am sure that we will enjoy a useful and interesting debate under your

it.</div><a name="06121269000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is short
and contains a small number of clauses, so it should not detain us
unduly long. Some Committees go on for months, but I suspect that we
will be able to deal with the Bill in about three or four sittings. For
that reason, we propose to meet again this afternoon and on Thursday at
the times set out in the resolution of the Programming

Douglas Hogg</b> (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con): First,
may I apologise for two things by way of preliminary? I have not served
on a Committee as a Back Bencher for more than 20 years, and I have not
been on a Committee for more than 12, so it is at least possible that I
shall commit the occasional solecism. I apologise for that in
advance.</div><a name="06121269000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
have moved a manuscript amendment. I appreciate what you have just said
about amendments, Mr. Bercow, and, with respect, I entirely
agree that notice needs to be given. However, this is a somewhat
exceptional situation. As you will see, the amendment would slip the
whole thing back by an hour on Thursday afternoon and slip the start
time back by an hour this afternoon. The reason for that is that it
seems 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 4</div>likely that there will be a statement on post offices on Thursday. That
is a matter of extreme importance to many Members, particularly rural
Members. I imagine that the constituents of Buckingham are pretty
concerned about what will happen to the post offices in their
constituency, Mr. Bercow, and they would be very sad indeed
if their representative could not express their views on that occasion.
I am sure that that is also true of those in other constituencies,
including Sleaford and North Hykeham. I therefore respectfully suggest
that it is important that members of the Committee can be present at
the
statement.</div><a name="06121269000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
far as this afternoon is concerned, you will have heard Mr.
Speaker reply to a point of order yesterday, Mr. Bercow, on
the report of the Iraq study group. As there was in business questions
last Thursday, there was pressure for the Prime Minister to make a
statement. Mr. Speaker indicated obliquely that he
might&#151;I can put it no stronger than that&#151;be favourably
disposed to an urgent question. I can tell you, Mr. Bercow,
that there is an urgent question before him for his
consideration.</div><a name="06121269000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06121269000358"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Heath</b> (Somerton and Frome) (LD):
Several.</div><a name="06121269000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000359"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I hear from the Liberal Benches
that there are several. It is possible that Mr. Speaker will
accede to an application for such a question. If he does, it would be a
tragedy if hon. Members, particularly those of us who have condemned
the war from the start, did not have the opportunity to be present. It
is with those thoughts in mind that I have proposed my amendment. If
agreed to, it would cause no prejudice to the conduct of the Committee,
because as much time would be provided as under the motion. I cannot
see any disadvantage to anybody, but much good would be
served.</div>
<a name="06121269000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06121269000360"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): On a point of order,
Mr. Bercow, does the amendment have to be taken en bloc, or
are we allowed to take parts of
it?</div><a name="06121269000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000361"></a>The
Chairman:</b> If the hon. Gentleman wishes to speak on the
matter, he is welcome to do so. He will be able to develop his line of
argument on the case for distinguishing between different parts of the
proposed manuscript amendment that has been tabled by the right hon.
and learned Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham.</div><a name="06121269000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06121269000362"></a><b class="B">Simon
Hughes</b> (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD):
It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr. Bercow.</div>
<a name="06121269000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the Solicitor-General, we
anticipate that the whole discussion can be contained within the
general parameters set out in the programme motion, irrespective of the
differences between us. My hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and
Frome and I have listened to the right hon. and learned Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham and are sympathetic to his amendment. It is
a sensible accommodation of likely business. It does not change the
amount of time that the Committee intends to sit and I urge hon.
Members to accept it, because it gives us cover if things elsewhere
should occupy members of the Committee. My hon. Friend and I have the
same interest in being 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 5</div>elsewhere, for the reasons stated by the right hon. and learned
Gentleman. The amendment keeps the total number of hours; we may well
finish within that time, but in any event, it gives us flexibility to
enable us to do well both parts of our job this
week.</div><a name="06121269000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06121269000363"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Dominic Grieve</b> (Beaconsfield) (Con): I welcome you to the
Chair, Mr. Bercow, and I look forward to serving on the
Committee under your chairmanship.</div>
<a name="06121269000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to make two points. First, I sent my apologies as I was not able to
attend the Programming Sub-Committee yesterday because of another
commitment. I spoke to the Solicitor-General before the Sub-Committee,
however, and I did not raise any objections to the suggested timetable.
At that stage, I had not had an opportunity to hear the points raised
by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham. It seems to me that he makes some pertinent points and if they
can be accommodated during the sitting, I would support that.</div>
<a name="06121269000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I raised an eyebrow
when I saw Thursday&#146;s timetable, as it is unusual for a
Committee to start sitting at 1 pm. It is of some inconvenience to me,
and I understand that the reason is a desire on the part of some hon.
Members to leave the House rather early on Thursday afternoon. One
wonders whether some will return on Monday, although that is a matter
only of quiet speculation. I say only that if the times proposed by my
right hon. and learned Friend could be accommodated, I would be wholly
content to go along with them. We should try to achieve consensus,
however. If any hon. Member feels that some parts of the proposals
could be accommodated, it will be desirable to reach agreement on that
in the time of this short debate. I am sorry that when the timetable of
the Programming Sub-Committee was put forward, I did not know of the
particular point that my right hon. and learned Friend has
raised.</div><a name="06121269000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000364"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> Having listened to the arguments so far, I would
like to propose my own amendment, which I hope will be acceptable to
the whole Committee.</div>
<a name="06121269000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend was incorrect on
one point: in my experience, it is normal for Committees to start at 1
pm and finish at 4 pm on a Thursday. Had I been available for
nomination to the Programming
Sub-Committee&#151;</div><a name="06121269000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000365"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I defer to my hon. Friend, but I say to him only
that I have sat on many Committees of this House and I cannot remember
a single Committee starting at 1 o&#146;clock. Heaven knows that I
have sat on enough Committees in the last four years&#151;it seems to
be my lot in life.</div>
<a name="06121269000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000366"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> It is a recent
development.</div>
<a name="06121269000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000367"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> The hon. Gentleman may be right that it is a
recent development, but the last Committee that I served on, which was
not so long ago, definitely started at 2 pm on a Thursday
afternoon.</div>
<a name="06121269000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000368"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> It is usually a matter of agreement that the time
is either 1 to 4 pm or 2 to 5 pm. Neither time is without precedent. My
hon. Friend is right that 2 to5 pm is probably more normal,
but 1 to 4 pm is not unusual&#151;I put it no more strongly than
that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 6</div><a name="06121269000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, if the Committee
agrees, I would like to accommodate my right hon. and learned Friend
the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham as far as possible by
suggesting that we start at 4.30 pm today, which would mean amending
paragraph (1)(a) from4 to 4.30
pm.</div><a name="06121269000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000369"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> The difficulty may be that 4.30 pm would not solve
the problem that the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and
North Hykeham referred to. We are already expecting a statement. If we
have an urgent question as well, it will depend on the order of the
question and the statement as to which will take
precedence.</div>
<a name="06121269000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000370"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> We may have four statements&#151;we are not in a
position guess. I was therefore attempting to take an acceptable
course. The time could be 4.35 pm, or I would otherwise be content with
5 pm. I also suggest that a 2 pm start on Thursday ought to be
acceptable. The Bill is relatively short. The Solicitor-General and I
both had the pleasure of serving on the Committee that dealt with the
Companies Bill, as indeed did you, Mr. Bercow&#151;that
was the first occasion on which I had the honour of serving under your
chairmanship&#151;which had rather more than 1,000 clauses. We have
four sittings planned for this Bill; in the end, following some
negotiation on the Companies Bill, we had 22 sittings to deal with
1,000 clauses. I dare say that we will be able to get through the
issues in this Bill by Thursday, even if we take an hour of the total
time for considering the Bill by changing the start time from 1 to 2 pm
on Thursday. I therefore suggest that we change the start time from 1
to 2 pm on Thursday, accepting that we will finish at 4 pm.</div>
<a name="06121269000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest that today&#146;s
start time should be 4.30 pm. However, whether the mood of the
Committee will allow for a 5 pm
start&#151;</div><a name="06121269000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000371"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The Committee needs to
be clear, as does the Chairman, as to whether the hon. Gentleman is
formally tabling an amendment. At the moment, the only formal amendment
tabled was tabled in manuscript form, perfectly legitimately, by the
right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham. If the
hon. Gentleman wishes to table what effectively constitutes an
amendment to an amendment, he needs to be clear and explicit about the
precise terms of that proposed amendment to an amendment, with which, I
think I am right in saying, the Committee would first deal, before
coming to the amendment tabled by the right hon. and learned Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham.</div>
<a name="06121269000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000372"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> I am most grateful to you, Mr. Bercow.
In the circumstances, I was seeking merely an indication from around
the Committee as to whether the views I was expressing were going to
receive support.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000373"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> My hon. Friend is of course seeking compromise,
which I suppose I am in favour of. He does not like a proposed end time
of 5 pm on Thursday. I am very reluctant to lose any time from the
total available for our deliberations, but if he were to suggest an end
time of 4.30 pm on that day, and a start 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 7</div>time today of 4.30 rather than 5 pm, we would keep the total amount of
time. I would be willing to compromise on that
basis.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000374"></a>The

indicating that, on that basis, or in that expectation, he is prepared
at this stage to withdraw his own
amendment?</div>
<a name="06121269000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000375"></a>Mr.

that there is another amendment coming forward. If we are going to
revert to the Government&#146;s motion, the answer is
no.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000376"></a>The

hon. and learned Gentleman for that clarification. On that
basis, a revised amendment&#151;an amendment to an
amendment&#151;may be forthcoming from the hon. Member for Reigate.
The written record will testify to that, although it will only be
viewable subsequently. He might wish to continue and then conclude his

Blunt:</b> I have listened to my right hon. and learned
Friend, who, understandably, is not prepared to concede that hour on
Thursday. It would seem that having three hours is more important to
him than starting at 2 o&#146;clock. In those circumstances, I
support his amendment to sit from 2 o&#146;clock to 5 o&#146;clock,
but I fear that we might not have a majority in Committee in favour of
that. I shall not move my amendment and I shall support his one, but I
fear that we will not

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000381"></a>The

between Opposition Members about their proposals has left me very much
in the dark. I hope that you can give me some clarification,
Mr.
Bercow.</div><a name="06121269000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000382"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am grateful to the Solicitor-General. It is
indeed my responsibility to give clarification and I am happy to do so.
I read out the amendment proposed by the right hon. and learned Member
for Sleaford and North Hykeham, but I shall do so again because there
has been considerable to-ing and fro-ing, as the Solicitor-General
said.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 8</div><a name="06121269000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed amendment is that

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000383"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Thank you, Mr. Bercow.
Opposition Members were invited to the Programming Sub-Committee. I
received an apology from the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, who was
otherwise engaged, which I accept entirely. However, no concern was
expressed in the Committee about the times that were set and the
Opposition made no
representations.</div><a name="06121269000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000384"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Bercow, I
realise that the Government arrange things differently from the rest of
us, but Back Benchers in Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition are allowed
their own opinion. My right hon. and learned Friend made a perfectly
sensible suggestion, and we are trying to resolve the situation. He was
not invited, or appointed to the Programming
Sub-Committee.</div><a name="06121269000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000385"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am grateful, but that is not a point of order,
but a point of debate. The position is as
stated.</div><a name="06121269000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000386"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Thank you, Mr. Bercow. I
have no quarrel with a Back Bencher making a proposal. However, Front
Benchers were invited to the
Committee&#151;</div><a name="06121269000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000387"></a>Mr.

way?</div><a name="06121269000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000388"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Let me finish my point and then I shall
give way. Let us not get too agitated. We are only talking about the
timings.</div><a name="06121269000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Opposition
Front Benchers were invited to the Programming Sub-Committee, which met
yesterday and had a brief discussion. No concern was expressed about
the times and nothing led me to believe that Opposition Front Benchers
would do anything other than accept them. However, I am not seeking to
be unduly difficult and as far as I am concerned the main thing for the
Government is that we get the Bill out following proper discussion by 4
pm on Thursday. I want to make it very clear that that is our
view.</div> <a name="06121269000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall be
happy, however, with the Committee&#146;s agreement, to accommodate
the concerns of Back Benchers. If the Committee wishes to sit at 4.30
pm today, that is fine with me; I have no problem with that part of the
proposal, or with a change of time from1 pm to 2 pm on
Thursday. I shall be happy to sit from 2 pm until 4 pm. I am not happy,
however, to extend the period over which we consider the
Bill.</div> <a name="06121269000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I seek your
guidance Mr. Bercow, but as I understand it the 4 pm
out-time is subject to a resolution of the House. We might not have to
go back to the Commons to change it, but 4 pm is the time at which I
should like the Bill to come out of the Committee. I shall be happy to
listen to representations to the contrary, but we need to get on with
consideration of the Bill if we are to get it out at the right
time.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000389"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I do rather slightly regret the
Solicitor-General&#146;s remarks. I hoped that I had made it clear
earlier that I had no criticism of the Government over the matter. I
spoke to the Solicitor-General because I knew that I would have
difficulty in attending the Programming Sub-Committee. If I had felt at
that time that I objected to anything about the programme, I would have
said so. I did not. Although I found the 1 pm start slightly unusual,
it did not bother me in the least; I was happy to go along with it.
However, I did not know about the problems raised by my right hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham. If I believe
that his argument has enough force, I will support it, even if we are
defeated in the vote. If his amendment can be accommodated, I would
seek to do so. That is no criticism whatsoever of the
Government&#146;s approach to the matter.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000391"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Will the Solicitor-General give
way?</div><a name="06121269000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000392"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Let me respond to the points made by
the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, then I shall happily give way. The
hon. Gentleman rightly has no criticism of the Government on this
occasion. However, I am free to criticise the way in which the
Opposition have dealt with the matter, and I have done
so.</div>
<a name="06121269000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000393"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I am seeking compromise, and that is what I have put
to the Solicitor-General. I am sorry that he is not prepared to agree
to extend the conclusion time on Thursday 14 December from 4 pm to 5
pm; I cannot think why he will not. No doubt he has his private reasons
for that. However, what about today? This is more a point of order,
Mr. Bercow: what time would we normally finish
today?</div> <a name="06121269000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">The
Chairman:</b> Ordinarily, we would finish at about 7 pm. That is not a
binding rule, but it is customary.</div>
<a name="06121269000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000394"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I am grateful. May I then continue
with my intervention, because I suspected that that was the case. If
the Solicitor-General would accede to a proposition that we continue
sitting until 8 pm or thereabouts today, I would be content with an
out-time of 4 pm on Thursday. The result of that would be that we would
lose very little time overall.</div>
<a name="06121269000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">The Chairman:</b>
Order. Just before the Solicitor-General responds,
may I advise the Committee that the matter that the right hon. and
learned Gentleman has just raised and his proposal that the Committee
sit somewhat later are matters that can be determined informally by the
Committee. It is only right for me to say that, although it forms no
part of the amendment, the Solicitor-General will have heard the point
made in the intervention by the right hon. and learned
Gentleman.</div>
<a name="06121269000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000395"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Members of the
Committee will have their own views about their appointments this
evening. I am not sure when they will have expected the Committee to
end and therefore what other appointments they might have. I hear what
the right hon. and learned Gentleman says, but I make no commitment
with regard to the time at which the Committee will finish its
deliberations. There is no obligatory finishing time in the evening, so
it is a matter for him whether he wishes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 10</div>to press his amendment. I have no great objection to starting at 4.30 pm
this afternoon if that is what he wishes to do, but I remind the
Committee that we have now spent 25 minutes of the sitting wasting time
in discussing how long it will be. I would rather get on to the
substance of the Bill, which is very important. I give way, however,
because I know that a couple of hon. Members wish to
intervene.</div>
<a name="06121269000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000396"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I am getting rather frustrated by the length of the
debate on something which should have been easily reconcilable. I hope
that perhaps the amendment tabled by the right hon. and learned
Gentleman mayin fact be three amendments rather than a single
amendment, which will enable the Committee to reach a sensible
decision. I also draw attention to the fact that no one should have any
expectation as to how long the Committee will sit until this evening,
other than having some recognition of the time of completion of
business in the main Chamber. I therefore do not see that we have any
difficulty with the time available for the Bill. If we can accommodate
members of the Committee, surely it should be sensible to do
so.</div>
<a name="06121269000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000397"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I hear what the hon. Gentleman
says.</div><a name="06121269000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000398"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I sense that there is now a recognition of the
consensus to start a bit later today. The first part of the right hon.
and learned Gentleman&#146;s amendment proposes a start a bit later
on Thursday, and the second part of the motion, for reasons we all
know, proposes that proceedings finish at four o&#146;clock. We have
the flexibility this evening and I hope that use will be made of that.
Therefore, I support two parts of the amendment and not the third and
then we can get on with the business.</div>
<a name="06121269000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000399"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Let us see. Providing that we can
discuss or vote on amendments consecutively, if you are content with
that, Mr. Bercow, we can deal with each of those amendments
in time. Providing that we can do that, I suggest that we proceed and
vote on the various times, so that we can make a decision and move
on.</div>
<a name="06121269000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000400"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am grateful to the Solicitor-General. I
already made the point about the informal understanding that could lead
to a later finish tonight. I ought, as a matter of record, to explain
that the so-called &#147;get-out time&#148; is not a matter of a
resolution of the House; that is a question of the get-out date.
Therefore, there is nothing binding, so far as the House is concerned,
about the get-out time, although I heard the Solicitor-General&#146;s
view that the get-out time should remain as it is.</div>
<a name="06121269000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I intend to
proceed as follows. I will ask the right hon. and learned Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham if he wishes to withdraw his existing
amendment and to submit a revised amendment, including what I would
describe&#151;for shorthand purposes&#151;as the 4.30 point. I do
not propose at this point to take any further amendments and, presented
with a suitably revised amendment by the right hon. and learned
Gentleman that is in order, I propose to put that to the
vote.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000401"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Bercow and in
reply to your question, I am prepared to withdrawmy existing
amendment, substitute 4.30 for 4 in paragraph (1) and leave the rest of
the measure as it is presently drafted.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000402"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000403"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000405"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I want to propose that clause 1 does not stand part
of the Bill. As I said, my familiarity with Committees is rusty in the
extreme but I think that it is in order for me to advance the arguments
why the clause should not stand part of the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 12</div><a name="06121269000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of clause 1 not
standing part of the Bill is that we would go back to the affirmative
resolution procedure, which is provided for in the Criminal Justice Act
2003. Mr. Bercow, you and I, and my hon. Friend the Member
for Beaconsfield were very interested in the passage of that Bill, as,
no doubt, was the Solicitor-General, who will remember the considerable
disagreement that arose between the Houses on what was then clause 42,
which became clause 43; namely, whether complicated fraud cases should
be held without a jury.</div>
<a name="06121269000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The House reached deadlock. At
that stage, there was a bargaining process, to which I was not party,
but it was reflected in the speeches made by the then Home Secretary
and the Government spokesman in the other place, Lady Scotland, when
they laid the affirmative resolution procedure. That procedure was part
ofa bargain, which comprised something like the Government not
trying to force their proposals forward; they would have very serious
discussions with all the interested parties to see whether it was
possible to formulate a lay assessor or special jury. It was plain that
undertakings were being given to both Houses that very serious attempts
would be made to agree a special procedure that did not involve
judge-alone trials. That was the basis on which the other place
accepted the Bill, and the basis on which it was
enacted.</div>
<a name="06121269000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06121269000406"></a><b class="B">Stephen
Hesford</b> (Wirral, West) (Lab): The right hon. and learned
Gentleman will recall that on Second Reading I asked him if he would be
in favour if the Government had come forward with a different procedure
of judge and tribunal. He gave me an honest and straightforward answer:
no, he would not. In those circumstances, even if the discussions had
taken place, the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s position
would have been the same. What, therefore, is his
point?</div><a name="06121269000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000407"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> The point is that Governments should keep their
word. It is as simple as that. Integrity is an important thing in
government. This Government have not got a reputation for integrity and
this is yet another example of why they have not. They entered into a
bargain; they told the House of Commons and the House of Lords what
that bargain was, and they are departing from it. It is unseemly and
dishonest and we should not be a party to that kind of
conduct.</div><a name="06121269000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
is whether anybody has made a serious attempt to become involved with
the other
parties&#151;</div><a name="06121269000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000408"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000409"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I certainly will.</div>
<a name="06121269000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">It does nothing for the
reputation of politics that a government should give their pledged word
to the House of Commons and to the House of Lords and then not deliver
on their pledge. I will not say that it is dishonest, simply that it is
unseemly and disgraceful, and I hope that that will satisfy the decorum
of this place.</div><a name="06121269000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no doubt what the House of Lords was told, and no doubt what the
House of Commons was told. It is in <i class="I">Hansard</i>; I have it
here&#151;I have the reports in front of
me.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 13</div><a name="06121269000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000410"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> Actually, three parties to that agreement, who are
sitting in the Committee at the moment, can confirm the
details.</div><a name="06121269000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000411"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I will sit down soon, Mr. Bercow, so that
the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield can
confirm what I am saying. There has been no serious attempt to involve
anybody in finding alternative ways forward, which breaches the
commitment to this House. For that reason alone, we should go back to
the affirmative resolution procedure.
</div><a name="06121269000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one other
point, Mr. Bercow&#151;I know that we need to press on. We
are seeing this primary legislation simply in order to enable the
Government to use the Parliament Act. The right hon. and noble Lord
Hunt of Wirral made it absolutely plain that he and our friends would
not support this on an affirmative resolution. The Government know full
well that they will have difficulties with that resolution in another
place and are introducing primary legislation so that the Parliament
Act can be applied&#151;and this change in the law, fundamental in
its character, can thus be forced through. I happen to think that that
is a disgrace.</div>
<a name="06121269000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore there are two reasons
for opposing the motion, Mr Bercow. First, although the Government have
not been dishonest, they have departed from their pledged commitment to
both Houses. Secondly, I deeply disapprove of the Parliament Act
procedure.</div>
<a name="06121269000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000412"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Of course, there will be agreement between the
three of us on these Benches, but the negotiations that led to the
insertion of the clause with the affirmative resolution in both Houses
was expressly done in order to require both Houses to be able to take
part in that agreement&#151;and expressly to avoid a type of
Parliament Act procedure which in the end allows one House to prevail
over the other.</div>
<a name="06121269000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000413"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that
point plain. Indeed, it was correct for him to make that point on the
Floor of the House. I have a copy of that speech before me. This is a
serious matter. It goes to the integrity of government, and I very much
hope that we do not give clause 1 a fair
passage.</div>
<a name="06121269000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000414"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I, too, have some short but
similarly strongly felt views to express. This important matter is
controversial because it is a move away from the principle that, in
England and Wales, there should be a jury trial for all serious
offences. That is why, when the relevant legislation was going through
the House in 2003, it was important for the Government to get their
Bill, but it was also important for the Opposition parties&#151;and
some Government Back Benchers&#151;to ensure that the Bill was passed
without a proposal to get rid of jury trial in England and Wales for
this category of offences.</div>
<a name="06121269000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had many robust debates in
both Houses, and the Lords rejected the Government&#146;s proposal on
several occasions. Mr Bercow, you will remember that this has been
round the course before in earlier guises. Finally, with the clock
against us at the very end of the Session&#151;literally, a day or
two before prorogation&#151;there were extremely intensive
discussions. In the end, it was proposed to have a double lock on a
proposal to move to jury trial: the House of Commons and the House of
Lords both needed to agree it. That is contained in the section that
clause 1 proposes to amend by taking out the double lock.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 14</div><a name="06121269000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Three things follow from that.
First, when discussing whether there was a way for the Government to
have their Bill in general but not this particular desired part, we
looked at various options and there was negotiation through day and
night to see what accommodation could be given. In the end, this was
found to be the most convenient outcome, so it was not an outcome that
did not ultimately command the agreement of both Houses.</div>
<a name="06121269000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, it was
clear&#151;and the references are in Hansard, in exchanges between
the then Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Sheffield,
Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) and myself&#151;that there were
other conditions to be fulfilled, with the double lock and
negotiations. There is, to put it gently, debate on whether the
envisaged formal consultations ever happened; I do not want to
elaborate at this stage. In our view, they never happened in the way
that we expected or envisaged. There was a consultation of sorts, but
it was never sold at the time as what we had agreed. Indeed, we were
surprised to be then told that that had been the expected consultation.
In our view, therefore, the second part of the proposal was not
delivered at the time.</div>
<a name="06121269000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">My third point is that there
have been discussions with the Attorney-General and the
Solicitor-General. I know that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield has had
such discussions on more than one occasion, as have I. The discussions
were not meaningless&#151;alternatives were considered, but in the
end agreement was not possible and the block therefore remains. We
sought agreement irrespective of the formal consultation, but it was
not possible, and we are back where we
started.</div>
<a name="06121269000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000415"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> The hon. Gentleman was party to the agreement and it
was anticipated that he would be party to the following discussions. He
will remember that the then Home Secretary
said:</div><a name="06121269000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I find
no difficulty tonight in offering the opportunity to the two main
Opposition parties working with the Attorney-General, the Serious Fraud
Office and the senior judiciary to take a further look at how that
might be taken forward.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 20
November 2003; Vol. 413, c. 1027.]</div>
<a name="06121269000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the hon. Gentleman say whether he
has been involved in any detailed discussions with the Government in
fulfilment of that
pledge?</div><a name="06121269000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000416"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The answer is that I can say expressly what
happened: there was never any formal consultation with either of the
Opposition parties, nor with the judiciary. There was a seminar in the
Lords to which certain people were invited, but that was all, and it
was never billed as such a consultation. There were then separate
bilateral conversations at the invitation of the
Attorney-General&#151;both to the Conservative party and to me. So
conversations have occurred, though not quite as we expected. The
conclusion is the same, however: there was no
agreement.</div><a name="06121269000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Wirral, West said to the right hon. and learned Gentleman,
there was no presumption that alternatives did not exist&#151;we
considered alternatives. For example, we examined the possibility of
smaller juries, and we considered juries with particular qualifications
or characteristics. Some of us, however, were unwilling to move from
the principle that there should be a jury trial, or a trial with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 15</div>jurors, to decide questions of fact. The double lock is intended to
ensure that both Houses must be satisfied on the question of departing
from the principle of jury trials in fraud cases in England and Wales.
They have not been so satisfied. The right decision was made
previously, and that decision remains the right one now. The clause
should therefore be rejected because it would change a very clear
political, parliamentary and constitutional
agreement.</div>
<a name="06121269000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000417"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I, too, was party to the
discussions at the conclusion of the passage of the Criminal Justice
Billin 2003&#151;in particular during the stand-off
disagreement between the House of Lords and the House of Commons on
certain parts of that Bill. I have absolutely no doubt that the way in
which the matter was resolved&#151;in particular the
introduction of the double-lock mechanism&#151;was a direct
consequence of the impasse that had been reached between the positions
of the two Houses. There were numerous late night negotiations that
covered different topics. At the end of the day, virtually every aspect
had been satisfactorily resolved, except for the Government&#146;s
desire to remove juries from certain fraud trials.</div>
<a name="06121269000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me make the position clear,
because I recollect the explicit words of my right hon. Friend the
Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) to the Home Secretary,
outside the Chamber. He said that the Opposition were prepared to
collapse the Criminal Justice Bill if the Government persisted in their
desire to retain section 43, because we felt extremely strongly about
it. It was in response to that that, after a time of meditation, the
Government proposed what I assumed at the time to be a face-saving
device to allow a graceful withdrawal; indeed it was almost explicitly
represented to us as that. That was the double-lock mechanism, and it
was designed to ensure that section 43 would not be implemented without
the consent of both Houses of
Parliament.</div><a name="06121269000328"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="06121269000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
entirely agree with my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham that the removal of the double-lock
mechanism is undesirable because we do not wish to end up with a
Parliament Act position. The Government appeared to concede, as I
understood it at the time of those negotiations, that only the consent
of both Houses of Parliament would be satisfactory for the
implementation of the proposals. These proposals are almost identical
to the original ones, apart from the substitution of &#147;High Court
Judge&#148; for &#147;Crown Court Judge&#148;. I can think of no
good reason why the double-lock mechanism should not remain.</div>
<a name="06121269000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the startling aspects of
this Bill is that, according to clause 4, on commencement, it appears
that the Act is to come into force at the end of a period of two months
beginning with the day on which it is passed. As I highlighted on
Second Reading, even if this Bill were to reach the statute book, there
would be some procedural aspects that needed to be resolved by way of
new court regulations before it could be implemented. I am startled to
note that it is blithely assumed that eight weeks after this Bill is
passed by the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 16</div>Houses of Parliament the first applications can be made to the Lord
Chief Justice. The procedure exists for conducting such trials without
further difficulty.</div>
<a name="06121269000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we
highlighted on Second Reading, there will be procedural issues about
how to conduct a trial without a jury where the judge has to make
rulings on law, possibly on public interest immunity material, and at
the same time not be influenced in the decisions that he makes based on
the facts. I assume that, if this unfortunate Bill were to be
implemented, at some point the Government would tell us what they
propose. There are, therefore, powerful reasons for having a
commencement order. As the commencement order that we agreed back in
2003 was a resolution of both Houses of Parliament, it seems to me that
it is a very good idea to keep that in.</div>
<a name="06121269000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000418"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> As I did not have the opportunity to do so on my
earlier interventions, may I say what a pleasure it is to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr.
Bercow?</div><a name="06121269000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon.
and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham is absolutely right
when he says that this is a matter of integrity. It is the integrity of
the Government that is in question because I, too, was a party to the
discussions that were held with the Home Secretary in his room behind
the Speaker&#146;s Chair very late into the night when we were
discussing the Criminal Justice Bill, as it then was.</div>
<a name="06121269000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was
absolutely clear to all who were involved that the proposal was
supposed to have a particular effect, the double lock. It was
absolutely clear that the Government were, in good faith, to undertake
discussions with the Opposition parties to see if there was a consensus
view on dealing with complex fraud cases. It is equally clear that, by
virtue of this clause, the Government are going back on the double-lock
mechanism and, secondly, that no such meaningful consultation between
all parties took place. Instead we had this absurd seminar in which the
Attorney-General in another place invited a few of his chums round to
talk about jury trial in an amorphous and unstructured way. I am not
sure about the Conservative Front Bench, but members of this Front
Bench who speak for the Liberal Democrats on home affairs, on
constitutional affairs or in respect of the Law Officers in our House
were at no time asked to attend, invited to attend or even told of the
existence of this
seminar.</div><a name="06121269000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000419"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I did not touch on the discussions in my own
remarks but I am on the record on many occasions as saying that we did
not consider the seminar to be the &#147;discussions and
negotiations&#148; that the Government had offered, and we were
totally unaware that that was in fact the only offering that was going
to be made.</div>
<a name="06121269000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000420"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who confirms
my view. We are left with a rather unpleasant taste in the mouth from
the whole episode.</div><a name="06121269000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
one area in which the Government have been true to their word has been
the undertaking that they gave a short time ago in another place not to
use the order-making process that was outlined in the 2003 Act to
proceed with the matter, but to bring it back as primary legislation.
That is why the Bill is before us. For that, at least, I applaud them.
However, many of us feel that it is brought before us in this form
thanks not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 17</div>to altruism on the part of the Government but because they know
perfectly well that they would not receive the consent of the other
place to secondary legislation. In using the primary legislative
route&#151;particularly through a short Bill such as the one
presented to us today&#151;they accept that they will not get the
measure through in this Session, but open up the opportunity of using
the Parliament Acts to force it through against the strong arguments
that will, I suspect, be adduced in another
place.</div><a name="06121269000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are left with what I think is a rather underhand procedure to achieve
an objective that the Government undertook not to try to achieve by
those means. That is a heavy charge to lay against the Government. The
other matter that is pertinent, given that we are considering clause
stand part, is the timeliness of the proposals in any case. I listened
carefully to all the remarks made on Second Reading. At no time was any
cogent argument put forward that circumstances had changed since our
discussions on the Criminal Justice Bill in 2003.</div>
<a name="06121269000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fact, if there were
arguments of timeliness, they would be in the reverse direction,
because we have had changes in procedure and changes to the definition
of fraud, by virtue of the Fraud Act 2006, which we dealt with in the
last Session. We have had the interesting experience of observing from
afar very significant fraud trials under another
jurisdiction&#151;the common law jurisdiction of the United States of
America, which has retained jury trial for complex fraud and appears to
have no difficulty whatsoever in securing convictions on that basis. We
are still, therefore, at a loss to know why the Government persist in
the view that there is a difficulty that can be solved only by the
abolition of an ancient right of the people of this country in respect
of complex fraud.</div> <a name="06121269000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
all those reasons, we would be absolutely right not to allow clause 1
to stand part of the Bill. In fact, if it were possible for the
Committee to vote out every single clause of the Bill and to ask you,
Mr. Bercow, to report that the Bill had been deleted in
Committee, I would feel that it had done its work
well.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000421"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The clause is important. It removes the
obligation for there to be an affirmative resolution before
commencement and paves the way for the implementation of section 43 of
the Criminal Justice Act 2003. That allows for the prosecution in
serious and complex fraud cases of persons before a judge sitting alone
without a jury.</div> <a name="06121269000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have listened with care to the debate. I shall deal first with the
procedural point raised by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, then look
at some of the points that were raised about the consultation before
saying something about the substance.</div>
<a name="06121269000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 4 will commence the
Bill, rather than implement section 43 of the 2003 Act. It will amend
that section, but there will need to be a commencement order to bring
the section into force. I hope that that deals with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s procedural question and his concerns about
regulations and so
on.</div><a name="06121269000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was never
intended that there should be a formal consultation such as those on
White Papers, Green Papers and legislation. Our view was always that
the Bill would provide an opportunity for representatives of the
Opposition to meet Ministers to discuss whether 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 18</div>there was room for agreement on the way forward on non-jury trials. To
facilitate that, the Attorney-General organised a seminar, which was
held in January 2005 and attended by spokespersons from the Opposition.
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said that the Liberal Democrats
were not in attendance. Well, they were invited, and Lord Thomas of
Gresford attended. I understand that he is a Liberal Democrat
spokesman.</div><a name="06121269000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000422"></a>Mr.

way?</div><a name="06121269000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000423"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I may have misunderstood the hon.
Gentleman and, if so, I shall allow him to correct
me.</div><a name="06121269000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000424"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I am grateful to the Solicitor-General. He said
that it was never understood that there would be formal consultation.
By whom? He was not party to the agreement, but those of us who were
understood clearly that there would be formal
consultation.</div><a name="06121269000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Thomas of Gresford was invited, as a senior lawyer in the House of
Lords, to a seminar organised by the Attorney-General. That is very
different from inviting the Liberal Democrat Front-Bench spokespeople
in the Commons to a formal consultation, on which we had a clear
undertaking from the Government. Does he not understand
that?</div><a name="06121269000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000425"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I simply do not agree with the hon.
Gentleman. I understand his point perfectly, but over the years there
have been repeated opportunities for broad consultation on the Auld
report, the Roskill report and so on. The matter has been going on for
decades, never mind years. Professionals, the public and others have
had ample opportunity to express their views over many years. The
Government&#146;s intention, which was always made clear, was that
there would be an opportunity for Front Benchers of the main parties to
come together and find out whether there was room for agreement. A
seminar was held, to which not only Front Benchers were
invited&#151;</div><a name="06121269000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000426"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000427"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman keeps saying that
his Front Benchers were not invited. My understanding is that they
were.</div><a name="06121269000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000428"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> It is nonsense to debate matters of fact but, just
for the record, as far as I am aware no invitation came personally to
my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome or myself. Lord
Thomas, who was a spokesman in the Lords at the time, was invited, and
he accepted and went along. As far as I am aware, the invitation to
something billed as the consultation, following discussions with the
Home Secretary the previous autumn, was not extended to Front Benchers
in both
Houses.</div><a name="06121269000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000429"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> My understanding was that the hon.
Gentleman had been invited, but he tells me that he was not. I shall
ask my officials to check whether an invitation went to
him&#151;perhaps he did not receive it. I understand that the hon.
Member for Beaconsfield accepts that he was
invited.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 19</div><a name="06121269000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000430"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I was certainly invited, but I did not understand
from the invitation that it was the formal consultation procedure that
the Government had promised. I thought that I was being invited to a
seminar to consider the issue. The fact that it was the one and only
consultation was not spelt
out.</div><a name="06121269000329"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="06121269000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000431"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I do not accept that a formal
consultation, giving yet another opportunity for public discussion, was
either necessary or promised. I am not sure what on earth the hon.
Gentleman expected the seminar to be&#151;it was billed clearly as a
discussion on serious fraud trials. Its substance dealt with the
options available, such as a single judge, a judge with assessors and
various other alternatives in order to resolve what everyone accepts, I
think, is an issue&#151;the length and manageability of serious and
complex fraud
cases.</div><a name="06121269000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The seminar was
held and views were expressed, not only by Front Benchers from the two
main Opposition parties&#151;they were representatives from the
Lords&#151;but by others who were present. Those were fed into the
Government&#146;s consideration of how to proceed. We took the view
that it was unlikely that the other place would pass an order in
relation to section 43. Following further thought, we decided that it
would be better to amend the 2003 Act.</div>
<a name="06121269000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I listened to the rather
agitated hyperbole&#151;if I may call it that&#151;from the right
hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham about how we
have proceeded. I think that for the Government to bring forward new
primary legislation, which will be considered fully in this House and
another place, is a perfectly honourable and proper way to proceed.
Hon. Members will have the opportunity to express their views, as they
have done and will continue to do, in the course of our
discussions.</div><a name="06121269000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
move from process to substance.</div>
<a name="06121269000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000432"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> For the record, I have seen a note on the seminar.
The Solicitor-General said that the Government formed the view after
the seminar that the House of Lords would not agree to trials without
jury. In the seminar, was there a unanimous, or significant majority
view about an acceptable
alternative?</div><a name="06121269000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000433"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The view that we needed to bring
forward primary legislation was not formulated immediately after the
seminar. The hon. Gentleman might recall that we debated the matter in
the Chamber in considering an order. We decided that it was unlikely
that it would get through the other place and, therefore, brought
forward primary
legislation.</div><a name="06121269000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the substance of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, at the end of the
seminar, it was clear that we did not have consensus. However, most
people who spoke thought that if we moved to non-jury trials, a single
judge would be the best approach, although there was not a vote. Other
people were in favour of a judge with assessors or small juries.
Different views were expressed. However, most people who spoke
indicated that if we were to move to non-jury trials, a single judge
would be better.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 20</div><a name="06121269000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000434"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I am listening to the Solicitor-General carefully.
My impression is that the majority of those who spoke were not in
favour of departing from jury trials.</div>
<a name="06121269000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000435"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I was not at the seminar, so I regret
that I cannot tell the right hon. and learned Gentleman whether his
view is correct. I understand that there was substantial support during
the seminar for both points of view. There were those who took the view
that jury trials should continue, even in serious and complex fraud
cases, and those who thought that the system should change. As far as I
am aware, no vote was taken, so I cannot deal with the point that he
makes.</div><a name="06121269000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall deal now with the clause. It is important, because it repeals the
requirement for an affirmative resolution, which means that section 43
will be amended. As a result, we will be able to bring about non-jury
trials, following an appropriate commencement order. Trial without
jury, under section 43, will relieve the excessive burden on jurors,
who have their lives disrupted for months on end. At the same time, the
provision will allow the full criminality of the most serious cases to
be laid out, to ensure that defendants face charges that adequately
reflect the totality of the accusations against them. Such cases will
be dealt with more efficiently, because the judge sitting alone will be
able to read evidence that otherwise would have to be presented orally,
at length, to a jury. The need for indictments to be severed or
simplified would be lessened.</div>
<a name="06121269000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06121269000436"></a><b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr.
Bercow.</div>
<a name="06121269000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Has the
Solicitor-General had discussions with the Lord Chief Justice and the
presiding judges of the circuit about the extra personnel that would be
required by the Queen&#146;s bench division, to make available
sufficient High Court judges to try the cases? Has he had discussions
about the flexibility that will be required by HM Courts Service in
listing to accommodate cases that are to be tried alone? Does he have
any view on what support for these proposals exists among the
judiciary?</div>
<a name="06121269000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000437"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The judiciary will no doubt express its
own views, but I think that I can say that there is support among many
senior judges. No doubt, other judges take a different view. As in any
group of people, there will be differing views. We know, from Lord
Justice Auld&#146;s report and the views expressed on a number of
occasions by members of the judiciary, that there are those who support
the proposals. The Lord Chief Justice will have to look in due course
at the availability of High Court judges. We can discuss that matter
when we reach that point of the Bill. To answer the point, there are
differing views on the bench; of that I am sure. There is support for
the change, as well as opposition to it.</div>
<a name="06121269000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that the judge should be able fully to look at all the
evidence. It is not our intention that the change to section 43 should
be the thin end of the wedge of an attack on jury trials, as some have
suggested. The provision will affect only a tiny number of
exceptionally long and complex serious fraud cases. The Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 21</div>have no plan to go further than is already provided for in section 43.
The other provisions, in part 7 of the 2003 Act, have, by and large,
already been implemented. Section 43 seeks to deal with a specific,
fundamental problem in serious and complex fraud cases, namely, the
combination of an enormously long trial, which imposes an intolerable
burden on jurors, and a failure to achieve justice. We therefore need
to move forward with this
change.</div><a name="06121269000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000438"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I want to make a point in response to the
Solicitor-General. I make no complaint that he referred to my comments
as &#147;agitated hyperbole&#148;. Agitated? Perhaps they were,
because we are talking about a scandalous matter. Hyperbole? I think
not, because I shall demonstrate that there has been a clear departure
from plighted
commitments.</div><a name="06121269000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
let us examine the nature of the seminar which, surprisingly, the
Solicitor-General did not attend. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> If the hon.
and learned Member for North Warwickshire was not Solicitor-General at
the time, I withdraw that
remark.</div><a name="06121269000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000439"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I would have attended the seminar if I
had been in a position to do so, but I was not Solicitor-General at the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000440"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I stand corrected and I am prepared to acknowledge
that I am at fault. However, we know the nature of the seminar as
described by the Solicitor-General: it was a gathering at which a
number of people were not present. I believe that the hon. Members for
North Southwark and Bermondsey and for Somerton and Frome were invited
but I understand that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield was
not aware of it. It constituted the formal consideration promised by
the then Home Secretary, who
said:</div><a name="06121269000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I find
no difficulty tonight in offering the opportunity to the two main
Opposition parties working with the Attorney-General, the Serious Fraud
Office and the senior judiciary to take a further look at how that
might be taken forward. We are able to look at that in relation to the
SFO in a way that Roskill could not. In that light, I will not press
for implementation of the clause.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, 20 November 2003; Vol. 413, c. 1027.]
</div><a name="06121269000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">What was promised on
the Floor of the House was a comprehensive consultation involving the
two main Opposition parties and the other responsible stakeholders,
which is the phrase now used. What has been described to us clearly
does not fall within that
description.</div><a name="06121269000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000441"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I was unable to attend the seminar because I was
unaware of its nature when I received the invitation and I had a prior
commitment. My noble Friend Lord Kingsland attended, but at the end of
the seminar he still did not appreciate that it was the formal
consultation that the Government had
offered.</div><a name="06121269000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000442"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I have the greatest respect for my noble Friend Lord
Kingsland and if he did not understand that it was the formal seminar
promised by the Home Secretary of the day, one can be sure that no one
else did either. What is certain is that the consultation promised by
that Home Secretary was not delivered.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000443"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I want to make an obvious point. The present
Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General occasionally telephone and
ask me to meet them about something. Discussions take place between the
offices, convenient dates are fixed and there is no doubt that the
conversations are intended to be formal and on the record; officials
attend, too. If there had been a telephone call to the hon. Member for
Beaconsfield or to me saying, &#147;We really need you at this
seminar,&#148; we could have rearranged the date, but it never had
that status in the conversation with Opposition parties. That is my
point.</div> <a name="06121269000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">There may have
been invitations to a seminar and there may have been discussions but
there are many such occasions, as the Solicitor-General indicated. We
were not aware that something of such formality was taking place or we
would have attended, or sought another date when we could have had
those
discussions.</div><a name="06121269000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000444"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention is
extremely important. I have often criticised the hon. Gentleman, but
never for being otherwise than assiduous&#151;sometimes he is too
assiduous. Had he had the slightest inkling that this was the formal
seminar that he had been promised he would have been the first to be
there; he would have been there throughout and he would have talked at
very great length. None of those things happened, and that is powerful
evidence in support of my proposition.</div>
<a name="06121269000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I have a much more
serious matter to raise: we heard the Solicitor-General&#146;s
explanation of what the commitment was and I found it impossible to
reconcile his understanding of the formal commitment with that given by
the Home Secretary of the day. That being so, I will remind the
Committee what that Home Secretary said in support of accepting the
affirmative resolution
procedure.</div>
<a name="06121269000330"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="06121269000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member

it the implication of his remarks that, as a result of the Bill passing

replied:</div> <a name="06121269000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I am
prepared to give that undertaking. It is part of the agreement that we
will retain the clause, but move forward towards looking at the
alternative solutions that I have mentioned, and that could be
incorporated in one or other of the two measures that have ...
been consulted on, or will come before the House in the Queen&#146;s
Speech. That safeguard is appropriate. I give a binding undertaking
that we will follow that agreement&#148;. &#151;[<i class="I">Official

<a name="06121269000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only thing that would be

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000445"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> For the record, and because the event was quite an
important bit of political history, thehon. Member for
Beaconsfield is absolutely right. He and his right hon. Friend made the
view of the Conservative party as a whole about the Bill absolutely
clear, as we did for the Liberal Democrats. It was clear that the
Government were having to concede because 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 23</div>they would not have got their legislation, and time was running out.
That too is consistent with them needing to make that significant
change of position, for otherwise the Bill would have
fallen.</div>
<a name="06121269000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000446"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Absolutely right. If anyone wants to confirm what
the hon. Gentleman has just said, it is in column 1030 for that day,
where my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield made it plain that
what we were then witnessing was, in his own words, &#147;a
climbdown&#148;. He went on to make it absolutely plain that the
other place would not pass what was then clause 42. We are dealing with
a departure from a commitment given on the Floor of the House, which is
an extremely serious matter.</div>
<a name="06121269000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one other point to make.
The Solicitor-General has, from time to time, referred in Committee and
on the Floor of the House to the advantages of putting full criminality
before the court. Anybody who has practiced in the criminal courts
knows that one is seldom obliged to do that, and generally speaking it
is a jolly good thing not to put full criminality, as it overloads
indictments. Actually, one should identify those charges in respect of
which there is good evidence, put the leading charges into the
indictment and confine the case and the evidence to them. That is how
to compress cases within manageable size, and it leads to a proper
result, in that the appropriate penalty is then passed. To load the
case with a multiplicity of indictments, simply to expose full
criminality, has been deprecated by the judiciary time and time again.
It is best dealt with, if at all, by offences being taking into
consideration, or by the new procedure contained in the Criminal
Justice Act 2003, which enables trial judges sitting alone to look at
what were previously those TICs.</div>
<a name="06121269000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea that you should, as a
matter of course, put full criminality before a court is an absurd
proposition and can only come from a Government who have little
experience of criminal law.</div>
<a name="06121269000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000447"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Let me briefly respond to a couple of
the points made by the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and
North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg). There has been no departure, in
our view, from any commitment that was given. The right hon. and
learned Gentleman quite rightly read out the list of individuals and
organisations that would be expected to contribute: the
Attorney-General, the Serious Fraud Office, the Opposition parties, and
the senior judiciary. A seminar was held to ask them for their
views.</div>
<a name="06121269000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know
quite what the representatives of the Liberal Democrats and
Conservatives thought they were going to when the Attorney-General,
following the passage of the 2003 Act and in light of the fact that
there had been a commitment to consultation, invited them to a
discussion of how non-jury trials might take place. What on earth did
they think they were doing if they were not going as part of the
consultation? It beggars belief that the Opposition now claim that they
sent respected senior lawyers to the very type of meeting and
discussion promised by the Government, but that they did not know what
they were doing. Do they often go along to meetings at which they do
not know what 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 24</div>on earth they are doing? It is preposterous to suggest that the leading
spokesmen of the Opposition parties did not know what they were doing
in going to that kind of seminar. Did they think it was an academic
discussion, or some sort of light entertainment? What on earth did they
think it was?</div> <a name="06121269000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">They
knew perfectly well that it was a serious discussion about a very
serious issue, because it had been the subject of legislation. The
Government said that there would be further consultation, and there
was. If certain spokesmen for the Opposition could not make it, that is
fine; it is their decision. If certain spokesmen turned up, expressed a
view, engaged in the discussion and let their views be known, before
walking away not knowing what on earth they had been doing at the
discussion, that is a problem for the Opposition parties. They need to
look at the nature and qualities of some of their spokesmen, because I
do not think that the position adopted by them is in the least bit
acceptable. They knew that it was a consultation on a serious issue.
They were involved in it. They may not have liked the outcome, or
decided that it was inadequate, but I do not accept that they did not
know what they were doing. That beggars belief.</div>
<a name="06121269000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsequently
there have been meetings between spokesmen for the Opposition, myself,
the Attorney-General and other hon. Members from the Conservative and
Liberal Democrat parties. Those discussions resulted in the clear view
that we cannot agree on the matter. Therefore, we need to go back to
seeing whether the House is prepared to pass legislation in order to
amend section 43 or the provisions dealing with its implementation, to
ensure that we can move forward. The Government always made it clear
that it was our intention to move forward.</div>
<a name="06121269000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon. and learned
Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham raised a point about a commitment
made by a former Home Secretary. I have the words before me. The hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey said:</div>
<a name="06121269000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Is it the implication
of his remarks that, as a result of the Bill passing into law tonight,
there will not be any serious fraud trial by a single judge in England
and Wales?&#148;</div> <a name="06121269000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was clear
then that the Bill had been amended so that an order would need to be
passed by both Houses. That provision was there for a purpose, and
everyone knew what it was. The implication of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question was whether there would need to be further
legislative discussion and voting on the matter before section 43 could
be implemented. As was clear then, it has always been the
Government&#146;s view that further legislation would be needed and
we have no problem with that. The then Home Secretary, my right hon.
Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside, said that he was prepared
to give an undertaking to that effect, and we have kept to it. Given
that the order that we sought to introduce was unlikely to be passed,
we have now introduced further
legislation.</div><a name="06121269000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The then
Home Secretary&#146;s response to the comment
was:</div><a name="06121269000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I am
prepared to give that
undertaking.&#148;</div><a name="06121269000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
explained, the undertaking has been kept. He
continued:</div><a name="06121269000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is part of the agreement that we will retain the clause, but move
forward towards looking&#148;&#151;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 25</div><a name="06121269000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;looking&#148; is the important
word there&#151;</div><a name="06121269000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;at
the alternative solutions that I have
mentioned&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 20 November 2003;
Vol. 413, c. 1028.]</div> <a name="06121269000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
undertaking was kept&#151;we looked at the alternative solutions.
There was a seminar, and there were subsequent further meetings to
discuss the various options. We have complied with the undertaking and
I do not accept that there has been any breach of the sort that the
right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham has
suggested.</div>
<a name="06121269000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000448"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> This is one of the most
pored-over exchanges in which I have ever been involved. The
Solicitor-General was, no doubt inadvertently, slightly misleading
about the timing. The exchange was in November 2003, at the end of the
Session. The then Home Secretary mentioned examining progress to
consider where we should go next, and he made the statement that we
have all been quoting. There was then a whole year, during which we had
a Queen&#146;s Speech, and there were measures, but there was no
formal consultation. The seminar was in January 2005, and it had
nothing to do with the proposals that he had referred to in his
response, because the parliamentary year had been and gone before the
seminar came around.</div>
<a name="06121269000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000449"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I do not accept that I have misled
anyone. I indicated that the seminar was in January 2005&#151;on the
24th, in fact. I gather that the invitation to the Liberal Democrats
was not made to the hon. Gentleman, but to John Burnett, who I think
may now be Lord Burnett. He was then the legal spokesman for the
Liberal Democrats and the invitation went to him.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman did not get the invitation
but the Liberal Democrats did&#151;there is no doubt about
that.</div><a name="06121269000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the seminar
took place we had not sought to introduce the order, but clearly it was
always our intention that at some point we would do so, or in any event
seek to implement non-jury trials. Therefore, when we held the seminar
it was the Attorney-General&#146;s intention that that should
constitute the consultation opportunity for the Opposition. Some
Opposition spokesmen from another place decided to attend, but
spokespersons from the Commons decided not to attend or were unable to
for various reasons. I make no criticism of that, but it does not
invalidate the consultation process and it should not cause problems
for the Government. We believe that the process was perfectly proper
and
sensible.</div><a name="06121269000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000450"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> The Solicitor-General is seeking
to reconcile what he is doing today with the commitments given by the
then Home Secretary. Will he help the Committee in the following way?
He would accept, I believe, that the Conservative spokesmen in the
Commons and in the Lords&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for
Beaconsfield and Lord Hunt of Wirral&#151;made it plain that they
would never vote for the affirmative resolution in the form of clause
42. Did the Home Secretary indicate at any stage that, if he could not
obtain agreement or find a way forward using special assessors or a
special jury, he would seek to ram through the provisions of clause 42
by subsequent primary legislation? Did he ever say that at any stage? I
of course have his statement in front of
me.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 26</div><a name="06121269000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000451"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I was not privy to his personal
thoughts on the matter, but the intention of the Government was that we
take the matter forward by way of order, and I assume that that was the
Home Secretary&#146;s intention at that
stage.</div><a name="06121269000331"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="06121269000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
year, we brought an order before the House, which again, by a
significant majority, expressed forcefully the view that it wanted to
see progress in dealing with the problem of complex and serious fraud
trials. It therefore passed the order. It became clear, however, that
the combined votes of the Opposition in the other place were likely to
frustrate the passage of that order. In those circumstances, the
Government took the view that the better way of proceeding was by way
of primary legislation, and that is why we have brought the Bill before
the House.</div>
<a name="06121269000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000452"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> It follows from what the Solicitor-General is saying
that at no time was it suggested by the former Home Secretary, when he
outlined the agreement to the House of the Commons, that there was a
possibility that primary legislation would be used to force through
clause 43. Had he done so, it might well have been the case that the
Opposition parties would have defeated the Criminal Justice Bill, as it
then was.</div>
<a name="06121269000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000453"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am not sure what point the right hon.
and learned Gentleman feels that he has made by saying that. However,
if he feels happier by reason of having said it, I am pleased. I
welcome anything that makes him happier about this Bill. Sofar
as we are concerned, however, the clause has been brought forward
honourably and properly. We have done it by way of primary legislation,
we have subjected it to full and proper debate and we believe that the
changes that it will enable us to undertake need to be made if we are
to have a system of justice that better delivers effective justice.
That is what the people of this country want. I hope that we can now
vote on the clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000470"></a>Mr.

appreciate some guidance. Clause 2 amends section 43 of the Criminal
Justice Act 2003. The new clauses, for the most part, seek to do
precisely the same thing but in different ways. I understand that they
will be debated in due course, as you have set them out on the
marshalled list. I want to be sure that if we do not debate the new
clause stand part motion we will not prejudice our ability to debate
subsequently the new clauses. I am not clear about that, and should
like to be before we debate the new
clauses.</div><a name="06121269000214"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06121269000471"></a><b class="B">The</b>
<b class="B">Chairman</b>: There is no such problem. It is perfectly
legitimate for us to debate Clause 2 now and, indeed, subsequently to
debate and in due course to vote upon each of the new clauses. The
order as set out is the order that we can and should
follow</div><a name="06121269000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000472"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> Clause 2 seeks to amend Section 43 of the Criminal
Justice Act 2003 to substitute for &#147;Crown Court Judge&#148; a
&#147;High Court Judge&#148; conducting the trial.</div>
<a name="06121269000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would not like the Bill to go
through this Committee without the Solicitor-General explaining the
Government&#146;s reasoning in deciding to entrust these trials to
High Court judges. My reason for saying this is that I noticed the
Solicitor-General picking his words with some care in the course of the
earlier debate about the extent to which the judiciary might support
these proposals.</div><a name="06121269000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
not in a position to conduct a survey of all Her Majesty&#146;s
judges, but I have yet to come across a single Crown court judge who
did not consider, first, that jury trial was a perfectly satisfactory
vehicle for dealing with long and complex fraud cases and, second, a
Crown court Judge who did not think that the worst possible thing that
could happen to him was to be asked to sit and try a fraud trial on his
own. As I hinted in my earlier interventions in Committee, this is
because there are all sorts of procedural problems surrounding such a
trial process which judges&#151;they have communicated with me
informally about this in large numbers&#151;consider to be massively
unsatisfactory.</div> <a name="06121269000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a
judge should express the view that they are sure a person is guilty in
a complex criminal case that leads to a substantial period of
imprisonment and should it subsequently transpire, whether through the
appeal process or by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, that some
further evidence comes to light which shows that the wretched defendant
was in fact telling the total truth when he denied his criminality,
this will have a serious adverse impact on the judge&#146;s
credibility and standing. This is almost inevitable, however good a
judge is at carrying out his work. This highlights why involving the
judiciary in factual decision making to a criminal standard of proof in
serious cases is a very dangerous road to take.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 28</div><a name="06121269000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government has taken the view that, in the circumstances, it should be
High Court judges who should be carrying out this procedure and not
Crown court judges. In fairness to the Government, that was a proposal
that came from the Opposition Back Benches at the time of the 2003
Criminal Justice Act because it was suggested that High Court judges
would be more familiar with the procedure of dealing with trials on
their own than the average Crown court judge.</div>
<a name="06121269000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">That in itself, however, does
not fully explain the Government&#146;s reasoning and therefore I
would like to take the opportunity of probing so that we can have fully
on the record why the Government have decided that this is the
appropriate course of action to take. I think that would be very useful
and I hope the Minister can enlighten the Committee on the
matter.</div><a name="06121269000221"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000473"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I have a linked question, and a separate question
that is germane to new clause 2. I take up the question asked by the
hon. Member for Beaconsfield. Have the Government had consultations
with the High Court bench on whether it is ready and preparing for the
eventuality of Parliament agreeing to this measure? More particularly,
do the Government envisage certain types of High Court judges doing the
work rather than judges taken at random from the court? For example,
will commercial judges be asked to do the work? Some reports suggest
that there will be a list of designated High Court judges who will do
this sort of work.</div>
<a name="06121269000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">That gives rise to a matter
that has caused some anxiety in previous debates and elsewhere: that
there will be judges who are known to be the judges of fact and law in
these cases. By definition, because they will be the only ones in the
country who have that responsibility, they might be more exposed to
threats from people who cannot knobble juries but who will be able to
spot judges who might try their case.</div>
<a name="06121269000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second question relates to
clause 2(2), which amends section 48 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003,
and refers to the wording not just in respect of fraud trials but of
trials that would be heard by a single judge where there has been jury
tampering or where the jury has been discharged for that
reason.</div> <a name="06121269000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we
debated the Criminal Justice Bill in 2003, it was accepted by
Parliament, including the House of Commons, that the one exception to a
jury trial in serious cases should be in the event of the corruption of
a jury, where there was a safety issue, or when there was a suspicion
that jury tampering meant that there could not be a fair verdict on
fact. My question to the Solicitor-General is, has that part of the Act
been implemented?</div>
<a name="06121269000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000474"></a>The
Solicitor-General</b> <i class="I">indicated
assent.</i></div>
<a name="06121269000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000475"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The Solicitor-General nods, which confirms what I
thought, that it has been implemented. If so, on how many occasions has
the measure been invoked, if at all? If it has not been invoked, is it
simply because no application has been made or that no such
circumstances have arisen? I am seeking an update on this part of the
proposal, because it is novel legal ground and there has been no chance
in the formal domain, on the record in Parliament, to learn whether
that has happened or any chance to discuss the progress towards
implementation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 29</div><a name="06121269000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000476"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I want to probe the Solicitor-General further on
similar lines. I refer to my earlier intervention on the impact of the
proposal on the judicial personnel who will be required to deal with
these matters. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield
that the suggestion that these matters are dealt with by a High Court
judge came largely from the Conservative Benches, but I want to be sure
that the Solicitor-General and the Government have thought through the
practical
implications.</div><a name="06121269000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
murder cases, for example, it is possible to release the case from a
High Court judge to a designated senior circuit judge&#151;ticketed
judges, as they are called in the profession. I take it that it is not
intended that that should be the case in this measure, otherwise it
would be self-defeating. Or would it? The ability to release a murder
case to a senior circuit judge is a very useful and flexible tool in
respect of listing and judicial availability. The lack of availability
of ticketed judges in murder and rape cases is one of the constraints
that cause delays in hearing cases.</div>
<a name="06121269000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to ensure that
there is not a similar delay in the cases we are discussing if a
suitable judge designate is not available, a matter to which the hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey referred. If these cases are
not to be released, how do we get round that lack of flexibility? It is
ironic that it is now possible for senior circuit judges to sit in the
Court of Appeal. They are very often ticketed to try murders, but it
does not appear that they would be ticketed to try serious fraud cases.
That might be an unintended consequence, but it seems to be a paradox.
Will it be resolved through the Bill or
regulations?</div>
<a name="06121269000332"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="06121269000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
consultation has there been, not just with the senior judiciary, but,
particularly, with the Council of Circuit Judges, whose members might
have a useful view, and presiding circuit judges, who will have a
responsibility for the administration and listing of such cases? Those
matters are as yet unclear, and I would be grateful to the
Solicitor-General if he could provide
clarification.</div><a name="06121269000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000477"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Clause 2 provides that applications
under section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and the resulting
non-jury trials would have to be heard by a High Court judge, rather
than a Crown court judge. The change was proposed during various
discussions and the Government have said that we are disposed to accept
it. The status of High Court judges provides an added safeguard and we
felt that the proposal was one to which we could accede.</div>
<a name="06121269000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I listened with great care to
the comments made by the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst on the
nature of the High Court judges who might consider such matters. The
identification of appropriate judges to hear such cases would be a
matter for the President of the Queen&#146;s bench division. The hon.
Gentleman raised an interesting point: some senior circuit judges can
try not only murder cases, but very complex ones, and some of them
might be more than competent to deal with complex and serious fraud
cases sitting alone. That is worth thinking about. I do not want to
make public details of the recent discussions between the Lord Chief
Justice and the President of the Queen&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 30</div>bench division, but it is safe to say that a point was made similar to
that raised by the hon. Gentleman. I would like to think a little more
about it. We might be able to identify certain circuit judges who would
be capable of dealing with such cases sitting alone&#151;some very
able circuit judges come to mind, although, perhaps not all of them. I
shall think about that, because he made some good points.</div>
<a name="06121269000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are,
I believe, 108 High Court judges. That limit is set in statute so we
will have to take into account the availability of judges. We do not
anticipate that the number of trials that are likely to take place in a
year will be very great&#151;we estimate an average of up to six. In
the past, we have suggested that it could be as many as 15 or 20, but
that is a remote prospect. However, given the various demands on High
Court judges and given that such trials, even if they are few in
number, will take a considerable length of time, there might well be
pressures. It bears thinking about, so I listened with great care to
what the hon. Gentleman said.</div>
<a name="06121269000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I told the
hon. Member for Beaconsfield, in response to suggestions by the
Opposition, we have concluded that High Court judges will be an added
safeguard. We have no difficulty with that. High Court judges are used
to deciding matters of great importance. They are senior judges who
decide cases involving vast sums of money far more often than such sums
are likely to be the subject of serious and complex fraud cases. To the
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey, I say that I do not
think that there is a great likelihood that such judges will be nobbled
or corrupted, or that they might become the victims of approaches that
are not already made to them. They decide big cases now; there is no
suggestion that there is corruption or attempted nobbling of those
judges, and I do not anticipate that we are likely to face that in
cases of serious and complex fraud that come before them. In any event,
our judges are more than capable of dealing appropriately with any
approach that might be made, because it would clearly be an unlawful
approach.</div>
<a name="06121269000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000478"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Reinforcing the point that my hon. Friend the Member
for Bromley and Chislehurst made, does the Solicitor-General accept
that now, the judges who have the greatest experience in fraud cases
are the Old Bailey judges&#151;who are not High Court judges by
definition&#151;and senior circuit judges? Does he accept that High
Court judges rarely try fraud cases because of the length of time that
such cases often take? He would have great difficulty finding a High
Court judge who, in his or her judicial capacity, has actually tried
fraud cases.</div>
<a name="06121269000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000479"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I hear what the right hon. and learned
Gentleman says and, as I told his hon. Friend the Member for Bromley
and Chislehurst, I shall bear those points in mind. We have responded
to a request from the Opposition to the effect that High Court judges
might have the appropriate seniority to deal with such cases. I have
some sympathy with the view expressed by the right hon. and learned
Gentleman that some senior Old Bailey judges and circuit judges might
be capable of trying the cases. That is a valid point and, as I have
said, I should like some time to think about it. In due course, after
reflection, I may come back to the Committee and express a view
onthe issue.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 31</div><a name="06121269000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me respond
to the point made by the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey
about section 48. That was implemented on 24 July, and I am unaware of
any circumstance in which it has been invoked to date. I should be
surprised if it had been. However, I shall double check that and if it
is necessary to correct what I have said I shall write to the
Committee.</div>
<a name="06121269000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000480"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> On the point that was made by three hon. Members
about the sort of judge to hear the cases, I hope that the
Solicitor-General will say a word about whether there has been any
discussion of the categories of High Court judges that Ministers have
in mind.</div> <a name="06121269000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me make
it clear that nobody is suggesting that judges are likely to fall for
attempts to corrupt them. That is not being alleged. Unless I am
missing something, there will be a new category of judge or of trial.
At the moment, the difficult cases dealt with by single judges are
civil cases, not criminal cases, except when they are appeal hearings,
in which higher court judges sit. Apart from jury-nobbling cases, which
they could now hear, it would be a new circumstance in which a Crown
court or High Court judge alone would be the judge of
fact.</div><a name="06121269000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000481"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It is not intended that the Government
will identify a new category of High Court judges to sit in such cases.
Which judges are available and appropriate to try particular cases is a
decision that must be left to the Queen&#146;s bench division.
</div><a name="06121269000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman is
right to say that we are going into new territory. Judges will be
hearing cases without juries. We know that there are non-jury trials in
magistrates courts before district judges and in Northern Ireland; and
in magistrates courts, although magistrates sit, there are no jurors. A
lot of cases are decided without juries, so that is not a big
innovation, but it will be a change for serious and complex fraud cases
to be tried without a jury before a High Court judge. Some High Court
judges deal primarily with civil cases, but they might well have had
experience of criminal practice. The straight answer to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question is that we shall have to wait and see how
the President of the Queen&#146;s bench division decides to allocate
judges.</div><a name="06121269000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also asked about the various views on the matter that have
been expressed by judges. I have tried to make my points carefully, and
it is part of my responsibility not to get judges involved in a
contentious area of political debate. They should stay above that. It
is publicly known that some support the change, and no doubt there are
those who oppose it&#151;the hon. Member for Beaconsfield has
referred to discussions that he has had with Crown court judges. I do
not want to bring judges into a contentious party political debate,
which would be undesirable given their standing above and beyond such
debate. However, it is safe to say that there are different
views.</div><a name="06121269000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that
I have dealt with all the points raised, and I shall be happy to deal
with any
others.</div><a name="06121269000244"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000482"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> The issue to consider is simple. If it is possible
to avoid Northern Ireland having inflicted on it what the Government
wish to inflict on England and Wales, I wish to take every opportunity
to ensure that it is avoided. For the reasons that I have already
given&#151;I shall not labour them&#151;I can think of no good
reason why Northern Ireland should be included in the Bill. In due
course, when we have the opportunity to vote on the clause, I shall
seek to delete the reference to Northern Ireland so that, even if we
have the misfortune of the Bill being imposed on England and Wales, the
inhabitants of Northern Ireland can be protected from
it.</div><a name="06121269000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000483"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> It would be helpful if the Under-Secretary could
tell the Committee why the proposal is being dealt with in this Bill
rather than in the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Bill. Will
she also tell us what the effect of that legislation will be? It has
not come to the House of Commons yet, so we have not considered it. I
have glanced briefly at it, but not given it detailed attention. I
understand that it may well be debated this week in the House of Lords.
It is directly relevant to the clause because I understand that it will
make changes to jury trial in Northern
Ireland.</div><a name="06121269000333"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="06121269000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Minister
and colleagues well know, Northern Ireland is the one part of the
United Kingdom where for a long period, going back to the 1970s, and
for particular reasons&#151;namely terrorism concerns&#151;trial
without jury has existed in what are called the Diplock courts.
Particular criteria must be met, but that is considered. What is now
happening is the welcome normalisation of life in Northern Ireland,
including the normalisation of the criminal justice process, which is
going back to jury trial in many more cases. It would therefore seem
sensible that we should debate these matters in the context of Northern
Ireland, where Northern Ireland Members of both Houses could see that
this is a matter that directly affects them, not one that is tagged on
to a debate about English and Welsh jury trial, which is clearly a
different legal system and one where relevant Members of our House and
the House of Lords would have expertise and
interest.</div><a name="06121269000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">My question
is first, what justification do the Government have for this proposal?
It is a parallel point to that made a moment ago by the hon. Member for
Beaconsfield. Secondly, can the Government explain how this is
consistent with the general picture of Government policy towards
Northern Ireland, which is to extend jury trial, not reduce it? It
seems to me that if they are trying to get the message across in
Northern Ireland that we want jury trial to be the norm again, this
will be entirely inconsistent with that approach because with one piece
of legislation they will be saying that jury trial can disappear while
with the other they will be saying that jury trial can
appear.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 33</div><a name="06121269000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, my
other, linked, concern is that Northern Ireland may well in the past
have been a place where the threats to the judge and the jury were
considerable&#151;far more than in any other part of the United
Kingdom. The Government in the 1970s took the view that the threats
were such that they needed to get rid of juries in particular cases,
and Parliament agreed to that in exceptional circumstances. Some of us
oppose this legislation because we do not believe that there are
exceptional circumstances. Fraud is, sadly, normal; it is not abnormal.
Large-scale fraud happens, and it has happened over recent years just
as much as it happens at the moment. This is not a response to a
particular trend. We are therefore keen to ensure that Northern Ireland
is treated similarly to the rest of the UK and that it does not have
legislation going in two different and inconsistent
directions.</div> <a name="06121269000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister reflect on whether it might be better if the Government
accepted a view that is going to be expressed and voted on by Members
on these Benches? That is that this clause should come out of the Bill
and, if the Government want to make the case for this proposal for
Northern Ireland, they should make it in the context of the wider
debate&#151;the wider legislative opportunity that will arise when
Northern Ireland criminal justice is debated, which we happen to know
will be in this
Session.</div><a name="06121269000253"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000484"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Joan
Ryan):</b> As this is the first time I rise in this Committee
I welcome you, Mr. Bercow, to the role of overseeing our
proceedings.</div> <a name="06121269000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions set out in section 43 will enable the criminal justice
system to deal more effectively with what we might call white-collar
crime and will enable the full criminality of cases to be exposed. They
will therefore result in more efficient trials and relieve the
excessive burden on jurors, who have to have their lives disrupted on
end, as we have already discussed. These are, in the
Government&#146;s view, substantial benefits. I can therefore see no
reason why they should not be realised in Northern Ireland as well as
in England and Wales. That is the justification I give to right hon.
and hon. Members of this Committee.</div>
<a name="06121269000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a simple issue. It is
not about inflicting something on Northern Ireland; it is about
extending a benefit to Northern Ireland, in the interests of justice.
The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey talked about
normalisation in Northern Ireland, which is a process that hon. Members
in all parts of the House welcome. Given that part 7 of the Criminal
Justice Act 2003 already applies to Northern Ireland, it would seem
strange if these changes were not made in parallel. Part 7 applies to
Northern Ireland because the 2003 Act extends there. That is normal
procedure. I hear what the hon. Gentleman says about the prospect of
changes to the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland and the
Diplock courts, but that is a process of normalisation. Northern
Ireland is moving from difficult times to better times, which hopefully
will become even better. That process should not affect our desire to
see serious and complex fraud detected and successfully prosecuted in
Northern Ireland, as in England and Wales.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 34</div><a name="06121269000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause ensures simply that
the Bill will extend to Northern Ireland. It is not a matter of tagging
it on, which is the expression that the hon. Gentleman used. Part 7
applies, so it is not an extraordinary measure that is tagged on. I
recommend that the Committee support the clause and that the provision
be applied to Northern Ireland. Serious and complex fraud cases
currently have little chance of resulting in a conviction that reflects
their full criminality. If we are to apply a measure in England and
Wales that allows such cases to be prosecuted before only a judge,
there is no justification for not applying it in Northern
Ireland.</div>
<a name="06121269000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000485"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I am rising to support my hon. Friend the Member for
Beaconsfield. To begin with, let us put an end to the idea of full
criminality going before a court. It is a thoroughly bad concept.
Anybody who knows anything about judicial processes knows that it is
deprecated by the judges: they do not want to have full criminality
brought before them as it extends trials unnecessarily. Let us put an
end to that nonsense&#151;I know that it comes from the Home Office,
but it is nonsense.</div>
<a name="06121269000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much more
importantly, this is ultimately a matter of democracy.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am sorry, I have something stuck
in my throat. I wish it were whisky. We have been reminded by the hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey that legislation that will
affect the legal system in Northern Ireland is about to go through the
House. The process will inevitably be attended very closely by Northern
Ireland Members. Most importantly, they will be heavily represented at
the Committee stage. Whether the benefits of these provisions should be
extended to Northern Ireland is essentially a matter for Northern
Ireland representatives. They are necessarily squeezed out of the
process on this Bill because of their limited number and the fact that
the main thrust of the Bill is directed towards England and Wales. They
have every right to feel excluded. I therefore entirely agree with the
point made by the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for
Beaconsfield that the matter should be dealt with in legislation that
applies exclusively to Northern Ireland, so that the hon.
Memberswho represent that Province have an opportunity
comprehensively to put their
arguments.</div><a name="06121269000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000486"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The Minister made the general point, but can she
tell us, just so that we are all clear, what exactly the Government are
proposing for Northern Ireland? We have not heard that from Ministers,
and it is relevant. They are proposing changes to the criminal justice
system. I do not pretend to be an expert yet, because I have not looked
at the Bill in detail, so it would be helpful to know what they
propose. We could then form a judgment about whether it is appropriate
to link it with this
provision.</div><a name="06121269000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
another relevant point about full criminality has been raised. I
absolutely support the argument that the right hon. and learned
Gentleman made. In addition, it is an argument applicable not only to
the criminal law in that context but, for example, to fraud or
financial insider dealing. One does not list every offence for some
horrible sex offender and bring to court all the victims. Strong cases
are taken, such offenders are convicted, and they will then ask for
further offences to be taken into consideration. Those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 35</div>cases can then be taken off the file, as it were. That is absolutely
normal for a taking and driving away, as it used to be called, or for a
burglary or shoplifting offence. By definition, the full criminality
never gets to the jury, because it does not need to.</div>
<a name="06121269000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
verdict of guilty and one of not guilty; there is a maximum sentence
set by Parliament, and that maximum is the same whether an offender
commits one of those offences or seven of them. The last bit of the
full criminality emerges between conviction and sentence, when matters
of previous conviction are read out and litigation is done. We have the
process for dealing with that, and it could not be otherwise, or the
courts would come to a grinding halt, and many people would be put to
particular disadvantage by having to give evidence and take time being
exposed to cross-examination, when the case does not need them to be
brought to the witness
stand.</div><a name="06121269000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000487"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b><b class="B"> </b>There is another point. I cannot remember,
although the hon. Gentleman may, whether Northern Ireland benefits from
the provisions of the recent legislation allowing specimen counts to be
tabled in cases and the judge alone to deal with the remaining counts
after conviction. My memory is not sufficiently good, but the Minister
may be able to enlighten us further. In the English context, that is a
powerful reason why the legislation is completely
unnecessary.</div>
<a name="06121269000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000488"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I do not remember either. I was
not leading for us on that Bill, so I do not have all the details of
that in my head. However, I revert to my general point. Legislation for
the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland should, for the sake of
the people and the representatives of Northern Ireland, be looked at in
one place at one time. It is a nonsense for Parliament, in the same
Session, to be dealing with criminal justice in Northern Ireland in two
different pieces of legislation, which appear to be going in different
directions, and which have so far been presented to us here without any
explanation of how they fit into the wider context of what has just
happened, if there have been recent changes, or what is about to
happen, if the Government get their
way.</div><a name="06121269000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000489"></a>Joan
Ryan:</b> Let me deal first with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
last point. As I have explained to him, because part 7 of the 2003 Act
applies to Northern Ireland, we have to deal with the connection with
Northern Ireland here in this Bill in order for this measure to apply.
That is why clause 3 is here. That is common practice, and is perfectly
understandable.</div> <a name="06121269000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not think that the Committee is the place to discuss legislation that
is before the other place. The Bill extends to Northern Ireland for
exactly the reason that has been given. As I have already said, and as
he said, some of the current discussions about Northern Ireland have
been about the continuation or otherwise of the Diplock
courts.</div><a name="06121269000334"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="06121269000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000490"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> The hon. Lady is arguing the case for extending the
provision to Northern Ireland. Will she be good enough to tell us
whether Northern Ireland representatives were involved in the
consultation of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 36</div>kind that was promised by the then Home Secretary and that took place to
examine alternative possibilities involving special juries or lay
assessors?</div><a name="06121269000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000491"></a>Joan
Ryan:</b> I can confirm to the right hon. and learned
Gentleman what he already knows, which is that I am not aware that
representatives from Northern Ireland parties were present. I can also
tell him that the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland is aware of
both the Bill and the clause, and has expressed no misgivings about it
whatever.</div><a name="06121269000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
touches on another point that has been mentioned&#151;that
legislation applying to Northern Ireland should appear in a specific
Northern Ireland Bill, and be considered by a Committee containing
Northern Ireland Members. Hon. Members will know that there is never
any attempt to exclude elected representatives from Northern Ireland
from any proceedings. They sit on many Committees, particularly those
in which they express an interest, and the usual channels on both sides
of the House work hard to ensure that that is achievable. I can assure
all members of the Committee that Northern Ireland Members are well
aware of our proceedings, including the Bill&#146;s Second Reading.
Had they requested a place in the Committee, we would all have made
every effort to facilitate it, and I am not sure that the point is as
significant as may have appeared to the hon. Member for North Southwark
and
Bermondsey.</div><a name="06121269000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
full criminality, I shall just have to beg to differ with the right
hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham. I accept that
his view is that full criminality is not a fundamental issue, but that
is not my view, nor is it the view on the Government Benches. I think
that the interests of justice make it important to expose full
criminality in court&#151;that is the case for all blue-collar crime,
and there is no reason why the same should not be true for white-collar
crime as well. Severing or truncating a charge is not the same as
taking other offences into account, such as the theft of another 30
motor cars, or joyriding. There is a fundamental difference, and full
criminality is important to
justice.</div><a name="06121269000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000492"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> Does the Minister accept that the area in which
full criminality becomes important is in sentencing? For example,
within the bracket of sentences available to the judge&#151;the
maximum, and the tariff indicated by the Court of Appeal&#151;the
judge can decide which sentence is appropriate. The point that I
believe my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and
North Hykeham is making is that that is separate from the trial
process, and the availability of full criminality to the sentencing
judge does not make it necessary to have full criminality presented to
the jury. That is the real point. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Beaconsfield said, it would entirely meet the Minister&#146;s
argument if current procedures such as those for specimen counts were
severed, so that they were dealt with on sentencing, after the trial on
indictment. That would avoid overloading the
indictment.</div>
<a name="06121269000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000493"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Interventions must be
brief.</div>
<a name="06121269000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000494"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I apologise. I shall revert to that
point.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 37</div><a name="06121269000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000495"></a>Joan
Ryan:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his enthusiastic
intervention. Full criminality is important on sentencing, but
sentencing is based on evidence that is exposed during trial, so I
stand by what I have said. In serious and complex fraud cases, it is a
matter not of filling the indictment with a lot of minor counts, but of
avoiding the need to sever the indictment, which results in two trials
instead of one. Full criminality is also an important point
there.</div><a name="06121269000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000496"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I may have missed this, and I apologise if I did,
but I raised the question of whether the new provisions regarding
specimen counts, and the judge being able to consider the remaining
outstanding counts by himself, apply to Northern Ireland as well. Can
the Minister deal with that point?</div>
<a name="06121269000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000497"></a>Joan
Ryan:</b> I was coming to that point, and it
is as the hon. Gentleman says. The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims
Act 2004 applies to Northern Ireland, but it has not yet commenced;
that is planned for January 2007. I do not accept that any valid
argument has been made that should prevent us applying these measures,
which bring substantial benefits. There is absolutely no reason why
those should not be realised in Northern Ireland as well as in England
and Wales.</div>
<a name="06121269000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000498"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I have two brief points. First, on the full
criminality point, the Minister is suffering under an illusion. Nobody
who practises in criminal courts thinks it desirable to overload
indictments, and judges will not permit it. If the thought is that
every offence will be reflected in account on the indictment, that is
illusory; the judges will stop it. If those at the Home Office are
labouring under that illusion, I wish that they would put it out of
their tiny little minds.</div>
<a name="06121269000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, on a quite different
point, it is clear from what the Minister said that the Northern
Ireland representatives were not involved in the discussions that were
held&#151;in so far as they were&#151;pursuant to the undertaking
given by the then Home Secretary. They have every reason to feel
aggrieved, which is a further reason for not allowing this particular
Bill to apply to Northern Ireland.</div>
<a name="06121269000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000499"></a>Joan
Ryan:</b> I have very little to add, because I have answered
the points made and stand by what I have already said in relation to
full criminality. Had Northern Ireland representatives wished to be
present, first, my understanding is that they can be present and speak
even if they are not named members of the Committee. Secondly, like all
of us, they know how to make representations to be members of the
Committee. I have said that the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland
has made clear that there are no issues with this matter. That should
satisfy the Committee, and I urge that this clause stands part of the
Bill.</div> <a name="06121269000279"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000515"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in clause 4, page
2, line 9, leave out &#145;months&#146; and insert
&#145;years&#146;.</div><a name="06121269000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is an exciting development&#151;the amendment is actually on the
Order Paper, as opposed to having snuck up on us unawares. It is a
short amendment arguing that if the legislation is passed, it should
come into effect not immediately, or after two months, but after two
years. Obviously, amendments such as this always contain some mischief.
I own up to that. Who knows&#151;there might be a general election
within the next two years. I could have made certain that an election
took place before the Act came into effect by tabling an amendment that
said &#147;four years&#148;, but there is plenty of opportunity for
such an amendment at a later stage in proceedings. That will no doubt
happen.</div><a name="06121269000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000516"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> In any event, as the other place is not going to
pass the Bill, and, therefore, the Parliament Act will have to be
invoked, we are well
covered.</div><a name="06121269000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06121269000517"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Indeed, we are well covered. However, I want to
put the case that I and others summarised on Second Reading on the
Floor of the House: at the moment, it is nonsense to be legislating.
Since the idea was conceived, circumstances have changed in a way that
moves the balance of the argument away from legislating. A further
delay would give us more information on the justification for the
case.</div> <a name="06121269000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary, the
Government started down this road during the Prime Minister&#146;s
first Administration. They came back to it in the 2003 Act and again in
the previous Session. After the general election they sought to pass an
order in the Commons to bring this provision into force, but it was
dropped in the Lords. However, in the meantime, various other things
have happened. First, Parliament spent a lot of time on the Fraud Act
2006, which has just come into force. We have had no time to evaluate
it because it has not been on the statute book for long. Will the
Solicitor-General tell us whether any of it has come into force and, if
so, how much of it? Parliament needs to know how important legislation
on the subject before us is working, before it makes a judgment on what
further legislation is
required.</div><a name="06121269000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
two other procedural changes have been made recently. On 22 March last
year, a new protocol for the control and management of heavy fraud and
complex criminal cases was handed down in court by the then Lord Chief
Justice, Lord Woolf. As Law Officers have accepted, it was intended to
deal with that largest 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 39</div>complaint&#151;that the organisation of fraud cases was not as good as
it should have been. It was meant to reduce the length of fraud cases
by implementing measures relating to paperwork and bundling, to ensure
the opportunity for summaries and to allow juries to be presented with
the material in a more manageable way. That was done in the light of
experience gained when such cases were heard in the courts and
considered at the highest level of the judiciary.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 40</div><a name="06121269000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">That protocol was announced in
March last year. It is now 18 months later. Will the Minister give us
an evaluation of the changes so far? We know that they have been
implemented, but have they been successful and, if so, can we see an
evaluation? Have the judges carried one out? Have Law Officers been
given one, or have they carried one out
themselves?</div><a name="06121269000306"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It
