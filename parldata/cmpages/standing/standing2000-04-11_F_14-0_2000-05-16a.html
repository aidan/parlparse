<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Malcolm Wicks):</B> Good afternoon, Mr. Benton. We were discussing important issues about the powers of the inspectorate. My final remark was on amendment No. 235, which relates to the powers of the inspectorate to enter the home of a trainer. Analogous provisions in the School Inspections Act 1996, which was introduced by the previous Administration, give the Office for Standards in Education the same access to school premises for the purposes of inspection without excluding dwellings. I am sure that many schools and colleges, including boarding schools, have private dwellings that are within school premises. I am not aware of any difficulty with that, and the previous Administration obviously did not think that it would be a problem because they made no provision for it.

<P>
I hope that I have reassured the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) that the inspectorate will act sensibly and reasonably and will co-operate as fully as possible with the people who are being inspected.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I apologise for my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) who has another engagement. He had hoped that the Minister would have concluded his remarks this morning so that he could consider them. I am but a poor substitute and certainly no lawyer.

<P>
The Minister's most important operational statement of the day was that he would draw the substance of our debates to the attention of the adult learning chief inspector. That would be helpful. It is right to be concerned about civil liberties, but it is wrong to be obsessed with them when it comes to good practice. I expect him to monitor the situation, and if a case occurs in which civil liberties are infringed, I hope that that will not be treated as a success. It is important that we work with sensitivity.

<P>
The growth of information technology has put a different gloss on the situation over the past four years. The Minister's response was about the co-location of home and education establishments, but the existence of IT and networks means that learning can be conducted anywhere, including in a person's home. The issue is serious, but given the Minister's assurances and, in anticipation of future debates, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendent No. 218, in page 24, line 34, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6A) It is an offence for an inspector wilfully to remove files or printouts of computer material if they are not material to that inspection'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 236, in clause 61, page 27, line 24, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5A) It is an offence to publish or otherwise make use of other than for the purposes of the inspection information or material acquired in the course of such inspection and any such information or material shall be returned to the person from whom it has been taken as soon as reasonably may be after the conclusion of that inspection.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> These amendments are very much in the same vein as the previous group, and I can dispatch them relatively quickly. Amendment No. 218 would make it an offence for an inspector wilfully to remove files or print outs of computer information that are not material to an inspection. The word ``wilfully'' is important. In the same way that I managed to pick up extraneous papers on other clauses for today's debate, it would be possible for an inspector, acting in good faith, to pick up a batch of papers that he thought were part of the accounts or student records, or to acquire a computer file that was thought to be dedicated to a particular purpose but which included additional material-but I infer nothing more than that. Broadly, he should not seek to go on a fishing expedition or go looking for trouble; it would not be within the material terms of the inspection. He certainly should not take away material that has nothing to do with the inspection.

<P>
In a sense, amendment No. 236 is a mirror image. If material-for the purpose of this discussion, we may assume it to be relevant-has come into the hands of the inspector, the amendment would put two further constraints on him. The first is that he should not publish that material if it is not relevant. The other is that it should be understood that the material will be returned to the person whose property it is once the inspection or any connected purpose is over. That scenario will not be unfamiliar to legally qualified members of the Committee, who will recall that the police have the power to retain items of evidence.

<P>
We do not seek to subvert the inspector's scope to carry out his duties, but he cannot have unbridled powers. He should not take away material without reason and, if he has material, he should not spread it around or hang on to it after the need for it has been discharged and he has completed his inspection. Those are reasonable points, and it would be useful to hear the response of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Malcolm Wicks), on whether the provisions need to be set in legislation or whether he would prefer a slightly different approach.

<P>
As I speak, it occurs to me that a clutch of similar points can be made, and that the Under-Secretary might want to produce a code or guidance for the inspectorate that would embrace them, and, in due course, give a calling letter to the chief inspector. The hon. Gentleman may decide to publish it, and lodge a copy in the Library, so that we all understand where we are.

<P>
I do not sense a failure of the Committee's common objective to get it right. The sensitivity of the matter in terms of civil liberties, the European convention on human rights and so forth has been sharpened during the past year or two. With respect to the Minister-I understand why he drew on it-even the standards of the previous Government in relation to safeguards may have been overtaken by events. We want to raise safeguards for individuals if we can, but I would be grateful if the Minister would consider the points seriously, as they are intended in a constructive spirit.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> As the hon. Gentleman emphasised, we are debating the balance that needs to be struck between proper public interest, scrutiny and accountability, and issues such as privacy. When I heard that the hon. Gentleman had picked up an extra bundle by mistake, I am bound to say that I wondered if it could have been one of mine, and that he would have been able on this humid afternoon not only to move amendments but to reply on my behalf. As we have nothing to hide, I would have been quite happy with that, but it turned out to be his own extra bundle.

<P>
On amendment No. 218, I agree that it would be unacceptable for an inspector wilfully to remove anything that was not material to the inspection. The adult learning inspectorate has no power to do anything of the kind, and the law would apply to the removal of non-relevant material in the same way that it would apply, for example, to the removal of a pile of bricks from the employer's yard. In other words, it would already be against the law. The amendment is therefore not necessary. However, I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman moved it, because it has allowed me to clarify the point.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I say that I found amendment No. 236 rather odd. It would make it an offence for anyone-not just an Ofsted inspector, presumably-to make use of or to publish inspection evidence
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>other than for the purposes of the inspection.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Taken literally, that would mean that inspection data on attendance, retention or achievement could not beused once an inspection was over. It is likely that some or all of that information would be published in the inspection report. Would that mean that the figures could not be quoted again in a speech or in a seminar? That obviously was not the hon. Gentleman's intention. He seemed to be referring instead to information that was not strictly relevant to the inspection.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister is reading my mind broadly correctly. I was concerned mostly with material that might, under certain headings, including that of removal and the legality of removal, be seen as relevant to the inspection but which might contain other information with nothing to do with the inspection. The inspectorate might choose to leak that non-relevant information to the general public, even though it did not add value to the inspection.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I understand that important point. As I have noted in relation to amendment No. 218, collecting clearly irrelevant information is beyond the powers of the inspectorates. The amendment is to clause 61 and, therefore, about Ofsted, which is a statutory body. It cannot exercise functions not given it in statute. It has no right to collect or to publish material not relevant to an inspection.

<P>
The other part of the proposal related to the prompt return of material. There is no need to worry: there is a clear right under clause 61(2)(c) for Ofsted to take copies of records and, in many cases, it will not need to remove anything. If it borrows material, it should of course act reasonably and return things promptly. Failure to do so would constitute grounds for complaint by the provider. I should emphasise that there will be a published complaints procedure. A principle in the draft common inspection framework is that, following the inspection, every provider should have recourse to such a procedure if dissatisfied with any aspect of the inspection. That is important.

<P>
It might be helpful to add that the adult learning inspectorate will be bound by the provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998 and, in particular, the convention on private and family life. The Act will be of help in terms of the dangers of fishing expeditions. We do not expect there to be such expenditions, but it is always right to point to extreme examples when testing law.

<P>
Following my earlier point, which the hon. Gentleman has welcomed, we should bear in mind our discussion and the will of the Committee when we bring issues to the attention of the new inspectorates. Again, our discussion on the amendments has been helpful, and we will certainly bring Hansard to attention of the leaning inspectorate with proper covering guidance. I am convinced that, when the inspectorates take on their new functions, they will take seriously the guidance offered to inspectors.

<P>
I thank the hon. Gentleman for the way in which he has moved the amendments. I hope that, given those points, he might consider withdrawing.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister is taking his most reasonable approach this afternoon, and I am sensitive to the points that he has made. I have only one specific point. It is most useful to have his reassurance as to the application of the European convention on human rights in relation to private and family life and the attached rights to privacy, and to have his assurance on general law. Material cannot be removed that is not relevant to the case. That would presumably be an act of theft or conversion. We would not anticipate the inspectorate wishing to do that and would not condone such an action if it did.

<P>
In relation to the use of the material, I understand the Minister's point about not sterilising educationally relevant material or the inspection of the relevant material. Our concern is that, either maliciously or accidentally, material extraneous to the inspection could leak out. The Minister was right to give us assurances as to the code and that there could ultimately be a liability on the inspectorate if they breached confidentiality.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The only other point that I want to raise relates to the taking of copies. I do not require the Minister to answer in terms, but I would like him to re-examine the record because I may have misheard or misunderstood him. I believe that he cited clause 62(3)(b), but the point related to clause 61(2)(c). The Minister cited an example in relation to the chief inspector of schools, but the clause relates to the chief inspector of adult education. I do not want to pin down him, but I would be grateful if he would check with his officials as to whether the chief inspector of adult education has the same sensible powers to take copies, and retain them when he has returned the original material. It is possible that there is a mismatch there. Perhaps neither the Minister nor I have thoroughly considered the Bill.

<P>
I notice that the United States cavalry may even at this moment be coming to the rescue with the answer to the Minister's and my concern.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I am advised that clause 55(1)(c) is helpful on the matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. That puts us in the right reference.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): Would my hon. Friend or the Minister tell us what clause 55(1)(c) says as it is not immediately visible on the face of the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am obliged to my right hon. Friend because I was about to say that the Minister in his desire to answer a perfectly reasonable question with a perfectly reasonable response forgot himself. I am sure he meant to say 55(2)(c), as we should have realised before. Having satisfied myself on that point, it would be churlish and unreasonable of me to press the amendment to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Michael Wills):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 188, in page 25, line 1, leave out ``person providing'' and insert ``provider''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 190, 193, 198, 202, 268, 273 and 282.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I hope that the amendments will not detain us for long. They are drafting changes and have no substantive effect. They should improve the clarity of the Bill.

<P>
In clause 63, we used the term ``provider'' for ``person providing''. For consistency, we should stick to that usage, and that is what the amendments effect.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I do not want to be a nuisance as I asked a similar question earlier. On this occasion, the Minister has explained why the change has been made in the wording of these clauses. I have to say that before he gave us the explanation for all these repetitive amendments I was reminded of one of Paul Jennings' articles, in which he would fasten on some absurdity of life and then produce some marvellously rational explanations for it. In the light of the Minister's clear explanation, I do not intend to press the matter further, although I had a long speech prepared. If the Minister wishes to provide me in person with the answer he promised me this morning in writing, then I should be happy for him to do so if he wishes to save time.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As the Minister is prepared to show the record to the chief inspector of adult learning, I wish only to say that the annual report should be taken seriously both by its author-whom I anticipate will do so-and by Ministers and the House. It would be a good idea if-perhaps not every year, but at least sometimes within the quinquennium of a Parliament-a Parliamentary debate were held on the report, possibly in Westminster Hall if that experiment is continued. I am sure the Committee agrees with me that this area is under-researched, under-reported and under-praised. It is important that the strengths of the further education sector in education and training are celebrated and that any deficiencies are corrected.

<P>
In the same spirit, I make two further points. If the adult learning inspectorate is to work alongside Ofsted and cover the whole provision of education and training, there may be occasions when it would be helpful if the inspectorates' two respective reports were considered together. I am not saying that one should be allowed to detract from the other by launching them at the same press conference. They have the same duty to measure what is going on, and have the same aim of quality assurance on behalf of the taxpayer and citizen, as well as participants in education.

<P>
The other point relates to the electronic opportunities that have opened up, of which Ministers are well aware. Indeed, many hon. Members are better versed in them than I am. There is a huge opportunity for providing material to large numbers of people, not just to education providers who are familiar with electronic networks, the internet and so forth. Increasingly, the documents will quickly become universally available. I hope that Ministers and the inspectorate will ensure they reach the maximum public possible.

<P>
We do not want it to be suggested that the inspectorate is a sop or a second best that is supposed merely to throw off the ravening hounds of complaints from citizens and parents about individual cases in the further education sector. There will always be such complaints, I am sure, but the system should be constructive, should celebrate strengths, if necessary draw attention to weaknesses and get something done about action plans.

<P>
My remarks are not intended to be contentious. Rather, they are intended as a spur to the Minister and his future inspector to get on with the job.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall briefly respond to the hon. Gentleman's comments. I assure him that we intend the annual report to be a serious part of the process. He made several characteristically constructive suggestions, which we shall, as always, consider carefully, as they seem to point towards the duties that we intend the inspectorate to fulfil. With respect, however, they do not bear directly on whether the clause should stand part. The clause simply puts a duty on the inspectorate to produce an annual report on its activities, which the Secretary of State must lay before Parliament. The clause is important, and it should therefore stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 209, in page 25, line 27, leave out from beginning to ``in'' and insert ``secondary education provided''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments: No. 229, in page 25, line 28, leave out ``institutions'' and insert ``maintained schools''.

<P>

</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 231, in page 25, line 36, after ``or'', insert ``educational''.

<P>
Government amendment No. 210.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I shall first speak to the Government amendments, as I intend to deal with the other amendments when I have heard what the hon. Member for Daventry has to say.

<P>
Our amendments are technical, but, as I shall explain, they are important because they reflect our policy of promoting collaboration between schools and further education colleges in the provision of secondary education. As has been mentioned with agreement throughout the Committee, such collaboration can benefit young people for whom learning solely in schools may not be the best option. Clause 58(a) extends Ofsted's remit to include education for pupils of compulsory school age who attend an further education college. The provision might include pupils who are benefiting from arrangements between their school or LEA and a local further education college that ensure that they spend part of their learning week at the college.

<P>
I am reminded of a visit that I made to a college in Yorkshire, where I met a group of children who were aged under 16 and who, because of their difficulties in school and because they were not benefiting much from a school regime, were spending one or two days a week in the local further education college-a rather different environment from a school. In the opinion of those children, the college and the head teacher, that arrangement had enormous benefits.

<P>
Such collaborative activities can also extend to the provision of secondary education for 16 to 18-year-olds, but the clause does not currently allow for the inspection of provision for that older age group, and neither would it fall within the remit of the adult learning inspectorate, which we have already debated. Clearly, all such education must be inspected, and secondary education should be a matter for Ofsted. Government amendment No. 209 ensures that secondary education provided at an further education sector institution will fall within Ofsted's remit for young people of compulsory school age and for those over 16 but under 19.

<P>
Government amendment No. 210 defines the terms ``secondary education'' and ``further education'' by reference to the Education Act 1996. Hon. Members will note that the Act's definition of secondary education is extended by clause 99 to include provision made partly at a school and partly at another institution. I commend the Government amendments to the Committee.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We are in the business of exploring this area a little. The Under-Secretary's remarks were reasonable, especially in the context of the Government's overall strategy for the inspectorate. I do not need to repeat the notes of reservation on this matter that we registered earlier.

<P>
Our amendments aim to probe the Government's intentions. Before I deal with them, however, I should tell the Committee that I share the Under-Secretary's view that pupils who might benefit form provision in a further education college or from other provision outwith the formal education system should be able to avail themselves of the opportunity to do so. Provision outside the system might take the from of training or work experience within a structured programme, and will especially help those who are disaffected or disadvantaged or who are low achievers at schools. We may hear more about that in future.

<P>
The Under-Secretary will know that we have had a difficulty in considering the Bill. Inevitably, we have been focusing on the 16 to 19-year-old age group, without referring to the same extent to earlier years in the compulsory period or within higher education. I notice the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) nodding in assent. We must take a longitudinal approach to these matters and not rule out any reasonable provision.

<P>
I suspect that the Under-Secretary has already anticipated my comments. Amendments Nos. 229 and 230 would allow the inspector to examine education only for people of compulsory school age in maintained schools in England, and would appear to preclude his involvement with the further education sector. I am not trying to make a point about his remit in relation to the independent sector and compulsory schooling. The Under-Secretary might like to say a word about that, although I suspect that he will not want to say very much. Having somewhat anticipated my point, he might assist the Committee by clarifying the following issue. When a local authority or local learning partnership devises a plan to enable young people to take advantage of some other pre-16 experience well within the compulsory period, which might include further education college provision, they may benefit from disapplication of the national curriculum. However, I am unclear about who is responsible for signing the chit to say that those young people can go on to further education. Is that the responsibility of the LEA or the head teacher, if they are enrolled at school but receiving education elsewhere? In no sense am I looking for trouble, but it would be useful to have that information-if not now, at a later stage in our proceedings.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
On Amendment No. 231, I am aware that there was a debate in the other place about bringing education and training for further education lecturers within the remit of the chief inspector of schools because, generally speaking, higher education is higher education and teacher education is higher education. Leaving aside that general principle, there is also the issue of whether the chief inspector of schools is the right person to consider the provision of training for further education lecturers, in particular for teachers of technical subjects as opposed to more educational subjects.

<P>
We have had some constructive debates. I remember that the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) contributed to the discussion on upgrading the status of further education lecturers to give them a more professional status. I am not trying to subvert that, but the way in which all the provisions will fit together and the relationships will work between the various quality inspectorates and individuals is not wholly clear. I tabled the amendments to obtain clarification from the Under-Secretary about that complex but important area.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The hon. Gentleman has raised several important points, including one specific point about how the curriculum will be disapplied in relation to this group of youngsters. I think that he was indirectly asking who would be responsible for the inspection of the child's education in the round. I should like to return to that point, perhaps in writing or at a later stage in Committee. It is not wholly irrelevant to some of the issues about ConneXions and about ensuring that 13 to 19-year-olds receive proper guidance about learning opportunities.

<P>
I listened carefully to what the hon. Gentleman said about the amendments. However, I cannot accept them because they would prevent the Government from filling a gap in legislation. I want to make two principal points. First, the effect of the amendments would be simply to bring education in maintained schools within Ofsted's remit. That is unnecessary-the School Inspections Act 1996 already gives Ofsted that remit. An entire Act is devoted to school inspections.

<P>
The second point relates to the lacunae that I mentioned earlier. As I outlined in relation to amendments Nos. 209 and 210, some pupils of compulsory school age spend all or part of their learning week in the further education sector. Several thousand pupils currently undertake education or training at an further education institution for different reasons. We have talked about those who are disaffected. My example from Yorkshire related to a group that could be so described. Those pupils were benefiting from having a day or two a week in a different institution.

<P>
We should be concerned not merely with about group. There might be an issue about whether it would be beneficial for very bright children aged 15 or less to stay on in the conventional school setting, where some might be bored by remaining in their year or by following the normal curriculum. Many would benefit from taking GCSEs a year or more early-some are ready to start A-levels before most young people are-and could do so in a sixth form or general further education college. The Select Committee produced a useful report on the matter in a previous Session.

<P>
Other children might need a specialised curriculum at the age of 14 or 15. Many such pupils have special educational needs. A statement of SEN might prescribe as the learning balance most likely to benefit the pupil two or three days in a school taking key skills and two days in a college taking a vocational option that the school could not offer.

<P>
Currently, the responsibility for inspecting provision for children of school age in further education colleges is blurred. We have taken the opportunity here to put beyond doubt that that grey area should fall within Ofsted's remit.

<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): We do not wish to rerun the arguments heard in another place about the appropriateness of which body should inspect which institution-we shall return to that question on Report.

<P>
Will the Minister clarify the framework under which Ofsted will inspect provision for children under 16 in further education institutions? The two remits are extremely different. In the case given, which I know well, of students in Leeds who go to other institutions, especially fresh start schools, there is a different regime. If an Ofsted inspection regime inspects the provision made for those youngsters and compares it with national norms, we will again end up with a conflict. The Minister will know that we have discussed the matter in the Select Committee. Will he clarify the regime for HMCI inspections-the traditional further education system using the FEFC model or the traditional school model?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We have had an interesting dialogue that has made me think harder about the group of children, numbering several thousand, who might spend time in an further education institution or in a school. The group is special because the children can be given a different chance to progress well in education or training.

<P>
Ofsted will clearly want to pay great attention to the way in which it can inspect in the round the provision for a young person who is in more than one institution. I recall that Ofsted has experience of the Department's new start projects, for example, and has studied the different opportunities being offered in different parts of the country, often on a pilot basis, which sometimes involve training and education. I hope that I have my facts right; if not, I shall let hon. Members know. I want to reflect on the matter and perhaps discuss it with the inspectorate, so that I can answer the hon. Gentleman's questions properly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> The Under-Secretary will know that ``Bridging the Gap'' identified a population of about 170,000 16 to 19-year-olds. The majority of the 9 per cent. of youngsters up to the age of 16 are taught in the compulsory maintained system. They do not suddenly become disadvantaged when they reach 16.

<P>
When the Under-Secretary was Chairman of the Select Committee, we debated whether Ofsted should inspect special education against the national norm. We differed on that, the majority of the Committee finding in his favour rather than in mine. As Chairman of the Committee, the Under-Secretary visited the east Leeds family learning centre, which is experimental and developmental. Unless we get the inspection regime right and unless such places are inspected against the specialist rather than the traditional norm, we shall be in danger of undermining an excellent Government innovation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I should like to reflect on two points. The first is that young persons are being offered a different kind of experience. The curriculum is disapplied. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough-quite properly, given that many of us are so positive about it-asks how it can be adequately inspected. The second point, which is closely related, is how inspections can benefit those children when they may be experiencing education in two or more institutions.

<P>
I shall want to reflect rather more on the second point. The implication is that if one inspects a school, one is inspecting a child's education in that school; but if the child attends two institutions, simply inspecting the institution may mean that things are missed. We need to take a more holistic approach.

<P>
It has been an interesting discussion. I cannot give a magical answer, but I promise that the Department will consider the matter carefully and talk to Ofsted about it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> A third element of Government policy, which I strongly support, is that young people between the ages of 14 and 16 should have some good work experience. It is crucial that such experience should be part of the overall educational experience that is inspected. Ofsted has no experience in that field, yet the new adult learning inspectorate will have a duty to inspect. When the Under-Secretary considers the matter-perhaps tonight, over a bottle of Chablis-will he consider including that element?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> It might be a glass of lemonade, although the Confederation of British Industry is entertaining me tonight, together with the Prime Minister and several hundred other people. As I shall need to reflect between courses on what the hon. Gentleman has said, I shall probably not go for the Chablis. That is my story, and I am sticking to it.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman has raised another interesting point. It does not relate to this group of amendments, but I certainly believe that we should offer better work experience to children. It is too variable at the moment. As we seek to make education more relevant to the world of work-that is not its only objective-and as we start to try to knock down the Berlin wall that divides academic education from the so-called vocational, the quality of work experience becomes more important. I expect the ConneXions service to be one of several vehicles to improve children's work experience.
<P>

<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I understand why the hon. Member for Daventry tabled amendment No. 231-there does come a time when we must return to the nitty-gritty of amendments-but I hope to persuade him that it is not needed. I do not want to be pedantic, but I am advised that the term ``educational training'' could be thought to be something of a tautology. The hon. Gentleman has impressed us with his knowledge of Latin, so we must resist the amendment-otherwise he would be able to misuse English. Given his position, that would arguably be a non sequitur.

<P>
On the substantive point, perhaps I may reassure the hon. Gentleman. It is not intended to extend Ofsted's remit into workplace training. Ofsted will, for example, inspect vocational A-levels in further education colleges as it does in schools, but it will not touch modern apprenticeships or new deal provision, or any other workplace provision. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment. Some of the points that he raised about inspection of teacher training can be revisited on another occasion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister and I share his view that the debate has been very constructive. It has been characterised by the welcome sight of Ministers thinking aloud, which is a good idea, particularly in such complex areas. It is the wish of the whole Committee to reach the right solution. I am very grateful to the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough for his contributions, which were well conceived and bore exactly on the subject. As the Minister has said, what we have been discussing is significant and may grow. It may be complex, for example with respect to numbers. I can imagine that it might be sensible for an individual under the age of 16 to attend a further education college for a course of instruction, which would not be a group activity. In a different situation, a group of young people might be transferred as a class, or part of a class, for the same activity. The same solution might not apply in each case.

<P>
Something else that would need to be carefully considered-we shall probably revisit it in the context of the ConneXions service-is signals about what might be termed the voice of authority. I might not want to say it, particularly having only today had a constructive response from the chief inspector to the concerns of a school in my constituency about school inspections, but some in the teaching profession see Ofsted as the educational equivalent of the boys in blue. That rather loose and jocular analogy can be applied to the question of disaffected young people. If they feel that by going to college they are submitting themselves again to the forces of authority, and that that is not helpful or constructive as they have been trying to get away from such experiences, we may be sending the wrong signal.

<P>
I was pleased that the Minister said that on some occasions a mix of provision would be sensible, for an individual or a group of young people. Part of the provision, such as basic skills, could be given in school, and the vocational experience could be acquired in a college. A view of the whole person's needs is important, along, logically, with an inspection mechanism covering appropriateness and the manner of provision. It might not be the same mechanism in every case. The Minister has done the Committee a service by listening to our concerns and suggesting that he will reflect on them, no doubt with the intention of producing an agreed approach to such circumstances.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Amendment made: No. 210, in page 25, line 38, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) ``Secondary education'' and ``further education'' have the same meaning as they have in the Education Act 1996.'.-[Mr. Wicks.]<P>

<P>
Clause 58, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 59</center></H4>
<H4><center>Additional functions of the Chief Inspectorate</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 232, in page 26, line 13, leave out subsection (3).

<P>
There are two angles to consider. The first is the involvement of the chief inspector in further education teacher training as a result of the transferred functions. What is the extent of that remit and why is it necessary? The second angle relates to the powers of the Secretary of State to widen the remit of the chief inspector at will, although I am not suggesting that he would go on a wild rampage to include endless and extraneous powers. Indeed, part of our case is that because the chief inspector is acquiring new duties at the early years end of the spectrum, he will have plenty to do. Why is such a wide provision appropriate? How will it be controlled and in what way will the Secretary of State be accountable to the House if he decides to extend the remit? The Minister explained that there was a lacuna in the existing arrangements. I am not saying that the power is inappropriate, but the Minister should give us a bit of a steer on the particular matter of training of further education teachers or lecturers and on the general matter of why the remit-extending powers are necessary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I understand that this is a probing amendment on an important issue, but it would have an unfortunate effect. Deleting subsection (3) would jeopardise the right of Ofsted to advise the Secretary of State on inspections of provision if its remit had been extended in regulations. When we debated amendment No. 213, which dealt with regulation-making powers in clause 51 to extend the remit of the adult learning inspectorate, I gave overwhelming reasons why the additional flexibility that is provided by regulations was necessary for future arrangements. Chapter II establishes a similar provision for regulations to extend the remit of Ofsted, if necessary. We must be careful to ensure that statutory bodies such as Ofsted have clear vires for their functions. We discussed that today when we debated amendment No. 218. The deletion of subsection (3) would jeopardise Ofsted's possible future functions.

<P>
On further education teacher training, Ofsted inspects post-graduate certificate in education schools courses in higher education institutions. Those institutions are, in general, the same institutions that offer PGCE for further education training. Ofsted has the potential expertise and infrastructure to inspect PGCE courses for further education. However, we envisage a substantial overarching role for the adult learning inspectorate in further education teacher training. If Ofsted took on that remit, it would be in conjunction with the adult learning inspectorate, which would ensure coherence between the City and Guilds standards, as City and Guilds courses give exemptions from parts of the PGCE for further education and are designed to provide progression to them. A joint inspection of some further education teacher training could ensure continuity and coherence of standards between the PGCE for schools and the PGCE for further education. Such arrangements may also avoid the inspection of teacher training work of higher education institutions by inspectorates and the consequent imposition of an additional burden.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Daventry for tabling the amendment, although I did not see its purpose when I read it earlier today. The Under-Secretary's answer was interesting. Anybody who visits a teacher training college or a university department will be told that such organisations are the most heavily inspected educational institutions. They are inspected by the teacher training agency and by Ofsted, and are also subject to institutional inspections. Is the Under-Secretary telling us that they will now have to undergo not only Ofsted inspections but those conducted by the adult learning inspectorate? Those inspections will apply in addition to those of the teacher training agency, so the Government are adding another burden. As the Government seek to address training and to increase provision for teaching in higher education institutions, will not that burden be extended into a huge mish mash of inspections? Will the Under-Secretary clarify the Government's position?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We will, of course, consult on draft regulations to extend Ofsted's remit, and the matters to which the hon. Gentleman refers will come to the fore in that consultation. I share his concern to ensure that no single institution is over-inspected in a non-joined-up and unco-ordinated way. The matters that we have been discussing in relation to further education teacher training and the Ofsted role show that the greatest care will be necessary in deciding how the institutions will be inspected as a whole. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I am sensitive to that point.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will withdraw the amendment in the light of remarks.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Under-Secretary has again sought to be conciliatory and has given us some important references. We shall need to study very carefully the interaction of the various bits of his remarks, but the point of substance is trying to ensure that there are not too many cooks in this particular broth. I recall from leading during the passage of legislation on various teacher training measures that a good number of inspections are already undertaken: adding a further one might be-to change metaphors-the last straw. We need to stand back from the Bill and ask whether the amount of inspection that could now be undertaken will be cost effective in terms of raising standards in teacher training, which is the essential concern. The matter will perhaps be of some concern to other hon. Members in the Chamber later this evening.

<P>
Will the Under-Secretary consider a little further the analogy between clauses 51 and 59 in respect of the definition of the present and potential extension of the remit of the chief inspector of adult education? Both of those clauses are potentially power extending. Clause 51, unless I have misread or misunderstood it, extends the remit of the chief inspector of adult education to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such other education or training as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 51(2), as I think the Minister said, states that the regulations may include in the inspectorate's remit various matters including teacher training. In respect of the remit of the chief inspector of schools, clause 59 refers merely to such
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>functions  as the Secretary of State may specify.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The problem might be that Ofsted cannot be bound by regulations because it is a non-ministerial Government department or because there is no procedure for doing so. I am not clear what the procedure would be. I do not want to pin down the Minister on that point now, but he might want to reflect and return to it. The matter seems slightly untidy.

<P>
Standing back from these close and terse provisions, I want to make a general point. Someone could be confused about the chief inspectors on a casual reading of the Bill-I hope that there will not be too many casual readers of legislation-because of the current drafting.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> No. I would not be confused.

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough says that he would never be confused; I suspect that he said that in jest. The Minister has once or twice dragged in a point from the other set of clauses to support an argument relating to the current set. While in no sense wishing to stimulate an excess of Government amendments on Report, I hope that the Minister will go through the part again and see whether there is any way of making the provisions clearer. If nothing else, to the casual reader, and I am sure that there are none of those in Committee, it would be possible to mix up Ps and Qs, or one inspector with another, in a way that could give rise to misunderstanding. With and subject to those comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I rise briefly to speak about what is an important issue for the Liberal Democrats and, I hope, for many members of the Committee. The point continues from our previous debate. There is a general feeling in the profession and in our schools that Ofsted, and the chief inspector in particular, is influencing Government policy and therefore policy in schools. There is a fair amount of evidence for that. The chief inspector, when last he appeared before the Select Committee, made it clear that he was proud of some of the Government's policy initiatives that he had instigated. That might be good or bad-I am not making a judgment although one might contend from my tone that I am. In the further education sector, and especially the post-16 sector, the inspectorate led by further education has generally been viewed not as benevolent-that is not the way in which we wish to consider inspection-but as developmental.

<P>
A real worry is that, if Ofsted, and the current chief inspector in particular, becomes increasingly involved in the way in which our teachers are trained, that body will have an influence on pedagogy, curriculum and methodology in our teacher-training establishments at school, further education and even higher education levels. That should not happen. I look to the Government to find a way of protecting the education system from the undue influence of a chief inspector of schools or the adult learning inspectorate, who has his own agenda.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall respond briefly to the hon. Gentleman. I would not necessarily buy the whole package that he put to the Committee. We need to get a response from the Minister. It is important that an inspector has in mind the fact that there are sometimes different routes to the same objective and that there will be different styles: for example, the old-fashioned drill method as against the direct method of teaching. There will be different approaches because children and young people are different and not all will be academically motivated. Some will readily take to academic and vocational courses, and others, whose bent is towards practical subjects, will not find academic subjects at all useful.

<P>
I think that it was a Conservative Secretary of State who, drawing on a Labour educationalist, said that we have two kinds of education in this country: a good academic education and a bad one. We do not want that; we want the right education for each child. The same objective can be reached by different routes, just as individuals have different styles and approaches. That is not to say that the chief inspector is not sensitive to such matters. I do not spend my time dealing with the work of the inspectorate, but I would not wish to give that signal. However, it is extremely important that Ministers should, in their wisdom, proceed with a degree of tolerance and pluralism, and not seek to impose a narrow template on whichever bit of the system is under observation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I need speak only briefly, because we have had a number of useful debates on amendments to the clause. I shall not comment on the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough's interesting discussion about the influence of Her Majesty's chief inspector. Inspectors obviously have many things to do. One of them should be to exert influence on the Government of the day. It may not be a prime function, but as inspection, by its very nature, includes the publication of annual reports and reports on institutions, it would be extraordinary if that work, whether of the three existing inspectorates or the two future inspectorates, did not have an influence on the Government.

<P>
One of the first documents that I read as Minister was a report by the Training Standards Council. I was disturbed by what it said about the poor level of training in private care homes. Those who have an interest in community care are sometimes worried about the standards of care in such homes. If training, too, is poor, as that inspection suggested, it is a matter of concern. That report had an influence on my thinking, but although inspectors obviously have influence, it is for the Government to govern.

<P>
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough might be reassured by the informal consultation document produced by the three inspectorates, because it draws on the best traditions and best practices of the different inspection regimes. Although its discussion of self-assessment was brief-I argued this morning that it is not an alternative to inspection but is complementary to it, and that it should be inspected rigorously-the way in which it was discussed should give the hon. Gentleman cause for optimism.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
As with the earlier amendments to clause 56, this is another minor drafting amendment. It has no substantive effect beyond improving clarity. However, I shall take this opportunity to answer the questions raised earlier by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke).

<P>
The right hon. Gentleman asked why amendments No. 184 and the amendments grouped with it were necessary. Since then, Ministers have racked their brains trying to remember how we arrived at this point, and teams of officials have been diligently trawling their corporate memory and looking through files. As a result of those stakhanovite labours, we are now able to give a definitive answer.

<P>
The right hon.Gentleman has had a distinguished career in government and will be aware that Bills usually start, as this one did, with the big picture. As Parliament exercises its proper function of scrutiny, turning its laser-like focus on the details of a Bill, imperfections are sometimes revealed. That is what has happened here. Thanks to the diligent labours of the Committee and to the scrutiny of the House, we have become aware that certain drafting alterations are necessary. In our restless quest for an ever more perfect Bill, we felt impelled to make certain changes. I admit that, in a perfect world, we should perhaps have spotted those imperfections a little earlier, but I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will understand the process by which we arrived at our current position. I am aware that, as this afternoon wears on, he may feel driven to ask a similar question about later amendments, but I assure him that much the same explanation will apply. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept that explanation and perhaps spare the taxpayer the expense of a letter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> It would be churlish of me not to respond to the Under-Secretary. As he will recall, at the previous sitting I invited him to save himself a letter by responding. I am extremely grateful to him for having done so, and will not rehearse the whole series of conjectures that I have devised in Paul Jennings mode, but I shall share with him just a couple.

<P>
There is either a daily incentive in the Department or in the parliamentary draftsmen's office to spot ways in which the Bill could be improved, or the Government are pursuing the practice of Dean Acheson, who, when trying to run a collaborative bipartisan foreign policy, deliberately included in any measure that he proposed to Senator Vandenburg-the Republican Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations-an item that he knew the senator would want to correct because, by that act of correction, the policy would become bipartisan. I had formed several other conjectures about the Government's intentions, but I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for drawing attention to the Government's labours in trying to improve the Bill as much as possible in a Cou-like manner, and I totally accept the Under-Secretary's explanation.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 233, in page 26, line 19, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`but subject to the prior knowledge and approval of that Inspectorate'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We now come to a series of amendments that deal with the relations between the two chief inspectors: the inspector for adult learning and the inspector for schools. It is clear from what Ministers have said, as well as from the framework proposals, that the chief inspector of schools will be in the driving seat. He will be the boss, and the chief inspector for adult learning will have a subordinate role. Whether that is the best way in which to conduct the relationship is for others wiser than I, or for the event, to determine.

<P>
I can foresee a difficulty. I am sure that Ministers want the two chief inspectors, whoever they are, to proceed with sweetness and light, to reach ready agreement and to implement smoothly the Government's framework. There seem to be two possible scenarios in which that might not happen. The first is if relations between the two inspectors break down and they become litigious. Indeed, in tabling amendments, I am always consious that if one tries to define something more precisely, one may increase the scope for affront. Most constituency MPs have experienced situations in which they find themselves not on one side in a neighbour dispute, but on both. One learns quite a lot about unreasonableness in such circumstances.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The second, perhaps more subtle relationship would be if the chief inspector of schools were the dominant party. Rather than there being a relationship between a subordinate and a superior, the chief inspector of schools might tell the chief inspector of adult learning what to do or take no notice of him. That might not obviously result in dissent or become a public scandal-even Ministers might not be aware of it, as they were not aware of one or two recent matters relating to car companies-but it would be no less corrosive than the first situation for the prosecution of good inspection of education training.

<P>
I am conscious that this string of amendments would legislate for the worst case by anticipating points of difficulty, but they, too, need considering. If the basis and the ground rules for the two inspectors are not clear, their respective powers could be misunderstood. The cause for justifying the amendments is that that might compound the difficulties if there is also a personal strain between the inspectors. If the problem arises 10 or 20 years down the track, Ministers will have to grasp the nettle, get the inspectors in and, if necessary, remove one of them. That would be regrettable, but it might be the only possible response. I am anxious to receive clarification of their different rights and duties.

<P>
Amendment No. 233 would tie the inspections by Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools in England into those of the adult learning inspectorate, which would have to be given prior knowledge of them before granting its approval. Nothing upsets people more than someone muscling in on their natural territory. It would be a courtesy and a sensible operational rule-this is covered to some extent in the framework document, which we are beginning to understand and appreciate-for the adult learning inspector to have prior knowledge. He needs to understand that the chief inspector of schools has the remit. Everyone should know what is going on in advance. The worst scenario would be if people's roles were contended, or if inspectors turned up at a college without the knowledge of the adult learning inspector. A college that is inspected one week could be inspected a week later by a different group of inspectors, which would add to ill feeling. The amendment envisages that situation arising and invites the Minister to comment on how it could be avoided.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> In sum, our approach is that the amendment is unnecessary. In practice, Ofsted and the adult learning inspectorate will work together in close co-operation to inspect all further education colleges. They will share information and work out a full programme of inspections. However, I recognise the hon. Gentleman's underlying concern about how the arrangement will work. I shall, therefore, discuss in detail how it will operate in practice, which I hope will reassure him.

<P>
Colleges are diverse. Nearly all of them will fall within the remit of both inspectorates. A few, however, will fall exclusively to one inspectorate. A few sixth form colleges will have no students aged over 19 and will therefore be entirely within Ofsted's remit. Similarly, a few adult residential colleges will have no 16 to 18-year-olds on the roll. However, the majority-400 or so colleges-will need joint inspections, with a team of inspectors from the adult learning inspectorate and Ofsted.

<P>
How will that work? The two inspectorates will consult each other on the programme of future inspections, using an up-to-date list of colleges, the current roll broken down by age and information about the provision made by the colleges. That will tell inspectors which colleges Ofsted or the adult learning inspectorate will inspect and which will need joint operations. The inspectorates will give colleges about six months' warning, with an appropriate date for the arrival of the inspection team. On that basis they will, we envisage, go about their work harmoniously, with each aware of the other's activity.

<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry made it clear that he was talking about a worst-case scenario, and he was right to draw our attention to it. We foresee no problems. Public bodies must work together in all kinds of ways, as must Governments and Oppositions. By and large, they find ways to do so. The hon. Gentleman raised a point-and the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough agreed with it-about who would take the lead in a joint inspection process. Clarity about that is necessary and colleges will expect it. If we had not set it out clearly in the Bill we should, I have no doubt, be accused of ducking the issue. Our choice of Ofsted was not meant to detract in any way from the experience and skills of the Further Education Funding Council and Training Standards Council directorates. However, and while I recognise the agenda of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough with respect to the chief inspector, Ofsted is already fully established, with a proven track record in improving standards. It runs highly successful inspection systems.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I cannot allow the Minister to get away with his last comment. There is no evidence that Ofsted has improved standards in any schools. Teachers, by interacting with students and parents, improve standards in schools. Our great concern about the Government's decision is that the excellent relationships between the FEFC inspectorate and further education colleges is likely to be undermined if the framework that applies to schools is applied to them-with due respect.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am happy to accept the respect of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough and to pay tribute to the invaluable work of school teachers. However, I want to return to the amendment rather than the political issues that the hon. Gentleman wants to introduce into our discussions.

<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked what would happen if relations between the two bodies were to break down and there were to be friction between them. We do not envisage that. They will have to work together. That is incumbent on them as professionals and we shall expect them to behave professionally. The Secretary of State will, should the worst happen, have a crucial role in guidance and in bringing the two inspectorates together.

<P>
I hope that I have offered sufficient reassurance to the hon. Member for Daventry to persuade him to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I did not rise immediately after my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry because I wanted to hear what the Under-Secretary had to say about the amendment. Even before the Under-Secretary spoke, however, I was testing the amendment against my own experience as a head hunter. I was, in fact, the first head hunter in the land, and I found after some time in the job that one had to spend a lot of time thinking, on the one hand, about companies that had never absorbed anybody from outside and, on the other, about companies that had changed their management structures to solve a problem and were introducing somebody to fill one or other of the jobs involved.

<P>
While dealing with the latter problem, we developed a process with which we ensured that the two people who would have to interact spent some 24 hours together with us, so that they could identify the contingencies that were to arise between them. The first person had frequently chosen the second person to join his company because he believed that he could work with him well. We had to tell such people that the fact that they got on with each other, could read each other's minds and believed that they could solve joint problems was not sufficient for the thousands and thousands of people in their company who did not share their experience. We had to explain the importance of rules enabling other people in the organisation to understand what was happening and of the provision of guidelines to them.

<P>
I thought that the Under-Secretary was a little casual about the Exocet delivered at him by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. He was a little too dismissive of an observation that was driving a coach and horses-or whatever an Exocet does-through the central premise of his argument. However, that is by the by; there is no accounting for tastes, and Ministers must make their cases in their own way. Although the Under-Secretary was casual in that respect, I thought that the case that he made in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry provided a framework that other people in the organisations would be able to follow, over and above those who are heading them. In that aspect of his comments, the Under-Secretary-I am not speaking about his response to the remarks of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough-made out a convincing case on the Government's behalf.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This has been a most illuminating debate. The analogy of the Exocet, which was drawn by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, was exactly the one that I, too, would have used. The Under-Secretary clearly has an almost unrivalled ability to use whatever electronic interference devices are needed for deflection, and to do his best to disarm the rest of the Committee with his charm.

<P>
Movingly, and to some extent convincingly, the Under-Secretary described an ideal scenario, just as I spoke of a worst-case scenario for the purposes of the debate. I was once empanelled on to a tribunal. As I recall, I was nominated as a farmers' representative, although I would also have been qualified to have appeared on the other side of the case, as a landowner. The way in which we worked, and the fact that some other members of the panel were in a similar position, ensured that I could not remember which side I was on by the end of the process. That is a good way of working in practice, and one should have a degree of collegiality within a framework whenever that is possible.

<P>
Ministers should pay close attention to my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminister and heed his wise advice. I was wondering from his description of himself as the first head hunter whether we should rename him as a proto-magnon man or something like that for the purposes of the Committee. The Government should ensure that the two chief inspectors can work together and that the cultures are seen as broadly aligned.

<P>
I did not table an amendment about the possibility of different pay and conditions for the two inspectorates, but the matter now gives me concern. There is a ministerial power of regulation, but it would be a recipe for ill feeling if pay and conditions were to go out of line and people from the adult learning and schools inspectorates were to be conducting joint inspections on different pay or other bases-in the same way that, as the Minister has been told, further education lecturers might be under-remunerated compared with school teachers. We hope that the arrangmeent will work. The Minister's assurances have been helpful. He needs to be constantly vigilant, both before and after the new inspectorate is appointed. Tensions arise between professionals, and if they get out of hand the entire process will be devalued.

<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I did not intend to fire an Exocet missile at the Minister; if that was the impression created, I am sorry. I wanted to raise an important point of principle about the standards agenda in schools. If I offended him, although I am sure I did not, I apologise.

<P>
I accept that debates in this and another place will not move the Government on the issue of two inspectorates visiting further education colleges. I am worried not that we shall not be able to persuade people to work together at the heads of the organisations, but that conficts will arise in the frameworks operating in the same institution. I understand about the consultation in this context, but the point is crucial. Ofsted might inspect a programme of study presented to 16 to 19-year-olds, but ALI might inspect exactly the same programme, given to students aged 19 to 24, under a different framework, with different documentation. That level of confusion would cause problems in the organisation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is an intervention-a rather lengthy one, I should point out. I see that other hon. Members are now trying to intervene on it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Some time ago, Mr. Benton, I was probably making a speech on which the hon. Gentleman intervened, but I was then about to counter-intervene on his intervention. I simply want to make the point before sitting down and leaving free rein to any of his other thoughts, or for other Committee members who want to join in, that one of the most embarrassing situations possible would be for different conclusions to be reached about the same activities conducted by a lecturer for different groups of students coming under different inspectorates. The poor lecturer would be able to say that the ALI gave him a clean bill of health but Ofsted said he was rubbish. That would be destabilising and difficult to cope with.

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster </B>(Worcester): What the hon. Gentleman described could happen now when both Further Education Funding Council inspectors and professional bodies are able to conduct inspections.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point. To modify Occam and, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster is now back in his place, to return to Latin, de inspectoribus non est multiplicandum. It really is too bad to have too many and perhaps lecturers and their institutions will see things that way.

<P>
<B>Dr. Starkey:</B> The hon. Gentleman gave the example of two different inspectors reaching different views about the same course. Might not that occur also if the same inspector inspected two different activities? A person might be fine when teaching 16 to 19-year-olds, but not so good when teaching adults.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a perfectly reasonable point, but the lecturer may not see it like that. We merely say that the structure is likely to increase the complexity and even the capricious nature of the work of the inspectorate. To be frank, Ministers have set minds on the matter. I do not intend to press the amendment to a Division, but it was certainly right to outline some of the potential pitfalls in what Ministers still see as a rather smooth path to even greater progress. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 194 to 197.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The amendments are part of our constant quest to improve the Bill. They are all technical. They add nothing of substance to the Bill, but they improve its clarity. They remove references to inspectors in clause 61. We do not need to refer to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any inspector taking part in the inspection<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
because, under the School Inspections Act 1996, references to the chief inspector for England include any inspector, any member of his staff and any additional inspector authorised by the chief inspector to act on his behalf. The term ``Her Majesty's chief inspector'' therefore encompasses the full range of persons involved in Ofsted inspections.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I assure the Minister that I shall not engage in cross-examination of the sort that I have attempted previously, not even at a modest level. I understand what he seeks to achieve. In the same way, Secretaries of State become de rigueur in Whitehall because each Secretary of State relates to a Department. I never understood why the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food should be excluded from that rule, but there is doubtless some arcane reason for it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I cannot tell my right hon. Friend why that should be, but I can tell him that, for every incoming Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Ministry makes a submission explaining why, under no circumstances, should he rescind that unique privilege. To date, under successive Governments, Ministers have accepted that submission.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for educating me. In this serial process of improving the Bill-I reflect on the MInister's sensible explanation when we last did so-I greatly admire the Government's timing. I do not remember such improvements being made to the first half of the Bill, although some may have been made on the day when I was in Northern Ireland. If I am right, it is perfectly clear that the Government believe that they must represent the Bill as perfect at least up to clause 50, and that only when we come to the second half of the Bill can improvements be effective without providing the Opposition with the opportunity of recording that the Bill could be still further improved. Nevertheless, I understand why these particular amendments have been moved.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I want to pick up a point enshrined in an amendment that did not catch your eye, Mr. Benton, for selection. There is a concern on the Conservative Benches, which I suspect the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough shares, that the inspectorate's report should be clear as to the action required, if action is to be taken. There is evidence, although I suspect that it is more in the assertion than in the fact, that past prescriptions of necessary medicine in further education and school inspections have not been sufficiently precise. The governors and head teacher in a school, or the governors and principal of a further education college, have not known what they had to do.

<P>
I agree that bringing an action plan into the public domain will trigger the process and that that might be acceptable. However, it will not be acceptable for either inspectorate to conclude that something is inadequate and to make general statements about the situation. Such statements are difficult to tie down, yet institutions would be expected to use them for specific action plans to remedy a breach that would still be unclear to them. If a statement were clear-one would hope that it would be as clear as possible-it would be reasonable to say to the institution that it should get on with the task. If it were not clear, because it had not been sufficiently precisely drawn, it would be too much to ask for action.

<P>
We decided that we would take the opportunity to offer the in-coming inspectors an indication of the Committee's opinion of their remit. I hope that the Minister will want to respond to the comments, and to echo the comments' relevance to the inspectorates' conduct.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I have listened carefully to what the hon. Gentleman has said. The issues are important, although I should stress that the clause contains a regulation-making power to govern publication and dissemination of the plans. The role of the inspectors is not to prescribe solutions. That is for the institutions-the providers. I am happy to confirm that the nature of the problem to be solved must be clear, as the hon. Gentleman has rightly noted. We want the deliberations of the Committee to be considered.

<P>
The clause simply confirms that, following an inspection secured by Ofsted under the new remit, providers must prepare action plans. The plans will include the steps that the provider must take within a particular time in light of the findings of the inspection report. That is subject to the institution being clear about the problems to be solved. With that, I recommend that the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 207, in page 27, line 46, at end insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(ab) the implementation of any local learning and skills council plan for that area drawn up under seciton 22'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
There is clearly an interest in conducting area inspections. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough will table a new clause to give the adult learning inspectorate the power to do that. We are not against that in principle, but we require elucidation on one or two points. The first point, which was enshrined in amendment No. 237 that was not selected, is to question whether, under the rubric of a specified area in England-that is an area inspection-it would be possible for the chief inspector of schools to carry out an inspection of all provision in a particular subject in England. I assumed that it would be possible. For example, if the inspector wished to examine the provision of religious education in further education colleges or the provision of moral and pastoral subjects-one being a subject and the other having a supporting role-I assume that he could. Or would he have to do that under the area education rubric?

<P>
Amendment No. 207 refers to the opportunity for the chief inspector of schools to consider the implementation of any local learning and skills council plan for an area drawn up under section 22. If we want the local learning and skills council to have a significant role, we need to ensure that those plans are taken seriously. One way to do that is to enable the inspector to inspect them. I look forward to hearing the Under-Secretary's response to that.

<P>
Before I sit down, I want to say how much we welcome the fact that our meagre Benches have been reinforced by the arrival of my hon. Friend the Member for south Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes), who has seen service if not in foreign parts, at least in somewhat inhospitable parts, but has emerged unscathed from fighting a very good war. No doubt he is raring to go, like a greyhound in the slips, to establish his position on the Committee. He has arrived at a late hour and has much ground to make up, but we have every confidence that he will do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I, too, noted the arrival of my former colleague on the Select Committee. I am sure that the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster will welcome the arrival of a spin bowler at this hot time in the afternoon. It is good to see the hon. Gentleman. I, too, had assumed that he had been taking part in an expedition, albeit unsuccessful, in Hampshire. I am not at all surprised that he has taken so long to recover.

<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): I wonder whether it has occurred to the Minister to mention today's opinion poll, which has given my hon. Friend the boost he so badly needed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We became friends on the Select Committee, and I am certainly not prepared to agree with the hon. Gentleman that the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings needs such a boost. However, it is good to see him.

<P>
I was interested to note that amendment No. 207 was also tabled in another place, although not by the party of the hon. Member for Daventry. Earlier, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary commented that even people in opposition need to co-operate; perhaps this is one example of that. I shall employ similar arguments to those used by my noble Friend Baroness Blackstone, who replied in the other place. The amendment relates to clause 22, under which local learning skills councils must prepare plans that assess the needs of the local area. The amendment would closely link Ofsted to that process by requiring it to inspect the implementation of the local LSC's plans. In our judgment, that would not be a good idea because it would blur the distinction between the roles of two independent bodies: Ofsted and the Learning and Skills Council.

<P>
Under clause 22, the local LSC will act as a planning body to ensure that local provision matches the aspirations of local communities, the needs of individuals and the demands of business. Of course, good inspection will encompass knowledge of local conditions and current trends, but Ofsted is not primarily interested in the process of planning. It is an independent, objective organisation that is interested in the outcomes achieved by education providers. The Bill contains provisions to examine, during an area inspection, the effectiveness of the LSC's application of its resources. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will allow me to deal with single subject inspections later.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am a little disappointed. We have tried to maintain a bipartisan front. The Minister's response was not convincing. I do not understand why we cannot inspect something that has been planned. The planning function and the evaluation of the effects of the plans are different. We might as well say that we cannot inspect the plans for the provisions of the schools population. I am minded to test the opinion of the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Daventry for inviting us to do that. We will support him. LEA plans are inspected. Surely this is the equivalent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Precisely so.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`they should seek to reach agreement on the division of responsibilities, but the Chief Inspector may thereafter determine the scope of that part of the inspection to be carried out by each of the two inspectorates separately'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I sense that the Opposition's batting average has improved considerably, although we will not seek to exploit that impovement. Instead, we will bask in our reflected glory and pursue our scrutiny of the Bill.

<P>
The Under-Secretary will have heard earlier exchanges about the adult learning inspectorate and its relationship with the chief inspector of schools, as well as remarks on the sensitivity of those matters. In that respect, the amendments form part of a piece with earlier amendments. Amendment No. 251 would enable the chief inspector of adult learning not merely to respond to a request for advice from the chief inspector but to tender such advice unsolicited. It is hardly likely that such a requirement will be needed if the parties have a decent relationship, but the Under-Secretary may want to consider that point.

<P>
Secondly, I cannot imagine any clearer evidence of the chief inspector of adult learning being subordinate to the chief inspector of schools than subsection (6) which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If the Chief Inspector asks the Chief Inspector of Adult Learning to undertake a specified part of an area inspection, he must do so.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an order, and it seems an unusual undertone that is not a good basis for a relationship. Amendment No. 238 would ensure that a positive attempt is made to reach agreement on the division of responsibility, but, in anticipation of the difficulty that would arise if no such a remit could be agreed it would ensure that the chief inspector of schools would thereafter prevail. That seems a better formulation to deal with such circumstances, which none of us want to occur.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I shall deal with the amendments together, as they are closely related. First, however, it will assist the Committee if I briefly outline how the clause will work. Subsection (1)(a) ensures that the Secretary of State may ask HMCI-that is, Ofsted-for area inspection of a particular area. He may also give a specified description of the education and training in the area that is to be inspected. Usually, that will include the work-based training for 16 to 18-year-olds, as we will want to know whether, for example, there is the proper range of modern apprenticeships in the area. In some instances, however, the Secretary of State may be interested only in provision for 16 to 18-year-olds in schools and further education colleges.

<P>
In the first case, the chief inspector will need the assistance of the adult learning inspectorate, as his remit does not run to work-based training. Therefore, clause 63(5) enables him to ask the chief inspector of the adult learning inspectorate, who will be under a duty to assist. That secures the inspection of 16-to-18 work-based training in an area inspection. In the second scenario that I have outlined, in which the Secretary of State is interested only in provision for 16 to 18-year-olds in schools and further education colleges, there will be no remit for the adult learning inspectorate. It will be pointless in such circumstances to ask for the chief inspector's advice, as Ofsted can do the inspection on its own.

<P>
It follows logically that amendment No. 251 is superfluous. There are no circumstances in which the chief inspector of the adult learning inspectorate needs a power to give independent advice. Either his advice is vital-in which case he has a duty to give it-or it is not needed at all because he has no remit. Amendment No. 238 is similarly unnecessary. There will usually be two parts to an area inspection: 16-to-18 education in schools and colleges, which is Ofsted's remit, and 16-to-18 work-based training, which is the remit of the new adult learning inspectorate. There is no overlap, and that will be perfectly plain and simple before the inspection begins. There is no need whatever for the rather complex iteration described in amendment No. 238.

<P>
I should add that I have just described how the law will work for the avoidance of doubt and dispute. In practice, as we have seen in the recent Hackney-Islington report, the inspectorates can handle co-operation, division of labour and the compilation of one joint report with consummate professionalism. The adult learning inspectorate will advise Ofsted, and Ofsted will advise the adult learning inspectorate. They will talk to each other and work together in harmony, using the common inspection framework.

<P>
Neither of the amendments would be helpful. Indeed, we believe that they would cause confusion. I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for those assurances. We hope for a sensible relationship between the two inspectorates, that they will regularly speak to each other and that, if necessary, one will read across to the other. I understand the Minister's diffidence in putting too much in the law. It is useful to have been given those assurances, which we shall study with considerable interest. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Amendment made: No. 202, in page 28, line 26, leave out ``person providing'' and insert ``provider of''.-[Mr. Wicks.]

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I rise briefly to respond to the Minister's rather churlish comments about Ofsted inspections of local learning skills council plans. It is a serious matter. At the moment, local education authorities are inspected by Ofsted. The school development plans provided to the Secretary of State by local authorities are inspected by Ofsted. Indeed, the services delivered by local authorities are inspected by Ofsted. It seems that organisations set up by the Secretary of State that are responsible directly to him, which is the case with the Learning and Skills Council and the local learning and skills councils, are beyond inspection. That is illogical.

<P>
In supporting the earlier amendment-I would like the Minister to reply in his usual sensible and calculated manner-I sought merely to ask who inspects the Learning and Skills Council. After all, the LSC will be spending 6 billion. Who will account for that expenditure?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The Learning and Skills Council is being established by the Government and by Parliament. That is what the Bill is all about. The LSC is ultimately accountable to the Secretary of State, who will issue guidance. The Secretary of State, of course, is accountable to Parliament. That is the line of accountability-and of inspection. It would be for the Select Committee to cross-examine the LSC about its work. We do not think it helpful for the LSC plans to be inspected by Ofsted. However, local provisions for which is is responsible and for which it provides funding, whether for modern apprenticeships, the school sixth-form or further education, will be properly inspected. That is the crucial point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): My hon. Friend has set out the lines of demarcation and responsibility fairly clearly. Will those plans subsequently be subject to audit by the National Audit Office?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> May I reflect on that? If I have not reflected sufficiently to give my hon. Friend an answer during this debate, I shall do so subsequently. The provision planned for and funded by the Learning and Skills Council is, of course, subject to inspection, whether by Ofsted, the adult learning inspectorate or, for an area inspection, both working together as appropriate. I understand the serious spirit in which the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough asked his question. In our judgment any confusion of roles, whereby Ofsted would in a sense be inspecting the LSC, would not be helpful. If would, of course, inspect the provision.

<P>
It is clearly important, in the context of action plans, that the right people should be consulted, if appropriate action is to be taken. I might well have inserted a similar provision in relation to publication, so that the right persons should be aware of it. That was perhaps an omission on my part. Amendment No. 240 would impose on the council or the local education authority a responsibility not only to consult the persons whom they had been directed to consult by the Secretary of State, but also to consider whether anyone else with an interest in the report should receive it. A conscious decision would be needed. It would not be possible to rely on the fact that the Secretary of State had sent a list of persons or institutions. It would be necessary to think about it, which would confer greater ownership of the process.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I agree that there might be some benefit in giving the council a duty to send copies of the action plan to any party it thought might be interested. However, I should be grateful for the opportunity to consider the amendment further. I do not think that I can accept it outright, because, whereas the subsection refers to a singular person, the amendment refers to ``them''. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will therefore withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In the light of those assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`after consulting the Chief Inspector of Adult Learning'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I anticipate the Minister's answer, because it has already been explained that a remit is a remit, and that a chief inspector advises on matters that fall within it, but not otherwise. My real aim in moving the amendment is to reinforce the point that, if there is to be a common framework of inspection and common interests, even if the remits in a particular case are discrete, it is sensible for the two inspectors to talk to one another. That is the thrust of what I propose.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I have a lot of sympathy with the impetus behind the amendment, but it would fetter the discretion of the chief inspector to advise the Secretary of State, because he could do so only after consulting the chief inspector of adult learning. The amendment is not compatible with the autonomy and independence of the inspectorates.

<P>
I have no doubt that the chief inspector will frequently consult the chief inspector of the adult learning inspectorate when he is using his power to give written advice. I do not think that he will do so in every case or that he should have to do so. For example, if the chief inspector wishes to give specific advice on a problem at a sixth form college whose students are all aged from 16 to 18, which has been inspected by Ofsted but which the adult learning inspectorate had never visited, why should the adult learning inspectorate be consulted? The advice referred to in the clause might be either written or oral. The Secretary of State should and will meet the chief inspector from time to time. Surely we do not want the chief inspector to be obliged in the middle of a conversation to say ``I am sorry, Secretary of State. I was minded to offer you some advice on that point but, under the law, I cannot do so until I have consulted the chief inspector of the adult learning inspectorate.'' Clearly, that is not a practical or sensible approach, and I am sure that it was not in the mind of the hon. Member for Daventry when he tabled the amendment. However, it would be one of the amendment's effects.

<P>
I expect the same freedom to apply to the chief inspector of the adult learning inspectorate. He or she will no doubt frequently consult Ofsted when he or she decides to give advice to the Secretary of State, but there should be no obligation to do so.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will ask leave to withdraw the amendment in the light of my explanation.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
As we move towards the end of chapter III, it is at least remarkable that the common inspection framework is embraced within three clauses and has attracted relatively few amendments, even though there has been a good deal of prior comment about how it should work. I do not need to add to the earlier exchanges about that. I sensed as I drafted the amendment and looked across to clause 68 that it was probably redundant. However, I am anxious to ensure that not only the first framework but any subsequent one is subject to proper and full consultation. If there are to be changes and a framework mark 2 is to be established, it will undoubtedly be formulated in the light of experience. Although we hope that this will not happen, some changes in the framework may become necessary because of problems in practice. It is, therefore, all the more important that the changes are absolutely right and have, as far as possible, the ownership of all parties involved. It is in that spirit that I tender the amendment and await the Under-Secretary's assurances.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The hon. Member for Daventry has correctly anticipated my response. We share his wish, but we believe that the amendment is unnecessary because clause 68(7) already achieves the same effect. Its purpose is to require the inspectorate to consult publicly when it decides to amend the framework in the same way as it did when the framework was formulated. I hope that that addresses the hon. Gentleman's concerns about any framework mark 2.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
Again, we all hope for smoothness in the relationship between the two chief inspectors. The amendment would bear on a specific situation when there had been friction between them. It would deal with a situation in which the draft framework was in preparation and there was a disagreement between the two chief inspectors, who went to the Secretary of State and told him that they were unable to agree and that they awaited his direction. That would be a serious situation, especially given that professional persons would be engaged in the matter, as the Minister said. It would suggest a radical difference in views of what was required.

<P>
I am not advising Ministers to wash dirty linen in public over their dealings with professional persons, although it is sometimes in the Opposition's interest if they do. The Secretary of State would have to make a judgment of Solomon between two great persons who could not agree. If there were such a serious situation and the Secretary of State was required to make a quasi-judicial judgment on whose view should prevail, the rest of the world would be entitled to know that a problem had arisen and that he had resolved as he or she best saw fit.

<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. However, the need for the Secretary of State to make a direction in the circumstances described in clause 68 is unlikely. My colleageus and I have received firm assuracnes from the existing inspectorates that they cannot envisage circumstances in which the difference between the two chief inspectors was such that the Secretary of State would need to intervene. The provision is one of last resort. Were a Secretary of State to make a direction under the clause, for whatever reason, it might be possible to publish the details of the direction. To do so where possible would be entirely within the spirit of open government, which we fully wish to promote. I say that even though it is not the convention throughout Government to publish the terms of any direction.

<P>
There is, nevertheless, one overriding argument against the amendment. The Secretary of State might be willing to publish a direction on some occasions but should not be obliged to do so in every instance. He might wish to publish a direction because it raised an interesting point of policy or principle that the wider public, and certainly the House, would want to consider. That will not always be the case. The Secretary of State might judge that the disagreement between the two chief inspectors was such that it would damage the inspection system were the direction to be made public. Public confidence in one or both of the inspectorates might be undermined. I would not want there to be a risk of that happening. For that reason and given my assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I had anticipated the Minister's response. He was a little more conciliatory and understanding than I had expected because he conceded that, in a last resort, it might make good sense and might contribute to open government were the Secretary of State to come clean on what the situation had been. I understood and am sensitive to the Minister's point about the possibility of damage to the interests of the inspectorates were such a matter to become public knowledge. That the two inspectorates had been at odds would still become known, I suspect, but in an unregulated, partial and perhaps less well-managed way.

<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for his assurances, but it does not seem outwith the wit of man to reconsider the point and to provide that there should be a presumption to publish unless the Secretary of State has considered the grounds and found an overriding reason of public policy why he should not do so. The Minister will be familiar with provisions under the Freedom of Information Bill. I am not seeking to press the amendment, but should like the Minister to reflect further on the matter. Given that he has gone some way to meeting our concerns, I should like him to consider whether it would be possible to include the proposals in an amendment with which he would be comfortable and which would meet the concerns that he has rightly expressed about good order and the morale of the individuals involved. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 244, in page 31, line 12, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and for the division of any responsibilities for the preparation and publication of such a report among the parties conducting the report'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This is a small but substantive amendment. It relates to the issue of defamation, which also concerns my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster. Although different people will be involved in different aspects of the joint inspection, there will be a single report. Who will be responsible for statements in the report that are defamatory or-I think this is most unlikely-motivated by malice? I have no doubt that the inspectors and their staff will act professionally, but someone has to take on that responsibility.

<P>
The Minister will be aware of the well known military maxim that it is best to attack an opponent at the point where two commands join. He might also be aware of that exemplary training manual for all officials-the life and works of Sir Humphrey Appleby. In one famous incident, a dreadful parliamentary accident was about to cause grave embarrassment to Ministers. It was decided that it would be timed to coincide with when the Prime Minister was out of the country and the acting Prime Minister was responsible for administration. The idea was that the Opposition would not be able to determine the audit trail or decide whom to blame. I mention that jocularly, but it is a serious point. If people make statements in reports, we need to know who will stand by them if push comes to shove at law.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The hon. Gentleman wants to amend clause 69(2). It lists the different issues that the regulations on joint inspection can cover. Subsection (2) provides the statutory basis for that important set of regulations. The amendment relates to the statutory basis for regulations that govern a joint inspection report. The hon. Gentleman wants to ensure that secondary legislation covers the bits of the report that each inspectorate writes. The amendment is unnecessary. Clause 69(2)(f) is broad enough to allow the Secretary of State to prescribe how the report should be prepared. It would be inappropriate to tack on to clause 68 technical details of joint inspection reports that are part of clause 69.

<P>
We have been able to rely on the good sense of the existing inspectorates to decide how best the tackle the issue. That augurs well for the future. In policy discussions with my Department, the inspectorates have explained in some detail how they envisage the preparation of joint inspection reports. They think-I am sure they are correct-that a joint inspection report
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>must reflect the collective judgments of the inspectors who conducted the joint inspection.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The details of individual parts of the joint report will reflect the observations of the two inspectorates, which will work separately according to their remits, but their approach implies that a collective team judgment will produce an overview of the college's provision.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman may know that the provisions for delegated powers in clause 69(2)(f) have received the approval of the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee in another place. Indeed, the Government submitted illustrative regulations with an explanation of the powers, and paragraph 6.3 relied on the form of words that I have outlined. In addition, and in accordance with usual practice, we shall consult widely on the draft text of clause 69 regulations, probably in the autumn.
