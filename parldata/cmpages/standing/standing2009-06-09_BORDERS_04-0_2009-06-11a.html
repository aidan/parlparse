<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000299"></a>The

convenient to discuss amendment 44, in
clause 39, page 29, line 9, after
&#145;person&#146;, insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;who came to
the UK under the Highly Skilled Migrants
Programme&#146;.</div><a name="09061172000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061172000300"></a><b class="B">Gwyn
Prosser</b> (Dover) (Lab): Before we adjourned, we were
talking about what I described as the intrinsic unfairness of using
legislation and rule changes retrospectively, particularly when it
affects individuals&#146; real lives. We were discussing the text on
the back of work cards and whether it gave people, no matter what
category they came under, reasonable expectation&#151;not expectation
of a natural, God-given right to indefinite leave to remain or to
citizenship, but whether the spirit of the text led them to believe
that they would be able to do so.</div>
<a name="09061172000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">One issue
that we did not touch on was that of a spouse joining their partner. On
the website and in letters from the Home Office, there are clear
statements that a person is entitled to apply for ILR if they are still
in the country after two years. The phrase &#147;apply for
ILR&#148; is used, and experience shows us that that would be the
case in most instances. It is pretty far-fetched to believe that there
is no expectation that spouses or partners would be unable to remain.
Similarly on the website, there is a phrase that says in effect that,
if a person is still married when their temporary period to remain
expires, they are entitled to apply to remain in the
country.</div><a name="09061172000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not detain the Committee any longer except to say that we do our
best not to apply laws and rules retrospectively. I do not want to
introduce a sour note, but let us imagine that the new rules that the
House is now considering with regard to MPs&#146; allowances and
expenses were applied retrospectively. It would give us all a great
deal to think about.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div><a name="09061172000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000301"></a>The
Minister for Borders and Immigration (Mr. Phil
Woolas):</b> It is good to be starting the debate so soon
after lunch, under these new modern hours. I am not sure why I voted
for them, but I can see the point of view of the Minister at the
time.</div>
<a name="09061172000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will try to
be helpful and answer the questions on specific points, and then
explain the approach we are taking. Before I do that, it is incumbent
on me to bring it to your attention, Sir Nicholas, and that of members
of the Committee that I have placed an updated impact assessment of the
Bill in the Vote Office this afternoon. Quite rightly, it is the
Government&#146;s obligation to give the House information that is as
up-to-date as possible. There are some revised figures in the
Government&#146;s estimate of the implication of the Bill for
benefits and I draw that to the attention of the Committee out of
courtesy. Members will want to be aware of
it.</div><a name="09061172000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">The
Chairman:</b> Order. Seeking to be helpful to the Committee, may I ask
the Minister whether there is a copy of the document in the
room?</div><a name="09061172000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Mr.
Woolas:</b> One copy is in the room because I have it. I will make
arrangements for others to be sent. I am trying to be helpful. There is
no substantial policy change in the document; there are some up-to-date
figures that will inform the House on Report. We will put some reports
on the
table.</div><a name="09061172000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall try to answer some of the specific questions that were asked in
what has been an interesting and important debate on the amendments. I
shall choose my words carefully because others outside the room will
read and interpret them. I shall answer the general principle points
raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dover, but the key point is
about work permit conditions. It has been tested in the court, as I
said before, under the Ooi case. Mr. Ooi was a gentleman of
Chinese citizenship. It was stated that a condition of the work permit
was that the person could, within four years, apply for leave to
remain. The court, in line with our policy, found that was not an
explicit and unequivocal representation creating a legitimate
expectation. My hon. Friend was talking about the expectation of
applying, not the expectation of necessarily receiving. It is an
important point, because there is a clear difference between temporary
admission for a purpose and indefinite leave to
remain.</div><a name="09061172000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Ashford helpfully read out the letter from Lord Brett,
following the debate in the Lords. It duplicated the comments the noble
Lord had made in the Lords about clause 37. The critical change between
what was reported at column 541 of House of Lords <i class="I">Hansard </i>of 2
March 2009 and the subsequent letter was the point relating to migrants
with ILR when the earned citizenship clauses under the Bill are
commenced. They will be able to apply to naturalise under existing
section 6 and schedule 1 of the British Nationality Act
1981, provided that they apply within a set period after the clauses
have been commenced. Lord Brett said that, although we have not yet
confirmed the period, it is likely to be for 18 months after the
clauses are
commenced.</div><a name="09061172000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following
the debate in the Lords, I looked at that point and made the suggested
change to 24 months not 18 months. The hon. Member for Ashford read out
a reference to 24 months. My suggestion is dependent, of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div>course, on the House agreeing a commencement date of December next year.
That would meet the specific point that has been
made.</div><a name="09061172000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
come now to the more general points. The hon. Member for Ashford
referred to policy and what we were trying to achieve. He made an
important statement in respect of Conservative policy. I think that he
said it was desirable, and that he agreed with the Government, that the
indefinite leave to remain concept should move on, and that we should
have a system of temporary leave to remain and moving into citizenship.
He is right to suggest that&#151;perhaps for reasons of dual
citizenship&#151;people might not want to have to choose. That is
recognised, but it is important that people note the statement that has
been
made.</div><a name="09061172000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for what we are trying to do, our policy is aimed at helping the
migrant who wishes to become a citizen of our country to integrate, to
better understand our society and the specific community and to better
be able to contribute. That is based on the belief that migrants want
to contribute and that we should provide a route for them to do that.
One can see earned citizenship in a punitive sense as a hurdle that has
been put in front of people or as a platform on which to help people
build a life. We believe that it is right&#151;I welcome the
consensus on this point&#151;that those who wish to become citizens
of our country should have an adherence to the commitment to the rule
of law and to the English language, and an understanding of our
democratic system. During the debate we shall look at how we can define
that. The strategy is to try to break the automatic link that is in
many people&#146;s minds, and in some cases in statute, between
temporary stay and automatic right to citizenship, and to help the
migrant to integrate.</div>
<a name="09061172000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061172000302"></a><b class="B">Paul
Rowen</b> (Rochdale) (LD): Does the Minister not accept that
the link already exists? Indefinite leave to remain does not grant one
British citizenship. What the Bill seeks to do&#151;in the parts and
sections that we support&#151;is to provide a much clearer route to
what has to be done for British citizenship. But the change that is
being proposed will make the route longer&#151;the point the hon.
Member for Dover was making. Under certain categories, someone marrying
a British citizen and coming to live in this country will be faced with
a longer time period. One can accept the principle of a route, but for
those who are already on the route, why should the time to complete it
be lengthened?</div>
<a name="09061172000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000303"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I shall
come to the transitional arrangements, but putting them to one side for
a moment, I believe that the purpose of the changes has the consensus
of the Committee. What the hon. Gentleman says is quite right. I know
that he agrees with the other side of that coin, which is that we have
created in this country a category of people who have indefinite leave
to remain that has no end point, necessarily, at citizenship or
otherwise. That is what the provision is
addressing.</div><a name="09061172000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
let me turn to the meat of the amendments and the clause, and try to
help the Committee find a way forward. The point has been made on both
sides of the House that we should not move the goal posts and that it
is unfair to legislate retrospectively. Where that expectation is
legitimate, I absolutely concur with that point of view. Indeed, the
debate in the Lords and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div>lobbying by individuals and Members of Parliament caused me to look at
the practical implications of our proposals and alerted me to a
potential gap in one or two areas. In particular, I have been in
correspondence with a young lady from Croydon. By highlighting her
circumstances she convinced me of the case.</div>
<a name="09061172000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">We accepted
the judgment on the highly skilled migrant programme. The
Government&#146;s intention was not to punish, but to create a new
system. However, the point was made in the court&#151;the hon. Member
for Rochdale quoted from the judgment in this morning&#146;s
sitting&#151;and we have put it right. There is not necessarily a
read-across to other temporary routes, but there is a principle
connection. My hon. Friend the Member for Dover, who knows more about
these things than most, made that point as
well.</div><a name="09061172000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
rights of people who have already been granted ILR will not be
affected. The question is: how do we deal with the transition? It is a
difficult and complicated question, which is why I suggested to the
Committee this morning that, in light of clause 39 being inserted in
the other place, and in light of the deliberations, we wish to ask the
Committee to reject clause 39 stand part and take out the clause, and
the amendments if they are accepted, with the commitment that we will
come back with further transitional arrangement proposals. That does
not mean that the Government are confused&#151;we have clear
proposals&#151;but it does mean that I want to look at them afresh,
particularly at the routes that I shall now
explain.</div><a name="09061172000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061172000304"></a><b class="B">Damian
Green</b> (Ashford) (Con): The Minister says that he is about
to explain the substance of his new proposals and that he will come
back to them at a later stage. It would be regrettable if the House
could not discuss the new proposals. Can he give a commitment that they
will come back in a form that can be discussed by the House as well as
in another
place?</div><a name="09061172000270"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15pm</div><a name="09061172000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000305"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. I can give that
commitment. As this clause has been inserted in the other place, it has
to go back there and, if we send it back, it has to return to us
anyway. Even if it did not come back, I would want that to be so,
because I want the Government&#146;s intention to be understood, for
the reasons given by my hon. Friend the Member for Dover and by the
Members for Rochdale and for Ashford. This is important; we are talking
about people&#146;s lives and their contributions to our
country.</div><a name="09061172000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have already said, clause 39 was inserted following the debate on
Report in the House of Lords. I have already quoted from that clause,
which intends to set out how the earned citizen provisions impact on
certain groups of migrants. The effect of that is to set down
transitional arrangements that the Government should apply, the clause
argues, when the earned citizenship provisions are
implemented.</div><a name="09061172000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Third Reading, my noble Friend Lord Brett made it clear, on behalf of
the Government, that we would return to this issue. The Government
understand that the intention behind the clause is to allow migrants in
three main groups to be able to apply for British citizenship under the
existing naturalisation requirements in section 6 and schedule 1 of the
British Nationality Act 1981, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div>rather than under the new earned citizenship requirements proposed in
the Bill. The Government consider that it is not appropriate to set out
details of transitional arrangements in the Bill and I will explain
why. Rather, such arrangements should be in the commencement order that
would give effect to part 2 of the Bill. That is the right thing to do,
given the level of detail needed to be set down. In addition, the
clause as currently drafted, does not achieve its intended aims, which
means that, even if had not reconsidered the categories, we would ask
the Committee to object to the clause in its own interests, as it were.
Ministers often make that
point.</div><a name="09061172000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me deal with some of the detail. When the clause was debated in the
other place, the Government indicated that we would return to this
matter. Committee members will no doubt have noticed that we tabled an
amendment in my name to remove the clause from the Bill. We have
previously argued that there is no reason why transitional arrangements
need to be set out in the Bill. I have outlined my reasons for that,
which remain valid. There is a good argument for the commencement order
giving effect to part 2 of the Bill being the proper place to set out
transitional arrangements. The provisions need to be detailed and will
be relevant only for a certain period. Setting out the provisions in a
commencement order also gives us scope to update them, should the need
arise. However, there are concerns about our intentions. I understand
the desire for clarity and certainty that has been mentioned by hon.
Members and constituents in recent weeks. Our intention is and has
always been to make transitional arrangements that are fair and
reasonable, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dover
said.</div><a name="09061172000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just
to reassure Committee members that I mean what I say and say what I
mean, it is my duty as Minister to make Public Bill Committees aware of
technical deficiencies, where I have been advised to do so by
parliamentary counsel and my officials. Part 2 of the Bill is concerned
solely with the acquisition of British citizenship and it cannot in
itself affect applications for indefinite leave to remain. The hon.
Member for Rochdale made that point and I am just emphasising it. The
Bill is about citizenship and it cannot affect applications for
indefinite leave to remain, which are made at an earlier stage in the
process and are decided under immigration rules. I am asking the
Committee to recognise that point by removing the
clause.</div><a name="09061172000042"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000306"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I accept the Minister&#146;s point, but the
argument is not about those who have indefinite leave to remain, but
about spouses who have been given temporary leave to remain for two
years and have an expectation that, at the end of those two years, they
will be able to apply for leave to remain. If he can assure us that
that expectation is not going to be affected, I will have no problem
with what he
proposes.</div><a name="09061172000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000307"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman will, I am sure, be satisfied
in a moment. Let me set out the Government&#146;s proposed
transitional arrangements for migrants who have completed the temporary
stage of their journey at the point of the legislation&#146;s
commencement.</div>
<a name="09061172000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
arrangements broadly reflect the intention behind 39(b). First, any
application for naturalisation that is received by the UK Border Agency
before the earned 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div>citizenship provisions are implemented, and which remains undecided at
that point, will be considered under the existing arrangements set out
in the British Nationality Act 1981.</div>
<a name="09061172000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
migrants with pending applications for ILR that have been submitted,
but not decided, before the immigration rules are changed, following
the commencement of the earned citizenship provisions, will have their
applications considered under the existing rules. Members will know
that that is often a point in immigration
law.</div>
<a name="09061172000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000308"></a>Damian
Green:</b> My memory of the ILR application laws, off the top
of my head, is that people are all but forbidden from applying until
they are within 28 days of the end of their temporary leave to remain.
Indeed, they are told specifically that an application made before that
period may well be turned down, or something like that. It sounds as
though this concession will affect a very small number of
people.</div>
<a name="09061172000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000309"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> This measure is a building block in the
transitional arrangements, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will let
me outline the other building blocks, and we can then see whether his
point is
made.</div><a name="09061172000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
applicants will have two years from the date of commencement to apply
for citizenship under the existing
arrangements.</div><a name="09061172000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Migrants
who already have ILR will be deemed to have permanent residence leave,
as is made clear in clause 50(3). Again, those migrants will have two
years from the date of commencement to apply for citizenship under the
existing naturalisation arrangements.</div>
<a name="09061172000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concerns have
been expressed about the position of those who are nearing the end of
their temporary leave and who, under the current rules, would be
eligible to apply for ILR. Clause 39(a) attempts to address those
concerns. I assure hon. Members that we have given, and continue to
give, thought to the transitional arrangements for that group. Our
dilemma is how to devise arrangements that are rational, proportional
and reasonable, but that also minimise the operational complexity and
costliness of running two systems concurrently. We do not believe that
migrants, as a matter of course, have a legitimate expectation that we
will not change our policy. However, we would like to give the matter
further consideration and return to it at a later stage.</div>
<a name="09061172000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 43
and 44 would narrow the clause&#146;s scope, as the hon. Member for
Rochdale has argued, although I am not sure that that is their aim. I
think they were meant to make specific points about the transitional
arrangements for the highly skilled migrant programme. They would apply
the transitional arrangements to a very limited group. People who were
here with another form of leave and then transferred to HSMP would not
be caught.</div>
<a name="09061172000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The courts
have ordered us to protect the position of certain HSMP migrants, and
if the amendments are intended to protect those groups, we agree with
their spirit. The High Court has held that all HSMP migrants who were
admitted before 7 November 2006 are entitled to the benefits of the
scheme, including eligibility for ILR after a qualifying period of four
years. If there are migrants for whom a legitimate expectation was
created 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div>by HSMP, who have not yet moved through the system, we will give effect
to the court&#146;s ruling and deal with their applications under the
current system.</div>
<a name="09061172000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Committee will accept our good intent on the HSMP route, and my
argument that there is not in all cases in the other routes a
legitimate expectation of ILR being granted but rather the right to
apply. My proposals on the timings for transitional arrangements for
the three routes through temporary leave&#151;particularly the hon.
Member for Rochdale&#146;s point on the spousal route&#151;will be
subject to the detailed proposals that we will bring back to the House
and the other place in order to meet the principle, although not
excepting automaticity, that has been expressed on both sides of the
House. I refer the Committee to the words quoted by the hon. Member for
Ashford from the letter that Lord Brett issued subsequent to the debate
in the other
place.</div><a name="09061172000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
transitional arrangements that we will put in place need to take on
board the tests of reasonableness and fairness without moving the
goalposts for the legitimate expectation of the person with temporary
leave. The intention of the person who has applied for temporary leave
is, of course, a different point that cannot be covered by
statute.</div><a name="09061172000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
that basis, and with the guarantee that I have made to the House, I ask
the Committee to consider turning down clause 39 if there is a vote so
that we can have a detailed look at the transitional arrangements. I
accept the spirit of the two amendments tabled by the hon. Member for
Ashford; in any event, we are applying through guidance the court
ruling on
HSMP.</div><a name="09061172000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000310"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> The Minister is being very generous with his time.
I accept the point that he is making, but I seek from him clarification
as to the intended timetable, given that protection is removed from the
Bill if we remove clause 39. Is the intention that regulations will be
published while the Bill is still making its passage through both
Houses? Will there be consultation on them so that we can produce
amendments if
necessary?</div><a name="09061172000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000311"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am choosing my words carefully to help the
Committee and not in any way to mislead it. It is my intention that
there shall be a new clause 39 or equivalent so that the House can
agree the principle. The regulations that flow from it would be
introduced after the Bill has completed its passage so that the House
can determine the principle and in order to meet my suggestion, which
has been the practice of Governments of all persuasions, to look at the
particulars through the commencement order and the
regulations.</div><a name="09061172000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difficulty is that in making transitional arrangements for people who
have ILR within a period of time, it is difficult to find comparisons
for ILR&#151;by definition, one could say that a transitional
arrangement could be here ever after. But, of course, we have to
provide reasonable expectation and fairness for the people who have ILR
now, and to ensure that the new system does not present greater
difficulties for them than would otherwise have been the case had the
system not been changed. I believe that that is the point that the hon.
Gentleman is making. I understand him, he and I being neighbours in
God&#146;s own county&#151;if I can put it that way.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I hope that I have explained
myself, and that I have not just lost the vote with that last phrase. I
prompted something, I know not what.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000313"></a>Mr.

understand the principle behind what the hon. Gentleman has said. I do
not believe in retrospective legislation, and I do not believe that
Members&#146; allowances should be changed during the course of a
Parliament. That is retrospective. Where there is retrospectivity, as
there is in a more liberal way in later clauses to do with children,
that is reasonable. However, I do not agree with it the other way
round. The Whip is urging me to get off the issue of Members&#146;
allowances and get on to public expenditure. I ask the Committee to
accept my point of

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000317"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I call the hon. Member for Ashford, I say
to the Committee that as far as I am concerned, the Minister has
replied to the debate on amendments 43 and 44. He has referred to a
certain amendment that I did not select, as I believed that it was more
appropriate for a stand part debate. However, he has explained his
position. Although I am happy to offer a stand part debate, if the
Committee wishes it, the Minister has clearly established his position
and, from his point of view, a stand part debate would be a repetition
of what he has already said. However, I am in the hands of the
Committee on this matter, and if it is the Committee&#146;s wish to
have a stand part debate, I am happy to permit one. I call the hon.
Member for Ashford to comment further on his
amendment.</div>
<a name="09061172000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000318"></a>Damian
Green:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas, I will respond to that. In
my view, we have given this matter a full airing. It is an extremely
important issue, but there is not necessarily much more to be gained
from a stand part debate. Presumably, the Minister has indicated that
he would like a vote on the clause stand part, as he wants to vote
against it. It is not for me to move the deletion of a clause from a
Bill. That would be an unusual constitutional innovation
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am happy to adopt it. We could
apply it to various clauses in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09061172000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000319"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. May I help the Committee further?
Clearly, one of my duties when we have finished debating the amendments
is to put the question that the clause stand part of the Bill. If there
is a negative answer, the clause does not stand part of the Bill. That
is pretty clear.</div>
<a name="09061172000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000320"></a>Damian
Green:</b> It is extremely lucid and clear, Sir Nicholas. The
Minister has made a potentially important concession&#151;I think
that that is how he described it. He has clearly listened to the wave
of outrage that has come 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div>not only from another place but from many bodies and individuals outside
this place. He has given the Committee an assurance that he will come
back with something better and more acceptable in the future. We accept
that his assurance is made in good faith.</div>
<a name="09061172000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to check with the Minister that the principles on which his new clause
will be adopted are first, that there is a significant difference
between temporary and indefinite leave to remain, and that that
distinction will remain. Secondly, does he agree that those who have
come here under the highly skilled migrants programme are, partly
because of the legal situation, in a different position to those who
have come by other routes? However&#151;this is a very important
point&#151;those distinctions should not necessarily apply to those
who have already been in the country for some time, even with temporary
leave to remain, and who have a reasonable expectation that they were
on a path to citizenship.</div>
<a name="09061172000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of my amendment, and of those moved by my noble Friends in another
place, was to say that those who are coming to the end of a period of
temporary leave to remain will have developed that reasonable
expectation. They in particular deserve the protection of the House
against what they see&#151;not unreasonably&#151;as retrospective
legislation. I agree with the Minister that the principle of
retrospection is normally bad in legislation.</div>
<a name="09061172000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am trying
to draw out the distinctions, because I think they are important. As
the Minister has said, the Government will propose a new clause, but it
sounds likely that the regulations, which will inevitably contain
important details, will not be seen by either House until the clause
has been passed. By that time, of course, if we discover that the
regulations make the provision unacceptable, it will be too late, so to
some extent we are being asked to buy a pig in a poke. Will he
establish the principles as clearly as possible, so that we can return
to the matter in later debate? In the expectation that the Minister
will be able to satisfy the Committee on those points, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061172000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<a name="09061172000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000321"></a>Damian
Green:</b> I want to ask the Minister some brief questions
about clause 40, which deals with the application requirements for
citizenship. I shall focus on the categories of people to which the
requirements will apply.</div>
<a name="09061172000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
subsection (11), in order to qualify toward naturalisation, the time
spent in this country has to be spent while resident on a certain type
of visa or entitlement, including ILR, Commonwealth right of abode or
European economic area entitlement. Time spent in the UK on a visa that
is limited as to duration will count only if leave is granted for a
purpose set out in the rules made by the Secretary of State, so it is
impossible to know to which categories of people they will apply. There
may well be large numbers of people on certain visas who do not fall
within the category. I hope that the Minister can clear up who and how
many people will be affected.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 104</div><a name="09061172000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 40 also
introduces amendments to the number of days that a person applying for
naturalisation will have to have been present in the UK for each year
of their qualifying period. As things stand, a person intending to
qualify for citizenship can be absent from the UK for up to 540 days
during their qualifying period and for no more than 90 days during the
final year of the period. Barring the final year of qualification,
there are no limits on the duration and timing of other absences, so
the person seeking to qualify for citizenship can spend time away from
the UK as and when they need or wish, within the
limit.</div><a name="09061172000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
40 seeks to impose stricter rules on absence by requiring that a person
must not be absent from the UK for longer than 90 days in each
qualifying year. In practice, that might mean that a person who
consistently remained in the UK for the first two years of their
qualifying period but was absent for more than 90 days in their third
year, perhaps as the result of a genuine family emergency or work
commitment, would thereby jeopardise their application for citizenship.
The change imposes a much heavier restriction on freedom of movement
and might unfairly discriminate, particularly against those who have a
family emergency. Can the Minister provide some explanation?</div>
<a name="09061172000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
also highlights the desirability of having the secondary legislation
flowing from clauses explained and made visible to the House while we
are considering the underlying clauses. The regulations flowing from
the clause might have dramatically adverse impacts on people. The
Minister may well have a perfectly good explanation, but at the moment
it is impossible for the Committee to take an intelligent view, because
we simply cannot know the facts. At the very least, I hope that the
Minister can provide some kind of explanation at this
stage.</div><a name="09061172000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061172000322"></a><b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): I want to raise a
number of points with the Minister. I know that he is assiduous and
will have noted that we tabled some amendments&#151;amendments 52, 49
and 50&#151;to the clause. He will have done his homework; he will
have the notes in front of him; and he will be able to respond to my
points.</div><a name="09061172000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first point is in relation to amendment 49. I shall read from an
Immigration Law Practitioners&#146; Association briefing, which has
helpfully been provided. Those who change their status but remain
legally in the UK will be knocked back as a result of the clause. That
is a matter of
concern:</div><a name="09061172000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
example a worker who ceased to work and did a full time degree (for
example a Masters of Business
Administration)&#148;</div><a name="09061172000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
then went back to their original status, would previously have been
able to aggregate the two periods as a contributory period, but now
they will no longer be able to do so. That is my understanding. An
explanation as to why that should be the case is required. If someone
is undertaking further studies, which eventually would be of benefit to
UK plc, it seems regrettable to penalise them for doing that. That is
one point that I hope the Minister can respond
to.</div><a name="09061172000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
point concerns the effect of the probationary citizenship stage on
refugees and those granted humanitarian protection. Might there be
circumstances in which it would not be appropriate for
refugees&#151;perhaps as a result of something that they have
experienced in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 105</div>their country of origin, or for whatever reason&#151;to undertake
voluntary work as part of their probationary citizenship period? Can
the Minister explain the extent to which flexibility will be provided
in such circumstances? We can all imagine a scenario in which someone
having to undertake that active citizenship role might not be
appropriate.</div><a name="09061172000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
query that I hope that the Minister can respond to concerns clarifying
the position on fees for refugees. My understanding is that refugees do
not currently have to pay fees, but if they want to achieve citizenship
at the earliest opportunity, they would seem be liable for some fairly
substantial fees. I suspect that refugees may be in the worst position
possible for settling such fees. I hope that the Minister can provide
some
clarification.</div><a name="09061172000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
final point has been referred to by the hon. Member for Ashford, which
is the question of an excess of 90 days. Our amendment 52 tried to
substitute what I believe is the current
arrangement.</div><a name="09061172000086"></a>

David Anderson</b> (Blaydon) (Lab): I assure you that I have
absolutely no intention of mentioning any amendments, starred or
otherwise, Sir
Nicholas.</div><a name="09061172000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
seek clarity from the Minister on clause 40(2)(e) and the meaning of
&#147;continuous employment&#148;, because there is a huge question
about the meaning of that phrase. A trade union asked me to ask this
specific question: what would happen to people who are working in a
workplace who are being harassed, bullied and exploited while they are
here on work permits? If they chose to walk away from exploitation
rather than remain in that employment, would they rule themselves out
of the opportunity to become naturalised citizens?</div>
<a name="09061172000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concern
is that there is only one legal definition of continuous employment. It
is spelt out in the Employment Rights Act 1996, which
states&#151;very clearly, for the law of this land&#151;that
continuous employment means employment with the same employer without a
break. Because there is no other definition in law, if people challenge
a decision to refuse naturalisation, the reality is that that
definition will be used. Is that the case? I understand that the
question was raised in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div>Lords, and that the Minister there said that in certain circumstances
individuals could change employers in occupation periods. If that is
the case, will the Minister expand on it?</div>
<a name="09061172000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">People are
concerned about when such a situation might come about. Some time ago,
the case of the cockle pickers in Morecambe bay led to the welcome
Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004. As recently as yesterday, however, a
10-minute Bill was introduced on the Floor of the House by my hon.
Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan),
which would update the 2004 Act to include construction workers,
because of the problems that such workers are facing. Many people who
come to work in construction in this country from abroad may, in the
long term, become eligible for naturalisation. They are the sort of
people we need&#151;as we said earlier, they are highly skilled
people&#151;and we want to attract them. We need to be clear that
they will not be exploited.</div>
<a name="09061172000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
lots of problems with temporary workers and the agency workers
directive, and people are in danger of being exploited in the real
world of work. I had some experience of that when I was a Unison trade
union official. A group of degree-level Filipino nurses were working
over here on a contract and living four to a room. They were being
charged transport charges for using a bike to ride to work. They were
under pressure because there was a bond on them: if they walked away
from their work, not only would they be liable to pay the money back in
this country, but they would be liable to pay the money back to
contractors back home. My union got them out of that workplace and got
them work in the health service, where they were treated properly. If
the Bill goes through as it stands, most people would not want to
choose the alternative that my union made possible for those nurses.
People could be forced to stay in such workplaces if they want to
become naturalised citizens. It is a real issue.</div>
<a name="09061172000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nobody is
unaware what is happening in the world now. There is massive
uncertainty because of the recession and there are questions about when
recovery will start. In the interval between the end of this
morning&#146;s Committee&#146;s sitting and the start of this
sitting, I spent three hours on the phone trying to deal with a case
that has developed in my constituency as a direct result of the closure
of Dairy Farmers of Britain. We are trying to stop the closure of a
dairy in my constituency. We know what the situation is, but we need to
be clear that we are doing everything we can to ensure we do not make
life even harder for people&#151;good hard-working people&#151;whom
we want to stay here. As a result of circumstances totally outside
their control, they might not be able to comply with the continuous
employment requirement.</div>
<a name="09061172000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Conservatives are committed to 10 per cent. cuts in public services.
Many of the people we are talking about&#151;skilled migrant
workers&#151;will be working in the health service, education and
local government. Their jobs will be under threat and they may well
fall outside this provision. Will the Minister please clarify what we
mean by &#147;continuous employment&#148; and calm my nerves? Let
us get this right and get it sorted.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000328"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Which do not exist.</div>
<a name="09061172000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me calm
the nerves of my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon. In answer to his
question, we have made it clear that to qualify for citizenship, those
here on the work routes&#151;in practice, tiers 1 and 2 of the
points-based system&#151;must show that they have contributed
economically and have paid taxes. If they do not meet those two
requirements, they will not normally qualify for citizenship and, would
therefore be required to leave the UK. However, the majority of people
here to work do precisely that. If they cease to be in employment, they
have ceased&#151;with the caveats&#151;to meet the key requirement
of their route and so should not be allowed to progress to citizenship.
I think we all agree that it would be unacceptable if migrants who have
come here specifically to work were allowed to qualify for citizenship
despite being economically inactive for long periods.</div>
<a name="09061172000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
continuous employment requirement is consistent with and underlines the
Government&#146;s clear policy that migrants who enter by the work
route are here to work and be economically active. However, let me
reassure the Committee on several important issues related to that
requirement.</div>
<a name="09061172000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
requires those who were granted probationary citizenship for the
purposes of taking employment to demonstrate only that they have
remained in continuous employment. We agree that the requirement that a
migrant on the work route must be in continuous employment should not
be interpreted rigidly. That is why there is discretion to waive that
requirement where appropriate. Continuous employment does not mean
employment with one employer; we are clear that people can meet the
requirement in the earned citizenship clauses if they change jobs, or
types of jobs, or self-employment during the qualifying period. That
will be set out in the guidance we publish on that
requirement.</div><a name="09061172000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall answer the more specific points raised in the other place about
domestic workers, even though my hon. Friend spoke more generally. The
Government are committed to the requirements set out for naturalisation
in the Bill, and the expectation is that migrants on the work route
must meet all of those requirements. Discretion should not be regarded
as a way to avoid the requirements. It is quite different from removing
the requirements for a person who has come here to remain in employment
continuously.</div><a name="09061172000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill includes a power for the Secretary of State to treat people as
meeting the continuous employment requirement even where that is not
literally the case. Our view is that we should mirror the time period
allowed under the points-based system for migrants to secure
alternative employment. In other words, we would consider applying
discretion where the total number of days of unemployment for the
duration of the probationary citizen period is 60 days or less. In some
circumstances, we would consider applications where the total is more
than 60.</div>
<a name="09061172000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not wish
to set out the list of those circumstances under which that discretion
should be applied, as I was tempted to do. That would be
counter-productive, because providing a fixed definition of discretion
would mean that&#151;by the very nature of its being fixed&#151;it
would cease to be discretionary. We do not want to exclude 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 108</div>scenarios that might arise. We are committed to considering each case
individually on its own merits, just as we are committed to upholding
that principle within the workings of the existing points-based system.
I believe that that provides a more transparent and fair basis on which
to use discretion.</div>
<a name="09061172000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary
of State would treat people who lost their jobs for a short period as
meeting the continuous employment requirement, even if that were not
literally the case. The 60-day period is consistent with the
points-based system period. To avoid the exploitation of that
loophole&#151;that is not quite the right word&#151;by those who
are not well intentioned, we wish to provide a clear framework based on
the 60 days, which is taken from our definition. That will provide for
discretion to meet the point that has been made. That is exemplified in
our response to the situation with domestic workers, where special
arrangements are in place to avoid exploitation that could take place
in any case, but which is more likely in an economic downturn. The rule
is strong, but it is not rigid, precisely because of the arguments that
my hon. Friend
made.</div><a name="09061172000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will respond to the other questions, again in reverse order. The hon.
Member for Carshalton and Wallington asked about continuous periods
interspersed with purposes other than the initial reason given for the
visa. Somebody who spends two periods in the UK with a qualifying
immigration status, and who in between is lawfully in the UK with an
immigration status that is not a qualifying one, can have the two
qualifying periods aggregated. The hon. Gentleman is nodding&#151;he
knows what I mean. For example, an applicant who entered under the work
route, stopped working after three years to commence a two-year period
of study and then resumed work, could count both periods spent as a
worker towards the qualifying
period.</div><a name="09061172000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have set out that only if migrants enter through one of the
three key routes&#151;work, protection and family&#151;can it lead
to naturalisation as a citizen. We made it clear that only time spent
in one of those routes is capable of counting towards the qualifying
period for naturalisation. If the period in the middle was spent as a
student, which was the hon. Gentleman&#146;s example, it would not
count because that is not a qualifying route. However, the work chunks
on either side could be aggregated. I hope that I have answered that
question.</div><a name="09061172000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was asked whether refugees have to pay fees to get citizenship. Like
everyone else, they have to pay. However, unlike other migrants on the
path to citizenship, they are not charged at other stages of the
process. In other words, when they have been given protection, they
become the same as other people on the route. By then, they would be
established in our
country.</div><a name="09061172000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Ashford asked which categories of people will have
qualifying immigration status. There are three main routes. The first
is the family route, which involves the family members of British
citizens. The second is the work route, which is made up of migrants on
tiers 1 and 2 of the points-based system, but not those on tiers 3, 4
or 5. The third is the protection route, which involves refugee status
or humanitarian protection, or discretionary leave. Another route is as
an EEA entrant; such people will retain the right to naturalise as a
British citizen, provided they meet the criteria.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div><a name="09061172000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also asked about periods of absence. He meant people going
abroad, rather than staying in the UK under another category. I do not
support, and I doubt that he does, the idea of an average calculation
of absences over the qualifying period. However, we will not examine
the requirement when the absences in the earlier part of the qualifying
period&#151;that is, at the entry into the probationary citizenship
stage&#151;have been examined already. I hope that he is following
my
logic.</div>
<a name="09061172000273"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="09061172000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
we are not concerned about absences from the UK before the start of the
qualifying period. Secondly, we want to avoid a system that
penalises&#151;for exceeding the time limit by a few
days&#151;those whom we might want to remain, or who might have
justifiable reasons for their absence. In other words, like my point
about continuous employment, we want to put some common sense into the
Bill&#151;I always try to do that in legislation, although it is not
always straightforward. In recognition of the need for flexibility, the
Bill provides discretion to allow the Secretary of State, or his
designated officials, to overlook a period of absences exceeding 90
days in a year in the special circumstances of a particular case. We
shall, of course, continue to expect migrants to justify large
absences, and in such cases we would expect the applicant to
demonstrate close links with the UK through length of residence, and
presence of home, family and estate in the UK. We would then consider
the reasons for an absence. The 90-day rule will apply, therefore, but
the discretion will enable the applicant to demonstrate a genuine
reason for an absence. That is better than making automatic
assumptions.</div><a name="09061172000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000329"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Before the Minister moves on to other
matters&#151;or, indeed, concludes&#151;may I return briefly to the
issue of refugees? Am I right in thinking that the citizenship
application costs are about &#163;700? Some refugees might suffer
from significant mental health issues&#151;perhaps as a result of
torture. Is there discretion within the system to allow those fees to
be
waived?</div><a name="09061172000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000330"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point,
but the answer is no. The citizenship fee applies at the point of
obtaining citizenship, by which time the refugee will no longer have
refugee or protected status. The circumstances that he mentions could
apply equally to those who have come through different routes and for
reasons beyond their control. So I do not accept his
argument&#151;well, he was not making an argument, but asking a
legitimate
question.</div><a name="09061172000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
40 ensures that the rights and benefits of British citizenship are
matched by responsibilities and contributions made to Britain. It does
so by creating a clear system to determine progress on the journey to
citizenship, a clear set of incentives for migrants to progress to
citizenship and a clear undertaking that citizenship should be earned.
To earn the right to progress between stages, migrants will be required
by the Bill, first, to meet English, or Welsh or Scottish&#151;I am
looking for help with pronunciation here&#151;&#147;Gar-lic&#148;
language requirements. [Hon. Members: &#147;Garlic?&#148;] I kid
you not, Sir Nicholas! I am quoting the hon. Member for Perth and North
Perthshire (Pete Wishart), who made this point on Second Reading. I
always thought that it was
&#147;Gay-lic&#148;.</div>

though. Why include Welsh and Scottish Gaelic, but then miss out the
Irish? There are four parts to this country. In Northern Ireland,
Gaelic&#151;or &#147;Gay-lic&#148;&#151;is also spoken
regularly. On an administrative point, the Government might like either
to include the Irish or take out the Scots and Welsh and simply refer
to
English.</div><a name="09061172000117"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000334"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am treading into areas about which I know
nothing. I accept hon. Members&#146; pronunciation&#151;I was
surprised when I heard the other
pronunciation.</div><a name="09061172000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Seriously,
however, there is a consensus on this matter. In 2001, when my right
hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr.
Blunkett) and I first made the suggestion, it was met with derision by
the commentating class, but now there is
consensus.</div><a name="09061172000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second requirement on migrants will be to contribute to the economy and
to pay tax, if they are economic migrants. Thirdly, and critically,
there is a requirement to obey the law so that criminal behaviour will
have certain consequences. In that sense, the word
&#147;probation&#148; is
right.</div><a name="09061172000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
requirement to undertake active citizenship is also included, and the
ability of the migrant to progress more quickly by meeting those active
citizenship criteria is a sensible change in policy. In my experience,
the vast majority of immigrants to our country want to get on. They
want to learn to speak English. They want to improve circumstances for
their families, and we want to help them to do so. The clause not only
helps the migrant, it helps to reassure the wider population that the
migrant wants to be in our country, wants to make a positive
contribution, wants to obey our laws and wants to learn our language.
In the long run that will change the relationship between the migrant
and the indigenous population in a wholly positive way. That is why I
am grateful for the support of the House for that
principle.</div><a name="09061172000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div><a name="09061172000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000337"></a>Damian
Green:</b> The Minister has just helpfully mentioned the
activity condition, which is clearly a central new idea that the
Government are introducing. The amendment is designed to probe some of
the details. At the moment there is a large black hole in the Bill as
to what is meant by activity condition. Even those who accept in
principle the argument that the Minister made in our most recent
debate, have a series of legitimate questions about how this activity
condition will be implemented in practice. Yet again, inevitably, the
details are not given and are left to be clarified in secondary
legislation, but as it is such a significant shift in this
country&#146;s attitude to immigration and immigrants, it is worth
the House knowing as much as it is possible to know at this
stage.</div><a name="09061172000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was grateful to receive an e-mail yesterday&#151;I am sure the whole
Committee received it&#151;about the document that had been made
available. I was slightly less thrilled when I discovered that the
document had been sitting in the Vote Office for 48 hours before the
e-mail went out. The Minister looks puzzled, but the document is dated
4
June&#151;</div><a name="09061172000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000338"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> It is an evolving
document.</div><a name="09061172000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000339"></a>Damian
Green:</b> It may be, but one of the amendments before us is
specifically addressed in the document. The document was not publicised
to any members of the Committee until after it was possible to table
amendments in time for them to be debated now. I do not think that was
an organisational triumph. We can deal quickly with amendment 44, which
seeks to say that the activity condition can be completed at any point
during an applicant&#146;s arrival in this country or the subsequent
probationary citizenship stage. On carefully reading the document, I
discovered that is the Government&#146;s thought too. I am pleased
that in that detail the Minister and I are thinking along the same
lines.</div><a name="09061172000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000340"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. May I try to be helpful? I think the hon.
Gentleman is referring to amendment 45, not 44. We are debating
amendment 45, with which it is possible to discuss amendment
46.</div><a name="09061172000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000341"></a>Damian
Green:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I meant to say amendment
46, not amendment 44. I knew that I wanted to refer to the second
amendment in the group. Amendment 46 is covered explicitly in the
document and, either by coincidence or some other happy event, the
Minister and I arrived at the same
conclusion.</div><a name="09061172000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will be aware that in another place, my noble Friend Lady
Hanham questioned Ministers carefully on the detail of the activity
scheme and condition. She was not satisfied that all the voluntary
sector&#146;s concerns had been properly considered, and thought that
the practical application of the scheme was still too vague. The
document addresses some of the practical issues, to which I shall turn
in a minute, because some of the suggestions are dubious and
others&#151;frankly&#151;even
worse.</div><a name="09061172000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
underlying problem is that the proposals for earned citizenship will
rapidly create fairly big bureaucracies, and the groups most affected
will be in the voluntary sector, which we all hope to support and we
all know is most vulnerable to bureaucracy. Small charities and
volunteering organisations are the least able to cope with onerous
bureaucracy. That would be extremely unfortunate for the voluntary
sector, which is keen to help and, by and large, wants more volunteers
and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>would like to serve many of the purposes for which the Minister argues
under the activity condition and earned citizenship. Nevertheless,
their lives will be a misery if the scheme produces too much
bureaucracy.</div><a name="09061172000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
of the underlying problems are summed up in five questions from
Volunteering England, which is part of the steering group, so I hope
that it is having a significant input to the Government&#146;s
thinking. I would like the Minister to respond to the five
questions.</div>
<a name="09061172000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, how
does the Minister expect organisations without the financial resources
to reimburse volunteers for travel and other out-of-pocket costs to
participate equally in the active citizenship scheme? That is a
reasonable and practical question. Secondly, many potential applicants
will have caring responsibilities and may not be able to rely on family
members for the care of children and other dependants. How will he
ensure that funds are made available to reimburse participants for
costs such as fees for child minding or respite care incurred while
fulfilling the requirements of the active citizenship scheme?</div>
<a name="09061172000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, does
the Minister agree with Volunteering England that every potential
applicant should have an equal opportunity to participate in the active
citizenship scheme, and what does he propose to do to support those
with extra needs linked to disability, or even straightforward lack of
literacy in English? Fourthly, a recent national survey on volunteer
management by the Institute for Volunteering Research shows that nearly
a third of organisations do not have the time or resources to cope with
more volunteers. That puts a gloss on the point I have just made that,
on the whole, the volunteering sector wants more volunteers, but a
third of the organisations cannot cope with more. How will the Minister
encourage organisations in that position to open up to new
opportunities? In particular, how are they supposed to spend time on
the verification arrangements for the active citizenship scheme? I
shall return to the verification arrangements, because they pose a
serious problem that must be
addressed.</div><a name="09061172000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
people have expressed considerable and legitimate fears as to what will
happen. There are those, including organisations such as Liberty, who
object in principle, saying that the scheme is discriminatory and
exploitative. At this stage, it will be useful for the Minister to
address that complaint, which I do not share. I can see how the scheme
might become discriminatory, but I do not think that it will be
discriminatory in principle. Clearly, however, if the Minister wants
overwhelming acceptance of the whole idea of earned citizenship, he
will have to take that argument head-on. The Minister looks slightly
puzzled. I will
explain.</div><a name="09061172000274"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="09061172000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are those who say that in principle, any earned citizenship scheme is
discriminatory and exploitative. While I have a small amount of
sympathy&#151;I can see how it might be&#151;I do not see any
reason why in principle it should be. As the Minister argues the case
for the new scheme, he will have to take on that particular
argument.</div><a name="09061172000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Associated
with that is the general point that whereas some migrants will find it
easy to contribute, and their lifestyle, skills, work and family
position make it fairly easy for them to take on extra voluntary work
for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div>number of hours that the Minister proposes, that will not be true of
others. At that point, it is quite hard to argue that it is not
discriminatory. The other point, which I think is valid, was made by
Liberty. It is unclear how the Government intend or expect to regulate
volunteering on that
scale.</div><a name="09061172000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
document, which I keep referring to, addresses the regulation. Let me
move on to it, because it gives rise to some of the most difficult
questions that the Minister has to answer if he believes that he will
create a good and practical scheme. The document states that the
Government</div><a name="09061172000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;place
the onus on the applicant to tell the truth about their &#145;active
citizenship&#146; with their citizenship application, but with a role
for a referee and a process to verify the bona fide status of the
organisation concerned...The referee would sign the
applicant&#146;s form to verify that the details given about their
active citizenship were correct. A referee would be defined as someone
in a supervisory capacity with personal knowledge of the
applicant&#146;s active
citizenship.&#148;</div><a name="09061172000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
far, it is a bit bureaucratic, but still acceptable. However, the next
suggestion is ridiculous.</div>
<a name="09061172000256"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whilst
the Design Group felt penalties should fall solely on the applicant the
Government&#146;s position is that there will also be penalties for
referees who act inappropriately as an additional safeguard. Under
Section 46 of the British Nationality Act 1981, someone who makes a
false or reckless statement for the purpose of procuring anything to be
done or not to be done under the Act can be sentenced to a term of
imprisonment of up to three months or a fine of up to &#163;5,000, or
both...Both applicants and referees would be subject to
sanction&#148;.</div><a name="09061172000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will try to persuade voluntary bodies and well-meaning people
all over this country to support the scheme. At the start of it, he
will make it compulsory for people to have referees, but he is also
saying that the referee will be laying themselves open to a fine of
&#163;5,000 and three months&#146; imprisonment if they themselves
are deceived by an applicant. I suggest gently to the Minister that
that cannot be a sensible way to start off&#151;it will not
work.</div><a name="09061172000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government Whip is shaking his head at me. I am reading word-for-word
from his own document that the Government placed in the Vote Office. He
can disagree with it, and indeed I hope that he does, because I
disagree with it. That is the burden of what I am saying. That does not
seem to be an extremely good way to design a new scheme. I hope the
Minister will mount an elegant retreat from it fairly
quickly.</div><a name="09061172000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also mentioned the regulatory regime that the Minister is proposing to
set up. The document makes the point that some 90 local authorities
currently operate a nationality checking service on a voluntary basis.
Those services check the details of citizenship applications&#151;for
a fee to the applicant&#151;and pass the applications to the UKBA
caseworkers in a state ready for immediate caseworking. The thinking of
the group is that</div>
<a name="09061172000257"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;our local
authority partners are uniquely placed to offer an accessible service
to applicants for British
citizenship&#148;.</div><a name="09061172000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again
that is arguable, but it seems to be a practical step
forward.</div>
<a name="09061172000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
document goes on to say:</div>
<a name="09061172000258"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whilst
the Design Group&#146;s preferred option was to make use of NCS as a
preferred provider, the Government&#146;s initial thinking is that we
should aspire to go further than this and make its use compulsory. The
Government&#146;s position is that ideally, all applications,
particularly those with an active citizenship element, would be
submitted through NCS enabling providers to use their local knowledge
to assess and verify evidence.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div><a name="09061172000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words, wrapped
up in all this wording is yet another duty on local authorities. As one
would expect, there is no suggestion that any extra funding will be
available for this service. The document suggests that local
authorities will have to provide this service compulsorily for
immigrants in their area, or that immigrants who do not have a local
authority that provides this service will not be able to use this
method, or that some other compulsion will be operated.</div>
<a name="09061172000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
the burden for this service will fall hugely disproportionately on a
small number of local authorities. We do not get an even distribution
across the country of long-term immigrants who wish to apply for
citizenship. Inevitably, many of the local authorities that will be
hardest hit by this extra burden will be those that are not the
wealthiest in the country. So I would advise the Minister that if this
idea is, as it is described, an &#147;aspiration&#148; of the
Government, they might wish to stop aspiring to it very quickly,
because it does not seem to be either a practical or a fair
aspiration.</div>
<a name="09061172000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not wish
to read out the whole document, because it is available. However, the
third point that I wish to make is about the activities involved: the
very basic things that people can do to prove that they are an active
citizen&#151;a worthy person to be granted the privilege of British
citizenship. The list of such activities bears some examination and
indeed it should be changed by the Minister. It starts off with things
that I suspect nobody would raise an eyebrow at. They
are:</div><a name="09061172000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;•
volunteering at the local hospital for example helping at a WRVS
shop</div><a name="09061172000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">•
volunteering at a health related community education
project</div><a name="09061172000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">•
volunteering at a local school for example to raise reading levels of
primary school
children&#148;.</div><a name="09061172000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, that last activity raises questions about Criminal Records
Bureau checks, as these people are people who, by definition, have
recently come from other countries and we know that CRB checks are much
more difficult to carry out on people who have recently arrived in this
country, and yet we are actively encouraging them to go to work in
schools. Has the Minister thought through the practicalities of that
suggestion?</div>
<a name="09061172000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
activities on the list that are still reasonably good
are:</div><a name="09061172000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;•
volunteering at a lunch club for the
elderly&#148;</div><a name="09061172000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div><a name="09061172000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;•
volunteering at a soup kitchen for homeless
people&#148;.</div><a name="09061172000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I question whether some of the activities lower on the list have been
fully thought through. They include:</div>
<a name="09061172000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;•
volunteering for a faith
organisation&#148;.</div><a name="09061172000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
that mean any &#147;faith organisation&#148;? Bodies can declare
themselves to be a &#147;faith organisation&#148;. Not all
self-styled &#147;faith organisations&#148; are necessarily places
where one would want to say, &#147;I have worked there for 15 hours
and therefore I qualify for a fast track to a British passport&#148;.
I put that suggestion to the Minister; he will know as well as I do the
sort of organisations that I am talking about.</div>
<a name="09061172000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The list also
suggests &#147;trade union activities&#148;. I am not sure that
several hours standing on a picket line should necessarily be a
qualification for a fast track to a British passport.

be controversial across the House.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000342"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Read the next one.</div>
<a name="09061172000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000343"></a>Damian
Green:</b> No, I shall read the one before, which
is:</div><a name="09061172000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;•
canvassing for a political party&#148;.</div>
<a name="09061172000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am happy to say that
we do not find it difficult at the moment to find people to canvass for
our party. I am conscious that, on the Government Benches, it may be
more difficult to find such people than it has been before. However,
the idea that people who, by definition, cannot have a vote because
they are not citizens yet should be specifically encouraged to engage
in some political activity for a party as a way of proving their
&#147;active citizenship&#148; gives rise to some quite significant
questions about how hard this list has been thought through. The
Minister is making a face that makes me think he considers that all
kinds of political activity in all circumstances are
good.</div><a name="09061172000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000344"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> The hon. Gentleman has prompted me to rise to my
feet, to ask him whether he thinks that delivering
&#147;Focus&#148; constitutes an active citizenship
activity.</div>
<a name="09061172000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000345"></a>Damian
Green:</b> It is so long since I have found anyone delivering
&#147;Focus&#148;<i class="I"> </i>that I cannot really comment. Seriously,
though, when people who have newly arrived in this country ask,
&#147;What should I do to get myself a British passport to become a
citizen?&#148; should we be telling them, &#147;We are the local
political party, why don&#146;t you deliver our leaflets?&#148;
This measure has not been thought
through.</div><a name="09061172000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000346"></a>Mr.
David Hamilton:</b> Surely the hon. Gentleman is not
encouraging people to get employment and then not join a trade union
that would protect their rights? Would he bring that in if he were
elected?</div><a name="09061172000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000347"></a>Damian
Green:</b> The hon. Gentleman gives rise to another
interesting point, in that this activity will only count if it is
unpaid. From the viewpoint of a strong trade unionist, which I guess
the hon. Gentleman is, it seems slightly perverse that a person is
allowed to work for a trade union, which will qualify them, but then
they must not get paid for it. Imagine the perversity of the situation:
jobs that could be done by people who are being paid are, instead,
being done by people who are unpaid, and the jobs are being done for
trade unions. My understanding of trade unions is that that is the
thing they hate most of all&#151;people doing unpaid labour
displacing people who would otherwise be doing paid labour. This Labour
Government are suggesting precisely that as a qualification. There is a
significant lack of coherence at the heart of this bit of the
proposal.</div>
<a name="09061172000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
clear what consultation has been had with the trade union movement
about this. I am perhaps less in tune with the motives and motivations
of the trade union movement than Labour Members, but even I feel that
this measure is a little perverse. A person can help the trade union as
long as they do not get paid. The moment that they are paid for their
work, it does not count as voluntary activity and does not count as a
qualifying activity for the purpose of active citizenship. I hope that
the Minister will fully explain the thinking that lies behind the
proposal.</div>
<a name="09061172000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
should like to note the extraordinary power that is to be provided to
the Secretary of State by the insertion of the proposed new subsection,
which will  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>allow the Secretary of State by regulation to amend the length of the
qualifying periods for citizenship. We had a long discussion earlier
today about the problems of quasi-retrospection&#151;of changing
things in ways that might be challenged by the courts, as they have
been under the highly skilled migrant programme. A huge power has been
slipped in here by which the Secretary of State can change the length
of time of the regulations. I am genuinely not sure whether that has
been slipped in in the hope that no one would notice. However, we have
noticed, and it seems to be quite a big power given the importance that
the Minister is placing on not just the length of time people have to
go through to qualify for citizenship but the fact that they can do
certain things that reduce that time. He is making it pretty easy for
the current or any future Secretary of State to change the conditions
under which the length of time can be set.</div>
<a name="09061172000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the
Minister can address that wide range of important issues, including the
type of activities that would count, the potential burden on the
voluntary sector&#151;specifically the fines for referees and the
amount of form-filling&#151;and the extra burden on local authorities
regarding the nationality checking service and the funding. It is
suggested that the migration impact fund would be used to fund some of
that activity. Up to now, Ministers have said that that fund is
available to local authorities that have been hard hit by unexpected
arrivals of immigrants. There is also the potential burden on
employers, because many of these people who will be doing this
voluntary work will be doing full-time work as well, particularly in
the current economic climate. What is suggested here is that employers
will be happy to give them time off to do their voluntary work.
Clearly, that will be easier for some employers than for others; it
will be easier for large employers than for small
employers.</div>
<a name="09061172000275"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="09061172000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
basic point that I am making&#151;I think the Minister will have got
it by now&#151;is that even if one accepts the argument for
encouraging people to integrate, making them feel that they have to
contribute something to the community and giving them a huge incentive
for those worthy activities in the form of two years off the period for
which they have to be here before becoming a British citizen, it is
absolutely a matter in which the devil is in the detail. So far, the
detail released suggests that the scheme has not been fully thought
through before being introduced into public policy. All experience
tells us that schemes introduced in that way and at that speed often
end up doing more harm than good. I hope that considerable thought is
given to the scheme before it translates into anything in the real
world.</div>
<a name="09061172000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000348"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I want to echo many of the queries raised in
relation to the amendments, and I will listen carefully to the
Minister&#146;s response. There are a couple of other queries that I
would like to put to him that I believe are pertinent to the
amendments, and I hope he can answer them as well.</div>
<a name="09061172000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree
entirely with the point about voluntary organisations. What greater
disincentive can there be to voluntary organisations than to know that
they will be subject to penalties, and possibly a term of imprisonment,
if they fail to account correctly for the volunteering activities of
people who join their organisation?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div><a name="09061172000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue of
CRB checks was raised. If the Government are going to push people down
that route, additional resources will clearly be needed in that area.
Like many other Members, I suspect, I regularly receive complaints
about the speed with which CRB checks are done. People are actively
prevented from securing employment because they are waiting for their
CRB check to come through. If we are going to be creating many more
requests for CRB checks, additional resources will be
needed.</div><a name="09061172000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
the Minister provide us with an estimate of the number of volunteers
that he thinks will seek voluntary activities each year after the Bill
has been passed? Has Volunteering England identified what demand for
volunteers it will be able to satisfy and what support those volunteers
will need in order to be able to volunteer? Also, has he heard any
representations about the difficulties, already highlighted in the
other place, of satisfying demand for places for volunteers,
particularly in rural areas? It is much easier in an urban area; there
are probably many more voluntary organisations, or at least many more
that are easily accessible, than in a rural area.</div>
<a name="09061172000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Instead of
raising the issue in a clause stand part debate, I will ask the
Minister one final question on volunteering for young people. I had an
amendment that I did not table in time and to which I therefore cannot
possibly refer, Sir Nicholas, but I understand that it would not have
achieved what we wanted it to even if I had. It would have sought
clarification from the Minister on whether children would be required
to undertake volunteering activities for their citizenship, and whether
that would place an undue burden on, for instance, children whose first
language is not English and who might be trying to combine studying
English with learning in their own language. They might, therefore,
have less time available to undertake active citizenship activities. I
hope the Minister will respond to those very specific
queries.</div>
<a name="09061172000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000349"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> We have put forward the document on the work of
the design group, to whom we are very grateful indeed. The background
to this is that in July 2008 we published a document entitled &#147;A
Path to Citizenship: next steps in reforming the immigration
system&#148;. I always like documents that say what is actually
inside them&#151;it is much better.</div>
<a name="09061172000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">We set out
our proposals in our response, to create the new path to citizenship.
The design group&#146;s document contains the work that it has done
so far. We set the group up last summer. It has representatives from
the voluntary sector, including Volunteering England, which was
referred to by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington. Local
government is represented as well. The group&#146;s remit was to
advise on the most effective way to operate the active citizenship
process in practice. We have now agreed a proposed model for
accrediting and verifying active citizenship, but I
emphasise&#151;and I do not think it is a weakness&#151;that we are
embarking on a very significant policy change. We are evolving and
consulting on it extensively. This is not on the face of the Bill and
one would not expect it to be&#151;to put it there would render it
inflexible.</div>
<a name="09061172000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would be
the last to say we are perfect, but let me try and answer some of the
specific points that have been raised so far. The idea of active
citizenship has  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>been around for some time. Its definition takes us into difficult areas.
I challenge anyone to put forward a set of proposals that would get
unanimity, perhaps even consensus&#151;certainly at first stab. I
hope the Committee recognises the common sense of what I am
saying.</div>
<a name="09061172000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">At its core,
I ask the Committee to consider the point that active citizenship and
what we are discussing here is a way in which probationary citizens can
speed up the time period for becoming a citizen. For migrants who have
come to the UK as a worker or a refugee and European nationals, the
default qualifying period for application for citizenship will be eight
years. For migrants who have come to the UK as the family member of a
UK citizen or someone with permanent residence here, the default
qualifying period will be five years. So none of these are requirements
for citizenship; they are a way of incentivising and speeding up
citizenship, and from the wider community&#146;s point of view are a
way of benefiting from that
application.</div><a name="09061172000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me turn to the specific answers to the questions. On the question about
children asked by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, an
application under section 6 of the British Nationality Act 1981 can
only be made by a person of full age. It is not envisaged that a child
would be able to do this programme. He asked about the number of
volunteers. Volunteering England has looked at that as well. We have,
on advice from the design group, assumed that there will be a
5 per cent. increase in volunteering among the migrant
population who are eligible for the probationary citizenship each year.
It is assumed that 4,000 migrants per year will undertake volunteering.
I confess to the Committee that that is a finger in the air. One has to
make working assumptions and have the ability to revise them as
policies roll out. That is why it is sensible not to put things in the
Bill. That is the best advice that we have.</div>
<a name="09061172000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000350"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Presumably the Minister is not saying that 5 per
cent. of people seeking citizenship will opt for active citizenship to
minimise the length of time before they are awarded
citizenship.</div>
<a name="09061172000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000351"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> This is the assumption that we have been working
on. It is the advice that we have. First, it is an increase in
volunteering; there is a substantial amount already. It is based on an
assumption of the number of applications, of course. Therefore, it is
assumed that 4,000 migrants a year, in addition to those who already
do, will undertake volunteering. The range of assumptions runs up to 10
per cent. but that is per year, so as time rolls on there will be more
people. I give that as information to the hon. Gentleman; I am not
suggesting that it is exact or a science. I refer him to the impact
assessment, which contains further analysis of those
figures.</div><a name="09061172000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000352"></a>Damian
Green:</b> The Minister has the exact guess, as it were, of
4,000. What proportion of each cohort are the Government assuming will
participate? Intuitively one feels it will be a very high figure. Has
that figure been
assessed?</div><a name="09061172000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000353"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Yes it has, but I do not know what it is. I am
being frank with the hon. Gentleman. The previous impact assessment
made reference to it.</div>
<a name="09061172000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
answer questions in random order. The hon. Gentleman asked about
resources for volunteering organisations. This was looked at. We
recognise that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>people and groups have expressed concern about this and the design group
looked at it for us. It worked with the voluntary sector and had
voluntary sector representation on the committee. There are
opportunities for funding to address any cost impact. The hon.
Gentleman mentioned the migration impact fund. There is no policy
decision on that; it is a suggestion from the design group. There is
also the European integration fund, which may be able to assist. There
is a concern that national bodies will receive a lot of requests for
funding, so clearly there is work to be done in this area. I am not
signalling that the migration impact fund will be used for other than
the purpose it has been set up for. The hon. Gentleman picked me up on
that point, as do the local authorities, for understandable
reasons.</div><a name="09061172000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
applicants with special needs, there is the flexibility in the system
to take into account special needs. The hon. Gentleman mentioned
disabled people and raised the important point about carers. It is not
policy that there should be any financial compensation for taking
part&#151;or remuneration, as he said on his trade union point. It
therefore is incumbent on the system, in fairness, to take into account
the fact that people have caring responsibilities. Without being too
rigid it is incumbent on me to point that out. We do not believe there
are any equality and human rights implications. We have looked at that
point, of course, not least because this is voluntary, not
compulsory.</div><a name="09061172000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked about the minimum time requirement. We considered
that point. Migrants will be able to demonstrate active citizenship at
any point of the route. That will allow them to plan activities in line
with work and family commitments. We are also looking at what the time
commitment should be for active citizenship. Again, does one want a
rigid number of hours a week or an average over a period of time? I do
not envisage people clocking in and clocking off in relation to
this.</div>
<a name="09061172000276"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="09061172000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Ashford made an important point, as did the hon. Member
for Carshalton and Wallington, about the critical passage at the
beginning of the document about whether there should be financial
penalties. The hon. Member for Ashford expressed amazement at that. I
sometimes think he lives in a different world from the one in which I
live. It is, undoubtedly, sadly the case that individuals will attempt
to exploit any new system. Not all voluntary organisations are what
they appear. Therefore, the challenge is to ensure that we get genuine
organisations to participate but that we do not create a cottage
industry of abuse and fraud, which could well
happen.</div><a name="09061172000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Recently,
there have been newspaper reports about exposed bogus colleges, which I
am proud to have brought to the public&#146;s attention and clamped
down on. I confess that that should have been done years ago by
Governments of both parties. That illustrates the type of problem with
which I am dealing. The fine, or the punishment, can only exist where
the person has intentionally and knowingly falsified. In relation to
the example that the hon. Gentleman gave, if the applicant misleads the
sponsor and the sponsor is inadvertently misled, of course, that would
be covered. He is right 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div>about that. I have very helpfully been handed something with the word
&#147;recklessly&#148; on it&#151;knowingly, intentionally or
recklessly are the criteria.</div>
<a name="09061172000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">A key
strength of the points-based system and this new system is that it puts
an obligation on the sponsor in the case of the points-based system.
That is a very effective tool in controlling visa overstayers. In this
case, an obligation will be put upon the referee to ensure that the
information is valid, so that we can avoid the circumstance whereby
some cowboy might sign a document in which he says, &#147;Yes, this
person has been volunteering in my community welfare advice
centre,&#148; when no such centre
exists.</div><a name="09061172000187"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000354"></a>Damian
Green:</b> I take the Minister&#146;s point. Of course, he
is right: any opportunity such as this will be an opportunity for
fraud. We have seen such things happen a lot in the past. However, in
these circumstances, I am not sure that I accept his point that one can
read across from sponsors, who gain a direct benefit from sponsoring an
immigrant, to referees. Although he might deter fraudulent referees
with these draconian penalties, they will also deter genuine potential
referees, particularly in relation to small charities or rural
areas&#151;as the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington
mentioned&#151;where there are lots of small charities. There is an
unpleasant combination of extra bureaucracy and extra risk that will
put off small charities. Members on the Government Benches are looking
shocked by
that.</div><a name="09061172000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
most important conversation I have had about the voluntary sector was
with the Connexions service in Kent, which said that many small
charities find it difficult to fill in its forms and as a result do not
get enough money, and that it had therefore set up an officer to teach
them how to fill in forms. As a prime example of how not to do
anything, that is ideal. In five years&#146; time, I do not want
Government bodies setting up and paying new officers so that they can
train small charities in how they can become effective referees for
people trying to earn citizenship. That is what I fear will
happen.</div><a name="09061172000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000355"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I give way to the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington on the same
point.</div><a name="09061172000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000356"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Voluntary organisations might want some reassurance
that the legal terminology of intentionally, recklessly and so on that
is used will ensure that they will not be put in a position where
perhaps the quality of the active participation&#151;the volunteering
activity&#151;is being challenged. I can think of examples&#151;I
am sure other Members can, too&#151;when work experience students
have come to us and, a couple of months later, we have received a
request to fill in a form saying that they did the job properly and
always turned up. Sometimes it is difficult to recall who they were and
whether they did, in fact, play an important role. Is that sort of
thing ever likely to be
challenged?</div><a name="09061172000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000357"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentlemen are raising a perpetual point
of public policy that all local and national authorities
face&#151;the balance between ensuring due probity in the voluntary
sector and not stifling it with burdensome bureaucracy. Getting that
balance right is the challenge; that is what the Office of the Third
Sector and the covenant address themselves to. In my constituency one 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>of my welfare groups complained that it was overcome with burdensome
forms; we released the burdens upon them and the organiser ran off with
the money. We have to get the balance
right.</div><a name="09061172000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
be fair to the design group, which we all want to be, the point about
the penalties refers to section 46 of the British Nationality Act 1981.
This is not a new principle being applied; it is an old one in new
circumstances. I take the point that is being made; this is why it is
right to scrutinise these things in
detail.</div><a name="09061172000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving
on to the duty on local authorities, the hon. Member for Ashford was
speaking against a potential new burden being placed on them. Around 80
local authorities have signed up to the nationality checking service.
There is an opportunity for local authorities: I would not over-egg it,
but this is a potential source of income. We envisage that some local
authorities will develop an expertise and may act on behalf of areas in
their proximity. We do not want to make it compulsory; we think that
would backfire. The local authorities are keen members of the design
group and there is no duty on
them.</div><a name="09061172000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000358"></a>Damian

want to make it compulsory. That contradicts what is in the

he want it to be compulsory or
not?</div><a name="09061172000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000361"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman is picking up on point 3 of the
document, I think. It should be compulsory for the applicant to
register through the nationality checking service, but not for the
local authority to provide that service. That is the question we are
looking at. I have raised further doubt in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
mind; he should read the paragraph at the
bottom.</div><a name="09061172000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000362"></a>Damian
Green:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="09061172000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000363"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Let me move quickly on. The proposals on local
authorities are being discussed. The views of the Committee are
important to that consideration, of
course.</div><a name="09061172000253"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Hon.
Members asked a number of other questions. The document lays out our
thinking on those. We are creating this structure so that active
citizenship can become real and meaningful in the United Kingdom. We
have laid out some of our ideas in the document. I think that trade
union activity is a legitimate part of active citizenship. Of course,
the trade unions are dependent on voluntary activity&#151;full-time
officials are paid for their work, but voluntary activity from the shop
floor is essential. I was interested in the debate about whether party
political activity should be considered a legitimate part of active
citizenship; a dividing line opened up on that issue. My view, which
will not count in the long run, is that we should encourage political
parties. We should encourage the idea that politics is part of
citizenship. Excluding it from the regulations would send the wrong
message; it would imply that participating in a political party does
not contribute to civic society. I would argue that my party helps
immensely and the hon. Gentleman&#146;s does damage, but I suppose he
would argue the
opposite.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div><a name="09061172000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000364"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> Is there not a possibility of some degree of
exploitation? Immigration provides a substantial amount of any
Member&#146;s case load. People will come to us on their route to
citizenship to seek our assistance when things have gone wrong in the
handling of their case by the Home Office. As with applications to get
children into faith schools, people will try to create circumstances to
advance their case for citizenship. One obvious way to do that is for
them to get their Member of Parliament to assist with their immigration
case and, at the same time, provide voluntary assistance to that Member
of Parliament&#146;s political party. I am afraid that the
opportunity for exploitation is all too
obvious.</div><a name="09061172000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000365"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Were such a Member of Parliament to knowingly and
intentionally, or recklessly, to sign a certificate, they would be
imprisoned
under&#151;</div><a name="09061172000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000366"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> That is not the point at all. How are Members of
Parliament meant to differentiate between those coming before them
seeking help, and those enthusiastically endorsing their political
party and all that they stand for and wanting to rush out and deliver
leaflets? That could be &#147;Focus&#148;, if that happens to be in
the constituency of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington,
&#147;In Touch&#148;, if it happens to be in Reigate, or whatever
passes for Labour propaganda
today.</div><a name="09061172000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000367"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I take the point. Such activity, whether it be for
a political party or one of the other bodies that have been referred
to&#151;or others referred to in the future&#151;would have to be
recognised as part of the scheme and be certified by the accrediting
body. It would not be a simple matter of self-certification. This is
the challenge that active citizenship puts before us. The hon. Member
for Ashford made a point about faith organisations. Defining a genuine
faith organisation is a challenge that the Charity Commission, local
authorities and others face all the time. Again, the proper
superstructure would have to be in place to ensure that things were
working.</div><a name="09061172000205"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000370"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I will give way once more, but I am conscious that
we are talking about the design group&#146;s work, not the
clause.</div><a name="09061172000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000371"></a>Damian
Green:</b> I am interested in the important point that the
Minister just made about a superstructure for checking. That sounds
like another licensing authority to decide what is an appropriate body
to provide the imprimatur of proper active citizenship. We all agree
that the opportunities for exploitation, fraud and unpleasant things
happening are considerable. The Minister is right that if we go down
this route, there will need to be a checking body. What will that body
be? Will it be the local authority, national Government or another new
regulatory body? Has any thinking evolved around that
yet?</div><a name="09061172000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000372"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Yes, indeed it has. The document from the design
group mentions the national checking service that I was talking about,
for which 80 local authorities have volunteered. Clearly one needs
local input. There 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div>cannot be a national top-heavy superstructure. It has to be based on
local knowledge, and that is how we envisage the
scheme.</div><a name="09061172000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
sense impatience in the Committee. I have spoken at length to try to
answer questions, but have not talked about clause 42 and the
amendments. I hope that I have covered the points that have been raised
and justified the desirability of the clause. I resist the amendments
and support the
clause.</div><a name="09061172000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000373"></a>Damian
Green:</b> I can assure the Minister that there was no
impatience on this side of the Committee. Conservative Members think
that this is a hugely important part of the Bill&#151;in some ways it
is the most radical. One reason why there were so many interventions
and questions was because the process is clearly imperfect. We are at a
relatively advanced stage of the Bill&#146;s proceedings. The Bill
has already gone through another place. It is in Committee here, yet we
are still groping for details of how the system will operate. The
document from the design group that we have been discussing
is full of caveats. I do not blame the group at all; it is
trying to get to grips with an entirely new system. It is perfectly
clear to anyone who reads the document that it is not very far down
that
road.</div><a name="09061172000277"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="09061172000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not intend to press the amendment to a Division, but I hope that the
debate has sent up a warning flare to the Minister that an awful lot of
additional work needs to be done on the clause before it is put into
effect. It is possible that the unintended consequences of what is not
an ignoble idea could cause severe damage. He sat down thinking that he
had talked for too long, but I disagree with him on
that&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I do not want him to
take that as a precedent.</div>
<a name="09061172000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s speech was so long and there were so many
interventions precisely because the more one thinks about the details,
the more problems&#151;and, frankly, ambiguities&#151;emerge. He
responded to my point about the checking arrangements for bodies with
the nationality checking service, but I understand that that service is
to check whether individuals are doing the appropriate thing. I am
talking about the bodies with which the individuals will volunteer. The
Minister is quite right to say that some of those will be big,
established charities while others will be small charities that we
would all recognise as such. At the margin, however, there will be some
bodies that are not recognised as charities or as volunteering bodies.
Beyond the margin, there will be organisations set up specifically for
getting people involved, but that are basically scams whereby they can
fulfil their requirements and get citizenship two years early or, even
worse, organisations that are actively of unpleasant intent and see a
new source of potentially vulnerable, and perhaps slightly ignorant,
recruits to exploit.</div>
<a name="09061172000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulatory regime for bodies is therefore hugely important, but I
detect no sign, from either what the Minister said or the document,
that that regulatory regime will be in place, or that how it will
operate has been thought through. Although this might be a good idea
that could go forward, it is also potentially a hugely dangerous idea,
and I hope that Ministers will take that on board in the remaining
stages of the Bill&#146;s passage.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div><a name="09061172000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000374"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the one question
that the Minister must be able to answer is how someone anywhere in the
country will be able to check whether a voluntary organisation is a
legitimate organisation that can provide a genuine active citizenship
opportunity? If that cannot be answered, I am not sure where the scheme
is
going.</div><a name="09061172000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000375"></a>Damian
Green:</b> The hon. Gentleman touches on an important point.
There are clearly bodies that could do that, such as the charity
commissioners, which register charities. However, the activity is so
important, and almost open-ended as new people arrive, that whoever
does it will find themselves having to devote considerable resources to
it. It will therefore be costly in terms of money, time and staffing.
That point is not remotely
trivial.</div><a name="09061172000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
more we think about it, the more we agree we need proper regulation,
but then the more difficult, expensive and time-consuming that
regulation will become. Ministers should have thought through what that
might entail, not least in terms of possible public expenditure. I
detect very little sign that that work has been done, which, frankly,
is slightly
worrying.</div><a name="09061172000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that on Report, and perhaps when the Bill goes back to another
place, Ministers will have something much more concrete with which to
reassure us. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="09061172000219"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000376"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am not quivering. I rise briefly to answer the
points that have been made. I give reassurance by referring to clause
42(5), which states that regulations, whether alone or with other
provision,</div><a name="09061172000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may

take the point made by the hon. Member for Ashford that the regulations
and what I have described as the superstructure are evolving. I am
aware of his caution. There has been a lot of work, but I accept that
these are the emerging thoughts of the design group. The issue is
extremely important, which is one of the reasons why the proposed
commencement date is what it is.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000379"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Clause 43 rights what some see as a wrong and is
consequential to clause 47. The reason that clause 43 appears earlier
than, but is consequential to, clause 47 is because it relates to
sections of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div>British Nationality Act 1981. Section 1(1) of the 1981 Act
currently provides for a person born in the UK or a qualifying
territory to acquire British citizenship automatically at birth, if
born to a parent who is either a British citizen or is settled for
nationality purposes in the UK or qualifying territories.</div>
<a name="09061172000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 1(3)
of the 1981 Act currently provides for a person born in the UK to
register as a British citizen if, while they are a minor, their father
or mother becomes either a British citizen or becomes settled for
nationality purposes in the UK. Under subsection (1), a person born in
the UK to a foreign and Commonwealth parent who is currently serving in
the UK armed forces acquires British citizenship automatically at
birth, or, under subsection (3), they may register as a British citizen
because the parent is recognised as being settled in the UK for
nationality purposes. Section 50 in part 2 of the 1981 Act sets out the
definition of settled in the UK or qualifying territory for nationality
purposes, which requires the person to be ordinarily resident and to be
free from immigration time control.</div>
<a name="09061172000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Home
Office lawyers have advised that the application of that definition to
foreign and Commonwealth members of the UK armed forces is now
ambiguous following changes to Ministry of Defence recruitment and
training practices, which means that those foreign and Commonwealth
persons eligible for recruitment to the UK armed forces are no longer
expected to have indefinite leave to remain in the UK. However, since
1997 members of the UK armed forces continue, as before, to be exempt
from immigration control while subject to service law during the period
of their service in the UK armed
forces.</div><a name="09061172000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government wish to maintain the current rights to citizenship of
children born in the UK or a qualifying territory to a parent who is,
or who becomes, a foreign and Commonwealth member of the armed forces.
That is because the right has existed in law and has been asserted by
this class of person since commencement of the 1981 Act. It is also
because the Government are committed to improving the lives of service
personnel, their families and veterans, as outlined in the MOD Command
Paper from July 2008, &#147;The Nation&#146;s Commitment:
Cross-Government Support to our Armed Forces, their Families and
Veterans&#148;, by amending section 1 of the 1981 Act to accommodate
that group of persons. The current ambiguity in the application of the
definition of &#147;settled&#148; to that group will be removed and
the existing rights will be maintained. This is therefore a good
opportunity to clarify the law in relation to those who serve in the
armed
forces.</div><a name="09061172000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000380"></a>Damian

change is welcome and necessary, and I can imagine the pleasure with

<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> No, do not tell him, Sir Nicholas. We concur
with the other place, again, on this point about descent through the
female line, and we accept that we should right that wrong.</div>
<a name="09061172000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The change
essentially brings into line the position of a certain category of
person covered by the British Nationality Act 1981, whose citizenship
has been passed on. At the moment there is a cut-off date of 1961, but
we are righting that wrong. In short, at the moment, if one had two
daughters who were born in 1959 and 1962 respectively, the younger one
would have rights and the elder would not, so we are putting that right
on advice from the other

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000384"></a>Tom

Minister said when I was called outside, so I welcome what I believe he
has said. I heard him complete his confirmation that he would address
that omission. He might have given an explanation for the original
omission when I was not present, but I wonder why it happened and so is
having to be addressed
now.</div><a name="09061172000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000385"></a>Damian
Green:</b> To add completeness to the debate, let me say that
we, too, welcome the change. I am sure that many hon. Members will have
had a small number of constituency cases on this issue, and that we
have all wondered how this law has subsisted in this completely
irrational way, under many successive Governments, for getting on for
50 years. It is incumbent on this House to pay tribute to the other
House for pointing out the problem in such a strong way, and I am glad
that Ministers have finally acceded to the apparently
ineluctable
logic.</div><a name="09061172000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061172000386"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I have asked myself the same question. I believe
we would have taken the opportunity to do this in any event, but it was
highlighted in the other
place.</div><a name="09061172000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
1981 Act was meant to limit citizenship to those with a close and
continuing connection with the UK. One of the underlying principles of
the Act was that an adult seeking to become a British citizen should be
able to demonstrate his or her personal connection with the UK. Section
4C differed from other sections in that it allowed for registration on
the basis of a mother&#146;s connection with the UK, and it was
originally the Government&#146;s intention that it should be limited
in its scope. On 7 February 1979, the then Home Secretary, Merlyn Rees,
announced that he would exercise his discretion in favour of any child
of a UK-born mother who applied for registration before his or her
18th birthday. Section 4C was intended only to cover those
people who might have been unaware of the 1979 concession and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>did not benefit from it. Persons born before 7 February 1961 could not
have benefited from the concession in any event.</div>

Friend Lord Filkin
said:</div><a name="09061172000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;British
