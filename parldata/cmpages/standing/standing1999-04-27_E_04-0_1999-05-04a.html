<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I beg to move  amendment No. 40 in page 4, line 40, leave out  `appropriate' and insert `necessary'. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take  amendment No. 41, in page 4, line 43, leave out 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and may impose conditions on the payment of the sums'. 
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody. It has been suggested that the  Committee is proceeding in a rather purgatorial fashion. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am now about to do the unforgivable  and interrupt the hon. Gentleman. I should have  announced that there is a mistake in today's amendment  paper. This is a ploy to ruin your speech, Mr. Grieve. On  page 421 of the amendment paper, amendment No. 57  should have been placed before amendment No. 128.  I shall call them in that order, which is how they are set  out on the selection list. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am happy to say that your announcement  does not trouble me too much, Mrs. Dunwoody, given  that my hon. and learned friend the Member for  Harborough (Mr. Garnier) will be dealing with those  amendments to clause 7, leaving me to focus my mind on  clause 6. Our proceedings arc proving to be enlightening  and the spirit of our debates has been pleasant. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Garnier </B>(Harborough): May I interrupt  the proceedings, Mrs. Dunwoody, to ask you whether it  is in order for gentlemen to remove their jackets? 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman  certainly has my permission. It is a matter of sartorial  choice. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I knew that the hon. Member for Hendon  (Mr. Dismore) was chafing to remove his jacket.       
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I always think that Members of  Parliament have a clear view of themselves when they  want to look as though they are in a dealing room. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Grieve:</B> I endorse those sentiments, Mrs. Dunwoody, although I have not been in the House  of Commons long enough to catch on to such trends. The  idea of removing my jacket in court would have been  anathema. I do not recall any occasion when that  happened. Sometimes we removed our wigs, but not our  gowns a subject that may arise later in our proceedings  and about which I shall have much to say. 
<P>
Amendment No. 40 proposes that "appropriate"	 should  be left out of subsection (2)(a) and replaced by  "necessary"	. Examining the minutiae of legislation is  often an exercise in semantics and about what certain  words may mean. Doubtless, the Solicitor-General will  tell us that it will be appropriate for satisfactory resources  to be made available by the Lord Chancellor, pursuant to  clause 6, for the funding of the services of the Legal  Services Commission and the Community Legal Service.  That matter causes us considerable concern. I am sure,  however, that the Solicitor-General will have no difficulty  in explaining some of the implications of the clause. 
<P>
It is accepted that the existing legal aid scheme has  many flaws, one of which is  because of the element of  it being a bottomless pit that a client who is financially  eligible and has a meritorious case is entitled to legal aid.  It is therefore demand driven; it is an important state  provision to ensure that individuals should have access to  justice. If more people require access to justice in one  year than another, and so long as their cases fall within  the merit criteria, they ought to be funded. Otherwise, they  would be denied justice. Under the Bill, that system will  be substantially altered. it will be based on the allocation  of available resources. It will therefore be a cash-limited  scheme. Not only that, but the cash limitation will depend,  first and foremost, on how much has been spent or is  being spent on criminal legal aid in that year.       
<P>
Criminal legal aid will continue to be a bottomless pit,  because the Government acknowledge the state's  responsibility under the Human Rights Act 1998 to  comply with the European convention on human rights. If  the crime rate rises, or if the courts' throughput of work  increases, the amount of money available for the  Community Legal Service may decrease. That is a matter  of considerable concern. The proposal to replace  "appropriate"	 with "necessary"	 may seem a small change.  By using "necessary"	, I do not suggest the return of the  bottomless pit. I seek to put an onus on the Government,  the Lord Chancellor's Department and the commission  that will administer the fund to justify the level of funding  for civil legal aid. 
<P>
I am fearful about the proposals. I say this in kindness  to the Government, but if their budget projections are  wrong, what will happen to those in civil litigation who  are now entitled to funding? Shall we simply receive a  letter from the Minister come January of the following  year, saying, "I am terribly sorry, but no further funds will  be available until the next financial year"	? Or will the  Department impose a close budget and ratchet down the  availability of funds irrespective of the merits of cases? 
<P>
I would be happy if the Solicitor-General were to  clarify how he sees the system working and in practice,  rather than as a theoretical construct. It sounds very well,  but when we get to the nitty-gritty, I fear it may prove to  be a real problem. I am convinced that there will be a  crisis unless people receive funding for deserving cases  that meet the Government's and the commission's criteria.  I move the amendment to probe a little, and to ascertain  how the Solicitor-General intends the system to operate.  Nothing in the Bill says how much money the  Government intend to make available for civil legal aid. 
<P>
I do not know whether the Government have made any  projections, or whether the actuaries have become  involved, but there is ample evidence that we are living  in an increasingly litigious society. That is due not so  much to lawyers as to the general climate and what some  might call the arrival of the blame society, in which  someone else is always considered to be to blame and is  a target for paying up. That climate will not go away. I  do not want to be sidetracked, Mrs. Dunwoody, or you  will call me to order, but many other ways to fund legal  aid, including the contingency legal aid fund, have  considerable merit. The Government have not pursued  these approaches in their reforms. I should be grateful to  hear from the Solicitor-General how the resources  necessary to meet the Government's commitment to  access to justice will be supplied, and how that squares  with clause 6.       
<P>
In addition, in line 43 of page 4 we suggest that the  words 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and may impose conditions on the payment of the sums"	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
be left out, which ties in with the other amendment. What  are the conditions? What is the relevance of those words  in the context of clause 6? I would be grateful if the  Solicitor-General would consider that, as it might be taken  to suggest although I am sure that he will tell me that it  does not that conditions may be imposed that would  greatly limit a person's ability to bring a case properly. 
<P>
At a later stage, we will consider quality in terms of  access to justice. At the moment, if one's lawyer is  satisfied and advises that the expenditure is justified, one  is likely to be granted legal aid, and it is unlikely that the  Legal Aid Board will turn down one's request for an  expert or for someone to go abroad to obtain evidence if  necessary. What conditions can be imposed? Is this  provision another blank cheque? By that, I mean a blank  cheque for the Lord Chancellor rather than the person  seeking to litigate. 
<P>
One of the problems of the Bill is that it gives  enormous powers of discretion to the Lord Chancellor  and, through him, to the commission. That is all very well.  I suppose that I must accept that the Lord Chancellor,  being below only the sovereign at the top of this country's  system of justice, ought to be benevolently inclined  towards access to justice working. However, an anxiety  remains because hitherto the system has not operated in  this way. There are far more checks now on the way in  which the Lord Chancellor's discretion may be exercised  than there will be on his and the commission's powers of  discretion in future. 
<P>
I hope that we shall have some clarification on those  points. I commend the amendments to the Committee as  they add something to the Bill without detracting from  the general thrust of what the Government have set out  to achieve. 
<P>
<B> Mr. John Burnett (Torridge and West Devon):</B> I am  delighted to welcome you as Chairman, Mrs. Dunwoody.  I am not sure whether there is a precedent in Committee  for shirt-sleeve order, but I do not think that now would  be a wise time to test that. 
<P>
The Government have not yet been minded to accept  the argument for separate funding of the Criminal  Defence Service and the Community Legal Service. We  all understand and appreciate that the funding of the  Criminal Defence Service, in the interests of justice and  in the light of our commitment to the European  convention on human rights, has to be led by demand. No  hon. Members argue with that fact. 
<P>
However, we have discussed at length what Opposition  Members consider to be the importance of having a  separate fund for the Community Legal Service. That fund  should be transparent and the sums in it should be gauged  on its own merits. That does not mean to say that any  more money should be spent on it, but that Parliament  should have the opportunity to know exactly how much  will be available for civil legal aid in any year. That would  go some way to ensure that civil legal aid does not wither  on the vine that the demands of the Criminal Defence  Service do not deprive our fellow countrymen of more  civil legal aid without warning or rational debate.       
<P>
Amendment No. 40 would allow the Lord Chancellor  to retain the abundance of discretion that he enjoys in the  Bill, in so far as he has the right to determine the sums  required for funding the Community Legal Service. The  amendment goes some way to ensure that in exercising  that discretion, the Lord Chancellor should be mindful of  what is necessary, rather than appropriate, for the  commission's funding of the Community Legal Service.  The amendment is logical. It is no good going to such  lengths to establish a Community Legal Service without  giving it the necessary funding. 
<P>
Amendment No. 41 boils down to a matter of trust.  The Lord Chancellor will retain the right to determine  the manner that and times at which sums for funding the  Community Legal Service will be paid to the commission.  However, the amendment would sweep away the Lord  Chancellor's absolute right to impose conditions on the  payment of such sums. Unless the amendment is accepted,  one person, unelected and unaccountable the Lord  Chancellor will have carte blanche to dictate to the  commission exactly how to fund the Community Legal  Service. I hope that the amendment will be accepted.

<P>

<B> The Solicitor-General </B>(Mr. Ross Cranston): It is  good to see you in the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody. 
<P>
Amendment No. 40 would delete "appropriate"	 and  substitute "necessary"	. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield  (Mr. Grieve) anticipated the objections to the amendment.  He used the phrase "bottomless pit"	, although I am not  sure that I would use that term. He also mentioned  demand-led legal services, which is probably a better  description of the existing system. However, as we have  said on previous occasions, the result of the demand-led  system has been that, over the years, the eligibility criteria  have had to be narrowed, so fewer people as a proportion  of the population have qualified for what is now civil  legal aid. 
<P>
In our previous sitting, I made two points that are  appropriate to today's debate. First, we are aiming to  achieve a controlled budget, just like in other areas of  public expenditure. I mentioned previously that spending  on legal services must compete with spending on other  important areas of public expenditure, be they education  or health. I also explained earlier that the fear that  expenditure on the Community Legal Service would  somehow be gobbled up by expenditure on the Criminal  Defence Service a point that the hon. Member for  Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) emphasised  today was in many ways not realistic, because during  the year contracts for the Community Legal Service will  be let and expenditure will be incurred. It will therefore  be difficult to move moneys from the Community Legal  Service to the Criminal Defence Service. The logic of how  expenditure will be used and of how contracts will be let  will not result in the realisation of the fears of the hon.  Member for Torridge and West Devon. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> How long are the anticipated contractual  periods likely to be? 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> The periods will vary. My  right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor recently  made some announcements about the periods in terms of  expenditure on family matters. If contracts run for at least  12 months, and possibly for up to three years, it will be  difficult for a variation to occur. Therefore the fear that  moneys will be gobbled up is not based on an accurate  description of how the system will operate.       
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I seek clarification similar to that which  was sought previously. Whatever the time scale, budgets  can run out. Certain Australian jurisdictions have had to  suspend eligibility for civil legal aid. In Ontario, the  capping of the legal aid budget has led to a reduction in  the number of civil certificates over three years.  I appreciate that much of the money will be contracted in  advance, but what will happen if the demand on the  criminal legal aid budget suddenly rises so that no money  is left in the civil legal aid budget? 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General rose  </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. In normal circumstances, I  would hope that interventions would be fairly brief. 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> My hon. Friend raises a  genuine concern, but I suspect that he will find that the  circumstances that he refers to occurred under  Conservative Governments in those jurisdictions. As I  explained previously, separate budgets will be created  under the Bill. They will be voted separately by  Parliament. They will appear separately in appropriation  accounts and in the commission's annual budget. 
<P>
Given the scrutiny that will occur, if any fear arose,  such as that which my hon. Friend expresses, it would  very soon result in a change. As I explained on Second  Reading, my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord  Chancellor would, in the first instance, have to consider  his budget as a whole. However, if a crisis arose, such as  that which my hon. Friend describes, he would go to the  Treasury, as any other Minister would have to do. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Burnett:</B> I wonder whether the Solicitor-General  can tell us whether three-year contracts are likely to  contain any limiting conditions, such as early termination  on the ground of lack of funds? 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I should have thought that that  would not be the case. The contracts will be for three  years. It may be that they will contain a termination  provision, but I understand that that will simply be in  terms of time a 12-month termination provision. We  have been round this course on several occasions. The  fears expressed although genuine have been met by  the logic of the provisions. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Before the Solicitor-General leaves that  subject, can he assure the Committee that no civil claim,  which comes within the Government's proposals for the  permitted use of state funds, will be denied progress  because of the failure of the Lord Chancellor's  Department to have sufficient money in the civil budget? 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I am not sure what the hon.  and learned Gentleman is getting at. If a contract has been  let and if a case has been commenced, it will continue.  I do not know whether he is talking about such a  circumstance. 
<P>
I think that the hon. Member for Torridge and West  Devon perhaps it was the hon. Member for  Beaconsfield referred to the problems of an increasingly  litigious society. As we have said on several occasions,  the thrust of our proposals is to try to get people out of  court as much as possible. That is why we have  emphasised options such as mediation. In introducing the  Community Legal Service, we believe that the provision  of legal services by non lawyers and advice centres, for  example, is as important as the services offered by  lawyers themselves. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I appreciate that, and doubtless we all  hope that the mediation services work. However, there is  a central issue that the Solicitor-General seems not to have  answered. If there is a limited budget, what will happen  if one goes over budget because of demand in a given  period? Will the tap simply be turned off, or will one go  to the contingency reserve because the Government accept  that funding must be provided for deserving cases as a  matter of principle? What will happen at that point? 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I explained the other day that  another aspect of the proposals is to try to improve  predictability. In recent times, budget predictions have  been much more accurate. The conditions imposed as  referred to in amendment No. 41 and where the money  can be allocated, such as to family matters, are provisions  designed to improve controls on expenditure, so that we  do not reach the crisis referred to by Opposition Members. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the Solicitor-General give way? 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> This must be the last time that  I give way. We must make progress.       
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the Solicitor-General. He  said that he wanted to control expenditure, but what will  happen if expenditure is over budget? 
<P>
<B> The Solicitor-General:</B> The contracts will be let  throughout the financial year to avoid the sort of problems  that the hon. Gentleman raises about the money somehow  running out. There should always be capacity within  contracts held by contractors to meet need. 
<P>
Amendment No. 41 would remove the Lord  Chancellor's power to impose conditions on the payment  to the commission of sums to maintain the community  Legal Service fund. There are mirror provisions that we  shall come to later in relation to the Criminal Defence  Service. This is a standard provision, required by the  Treasury guidance, "Government Accounting"	. The  provision existed under the previous Government and we  have simply continued it. 
<P>
"Government Accounting"	 sets out the financial  framework within which departments are required to  operate. Sponsor Departments, which make funds  available to non-departmental public bodies, are  accountable to Parliament for the provision of funds, and  are required to draw up clear, strategic frameworks for  each of their non-departmental public bodies. They have  a duty to ensure that the financial and other management  controls applied are appropriate and sufficient to  safeguard public funds; that the NDPBs comply with the  requirements of regularity and propriety; and that they  conduct their operations as economically, efficiently and  effectively as possible. 
<P>
"Government Accounting"	 states that legislation setting  up NDPBs should provide explicitly for enforceable  conditions to be attached to the payment of any  Government subventions to these bodies. We are simply  continuing the standard operating accounting procedures  used for bodies such as the Legal Services Commission.  Clause 6(2)(b) is designed to ensure that sufficient  safeguards are in place to protect the public funds that  will be administered by the Legal Services Commission  by giving statutory force to the financial memorandum  that will, in due course, be agreed by the Department and  the commission. 
<P>
I ask the hon. Member for Beaconsfield to withdraw  the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Solicitor-General has provided me  with a certain amount of reassurance on amendment  No. 41, which was a probing amendment seeking  clarification. Amendment No. 40 remains a point of  serious concern. However, having voiced that concern,  having listened carefully to the Solicitor-General, to  whom I am grateful for his full comments, and subject  to the caveat that we may have to come back and say  "I told you so"	 at a later date, there is no point in  pressing the matter further. Therefore, I beg to ask leave  to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.       
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind members of the Committee  that when moving amendments, it is a matter of courtesy  to address the Chair. A record is being taken of the  Committee's proceedings, and as we seem to have a large  number of lawyers who do not follow the same rules as  we ordinary mortals, perhaps that could be borne in mind  when moving or responding to amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve: I beg to move amendment No. 54, in page 5, line 12, after `obtain', insert </B><P>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`good quality services for those using them and, subject to that,'. 
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take  amendment No. 67, in page 5, line 12, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`after first taking into account the need to obtain good quality  services.'. 
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The amendment seeks to consider the  nature and quality of services that will be funded by the  Community Legal Service. Clause 6(6) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In funding services as part of the Community Legal Service the  Commission shall aim to obtain the best possible value for money."	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It may be that the term "value for money"	 is beginning to  acquire what we lawyers call a "term of art"	, but I am not  sure that we have reached that point yet. What the term  "value for money"	 means in practice is an extremely  flexible concept. 
<P>
It raises an issue of concern for me and my hon.  Friends. The amendment would add the words "good  quality services"	. I do not want to speak for solicitors,  which would be improper, although I have more than  anecdotal evidence of the quality of service provided,  having been instructed by many firms of solicitors over  the years. However, at the risk of shopping my own  profession, I must accept that the quality of service is, like  everything else in live, fairly variable. One can come  across extraordinarily good quality legal services from  solicitors and barristers across the country but, from time  to time, there are instances when one's hair stands on end  by the abysmal quality of service. That applies as much  to my own profession as to solicitors. I hope that I have  never come into the latter category in the service that I  have provided over the years. 
<P>
We are concerned with providing good quality services.  If such services are not provided, we can see now this  is not a matter of looking into the future that people are  denied access to justice. I have great faith in the justice  system in this country. In my experience, when it goes  wrong, it is because the lawyers botch it and do not  present their clients' interests properly. They do not take  a sufficiently proactive or aggressive stance in promoting  their clients' claims. The need to obtain good quality  services is paramount.       
<P>
We have already gone a long way down that road under  the existing legal aid provisions for civil legal aid. I have  always approved of the move that has gradually seen the  development of specialist panels, rather than simply  relying on the fact that any high street solicitor can do  every aspect of work. As a barrister, I am conscious that  there are many areas of work that I would not be prepared  to touch because my experience and knowledge dates  back 10 to 12 years and may be superseded by new  statutes. If I had not been practising in a particular field  for some time, I would be foolish to touch it. However,  the Bill emphasises simply "value for money"	. When  opening the debate, I asked what that means. In the  absence of an assurance that contracts will be available to  all who can pass the quality threshold, it could lead to the  commission selecting a few large providers to achieve the  best possible price, thereby denying people access to good  quality services that would otherwise be available. That is  my central anxiety about clause 6(6). It is on that matter  that I seek clarification from the Solicitor-General. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Alan Whitehead </B>(Southampton, Test): Unless one  takes a compulsory-competitive-tendering view of the  service, as was the practice under the previous  Government, are there circumstances in which a basic  quality service could be conceived as being good value  for money? How would one define a bad quality service  being good value for money under the terms of the  amendment? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point,  but I am not sure that it quite meets the thrust of my  argument. If all the work is directed to large-scale service  providers because they provide good value for money and  a reasonable quality of service, I am worried that the lack  of diversity in service providers will cause quality to slip.  If we spread the load among quality providers throughout  the country, which would ensure real competition, the  quality would remain. 
<P>
It is a traditional problem; it does not happen only in  the law. I have come across it the attempts of the present  Government and the previous Government to cart off  various services to mega providers. those providers were  supposed to be able to cope with the work, but the quality  started to slip because they became casual and slack as a  result of generating such a large throughput of work. I  believe that quality of service will identify those firms of  solicitors which can ensure, through monitoring, that the  service is maintained; we should be willing to let them do  the work. The Government's proposals seem to tend in  the other direction. I hope that I have answered the valid  point made by the hon. Member for Southampton, Test  (Dr. Whitehead).       
<P>
The central thrust of the amendment is that diversity  will produce the quality that the Government desire.  Those who provide good quality services should be  identified and supported. The Lord Chancellor said that it  is important not to introduce price competition at the  expense of quality of service, but if he is correct, might  not the need for quality go beyond the need to keep the  price low? The amendment will not prevent the Lord  Chancellor introducing an element of price competition;  it would simply ensure that quality is put at the forefront  because quality services usually turn out to be the  cheapest. 
<P>
I raise a point slightly peripheral to the amendment,  Mrs. Dunwoody, but I think that it is germane to the  argument. We have mentioned the impact of the Woolf  reforms on civil procedure. Those reforms are about the  front loading of costs in litigation. There is a strange fork  between the Government's proposals for access to justice,  which try to reduce costs, and the Woolf proposals, which  require people to dip more readily into their pockets to  get to the nub of issues as early as possible. The  Solicitor-General spoke about mediation, but that costs  money. 
<P>
The major obstacle to reasonable quality litigation is  manÄana the tendency, once proceedings have  commenced, to minimise spending on them and to let   them spin out until one eventually has to dip reluctantly  into the kitty and start disbursing money in all directions.  That is how my profession and the solicitors' profession  have tended to acquire a bad name as a direct result of  an unwillingness to grasp the nettle. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> Order. I am listening to the hon.  Gentleman very carefully and do not want to restrict his  speech, but the amendment is narrowly drafted and if he  proceeds to make a clause stand part speech, he will find  me less acquiescent in allowing a debate on the clause as  a whole. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am mindful of your comments, Mrs. Dunwoody. We have tried to avoid having too  many clause stand apart debates by considering  individual matters. I shall bring my speech to a close.  If we want quality, it has to be paid for. Quality  ultimately goes hand in hand with financial efficiency,  but I am not certain that clause 6(6) is sufficiently well  drafted to achieve it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Would it be in order for me to speak to  amendment No. 67 now, Mrs. Dunwoody? 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> In tabling amendment No. 67, our  intention is to ensure that quality comes first and that we  do not establish a Community Legal Service that is cheap  and inadequate. In other words, we want to put the legally  aided litigant in the same position, as far as possible, as  the privately funded litigant.       
<P>
Last January, the Legal Aid (Prescribed Panels)  Regulations 1998 were debated in Committee. During that  debate, the Minister of State put great emphasis on quality  and on specialisation, and I agreed with him on both of  those points. We want quality, which can be achieved by  specialisation they are both important matters. 
<P>
To be granted a franchise to carry out legal aid work,  solicitors and other providers should demonstrate their  skills in the legal specialisations for which they wish to  contract. I do not understand how the Government could  not accept at least one of the amendments. In fact,  Conservative Members have a similar objective in moving  amendment No. 54 as we have in tabling amendment No. 67. We all want the Community Legal Service to  provide good quality services, and provision to that effect  should be made in the Bill. 
<P>
Under the current legal aid scheme, those seeking legal  aid can instruct any solicitor to act for them. I appreciate  the necessity for franchising and the necessity to ensure  that those contracted with the Community Legal Service  have the expertise and knowledge in other words, the  quality to do the work. That is one of the reasons why  the Law Society has established several specialist panels.  Those panels will allow the public, the commission and  the Community Legal Service to know that individuals or  firms have the appropriate skills and specialisations to do  the work. 
<P>
Several panels have been set up, including panels for  family law, personal injuries, medical negligence, children  cases and mental health review tribunals. The Law  Society will shortly introduce specialist panels for  housing, immigration and criminal law. In addition,  special accreditation for practice management standards  will be introduced. 
<P>
All members of the Committee have the aim that  legally aided litigants should receive high quality advice;  they should not be prejudiced by having to rely on advice  that is less than adequate. In Committee on 27 April, I  asked the Minister whether firms that achieve the  appropriate quality standards in other words, obtain a  franchise will automatically secure a contract. The  Minister replied: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Securing the appropriate quality standard is not something that"	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
the Government have as yet set out. He mentioned that  he had 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"outlined interim measures for securing a franchise"	, 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
and that that was 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a step along the way towards a contracting system that will  concentrate the work in the hands of those who are competent to  do it."	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
He went on to say that the Government were 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"looking for the most effective way in which to ensure that there is  access to justice throughout the country on a geographical basis,  which will guarantee that those who seek advice will receive it from  those who are best qualified to do the work."	 [Official Report,  Standing Committee E, 27 April 1999; c. 32.]       
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>11.15 am   </H5>
</P>
<P>
I was encouraged by that reply. The amendment meets  the Minister's aspirations about quality. I believe that the  Minister agrees that to concentrate on value for money  only would lead to an emphasis on price at the expense  of quality. We do not want a system in which the  commission merely chooses a few large providers in order  to achieve the best possible prices. We want a system in  which all those who pass the quality threshold can secure  contracts. That is what we should be aiming to achieve.  That would secure choice, competition, access throughout  the country on a geographical basis, and quality.

<P>

<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I do not think that we disagree  with the sentiments that Opposition Members have  expressed. However, I shall advise my hon. Friends that  the amendments are unnecessary. As my hon. Friend the  Member for Southampton, Test said, the concept of best  value even to mere mortals involves a combination of  price and quality. Subsection (6) therefore already refers  to price and quality. 
<P>
The Bill contains other mechanisms that meet  Opposition Members' anxieties about quality, such as  contracting and quality accreditation schemes for service  providers. The hon. Member for Torridge and West  Devon mentioned franchising and the steps that the Law  Society has taken to establish specialist panels, for which  we commend it. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield  mentioned the Woolf reforms and the fact that lawyers  must now deal with matters much more quickly and  therefore cannot allow cases to drag on. All those  proposals, in combination with the concept of best value  that is incorporated in subsection (6), meet Opposition  Members' anxieties. 
<P>
With your permission, Mrs. Dunwoody, I should also  like to mention the amendments to clause 5 that we made  in our previous sitting. The hon. and learned Member for  Harborough lost those amendments, as did I for a while,  but they make it clear that the promotion of quality  services is one of the aims of the Community Legal  Service. Together with obtaining best value for money,  that makes clear the Government's intention to provide  quality service through the Community Legal Service.  I therefore ask Opposition Members to withdraw the  amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Having considered and ventilated the  issue, which worries us, and in the light of comments  made but subject to my reservations about how the  provision will work in practice I beg to ask leave to  withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the  Bill.       
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> The intention behind  subsection (5) is for the fund to be divided into two main  budgets; one providing services for family cases and the  other for the remainder of civil cases. the Commission  will be allowed limited flexibility to switch money  between those two areas. The Lord Chancellor may set  further requirements within those two budgets. He could  specify the maximum or the minimum amount that should  be spent on, say, services from the voluntary advice  sector, on meditation or on cases involving a wider public  interest. As a result, it will be possible to ensure that  resources are allocated in accordance with the  Government's priorities. 
<P>
Last Thursday, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said  that I had said that budget changes would be subject to  affirmative resolution. I did not say that, nor will that be  the case. Changes in the budget for the Community Legal  Service fund are likely to be rare. Any change would be  announced immediately to Parliament. It would not be  subject to parliamentary approval. I thought it right that I  correct the hon. Gentleman. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I need guidance about clause 25(9),  which the Solicitor-General drew to our attention earlier.  It deals with how orders will be considered. Is the hon.  and learned Gentleman now saying that the matter to  which he referred does not come within that edict? 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> No. We shall discuss that  subsection later. It provides for affirmative orders in  certain cases, but not in respect of that to which I referred.  When we debate Clause 25, I shall set out clearly the  situations that will be covered by affirmative orders. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> In the light of what the Solicitor-General  said, it might be helpful if the Government drew up a  schedule of those matters that will be dealt with by the  procedure under clause 25(9) and those matters, such as  that mentioned by the hon. and learned Gentleman, which  will not be so covered. That will help us to understand  from the skeleton Bill what the Lord Chancellor has  condescended to allow Parliament to consider and what  he has not. Bearing in mind the majority that the present  Government enjoy, the Lord Chancellor will be given a  huge number of increased powers by Parliament and those  powers will be devoid of all scrutiny.       
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): Does my hon. And  learned Friend accept that several of us were concerned  about that matter when we discussed the Bill on Second  Reading? I endorse strongly his suggestion, and I hope  that the Government will feel obliged to clarify their  intentions to inform not only members of the Committee,  but the wider public and those in the legal profession who  are worried about the Henry VIII powers that the modern  Cardinal Wolsey proposes to give himself. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I entirely agree with my hon. Friend.  His contribution to the debate on Second Reading was  extremely valuable and, I hope, will have been widely  read. I shall now draw my remarks to a close, in the hope  the Government will accede to our request or, at least,  provide us with better information 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am sure that the Solicitor-General will  remember our debate on clause 4 and our attempt to insert  a provision that the order should be laid. I understood  from what was said then that the matter will be reviewed  annually under the affirmative resolution procedure.  I hope that we receive some clarification of the issue and  that we have an opportunity to debate it further when we  reach clause 25. 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I have sought to correct a  misunderstanding on the part of the hon. Member for  Beaconsfield. Clause 25(9) makes clear what matters are  subject to affirmative resolution procedure. It would be  difficult to provide a schedule of what is not covered by  that provision. If such matters are not expressly provided  for under the clause, the logical conclusion is that no  affirmative resolution is required. 
<P>
The mater has been debated in the other place and, as  a result of certain amendments, their Lordships were  content with our approach. To talk about large Henry VIII  provisions does not accurately describe the Bill at present. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`have particular regard to the priorities set out in subsections (1A)  and (1B). 
<P>
(1A) Subject to subsections (5), the Commission shall afford  priority to advice and representation in cases concerning

<P>
(1C) Subject to subsections (1A) and (1B), the Commission shall'. 
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment seeks to place in the Bill priorities  reflected by those already identified by the Government,  such as social welfare, public interest cases and the  protection of especially vulnerable people, including  children and women suffering from domestic violence. 
<P>
This will be a short debate designed to tease further  information out of the Government about their intentions.  I shall not press it to a vote, but I shall be interested to  hear the Minister's response. 
<P>
Our amendment can be found on page 421 of the  amendment paper. It would place in the Bill a requirement  on the providers of state-funded legal services to have  particular regard to certain priorities. It states that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Commission shall afford priority to advice and representation  in cases concerning...welfare benefits...contract of  employment...homelessness...the enforcement of judgement  debts...immigration, asylum or nationality; or...such other matters as  are specified in regulations."	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The amendment would also require that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Commission shall afford priority for advice, assistance and  representation in cases: 
<P>
(a) likely to give rise to substantial benefits for a significant  number of people other than the parties 
<P>

<P>
(c) concerned with protection from violence 
<P>
(d) relating to the welfare of children

(e) concerning the welfare of a person under a disability 
<P>
(f) relating to the care of a child, or 
<P>
(g) concerning the provision of a child's education, including  admission and exclusion proceedings. <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have a suspicion that the Government do not disagree  with any of the general good intentions behind those  words. However, we want to see those intentions and  broad sympathies either clarified by a Government  statement there has not been one so far or placed in  the Bill. 
<P>
Without them, we get into the sort of difficulty that we  had a moment ago when the Solicitor-General and my  hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield seemed to be at  odds with each other as to what the Bill was supposed to  say and mean indeed, it was difficult to divine what the  Solicitor-General supposed it to mean. I see that he is  smiling, which I take to mean that he does not find my  remarks too objectionable. It would help the Committee  and those outside it if we were told precisely what the  Government intend. 
<P>
This is a long Bill, half of which contains schedules,  but reading it would not leave one any better informed  about what the Government could do or intend to do with  taxpayers' money. We seek greater clarification through  our discussion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins: I rise to support my hon. and learned  Friend the Member for Harborough, as it would be  enormously helpful to have the clarification set out in  amendment No. 57. In our recent brief clause stand part  debate, we talked about the breadth of the powers given  to the Lord Chancellor. I find those that will be given to  him by this clause among the most objectionable. The  Solicitor-General denied that the Lord Chancellor has  wide Henry VIII powers, but clause 7 states that </B><P>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the priorities shall be set  
<P>
(a) in accordance with any directions given by the Lord  Chancellor"	. 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That is not good enough. The public want to know exactly  what the priorities in the Bill are. I think that most of our  constituents would feel that the kind of priorities set out in  the amendment are precisely those that they want to have. 
<P>
I used to practise extensively in cases concerned with  domestic violence and children. I am pleased that  proposed new subsection (1B) (c) of the amendment  would give priority to cases 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"concerned with protection from violence"	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
and that proposed new subsection (1B) (d) would give  priority to those 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"relating to the welfare of children"	. <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Such clarification would be enormously helpful. I hope  that even if the amendment is not pressed to a vote, the  Government will consider whether, at a later stage, to  introduce an amendment of a similar nature. It would be  a much better Bill, and our constituents would be much  happier, if the priorities were set out in turn. 
<P>
<B> The Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's  Department (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</B> I belatedly welcome  you to our proceedings, Mrs. Dunwoody; this is the first  opportunity that I have had to do so. I am tempted to  sympathise with your having fallen in with such a gaggle  of lawyers, but I know from previous experience that if  those lawyers get things wrong, it is they who will require  the sympathy. 
<P>
Amendment No. 57 would set out in the Bill specific  priorities for funding cases to which the Legal Services  Commission would have a duty to have particular regard.  The amendment is similar to one tabled in the other place  by my right hon. and learned Friend Lord Archer of  Sandwell, which he withdrew having heard the  explanation by my right hon. and learned Friend the  Lord Chancellor. 
<P>
The Government cannot accept the amendment, but not  because we fundamentally disagree with the list of  priorities. Indeed, many of them reflect the priorities that  we have already outlined in the White Paper,  "Modernising Justice"	, and elsewhere. We cannot accept  the amendment because we do not believe that it is  appropriate for general priorities, which will influence the  overall deployment of resources, to be set out in this way  in primary legislation. Ministers are accountable to  Parliament for the use of resources voted by Parliament. 
<P>
Primary legislation determining the commission's  priorities would be an unnecessary and unusual burden,  leading to inflexibility and inefficiency. I am sure that  Opposition Members, if they gave some thought to that,  would recognise that any change in priorities would  require the passing of primary legislation. That would  hardly be a sensible use of parliamentary time, not least  because the funding code that will give effect to priorities  will be subject to parliamentary approval by virtue of the  provisions of clause 10.       
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I understand the Minister's point.  However, if he feels that the amendment could not be  made for the reasons that he mentioned, such as the need  to make any changes by primary legislation, will he  reassure us that a clear set of guidelines will be issued  that will include all the proposals in the amendment? That  would reinforce the point made by my hon. and learned  Friend the Member for Harborough and the right hon. and  learned Lord Archer of Sandwell who, after all, is a  former Law Officer and no doubt shares our concern. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I reassure the hon. Gentleman that the clear  set of guidelines that he is looking for will be known as  the funding code. It has been subject to consultation, will  be subject to parliamentary approval and will meet all the  concerns that I imagine the hon. Gentleman has. 
<P>
I hope that the hon. and learned Member for  Harborough, having heard that explanation, will be able  to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am not wholly content with what the  Minister has said, and I am not wholly convinced by the  responses given in the other place by the Lord Chancellor  to the right hon. and learned Lord Archer of Sandwell,  who is, incidentally, joint president of the Society of  Labour Lawyers. However, I am content that the matter  has been raised and perhaps will burrow its way into the  minds of hon. Members on the Government Benches for  consideration on Report and Third Reading. I beg to ask  leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 128 in  page 5, line 17, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`provided that the Commission shall not make different provision  for representation in any description of case in different areas of  England and Wales.'. <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take  amendment No. 74, in page 5, line 38, leave out `may'  and insert `shall'. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> This is a probing amendment, but is  worthy of debate. Its purpose is to ensure that  representation in court is funded on an equal basis  throughout England and Wales, while still allowing the  commission to fund advice services differently in different  areas so that advice needs could be tailored to local  circumstances. It would reflect the subsection of clause 1  the Government have removed that clause that ensured  that there was no discrimination on the ground of  geography in access to the courts or legal services. 
<P>
The amendment is intended to provoke the Government  into explaining why they wish to provide different  services for representation in court in different areas or  communities in England and Wales. The commission will  need the power to fund advice services differently in  different areas and will undoubtedly wish to pilot  schemes, with regard to different regional priorities and  taking into account the different ways in which advice  services can be provided, but it is not clear from the Bill  why the commission should be permitted to fund  representation in court differently. If the power were  intended to be only that of setting different contract prices  for London or for other major cities, that is not likely  to be objectionable, but if the intention is to permit the  commission to fund representation in court in a civil case  in Plymouth but not in Newcastle, it is hard to understand  how that could be justified or in the public interest. If the  Government do not intend the commission to have that  power, perhaps they will introduce an amendment at a  later stage to make the position clear. Our general  complaint about the Bill is that it is full of powers and  abilities for the Lord Chancellor to make regulations and  orders but is unclear on how they would be used in any  given set of circumstances. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Amendment No. 128 would take away  the powers of the commission to be flexible when  providing services using the Community Legal Service  Fund. Clause 7(1) empowers the commission to  prioritise its funding to various services to meet the  differing needs of local communities and particular  circumstances. To tackle head on the point raised by  the hon. and learned Member for Harborough about  why services in different parts of the country need to  be funded differently. Different parts of the country  have different needs and the underlying purpose of the  Government's approach to the provision of public  support for legal services is to recognise and identify  those differences. The needs of different areas or  communities differ widely; the need for immigration  advice in rural parts of the country        
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> Like Harborough 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I was not going to mention a particular area,  but Harborough might spring to mind as an example of a  place requiring different immigration advice from Dover  or the inner cities of our major conurbations. The point of  the Government's approach is to target the necessary  advice and representation on areas of particular need.  Without the flexibility provided by the clause, the  Government will not be able to satisfy those objectives.  Both amendments seek to limit the flexibility of the  commission and would do considerable harm to the  Government's central approach. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am sure that the Minister will agree that  that brings us to the nub of the objections that some  Opposition Members have to the Bill. Is he saying that if  one happens to be in a rural area and in need of  immigration services with exactly the same  requirements as someone in an urban area one may be  disadvantaged because one would not be regarded as a  priority need by the Government? If that is what he is  saying, that introduces the concept of the Government  simply deciding what is socially desirable in a particular  area. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am not saying that for a moment. I will  check the record later, but I am astonished that my words  could be so misinterpreted. I was saying that the  Government, through the regional legal services  committees and through effective public consultation, will  identify the needs of particular areas and seek to match  resources appropriately. There may be a need for  immigration advice in rural areas, but it is not likely to be  as significant a need as that in the inner cities. I would  have thought that that was self-evident and entirely  consistent with what the Government have been saying. I  hope that Opposition Members are satisfied with that, and  that the hon. and learned Gentleman will withdraw the  amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Amendments Nos. 68 and 70 would  enable separate provision to be made for expenditure on  disbursements and on the costs of advocacy. At an earlier  sitting, we discussed the exclusion of personal injury  cases in schedule 2, and I asked the Minister what would  happen to a poor or disadvantaged litigant who had an  action for personal injury. He or she must be able to find  the insurance premium for after-the-event defendants  costs; the minimum amount for that has doubled in the  past year to about £161 and is rising. 
<P>
When I asked the Minister how a poor litigant could  afford that sum, he replied that it was a business  opportunity for lawyers in other words, that lawyers  would stake the case and pay the premiums. The Minister  must know that most small and medium-sized solicitors'  firms cannot afford those sums. Years ago, most law firms  ceased to pay disbursements in advance, even in  conveyancing transactions, of which most members of the  Committee will have had experience. Ten or 15 years ago,  the cost of a search was about £20 and would have been  paid by the lawyer; these days the cost of a search fee is,  I understand, about £100 and is invariably asked of the  client in advance. In other words, lawyers do not have the  resources to pay even small amounts, let alone the large  fees sometimes required in litigation.       
<P>
I am indebted to Devon and Exeter law society for an  example of the costs of such disbursements. I shall start  with insurance premiums. The cost of premiums is  absolutely astronomical and it is likely to rise. For  instance, an indemnity of about £2,000 will cost about  £258, which is about 12.5 per cent. The minimum rate  chargeable for an indemnity of £10,000 for medical  negligence is about £1,664 about 16.5 per cent. Those  are huge amounts to have to pay in advance. Of one thing  we are certain: they will continue to rise as the insurance  industry extends its grip and drives on litigation in its  own interests. 
<P>
<H5>11.45 am   </H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendments seek also to ensure that clients are  not disadvantaged because lawyers are under economic  pressure to cut unnecessary disbursements or by the  lawyer pressing the client to settle a case that ought to be  contested. The Government should recognise that the cost  of some disbursements for example, doctors' fees is  outside the control of the lawyer. Those are enormous  sums of money, and the Bill should provide for them to  be funded. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): I am interested in  what the hon. Gentleman says, because I have been a  personal injury practitioner for 20 years. My experience  is that lawyers have quite a lot to say about doctors' fees.  They negotiate doctors' fees, and doctors who are used  regularly can negotiate terms for payment in arrears. To  suggest that lawyers in this day and age pay whatever the  doctors ask is nonsense. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I would not dream of suggesting that  anyone pays what is asked. For instance, the client in a  clinical negligence case will require a report from a  specialist doctor. Doctors will want to be paid, and it is  part of the lawyer's job to negotiate. However, such  payments will no longer be in the control of lawyers.  I hope that the Government will see fit to allow the  amendments, and to provide an equal footing for those on  legal aid and those who fund their own cases. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I shall respond first to the comparison with  personal injuries work and conveyancing made by the  hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon. That  solicitors no longer fund the cost of searches and  disbursements for conveyancing is, I suspect, the result  of changes to conveyancing practice. They now offer a  cost-effective and business-like service. I anticipate that  the profits made from conveyancing are much slimmer  than they once used to be. The costs are now more  reasonable. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Of one thing we can be sure: under the  Bill, the profitability of law firms and their ability to fund  costs will not be greater than hitherto but slimmer, just as  it has become in conveyancing. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I do not accept that. The reality of  conveyancing is that the public are now getting an  effective and business-like service. Solicitors have been  forced to compete on price. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Has my hon. Friend seen the Stoy  Hayward report that I referred to on Second Reading,  which shows that law firms expect the new arrangements  to be more profitable?       
<P>
<B> Mr. Hoon:</B> I have seen that; I agreed with my hon.  Friend then, and I agree with him now. We should not  spend too much time talking about conveyancing.  However, it is a good example of solicitors becoming  
more business like, which is what we want to encourage. 

<P>
I cannot accept the amendments. Each amendment tries  
to protect the legal profession from having to behave  
commercially in its dealings with the Legal Services  
Commission. They all seek to entrench old-fashioned  
ways of doing business. 

<P>
Amendments Nos. 68 and 70 seek to ensure that  
lawyers' fees will always be separate, and presumably that  
lawyers will be protected from having to meet  
disbursements that is, fees or costs incurred by the  
lawyer not covered by his basic fees or the costs of  
advocacy and of employing a barrister. I simply do not  
accept that kind of backward looking nonsense. The best  
value for money is to be obtained by requiring suppliers  
to provide an all-inclusive price for the delivery of defined  
levels of service. That is what the commission will seek  
to do. We do not intend to allow the freedom to match  
contract terms and to obtain the right services of the right  
quality and at the right price to be limited by such  
self-serving amendments. 

<P>
Amendment No. 89 would require separate provision  
to be made for the costs of advocacy. We are ready to  
enter into contracts with lawyers, from whatever branch of  
the profession they come. The Bar's anxiety about being  
merely a disbursement in the solicitor's contract is  
understandable, but the solution is in the Bar's hands.  
Barristers must organise themselves so that contracting is  
a realistic possibility. It would not be practicable for the  
commission to contract with every member of the Bar  
who meets whatever quality standards are set. The Bar  
could organise itself in many ways, and I know that the  
more far-sighted members of the Bar are already  
considering doing so. However, seeking permanent  
preservation clauses in legislation is not acceptable. 

<P>
Amendment No. 90 would require the commission to  
keep under review the service of specialists if that were  
required in the interests of justice. I recognise that  
advocacy can be a specialist technique, and that there will  
be a continuing need for the services of barristers. Once  
again, however, it is not necessary to include such a  
provision in primary legislation. My right hon. Friend the  
Lord Chancellor gave a firm commitment in the other  
place that he would give guidance to the commission  
under clause 23 that, in the interests of justice, it should  
keep under review the availability of specialist advocates  
and other services. I repeat that undertaking.

<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Will the Government publish the Lord  
Chancellor's guidance? 

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I anticipate that that will be the case. I see  
no reason why we should not publish such guidance.  
Ministers will certainly be accountable to Parliament, and  
if hon. Members are concerned about a lack of  
commitment, they will be able to challenge them. 

<P>
Amendment No. 92 goes further than amendment 
No. 90. It seeks to secure a permanently privileged  
position for the Bar. I have already explained that we are  
keen for the Bar to enter into contracts with the  
commission, but it must organise itself to make it a  
practical proposition. 

<P>
Amendment No. 91 is unnecessary. It is not our  
intention often to use the power in clause 7(3)(b), which  
empowers the commission to secure services by making  
direct payments to providers. The Legal Services  
Commission will purchase legal services as part of the  
Community Legal Service, almost entirely through  
contracts. To the extent that payments are made directly,  
clause 25 already provides adequate provision for the  
Lord Chancellor to make remuneration orders. 

<P>
I hope that, in the light of those explanations, the hon.  
Member for Torridge and West Devon will withdraw the  
amendment. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> We are not entirely moved by what the  
Minister has said. Notwithstanding that, I beg to ask leave  
to withdraw the amendment. 

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We now come to amendment No. 93,  
which is narrowly drawn. The main debate will come on  
schedule 2. I hope that the Committee will bear that in  
mind. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> In the light of your advice, 
Mrs. Dunwoody, I shall postpone my arguments on that  
amendment and wrap them up in our debates on  
schedule 2. I shall not move the amendment. 
 
 
 

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the  
Bill. 

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it may be convenient to  
discuss the following: New clause 14 Contracts for  
provision of services  

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. (1) The objective of the Commission in entering into contracts  
shall be to provide the greatest possible choice of good quality legal  
services for those using the services of the Community Legal  
Service. 

<P>
(2) In entering into contracts the Commission shall  

<P>
(a) contract with every supplier who meets appropriate quality  
criteria and who wishes to provide services under the  
Community Legal Service, 

<P>
(b) offer each contractor a contract for at least the same number  
of cases as they undertook in the year preceding, 

<P>
(c) not set a minimum level for the number of cases for which  
it is willing to contract, 

<P>
(d) provide in each contract for separate payment, in addition to  
the contract sum, to be paid for disbursements reasonably  
incurred, and 

<P>
(e) define in each contract the number of hours' work, or a  
number of cases, to be undertaken for the contract sum.'.

New Clause 15 Contracts

shall be to provide the greatest possible choice of good quality legal  
services for those using the services of the Community Legal  
Service. 

<P>
(2) The Commission shall therefore adopt the following principles  
in entering into contracts  

<P>
(a) the Commission shall contract with every supplier who  
meets prescribed quality criteria and who wishes to provide  
services under the Community Legal Service; 

<P>
(b) subject to paragraph (c), the Commission shall offer each  
contractor a contract for at least the same number of cases  
as they undertook in the year preceding the year of  
contracts; 

<P>
(c) where the total number of cases to be funded in any category  
of work in a particular region is to be reduced below the  
number undertaken in the previous year, the Commission  
may make proportionate reductions in the number of cases to  
be funded by each contractor in the region concerned; 

<P>
(d) the Commission shall not set a minimum level for the  
number of cases for which it is willing to contract; 

<P>
(e) contracts shall provide for separate payment, in addition to  
the contract sum, to be paid for disbursements reasonably  
incurred, and for the costs of advocacy in court; and

(f) contracts shall define the number of hours' work, or the  
number of cases, to be undertaken for the contract sum.'.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): I, too, welcome you to  
the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody. As this is the first time that I  
have spoken in this Committee, I declare an interest as a  
non-practising solicitor, which I declared in the Register  
of Members' Interests and on Second Reading. 

<P>
I simply want to ask my hon. Friend the Minister a  
question that would have been too long-winded as an  
intervention. I assured the members of Stafford law  
society that I would ask the Minister about the future  
provision of services through contracts and, in particular,  
about how new solicitors or legal practitioners will break  
into the system of contracts. 

<P>
Perhaps it would be helpful to explain that I come from  
that part of the profession that might be summed up by  
the words that Shakespeare put in the mouth of Julius  
Ceasar when describing the conspirator Cassius. It is the  
part of the profession that 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"has a lean and hungry look"	. 
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Certainly lean these days. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> It is the double-breasted jacket. 

<P>
It is the part of the profession that is always keen to  
look for a new market. It is independent in spirit and has  
ideas of challenging authority and independence, such as  
those that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield mentioned  
in his speech on Second Reading. It is the sort of  
enterprise of which my right hon. Friend the Prime  
Minister would be proud. 

<P>
When those solicitors and lawyers want to set up in  
future, they will need a contract to be able to practise legal  
aid work as part of their new business. How do they break  
into the system of contracts? Will they be like farmers  
with their milk quotas? Will they have to buy someone  
else's contract rights to be able to practise in legal aid  
matters, or will contracts be available because the Lord  
Chancellor's Department recognises the value of those  
spirited and independent individuals? 

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Would that those contracts were like  
dairy quotas, because they have a significant inherent  
value. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> That is precisely what worries me. 

<P>
<B> </B><P>
Mr. Garnier: I shall briefly ask the Minister a detailed  
question on clause 7. The meaning of subsection (8)(b)  
may be clear in his mind no doubt, he had a direct hand  
in drafting it but it does not tell us very much. I should  
be grateful to the Minister if he would explain for the  
record precisely what he means by the expression, 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Lord Chancellor ... may authorise the Commission to fund  
the provision of any of those services in specified circumstances or,  
if the Commission request him to do so, in an individual case."	 

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
What is in the Government's directing mind in that  
paragraph? 

<P>
Will the Minister also explain whether it is the  
Government's policy that it should be the normal practice  
for the fees of experts not to be paid until the end of any  
case? It has been suggested that it may be proper to delay  
the payment of experts' fees until a case has finished. I  
suggest that that runs directly contrary to the new civil  
procedure rules, which expressly state that an expert owes  
a primary duty to the court. 

<P>
How can an expert maintain the necessary  
independence if he or she is involved in the funding of  
the litigation? In cases that are lost, is it not at least  
possible that a solicitor may ask the expert to accept either  
no fee or a reduced fee? Will that not lead to fees being  
loaded in successful cases? It is one thing for an expert  
voluntarily to accept deferred payment, but is it the  
Government's policy that that should become a normal  
method of funding litigation? 
 
 
 

<P>
New clauses 14 and 15 are entirely self-explanatory,  
and I invite the Government to comment on them. 

<P>
<H5>12 noon </H5>
</P>
 

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon: First, I shall deal with the specific points  </B><P>
that have been made. My hon. Friend the Member for  
Stafford (Mr. Kidney) asked about how new practitioners  
could break into the system of contracts. I know that  
solicitors across the country not simply those in  
Stafford are anxious about that, but the answer is the  
same whether they are in Stafford or elsewhere. The  
provision of contracts will involve flexibility. Those who  
have not previously secured contracts will have an  
opportunity to apply, subject to their being able to show  
that they have the appropriate quality standards and that  
they can deal with the work. 

<P>
I am sometimes tempted to think that many firms of  
solicitors develop by the constant process of splitting and  
change that law firms undergo. [Interruption.] My  
apologies, Mr. Dunwoody. The process of securing  
contracts will involve ensuring that a firm or individual  
possesses the necessary expertise to hold a contract. It will  
not be like milk quotas the firm will not possess the  
contract and will not be able to trade it. I am relieved to  
be able to say that the contract will not, therefore, have  
any value, which was a pernicious consequence of the  
imposition of milk quotas which was never intended. 

<P>
Clause 7(8)(b) is designed to provide flexibility. If a  
wholly exceptional individual case arises, which would  
otherwise be in an excluded category, the Legal Services  
Commission will be able to ask the Lord Chancellor to  
authorise funding. I hope that all members of the  
Committee will applaud that welcome flexibility. 

<P>
The making of payments to experts is not the  
responsibility of government in any way. It is a matter for  
negotiation between the parties. I do no believe that the  
Government should prescribe a policy one way or the  
other.

<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The Government have no view on that  
matter at all? 

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I did not say that. I said that the  
Government have no policy on it, which is a very different  
matter. The Government do not have a policy because  
such matters are resolved by individual negotiation  
between solicitors and experts, presumably in consultation  
with the clients. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I accept that the Government have no  
policy on the matter, but the Minister implies that they  
have a view on it. Perhaps he can tell us what their view  
is. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Having said that the Government have no  
policy on the matter, I see no reason to explain what the  
Government's view might or might not be. I think that the  
hon. and learned Gentleman is seeking the elucidation of a  
point that is not worth making. he knows what the current  
position is, and the Bill will not change it. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Will the Minister give way? 

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Not on the same point. 

<P>
I shall deal with new clauses 14 and 15. The  
Government are unable to accept either of them because  
they are unnecessarily prescriptive. They would enable  
lawyers to demand public money not on any basis of need  
but on that of past experience. The scheme under the new  
clauses would be cumbersome and would effectively  
negate the benefits that the Government wish to come  
from the move to contracting. 
 
 
 

<P>
Unless the hon. and learned Member for Harborough  
wants to press either of the new clauses to a Division or  
wants to explain them in more detail than he has done so  
far, I hope that my resistance to them will be sufficient  
and that they will not be pursued.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Schedule 2 establishes which categories of  
case or which proceedings are eligible for which types of  
funded service under the Community Legal Service.  
Clause 5 sets out the broad types of service that the  
commission shall provide as part of the Community Legal  
Service. The schedule limits the circumstances in which  
those services may, for the time being, be provided. 

<P>
Amendment No. 7 simplifies and clarifies schedule 2.  
Although the amendment is lengthy, it does not make any  
major changes to the exclusions set out in the schedule. It  
will ensure that the schedule accurately and clearly gives  
effect to the Government's intentions, as set out in the  
White Paper and explained by the Lord Chancellor in the  
debates on the Bill in another place. The original schedule  
2 contained several drafting infelicities and some obsolete  
or unnecessary provisions. It lacked precision and clarity.  
The amendment revises schedule 2 to make it more  
precise and more concise. 
 
 
 

<P>
I shall explain the provisions of the revised schedule  
before I clarify the changes that have been made to the  
original version. The revised schedule has two paragraphs.  
The first lists the areas of law for which the Legal  
Services Commission may not fund any help, except  
general information about the law, the legal system and  
the availability of legal services. In other words, specific  
advice about a case and more substantial services in those  
categories may not be funded by the Legal Services  
Commission as part of the Community Legal Service. 

<P>
The second paragraph lists the courts and proceedings  
for which the Legal Services Commission may fund  
advocacy. They range from proceedings in the county  
courts, for example, to specific proceedings in magistrates  
courts. Any other proceedings those not covered by  
paragraphs 1 or 2 will be eligible for all services,  
except advocacy. 

<P>
I turn now to the differences between the old and new  
versions of the schedule. Paragraphs 1 to 3 of the original  
schedule have been combined to make one paragraph.  
Although the intended scope of each paragraph was the  
same, the wording was different because of the use of the  
word "proceedings"	 in paragraphs 2 and 3. By avoiding  
the word, it has been possible to combine the two  
paragraphs into one. The revised paragraph adopts the  
words of clause 5(2)(a). It remains the Government's  
intention that the very basic services described in that  
provision should be available for all types of problem or  
case. 

<P>
The proposed paragraph 1(a) deals with the removal  
from scope of most personal injury cases. That is limited  
to injury allegedly caused by negligence and, as such, the  
exclusion would not apply, for example, to allegations of  
abuse or assault. As the Government have repeatedly  
stated, some cases of negligently caused damage will  
remain eligible for public funding because they are not  
well-suited to conditional fees. For that reason, the Lord  
Chancellor intends to direct that cases with high overall  
or initial investigative costs and those of wider public  
interest shall remain eligible for consideration for funding. 

<P>
The proposed paragraphs 1(b) to (h) repeat the other  
exclusions previously set down in paragraphs 1 to 3 of  
schedule 2 for matters of conveyancing, boundary  
disputes, the making of wills, matters of trust law,  
defamation or malicious falsehood, matters of company  
or partnership law and other matters arising from the  
carrying on of a business. Within those broad exclusions  
are several specific matters that should continue to be  
eligible for funding, and the Lord Chancellor intends to  
use his power also to direct or provide for them. 

<P>
We intend to provide for advice and assistance about  
wills and conveyancing in circumstances where it is  
currently available under the green form scheme, which  
covers advice about wills for disabled people and those  
over 70 years old. 

<P>
The existing paragraph 3(d) provides for funding for  
proceedings relating to a trust. 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"arising from the joint ownership or occupation of domestic  
property"	. 
 
 
 

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
The way in which the proposed new paragraph 1 is drafted  
makes it unnecessary to refer specifically to that. The  
schedule does not exclude funding when an issue about a  
trust, a company or partnership arises in what is  
essentially an ancillary relief case. The exclusion in  
proposed paragraph 1(h) for matters arising out of the  
carrying on of a business is still intended to apply to  
business men or women bringing and defending cases, not  
to consumers bringing cases against businesses. 

<P>
Paragraph 4 of the original schedule has been removed  
because it is unnecessary. It was drafted to mirror the  
provisions of the current Legal Aid Act 1988. The  
proceedings listed in the paragraph are mainly obsolete or  
rare and can be dealt with satisfactorily by giving them a  
low priority in the funding code. Paragraph 5 of the  
existing schedule deals with those proceedings for which  
the commission may fund representation. That is too  
broad a term and has been changed to "advocacy"	 to  
reflect more accurately the scope of the existing scheme. 

<P>
The amendment would remove paragraph 5(3)(j),  
which provides for advocacy to be available for  
proceedings in a magistrates court if a person is at risk of  
imprisonment for failure to pay a fine. Because of the risk  
of imprisonment, we believe that it is more appropriate to  
provide for help in such proceedings under the Criminal  
Defence Service than under the Community Legal  
Service. The Lord Chancellor will prescribe those  
proceedings under clause 13(3)(g), so that any person who  
is before a magistrates court for any such proceedings will  
be entitled to help. Paragraph 2 contains some other  
minor changes. 

<P>
Paragraph 5(3)(b) of the original schedule in the Bill as  
drafted has been omitted. It related to section 10A of the  
Fire Precautions Act 1971, which deals with fire  
certificates for non-domestic properties. As the Bill  
excludes help for matters arising from carrying on a  
business, the provision was considered anomalous. 

<P>
We have added to the list of proceedings for which  
advocacy services will be available devolution issues  
heard by the Privy Council; the variation of certain orders  
under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997; and  
issues under part IV of the Family Law Act 1996. Finally,  
when any of the listed courts or tribunals make a referral  
to another person or body, funding for advocacy will  
remain available. 

<P>
I hope that the amendment will make the Bill clearer,  
simpler and above all shorter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> As a new collection of words for the  
schedule, the amendment is entirely acceptable. It is  
clearer and, as the Minister explained, preferable to the  
words in the Bill as drafted. However, we disagree with  
the Government not about the wording of the schedule  
but about what it says and what it leaves out. We are  
worried that many members of the public will be denied  
access to justice deliberately or unwittingly, it does not  
matter which as a consequence of the wording in the  
amendment. 
 
 
 

<P>
I should like first to speak briefly to amendment No. 129,  
which is tabled in my name and in those of my hon. Friends,  
and subsequently, if it be convenient for the Committee, to  
say a few words about amendments Nos. 130 to 132. Before  
I do so, however, I draw the Committee's attention to  
amendments Nos. 55, 53, 56, 73 and 43, tabled in my name  
and in those of my hon. Friends. To some extent, we may  
have reached cross-Committee agreement, because we  
want to make it permissible for legal assistance to be given  
to those appearing before tribunals and coroners courts. 

<P>
One of the best suggestions made on Second Reading  
was that of the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)  
for a combination of tribunals in public inquiries. He  
made the sensible suggestion that the King's Cross rail  
disaster inquiry, for example, should have been able to sit  
as a coroners court, in order to save the bereaved and  
those who were badly affected by the disaster having to  
suffer the trauma more than once. 

<P>
Sometimes the chairman of such inquiries is a judge,  
sometimes a leading Queen's counsel if I dare use those  
words when praising the hon. Member for Hendon; no  
doubt he has to wash his mouth out every time he utters  
them. The chairman of that inquiry and the chairman of  
the Clapham rail disaster inquiry were leading lawyers, as  
was, I think I cannot remember, but I shall be corrected  
if he or she was not the chairman of the Marchioness  
disaster inquiry. 

<P>
Those inquiries could have easily performed the  
function currently carried out by a coroners court. It  
would be humane and sensible not only for the functions  
of the separate inquiry and coroners court to be combined  
as the hon. Member for Hendon suggests, but for those  
who have an interest in appearing before inquiries or  
coroners courts to have access, in the event of insufficient  
funds of their own, to representation and advice both at  
and prior to their attendance. That is why I draw attention  
at the outset of my remarks to amendment No. 43. 

<P>
I also draw attention to amendments Nos. 53, 56 and  
55 because they deal with  

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. On a point of information, I  
draw the Committee's attention to the fact that if  
Government amendment No. 7 is accepted, the other  
amendments will fall because they are amendments to the  
original schedule. 

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm </H5>
</P>
 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier: That is precisely right, Mrs. Dunwoody.  </B><P>
However, I wish to draw those later amendments to the  
Committee's attention because they contain within them  
matters that may appeal to members of the Committee.  
When deciding whether the Government amendment is  
acceptable, members of the Committee should bear in  
mind that they will be denied the opportunity for the  
suggestion of the hon. Member for Hendon on Second  
Reading to reach the statute book on this occasion.  
However, there may be another opportunity to persuade  
the Government that that particularly good idea should  
reach the statute book. 

<P>
I hope that all members of the Committee will consider  
the points made about the need for assistance with  
representation in not only coroners' courts but for other  
sorts of tribunal. Amendment No. 55 deals with  
employment tribunals, for example. 

<P>
The noble and learned Lord Donaldson of Lymington,  
the former Master of the Rolls, tabled an amendment that  
was designed to ensure that legal aid would be available  
to those appearing before employment tribunals. The Lord  
Chancellor was at his most lofty that evening and simply  
said that he would not accept it. He was rebuked by the  
former Master of the Rolls, who said that that was not  
good enough. He may well be Lord Chancellor, but it is  
not good enough for a perfectly sensible and reasonable  
argument certainly not one put forward by the former  
Master of the Rolls to be dealt with in that rather  
high-handed fashion. It was interesting to see the Lord  
Chancellor becoming somewhat red in the face, having to  
provide a better explanation for his Government's policy. 

<P>
The wording of the Government's schedule, in both its  
amended and unamended form, does not make it possible  
for the least well off to gain access, with public assistance,  
to industrial tribunals. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I was fascinated by my hon. Friend's  
description of what happened in another place. Does he  
think that the main reason for the Lord Chancellor's  
embarrassment was because he was acting under orders  
from Her Majesty's Treasury and that the Government  
were not prepared to afford the cost of extending legal aid  
to employment tribunals? 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> From the little I know of the present  
Lord Chancellor, I do not believe that he acts under  
anyone's orders. None the less, it is a point worth making  
in front of a collection of hon. Members who, I am sure,  
have the interests of their constituents at the forefront of  
their minds. 

<P>
It is usually the case that dismissed employees are short  
of funds, and sufficiently so that they may be unable to  
afford privately funded lawyers to help them. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster </B>(Hastings and Rye): Will  
the hon. and learned Gentleman give way? 
 
 
 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> In a moment. 

<P>
There will be cases when a dismissed employee  
belongs to a federation, a trade union or some other  
organisation that will assist in funding his representation.  
Trade union membership is declining. 

<P>
<B> </B><P>
Mr. Dismore: On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. 

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Point of order? 

<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I am sorry, Mrs. Dunwoody. It was not  
a point of order. I wanted to intervene. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am sure that the hon. Member for  
Hendon wants many things. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Will the hon. and learned Gentleman  
give way? 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I will, but first I shall give way to the  
hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Mr. Foster). 

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster:</B> Trade union membership  
has started to increase, which is highly desirable.  
Although it is desirable to have legal aid for employment  
tribunals, does the hon. and learned Gentleman agree that  
conditional fees are wholly appropriate to tribunals and  
have been used widely for some time? 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am not sure whether the hon.  
Gentleman is right or wrong. I should be surprised if  
conditional fee arrangements have been used in industrial  
tribunals, but the hon. Gentleman's experience may be  
greater than mine. 

<P>
In any event, the argument has not been resolved. A  
substantial proportion of allegedly unfairly dismissed  
employees will be unable to secure the necessary  
insurance to underpin their conditional fee arrangement.  
They will be unable to attract the attention of a  
business-like lawyer to take on their case, so will be  
denied access to justice. 

<P>
Some will appear before industrial tribunals because of  
trade union assistance or some other federation or  
association assistance, but a huge number of people will  
be unable to do so. Amendment No. 55 endeavours to  
deal with that, and I shall be interested to hear whether  
Labour Members can persuade the Government that  
industrial tribunals should be a forum in which publicly  
funded assistance is available. The other tribunals referred  
to in our amendments are set out in the amendment paper,  
so I shall not delay the Committee further by going  
through the examples, as my arguments in favour of legal  
assistance apply equally to those. 

<P>
I want to try to persuade the Committee to support  
amendment No. 129, although I accept what will happen  
if the Government have their way and their amendment  
No. 7 is carried. Before voting for Government  
amendment No. 7, I want the Committee to consider what  
they will be doing. Amendment No. 129 is intended to  
allow the Legal Services Commission to make loans to  
individuals who would otherwise be financially eligible  
for assistance in personal injury and property damage  
cases, but who are proceeding on a conditional fee basis.  
It will ensure that those of moderate means will not be  
deprived of assistance in pursuing reasonable claims by  
virtue of an inability to afford insurance premiums or  
disbursements, such as experts' reports and court fees. 

<P>
Clause 4(2) (c) gives the Legal Services Commission  
the power to make loans. However, the loans can be made  
only to those whose services are funded by the  
commission. If funding is not available and the claimant  
enters into a fee arrangement with his lawyer, no  
assistance will be available to help with the payment of  
his disbursements and insurance premiums. For those who  
would not otherwise be eligible for legal aid, funding for  
insurance premiums and disbursements will usually be  
provided out of the claimant's own resources or through  
bank loans. The Government suggest that for individuals  
who cannot afford it, solicitors will invest in their cases  
by paying those premiums and disbursements. 

<P>
We have debated ad nauseam the Government's belief  
that lawyers are so enthusiastic about making more and  
more money and that profits will be so much easier to  
come by under conditional fee arrangements that they are  
prepared to fund additional disbursements. Why then are  
solicitors not flocking to join the Government's  
bandwagon in support of CFAs? 
 
 
 

<P>
The Government's confidence is misplaced; it appears  
to rely on a report from KPMG, which considered  
hypothetical models and advised that after some years,  
conditional fee arrangements would be very profitable for  
solicitors. Most of those models assumed that there would  
be little income for the partners of the firms in the  
intervening years before they became very profitable. 

<P>
Separate research carried out for the Law Society by  
the Institute for the Study of the Legal Profession at the  
university of Sheffield examined in detail the accounts of  
several different types and sizes of firm that were likely  
to undertake conditional fee work. That was research into  
real firms, not pretend or model firms as in the KPMG  
research paper. The university of Sheffield's research  
showed that a substantial cash flow problem arose even  
for firms that were currently profitable and cash rich. As  
I explained to the Minister last week, most small to  
medium-sized firms of solicitors are not cash rich and do  
not have long lines of credit at their banks. Therefore, it  
is an inescapable fact that few of them will be able to  
invest as the Government desire. 

<P>
In reality, the poor will have to take out loans for  
disbursements or premiums. Where their financial  
circumstances do not permit bank or finance loans, they  
will be dependent on solicitors lending the money. The  
argument therefore becomes circular. 

<P>
Minister have suggested that trade union firms fund  
disbursements, so all firms should be able to do so, but  
that misunderstands the nature of the work for one or  
more large clients, where lawyers can be certain of  
volume and price their arrangements accordingly. It is  
impossible to provide that same facility for individual  
clients. 

<P>
The Government have also argued that in Ulster in  
fact, in all Northern Ireland it is traditional for lawyers  
to fund disbursements. That fails to take into account the  
fact that there is a much quicker turnover in personal  
injury cases in that jurisdiction, even in comparison with  
the likely timetable under the new civil procedure rules  
introduced by the right hon. Lord Woolf, the Master of  
the Rolls. Once proceedings are commenced, most  
personal injury actions in Northern Ireland are likely to  
conclude within about three months. 

<P>
The amendment would therefore permit the  
commission to make loans to individuals I stress to  
individual claimants, not to lawyers to fund  
disbursements and premiums if they would otherwise be  
financially eligible for assistance. We say that there is  
little risk to the legal aid fund. The money would be  
repayable out of damages in successful cases. In  
unsuccessful cases, it would be recovered from  
after-the-event insurance. 

<P>
Amendments Nos. 130 to 132 stand in my name, those  
of my hon. Friends and of the hon. Members for  
Montgomeryshire (Mr. OÏpik) and for Torridge and West  
Devon. I shall concentrate at the outset on amendment  
No. 130, which seeks to introduce to the ambit of schedule  
2 six classes of case to which its exclusion does not apply.  
In addition to proceedings for clinical negligence, which  
the Government admitted about a year ago should remain  
available for public assistance, the amendment concerns: 
 
 
 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) cases for children and people suffering from a mental  
disability, 

<P>
(iii) cases where the overall costs are likely to exceed £25,000, 

<P>
(iv) cases where the costs of investigation are likely to exceed  
£3,000, 

<P>
(v) complex cases where damages are likely to exceed £50,000, 

<P>
(vi) cases involving multiple causes of action. 
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So far as I understand it, those five classes of case are  
likely to be ineligible for publicly funded legal assistance  
if the Bill is enacted. It is important that, before Labour  
Members vote in favour of the Government's amendment  
to introduce changed words to the schedule, they realise  
what is being removed and whether they think that is a  
good idea. 

<P>
No one doubts that the current legal aid scheme for  
personal injury cases is a success. Its net cost to the state  
represents good public value for money as well as good  
value for money for the victims. In 1996-1997, personal  
injury lawyers in legally aided personal injury cases,  
excluding medical negligence, achieved £502 million of  
compensation for more than 76,000 legally aided accident  
victims. They did so at a net cost to the public purse of  
only £34 million, which is a minuscule amount compared  
with the overall gross domestic product, and they  
achieved about £90 million in benefits.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett: Does the hon. and learned Gentleman  </B><P>
agree that those costs are minuscule compared with last  
week's announced budget surplus of £7.4 billion? 

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It might help if the hon.  
Gentleman sticks to the amendment. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The figure referred to by the hon.  
Gentleman and the Opposition amendments speak for  
themselves. 

<P>
In addition to about £90 million-worth of benefits that  
was repaid to the Department of Social Security by  
insurers, the cases to which I referred also brought with  
them substantial savings to the national health service and  
supported public interest in holding wrongdoers liable in  
damages, with consequent improvements in health and 
 
safety. The Government propose to abolish legal aid for  
all personal injury cases, other than cases involving  
medical negligence. We do not believe that all cases  
currently funded under legal aid can be brought under  
CFAs as proposed by the Government a point that I  
have made on Second Reading and on other occasions. 

<P>
Although CFAs have worked successfully in personal  
injury cases since they were introduced three-and-a-half  
years ago, they are still a relatively new type of funding.  
At present, they can run alongside traditional legal aid.  
Little research has been published about how they are  
working in practice. At least three times as many clients  
are helped each year under legal aid as sign up for CFAs.  
Anecdotal evidence suggests that financial risk to the  
lawyer leads to fewer difficult, but meritorious, cases  
being taken on. I used the term "anecdotal evidence"	  
because the Minister is fond of quoting it when referring  
to the use of insurance to support CFAs. 
 
 
 

<P>
The poor may be deprived of access to justice because  
lawyers may not be able to pay on their behalf the  
insurance premium and disbursements and invest in  
investigating cases without payment up front.  
Furthermore, because lawyers will be paid only if they  
win, they are less likely to take on difficult or complicated  
cases. Indeed, evidence suggests that some insurers are  
requiring solicitors to take on cases subject to their  
insurance only if there is a more than 85 per cent. prospect  
of success. It is almost an unreal assessment. 

<P>
Over the past few weeks, there has been much debate  
in the press and elsewhere about the type of cases that  
won compensation with legal aid funding, but which will  
be unlikely to do so under the CFA proposals. I shall not  
go into detail about such cases, but they are there for us  
all to study. 

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I did not want to interrupt the  
hon. and learned Gentleman but, given the extraneous  
noise, I ask members of the Committee to make it more  
easy for a record to be taken of our proceedings. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> In the explanatory notes to the Bill, the  
Government suggest that some legal aid might be  
retained. 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"where exceptionally high investigative costs or overall costs are  
likely to be necessary, or where issues of wider public interest are  
involved."	 

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
That would be by way of direction by the Lord Chancellor  
and its content or any variation would not be subject to  
parliamentary scrutiny. That is not in the interest of  
accident victims, who should know where they stand in  
relation to the availability of legal aid. Changes should be  
subjected to parliamentary scrutiny and debate, and such  
procedure should be expressly included in the Bill. As my  
hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said, we are  
very worried about that. 

<P>
The hon. Member for Hendon is right; I am being  
assisted in my argument by the briefing that I have  
received from the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers.  
It is not the only organisation that is worried about what  
the Government are doing. The Conservative party as a  
whole and, I suspect, many Labour Members are worried  
about being required, whether they like it or not, to vote  
for something that will lead to a denial of access to justice  
for huge swathes of the public. 

<P>
Previously, either in Committee or on the Floor of the  
House, I used the expression "the law of the unintended  
consequence"	. That intended consequence may not  
become apparent for a few years, but a time will come  
perhaps several Labour Members will still be Members  
of the House of Commons when it does when ordinary  
members of the public will ask at advice surgeries, "Why  
did you introduce a Bill that has led to my not being able  
to take my children's, my own or my elderly relations'  
cases to court or subject them to some form of dispute  
resolution? You have taken away my right and my  
family's right we are a poor family to gain access to  
the law."	 

<P>
As I said at the outset, the language of the  
Government's new version of the schedule, which has  
been produced this morning, is better than that of the  
original. None the less, the schedule will still cause the  
disbenefit to the public that I discussed and about which  
not only the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers and  
other lawyers' groups but consumer groups are worried  
about. It is no good the Minister or the Lord Chancellor  
saying that this is a lawyers' whinge and that we are  
scaremongering. That is an unworthy line to take when  
they know if they do not by now, they jolly well  
should that the Government's proposals will lead to the  
adverse consequences that I have drawn to the  
Committee's attention. 
 
 
 

<P>
The Association of Personal Injury Lawyers and I have  
argued that certain types of case should continue to  
receive legal aid funding as they are unsuitable for  
conditional fee arrangements complex cases and those  
that involve high investigative costs, especially industrial  
disease cases, multi-party actions and pharmaceutical  
claims. Amendment No. 130 specifically refers to some of  
those. The Lord Chancellor did not accept the arguments  
advanced. He believes that CFAs will work, but suggested  
that he will retain the power to bring cases back within  
the scope of legal aid if that proves not to be the case. 

<P>
Yet again, however, we are faced with a vague and  
uncertain regime and set of arrangements. That is a  
function of the Bill, which is no more than a collection of  
clothes pegs on which the Government from time to time  
will hang their little policies. Regardless of whether legal  
aid is withdrawn for some or all personal injury cases, it  
should be extended to allow representation for victims'  
families before coroners' inquests into death and public  
judicial inquiries, which I discussed at the outset. I ask  
the Government to bear in mind the suggestion of the hon.  
Member for Hendon. 

<P>
The arguments in favour of amendments Nos. 130 to  
132 are broadly similar. Amendment No. 131 would add  
the words 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"save where compelling reasons exist"	. 

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
Paragraph 3 of the schedule states: 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Services consisting of the provision of help in bringing or  
defending  

<P>
(a) proceedings for negligence where the alleged damage is to  
property or the person, other than proceedings for clinical  
negligence"	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B> </B><P>
The Chairman: Order. The hon. and learned  
Gentleman is setting out his arguments with great clarity,  
but not with quite as much clarity as the Committee  
would like. 
 
 
 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> You encourage me, Mrs. Dunwoody, and  
I shall endeavour to persuade the Committee not only that  
my arguments carry force in themselves but that the  
louder I speak, the better they are. 

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Not an unusual attitude in the House  
of Commons. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> It is not an attitude that I readily adopt,  
but circumstances force me to do so. Unfortunately, this  
may be one of the last shouts on behalf of legal aid in this  
Parliament. As I said at the outset, legal aid has brought  
huge social benefits to the public and I would have  
thought that the Labour party stood for social benefits  
it used to, before the new Labour, or right-wing,  
government. [Laughter]. Even if the machinery that  
records what we are saying does not pick up my words,  
it will perhaps have picked up the sniggering laughter of  
the Government and their supporters as the legal aid  
system is washed down the sluice of history. 

<P>
My concluding remarks address amendment No. 132,  
which would insert the following words: 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) A compelling reason for the purposes of paragraph 3(a) above  
exists where; 

<P>
(a) the case is one which a private client of sufficient but not  
superabundant means would be likely to wish to pursue  
or defend; 

<P>
(b) it is not practical for the case to be conducted on a  
conditional fee basis.'. 

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
We seek to introduce means to enable those who cannot  
afford to bring actions but who have cases with sufficient  
merit and which come within the scope of cases set out  
in amendment No. 130 to bring them before the courts.  
We believe that that is socially just and economically  
sensible. 

<P>
I have on several occasions said that the Government  
are economically illiterate, intellectually confused and  
socially divisive. There is no better example of that  
argument being made good than in regard to the schedule,  
which sows the seeds for long queues of confused,  
dissatisfied people who voted Labour turning up at  
Labour Members' surgeries to ask, "What on earth have  
you done?"	 Unless the Government can satisfactorily  
explain their proposals, not only to lawyers but to the  
wider public who will be denied access to justice they  
will increasingly lose credibility and the support of all  
people of good will. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Opposition to the abolition of legal aid  
for personal injury cases is the one measure that united  
the Opposition parties and several Labour Members  
on Second Reading. It seems amazing that a Labour  
Government could introduce such a measure because it  
impacts on the poorest and most vulnerable in our society.  
I have always thought that that was a fundamental tenet  
that drove people to become members of the Labour party  
and Labour Members of Parliament. How can an  
individual with no means afford a £161 premium for  
after-the-event defendants' costs? That figure will  
change last year, it doubled; it was about £80 a year  
ago. As I said, it will continue to rise inexorably.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman  
makes the point that premiums will increase. As the  
market widens and more players come in, the normal rules  
of market economy will surely dictate that the fees will  
reduce rather than increase. Why does the hon. Gentleman  
believe otherwise? 
 
 
 

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm </H5>
</P>
 

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett: The market began in 1965. It has been  </B><P>
widening ever since and premiums have risen inexorably.  
It distresses me that Labour Members are, in effect,  
disbarring an enormous number of poor people from  
seeking access to justice and defending their own rights.  
It is dreadful that the Government have produced this  
legislation. The Minister says that it is for small and  
medium-sized firms of lawyers to pay that money, but  
they do not have it. 

<P>
The Committee will remember the discussions on the  
earnings basis on what was last year's Finance Bill, and  
the changes that were made. It was apparent to the  
Government, because they gave way on it, that lawyers'  
profits and lawyers' ability to get hold of up-front money  
were not that great. Lawyers could not make the change  
in three years, so the change was rightly covered by a  
nine-year period. 

<P>
The money to make the payments does not exist, and  
lawyers cannot take this business opportunity, as the  
Minister inelegantly called it. It is a dreadful shame that  
the Government have decided to make this change.  
I deprecate and renounce it, and I hope that some Labour  
Members will think again and vote against it. 

<P>
I want to address amendments Nos. 130, 131 and 132,  
which are in my name, that of my hon. Friend the Member  
for Montgomeryshire and various Conservative Members.  
We want to add to the list of cases exempted from the  
general prohibition on funding under schedule 2. The types  
of cases that we suggest are especially difficult to fund on a  
conditional fee basis those involving children and people  
suffering mental disability. Amendment No. 130 seeks to  
place in the Bill a number of different categories of personal  
injury cases for which legal aid might continue to be  
available. Cases involving children and the mentally  
disabled will involve their litigation friends being  
responsible for making decisions about conditional fee  
arrangements and taking out any necessary insurance on  
their behalf. 

<P>
Litigation friends will normally be expected to give the  
court an undertaking to be personally responsible for any  
costs that might be ordered against the child or patient.  
There will be difficult decisions for litigation friends to  
make, although I concede that the situation will be  
improved if the success fee and insurance premiums are  
recoverable on a full indemnity basis. I raised that point  
with the Minister at Lord Chancellor's Questions some  
time ago. When he replies to this debate, will he assure  
us that they will not only be recoverable but recoverable  
on such a basis? It is not solely recoverability that I want  
the Minister to assure us of, but that the fee and premiums  
will be recoverable in toto. 

<P>
The Lord Chancellor has suggested that high cost cases  
or those with high investigative costs may result in his  
making a direction to fund. However, lawyers advising  
clients need to be able to refer to the statute to see whether  
a case comes within the scope of legal aid without needing  
to check whether the Lord Chancellor has made a  
direction or is minded to do so. The amendment would  
incorporate those assurances in the Bill. 
 
 
 

<P>
Cases involving multiple courses of action are  
necessarily difficult to conduct on a conditional fee basis.  
The collapse of the recent tobacco case well illustrates  
that point. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one  
of the main problems of the tobacco case was not the  
basis of the funding, but the fact that the lawyers lost the  
limitation point at an interlocutory hearing, which made  
them far less likely to succeed at trial if at all? 

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I must admit that the hon. Member for  
Hendon has made a good point. I shall continue that  
theme. One reason for the difficulty for CFAs involving  
multiple courses of action is that each individual will have  
to enter into a separate agreement with each client. Some  
litigants will drop out during the case; some will come in.  
CFAs cannot cover all such outcomes. In the light of my  
comments and those of the hon. and learned Member for  
Harborough, I hope that the Government will accept our  
amendments. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Part of the problem with our debate is  
that members of the Law Society and others who oppose  
the Government's action are considering legal aid and  
CFAs as they exist now, not as they will be under the  
new schedule 2. I welcome the major improvements to  
the CFAs. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I shall attempt to bowl the hon. Member  
for Hendon an equally compelling intervention as the one  
that he bowled me. Does the hon. Gentleman support the  
wholesale abolition of legal aid for personal injury cases? 

<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Of course I do not. The Government are  
not proposing that. There will be exceptions to which I  
shall refer later. Part of the problem with the debate was  
illustrated by the intervention of the hon. Member for  
Torridge and West Devon. There has been much hype  
in the debate and, given the Law Society's campaign, if  
anything it should go back to law school and learn the  
basis of courses of action and how to construe legislation.  
In all but one of the society's examples, there was no  
question of being denied legal aid, while the other  
example would be suitable for a CFA. 

<P>
The major improvements to CFAs, such as fairness pay,  
the success fee and the insurance premium will be greatly  
beneficial. One or two further improvements could be  
made, too. If we look back at this debate in a year or two,  
we will realise that our argument about access to justice  
for personal injury victims was somewhat academic. 

<P>
I accept that there have been problems with conditional  
fees. For example, disbursement funding has been  
mentioned, but new banking products are being developed  
to deal with that perhaps along the lines organised by  
trade union firms. Adverse selection has been responsible  
in large part for some of the hike in the insurance  
premiums. If anything, legal aid has distorted the CFA  
market because, under the present rules, before a CFA can  
be offered, the client must be offered legal aid if the case  
would fall within the existing rules, and that would distort  
the market. 
 
 
 

<P>
As lawyers become more used to risk assessments,  
which have been the practice across the Atlantic for many  
years, they will become more willing to use CFAs. The  
object of the Bill must be to look to the interest of the  
client, not that of the lawyers. Clients want the same as  
the Government: a competent personal injury lawyer at a  
reasonable price. The present system has failed to ensure  
quality for clients who instruct lawyers under the legal aid  
process. An advantage of the CFA scheme is that, to gain  
access to CFA insurance, for example, the lawyer must  
be a member of the Law Society personal injury panel,  
and therefore have at least a minimum level of  
competence, if not rather more, to conduct a conditional  
fee arrangement. Other accreditation arrangements are  
expected, such as the Association of Personal Injury  
Lawyers college of personal injury, which will be  
launched later this week. 

<P>
My experience in practice is that many people dabble  
in personal injury, often on the back of legal aid, who  
should not be doing such work. That experience has, if  
anything, been confirmed by my surgery experience. I am  
appalled by the quality of work that some of my erstwhile  
professional colleagues deliver to the public. For example,  
at my surgery on Friday, I heard about a legal aid case  
brought on behalf of a constituent who fell off a roof at  
work some six years ago. Unfortunately, he was not a  
member of the trade union. He applied for, and was  
granted, legal aid. 

<P>
Having examined the facts, on the face of it, it seemed  
a good case. However, the employer did not have an  
insurance policy. He had contravened the Employers  
Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969, and was not  
insured. One of the first questions that a personal injury  
lawyer should ask is, if I win the case, where will the  
damages come from? However, the lawyers ploughed on  
regardless. They received a barrister's opinion that the  
case had a 60 per cent. chance of success. The trial date  
was set for this May, some six years on but the Legal Aid  
Board pulled the plug on the case a couple of weeks ago.  
Not surprisingly, the client was very wound up about that,  
and ended up at my surgery. The case should never have  
reached that stage in the first place. The client should have  
been given a much better analysis of the problems of the  
case at a much earlier stage. He should have been warned  
about what would happen, because it was inevitable. 
 
 
 

<P>
That is one of the problems of the existing legal aid  
scheme. One of the lessons that we can learn from that  
case is about the benefits of block contracting and  
franchising, which will become the order of the day for  
other areas of work that will remain within the parameters  
of the legal aid scheme under schedule 2. Block  
contracting will provide quality control and price control.  
Moreover, the incentive under block contracting will not  
be, as it is now, to continue with a duff case at any cost  
because that is how the lawyer is paid. The incentive will  
be the opposite, as operates in trade union schemes to  
turn down bad cases early because the lawyer will not  
receive more money for continuing with them. From a  
client's point of view, it is far better to know where he  
stands at an early stage, rather than to have his hopes  
raised year after year only to have them dashed at the  
last minute. 

<P>
Of course I have reservations about the proposals, in  
particular about how the exceptions will operate. I hope  
that the Minister will flesh out how the public interest  
scheme and the arrangements for high investigation costs  
will work. Perhaps he could respond to cases such as  
those raised by The Lawyer magazine, which expressed  
valid anxieties that should be discussed. I know that my  
hon. Friend the Minister has done so in the press, and it  
would be helpful to have such a response on record. 

<P>
We must consider how to fund complex investigation  
cases, but the existing legal aid scheme is all or nothing.  
Some of the proposals in the Bill, such as allowing loans  
for high disbursement cases while expecting lawyers to  
fund work in progress, matches what happens in practice  
outside the legal aid scheme in trade union schemes or  
private cases. We can consider some of the more  
complicated industrial disease cases as high investigation  
cost cases. Several years ago, I handled what I think was  
the only case involving phosphorus tribromide poisoning.  
Luckily, it was funded by Unison, but it could have been  
a rather expensive case. I do not think that such a case  
has been brought since. I have great difficulty even in  
saying the name of the chemical. A lot of ground-breaking  
work is being done in industrial disease cases, such as  
linking some bladder cancers to exposure to industrial  
oils. Again, such cases may involve rather high  
investigative costs, which are often funded by trade  
unions. The private sector might be suitable for the cases  
under discussion. 

<P>
We should also consider product liability cases,  
especially pharmaceutical cases, which are often lumped  
in with clinical negligence but are different. Traditionally,  
they have had a low success rate, but they are of high  
public importance and must be examined. We must also  
consider how to deal with new points of law raised by  
cases such as in the personal injury sphere the recent  
asbestos claim cases in the House of Lords, in which the  
victim has died and another tort-feasor may be involved,  
or the case recently handled by my firm, relating to rates  
of return, which had peculiar problems, partly caused by  
the existing legal aid scheme. 

<P>
I should also like the scheme to be expanded to cover  
some of the areas that Opposition Members mentioned.  
However, tribunal work presents a problem compared  
with other litigation in that there are no cost orders in the  
normal course of events for employment or other  
tribunals. Although at the moment legal aid is, in effect,  
a loan as I have always tried to explain it to clients,  
using layman's terms for tribunal work it would  
constitute a grant and thus may be rather expensive. I  
hope that, if we can generate additional resources from  
the changes, we might be able to expand it to cover cases  
such as criminal injuries compensation appeals and motor  
insurance bureaux cases involving untraced motorists. 

<P>
I am grateful to the hon. and learned Member for  
Harborough for flagging up new clauses 10, which I have  
tabled. Without wishing to count my chickens before they  
are hatched, there is a case in some circumstances for  
considering coroners' inquests, too. however, such issues  
can be tackled only when we have the resources to do so.  
If being able to do so means that we can produce another  
method of funding that ensures quality access to justice  
for people bringing personal injury cases, and that people  
who cannot secure conditional fee arrangements for  
complex cases are protected through a public interest fund  
or high investigation cost arrangements, I would be  
satisfied.
