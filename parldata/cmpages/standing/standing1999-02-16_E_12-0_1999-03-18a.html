<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we begin, I draw the attention of the Committee to a misprint on the amendment paper. Amendment No. 259 relates to line 38 on page 46 and not, as is printed, to line 17. That means that amendment No. 259 should be marshalled after amendment No. 258; that is not surprising, even in the House of Commons. However, the mistake does not affect the Chairman's provisional selection and grouping list, as amendment No. 259 is in any case the next lead amendment selected after amendment No. 255. I hope that all hon. Members are paying attention, because I intend to ask questions.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Union Membership: Detriment</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move amendment No. 255, in page 46, line 14, after second "any" insert "wilful and".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 256, in page 46, line 14, after second "act", insert "by way of discrimination".
<P>
No. 257, in page 46, line 17, at end insert "wilful and".
<P>
No. 258, in page 46, line 20, after "individual", add "by way of discrimination."
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Thank you, Mrs Dunwoody, for clarifying that point on the later amendment. I chose not to speak on clause 2 because the Government have translated the meat of their proposals into schedules, as has been their wont lately.
<P>
Schedule 2 is somewhat more manageable than most of the schedules that we have been dealing with. When I first read it, I wondered whether I might have been short changed and whether another 11 pages were to come. However, we will not speculate further on that.
<P>
Conservative members have no difficulty in principle in accepting either the clause--which they did not seek to oppose--or the intention of the schedule. As the explanatory notes helpfully remind those of us who may not always have the information at the front of our mind, the measures related to the cases of Associated Newspapers v. Wilson and Associated British Ports v. Palmer, in which judges applied--as they are entitled to do--a literal interpretation of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992.
<P>
The cases were about whether actions were positive actions, but did not deal with failures to act, which are addressed under the schedule. I have no particular problem with that, but I tabled the amendments to probe a number of details.
<P>
As I have said to the Committee in a slightly different context, an act is a fact, but a failure to act is something of a speculation. A court must decide whether somebody has failed to act, and it is right that it should examine all the circumstances. However, it is a little easier for us to get hold of a positive act than to identify a negative act or a failure to act.
<P>
We tabled amendments Nos. 255 to 258 to find out two things. Amendment No. 255 would insert the word "wilful". I am by no means sure that that is the right adjective to use. Again in a different context, I have regularly said that the Government are rather fond of adjectives--rather fonder than they are of nouns. The amendment is an attempt to import a test of whether someone has wilful determination to be unfair to the trade unionist or person who has allegedly suffered detriment.
<P>
The Bill simply refers to a deliberate act, but that does not necessarily imply that the act was taken in that context.
<P>
That is what I am feeling after; the amendment is probing. I would like the Minister either to reassure me on it or to explain why his wording is more viable for what I think is a common intention.
<P>
The second point--which relates to amendment No. 256 and, as I will explain, to amendment No. 258--is that we should insert the words "by way of discrimination". That is another way of saying that the failure to act should be viewed in the context of deliberately trying to discriminate against the union member in particular.
<P>
As I have said, we are happy with the principle it is enshrined in the Conservative Government's consolidation legislation--that there should be no picking on union members. We are not discussing that issue. Employers may deliberately do things--or, in certain cases, deliberately fail to do things--that they judge to be perfectly reasonable parts of business practice.
<P>
A failure to act--the concept that schedule 2 imports--is a rather more slippery notion than a positive act that has taken place. By tabling the amendments, I am inviting the Minister to consider whether it would be sensible to include in the Bill a test of a wilful attempt to be unfair to the employee or union member. The amendment is probing; the debate is simply to find out whether our wording is more appropriate than the Government's.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Wills):</B>
 In responding to what I accept are probing amendments, I will take amendment No. 255 and the consequential amendment No. 257 together, before responding to amendments Nos. 256 and 258.
<P>
The Government believe that the new wording that schedule 2 will insert into section 146 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 gives individuals the right not to be subjected to any detriment by an act or any deliberate failure to act on the part of the employer, whose purpose was one prohibited by that section. That is clear and unambiguous.
I understand how the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) might think that an employer could commit a deliberate act that was not intentional or wilful. If one examines the dictionary definitions of those words, however, one will see that the problem largely goes away. The dictionary defines "wilful" as "intentional". The same dictionary defines "deliberate" as "carefully thought out in advance" or "to consider deeply".
<P>
There is an element of semantics here. The amendments would drag employment tribunals into semantic discussions about the relative meanings of the words "wilful" and "deliberate". The Government believe that--for the purposes of the legislation--,'deliberate" is a perfectly good word for signifying intent. That is the key test. It covers both conscious and unconscious failures to act. I think that that addresses the concerns of the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I think that the Minister realises that we are probing to get the wording right. He will know that he is operating under the shadow of Pepper v. Hart. He has just said that a deliberate act implies intention. Unfortunately, he qualified that by saying "for these purposes".
<P>
Our concern--I would like the Minister to consider it and, if necessary, to take it away--is about the maintaining of the word "deliberate". An employer could be taking, or failing to take, an act for what seems to him a good reason. That act, or failure to act, could then be interpreted as discriminatory for the purposes with which the Minister is concerned. We are anxious to differentiate actions that are nasty and unfair from those that are taken for another reason and have nothing to do with an attempt to pick on individuals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Of course, I appreciate that. Our view remains that the addition of words to qualify meaning would, in fact, add doubt to the meaning rather than amplify it. The amendments would narrow the definition of the word "omission" by adding a further criterion. That would be unnecessary. The existing wording is perfectly clear.
<P>
I shall speak to amendments Nos. 256 and 258 together. They are paving amendments, the purpose of which is to give employers a get-out. Under the amendments, the right would apply only when a deliberate failure to act, that a worker had been subjected to as an individual, was by way of discrimination. Whether a deliberate act taken by an employer had a discriminatory effect is for an employment tribunal to decide. The wording in the amendment is unnecessary and would serve only to complicate matters. The clause deals adequately with the issue. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have listened to the Minister's argument and, with my fingers crossed--as I fear his fingers may be--I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 259, in page 46, line 17, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or if that is unclear, to the date on which the discrimination becomes apparent.".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
For those who are not paying attention to the Chair earlier, the amendment relates to new subsection (2)(b) under paragraph 3 (4) of the schedule. If anything, I am making an even smaller point than the one I raised a moment ago, in respect of a provision that we are not substantially contending. It refers to mental states and, commendably, the Government want to be as clear as possible and have imposed several tests under the clause. We must remember that we are discussing an act, but a peculiar kind of act--it is a failure to act, an act that did not take place.
<P>
The test under new subsection (2)(a) under paragraph 3(4) of the schedule covers circumstances
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"where an act extends over a period, the reference to the date of the act is a reference to the last day of that period",<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
which is probably acceptable. However, it raises the question of acts that took place, were intermitted and restarted.
<P>
The amendment refers to new subsection (2)(b) in paragraph 3(4) of the schedule which states
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a failure to act shall be treated as done when it was decided on."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The problem with determining when a failure to act was decided on is that the only people one can ask are the employers in question, and I doubt whether they would have written themselves a minute saying, "I have now decided to fail to act in this matter as a matter of discrimination against an individual on whom I have a downer."

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): I remind that the hon. Gentleman that, in tribunals where determination of such questions take place, witnesses are under oath.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am well aware of that; neither of us were born yesterday. I hold no particular brief for any individual employers and some individuals, of course, may want to put their own interpretation on matters. My argument is not designed to make the case of an individual unionist or union more difficult. The test in line 38 on page 46 is purely the mental test of whether the employer thought about failing to act and decided to do it on a discriminatory basis.
<P>
I am arguing the case for an alternative objective test that would be conditional on it not being clear when the employer had made such a decision. The amendment would simply add the provision that, if it was not clear when the employer decided, the qualifying period could run from the date on which the discrimination became apparent. That would also have to be determined by a tribunal, but presumably it would have an objective basis or evidence to enable it to find out why it had happened. The amendment raises a probing point. It is not a matter of great theology and I should be grateful if the Minister would respond to those thoughts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Opposition Members, with characteristic sophistication, have picked up on an important point, which is that life is complicated, particularly in relation to acts and failures to act. Clear-cut acts, or failures to act, are not always followed by an immediate detriment. In drafting the schedule, the Government have taken account of the possible difficulties. However, although I accept that it is only a probing amendment, I shall take a few moments to set the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The time of an act or failure to act is set out in subparagraphs 3(3) and 3(4) of schedule 2. Hon. Members will note that in a series of acts, the last act is to be taken as the time reference. For example, an employer may tell his employee in January that he will not receive the pay rise that is normally due in June. Without the provisions of paragraph 3, the detriment suffered in June would fall outside the three-month limit. As drafted, the provisions apply to the failure in June, not the act in January.
<P>
The amendment seeks to widen the time reference for calculating the time limit for proceedings. It would apply if the act or series of acts did not themselves become immediately apparent. Under the amendment, the time reference would be taken as the date when the act became apparent. I agree that if the discriminatory act did not immediately become apparent, linking the time reference to when the act came to light might theoretically add something to the provision, but I can think of no example of an act being done to an individual that he would not know about. The amendment is much more likely to apply to failures to act, which we believe to be adequately covered.
<P>
The wording of schedule 2 is closely based on other provisions, such as those in section 48(3)(a) of the Employment Rights Act 1996. The provisions of section 48(3) (b) of that Act, which enable tribunals to extend the time limit for proceedings in certain circumstances, are already covered in section 147(b) of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. We are not aware of problems of the sort described having arisen from that wording. The hon. Gentleman seems to have found a solution in search of a problem. Unless we see real evidence of a need for such a change, I would prefer to stick with wording that is tried and tested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is nice to hear the Minister exemplifying Conservative values. In view of the charm of his exposition, even if he wanted time to reflect on the matter, we certainly shall not press the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedule 2 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Blacklists</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 260, in page 1, line 19, after "compilation", add "or misuse".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it may be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 273, in page 2, line 2, after "of", insert "restricting or preventing".
<P>
No. 261, in page 2, line 2, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"whether by way of positive or negative discrimination.".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is with a great sigh of relief that we move from the schedules to another clause. The print is a little easier on our jaded eyes, and, for those who like the red meat of debate, we have moved on to a more substantial issue--that of blacklists.
<P>
I am conscious that blacklists were a matter of considerable debate some years ago. The explanatory notes are generous enough to reveal that they have rather passed out of the scene. Indeed, I wonder whether, in clause 3, the Minister is paying homage to an item of Labour history, or even Labour demonology, rather than to something that could happen now.
<P>
Again, in conformity with the pursuit of fair treatment of employees, we understand the concept of not picking on people because they are union members. The Minister will be aware that that principle is enshrined in the 1992 Act in general terms. We are discussing the use of lists that might, or might not, be used in connection with recruitment.
<P>
There is no huge rift across the Committee about whether or not such lists are likely to be drawn up, or about whether or not they might be used in certain circumstances. The problem is whether a sensible approach in law is being adopted. A moment ago, the Minister charmingly accused me of finding a solution in search of a problem. I could throw the same charge back at him about blacklists. If there is no problem, we do not need to legislate. If we are to legislate, we must make absolutely sure that we do not create problems of interpretation, misinterpretation or, indeed, wilful interpretation, which are more difficult than the disease that is being addressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): I am most grateful to my hon. Friend, who is approaching the matter in the commonsensical fashion that we have come to expect. Does he agree that it would be reasonable for an employer to compile a list--it might be relatively short--of individuals who have, as the clause states,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"taken part in the activities of trade unions"<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
if in the course of that activity they have caused or prolonged exceptionally damaging strikes that have resulted in the closure of other businesses or factories? In a free and pluralist society, the idea that an employer should be prevented from doing so is abhorrent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sure that, in response to my hon. Friend's trenchant comments, the Minister will say that under a Labour Government no such union activity would be contemplated. I sometimes wonder, given the spread of new Labour opinion, whether such activity would even be allowed. However, I shall say no more about that, given that we keep reading that certain items of Labour philosophy are being diluted by the Prime Minister.
<P>
To return to the amendment--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That would be nice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am rightly encouraged to do so from the Chair.
First, the clause makes clear the distinction between the compilation of lists, on one hand, and their use on the other. Under amendment No. 260, the word "misuse" would be inserted after the word "compilation". The Minister will appreciate that the amendment was tabled in some haste, but if it were accepted, no provisions would be needed on the use of such lists.
<P>
The Minister owes it to the Committee to explain in more detail which lists it would be relevant to compile. Is he saying that a list could be compiled that consisted of two or three trade unionists who have characteristics of an especially destructive nature--perhaps they have damaged plant at a works? I am not suggesting that any member of the Committee would condone such conduct. I am trying to read the mind of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow), in saying that an employer might have a reason to say that X, Y and Z are very nasty people for reasons that have nothing to do with their being trade unionists.
<P>
Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether the law is intended to bite on comprehensive lists, but not on partial lists. If so, would a partial list of those who had other characteristics, perhaps including the use of violence against the employer, be admissible, even if a full list were not admissible?
<P>
It is important to consider the issue of misuse, which raises the question of intent. People might want to draw up a list of union members for several reasons. I shall discuss the amendment that raises that point in a moment. Drawing up such a list--perhaps to select a cricket team of union members, which would be entirely innocent--without intending to discriminate against those union members or advise another part of the firm or a different employer they should not be employed, does not seem inherently indefensible. We must be clearer about what lists may be compiled, what will constitute misuse of lists and how that will be differentiated from proper use.
<P>
The Minister will no doubt remind us that regulations will be introduced in due course under clause 33 through the affirmative resolution procedure. He will no doubt go on to say--I am trying to shorten his speech--that full consultation will take place before they are introduced. Our job is to be the awkward squad, and to try to anticipate difficulties. I nearly tabled an amendment to wake up the Minister and to make the point that the possession of a list, rather than its use, might by itself constitute an offence. If a list that I had never used--and certainly never misused--were found in my trunk or, perhaps, sent to me without my knowledge and found on my premises, would that fall within the criminal sanctions of the provision? Through the amendment, I am trying to show that we need more light and shade to clarify what the Minister is trying to achieve and what offence the compilers or users of such lists will have committed.
<P>
My second amendment in this group is No. 261, which I tabled to show that, in practice, it will be open to an employer to say that, because he wants a union shop, he will not employ anyone who is not a member of a union--especially if that employer were on the new left and could afford to do so. Unless the Minister proposes to exclude such cases in his regulations, an employer who kept a list for that purpose, as a checklist of what he regarded, rightly or wrongly, as good industrial relations practice, would also be committing an offence. I doubt whether that is what the Minister intends.
<P>
Our amendments bite on the need to ensure that the provisions, especially in the case of criminal offences, are properly conceived, are directed towards the perceived ill that the Minister claims to have identified, are not disproportionate and will not drag in innocent parties by accident.
<P>
Amendment No. 273, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce), to which he will no doubt want to speak in a moment, is designed to confine the operation of the clause to circumstances in which the blacklist is used to blacken people, rather than merely to facilitate recruitment. It is another way of defining the provision to relate it more closely to the ill that the Minister is trying to prevent. I have some sympathy with my hon. Friend's alternative approach, and shall listen to what he says.
<P>
The provision does not seem to be a great problem now, and I hope that it never will be. However, anxieties have been expressed that the regulations and criminal sanctions might penalise people who make lists that are otherwise apparently reasonable, because they somehow slip into the definition of a blacklist, even though they did not intend to use those lists for unfair employment or recruitment practices.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): I hope that we will have a stand part debate on the clause because I wish to raise some important issues that cannot be dealt with under the amendments. The clause is wholly-unnecessary and should not be in the Bill, but my amendment No. 273 does not attempt to disturb the Government's proposals; indeed, it seeks to correct an anomally and put into effect the Government's intention. I am concerned, from a legislative point of view, that clause 22(3) requires the Secretary of State to do something that under under clause 3(1)(a) and (b). Under clause 22(3), he is required to compile lists of people with trade union membership so that they are eligible for the CAC committees; that is a proper use of a list for employment purposes.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend is making an interesting point, but would he not agree that the provision in clause 22(3) is precisely for recruitment purposes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Absolutely. Nothing demonstrates the defectiveness of the clause more clearly. My amendment deals with blacklists that prevent people from getting a job or restricting them from employment. Throughout the clause, lists are mentioned--not blacklists, which are mentioned only in the rubric beside the clause. That is why I need to speak on this clause. When a Secretary of State compiles lists of people suitable to go on to the CAC or any other body that requires people with trade union experience, he will be committing an offence. If an hon. Member writes to a colleague in the Labour party to ask for the names of good trade unionists who would make a good contribution to the CAC and then writes to the Secretary of State to recommend those people, he would be producing a list for employment purposes that would be illegal under the clause. Before the Minister makes all his colleagues criminals, he should accept that my amendment is the only sensible way forward.
<P>
I used to run an employment agency, at the time when there were closed shops--to all intents and purposes, many still exist. When an employment agency is looking for a driver to send to what is virtually the closed shop of the Transport and General Workers Union, for example, it ensures that he is a member of that union. Manpower keeps a list of trade union members, so that they can be sent to employers who prefer them. That is not blacklisting individuals--it is listing them so that they can get a job. What about the acting profession? I understand that people still have to hold Equity cards to get certain jobs; will agencies be caught by the clause if, when they are trying to find work for people, someone asks whether a candidate has a British Equity card or a union card for another sector of the industry? The Minister knows the industry well. Will an offence be committed if there is a list of people to help someone find a job? My amendment is for only "restricting or preventing" employment.
<P>
If trade unions are recruiting officers, they will probably ask on the application form whether individuals are or have ever been members of a trade union. I suspect that they would prefer to take people on who were trade union members when they worked in other organisations, rather than people who had no trade union experience at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In several professions, such as teaching, it is extremely, desirable that people carry liability and professional insurance. Might not employers in the public or private sectors want to ensure that all their teachers are safely insured against any claims that arise in the course of their work?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am glad that my hon. Friend has made another sensible point, which a reasonable employer would consider in compiling a list. A series of application forms is effectively a list. One of the questions on an application form might be about trade union membership. If one was negotiating in a workplace, it would help for some of the requirements--ensuring that people are accompanied to different grievance procedures, and so on--if one knew who was a member of each trade union. This clause will catch such reasonable employers unless it is amended.
<P>
What will happen with the Register of Members' Interests, which requires people in this place to list whether they have trade union membership? Will the Registrar of Members' Interests be hauled up and prosecuted under the clause for keeping a list of Members who have trade union membership?
<P>
Such membership is part of employment and part of our declarations in Committee, and I am sure that it makes trade union members proud. Some Conservative Members are in trade unions--the other day, my right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Sir N. Fowler) proudly said that he was a member of the National Union of Journalists. Membership such as that is listed, and is relevant to employment. I suspect that when the Prime Minister decided to give the Minister a job, he made certain that he appointed someone with a lot of trade union experience, knowing that the Minister would deal with trade union matters. The Prime Minister probably looked that up in "Dods" or "Who's Who" to make sure that the Minister had such experience, and I am sure that it was on the Minister's original application form to become a Labour party candidate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is giving the Committee pertinent and thought-provoking examples. Does he recall that Lord Tebbit of Chingford might also have been appointed to his high office as Secretary of State for Employment because of his distinguished record as one of the outstanding trade unionists of the 20th century?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I do not think that I could improve on that description of my noble Friend. He was a distinguished member of the British Air Line Pilots Association. It is interesting that so many members of the Committee seem to know that fact--they know it because they read it in a list.
<P>
What will happen when a body of the great and good decides on a proper balance between those who have trade union experience, employer experience and charity experience? It will select someone by going through "Who's Who", which will be a criminal publication that gives not a blacklist but a list. Someone else will then complain, saying, "Hang on a minute--you've given someone employment because you've found out that they were a trade unionist by reading 'Who's Who'."
<P>
The clause would catch many people. I hope that, in the debate on clause stand part, I can persuade the Minister simply to throw it out. I urge him, if he goes ahead with it, to make sure that he outlaws a blacklist and not a list that may have positive benefits for trade union members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> We have had an interesting ramble around the imagination of the hon. Member for South Dorset, but I will now address myself to the amendment. Before doing so, perhaps I should make one or two remarks about the clause, although I hope that we shall have a stand part debate.
<P>
The clause addresses the crucial underpinning of a fundamental democratic right, which is the right to belong or not to belong to a trade union, and will help to protect union activitists against discrimination. I understand the remarks of the hon. Member for Daventry about the problem having gone away. It is true that some of the most notorious organisations that were engaged in that activity, such as the Economic League, are now defunct. However, I understand that there is still a company that has associations with the former Economic League, so I am not as sanguine as he that the problem has become a non issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> If I may just continue with my preliminary remarks, I shall be happy to give way when I get to the amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the Minister is addressing the amendment at the moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Indeed, I am, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
The complexities of the amendments and the issues and subjects that they raise have been well illustrated. We are drafting regulations to deal with those complexities and we will consult on them. The hon. Member for Daventry correctly divined that they will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure and that there will be a further opportunity to debate them. We will ensure that the regulations are properly conceived and appropriate.
<P>
Amendment No. 260 is unnecessary, as the hon. Member for Daventry has already recognised. The issue of use, and, by implication misuse, is dealt with in subsection (2), which allows the Secretary of State to make regulations to prohibit the use of such blacklists. The regulations will specify in detail what prohibition entails and which types of organisation will be involved.
<P>
I suspect that the hon. Member for Daventry tabled the amendment not least to probe what we mean by the use of blacklists. For the most part, we wish to deter employers and employment agencies from using the services of blacklisting organisations. It should be unlawful for employers and agencies to use the lists when recruiting new members of staff or when placing people in work.
<P>
That makes sense in itself. If it is wrong to compile the information, it should be wrong for recruiters to use it. A potential loophole will be closed. Blacklisters could operate offshore and use, say, the internet, to disseminate their lists. Obviously, it would be difficult for UK authorities or UK citizens to detect and prosecute blacklisters operating in that way, but by tackling the final user of the information, we can ensure that we tackle the problem effectively.
<P>
It is possible to use these order-making powers to deter the use of blacklists by intermediaries or middlemen acting between the compiler and the recruiter. Certain people or organisations may not actually compile the lists themselves but they may specialise in disseminating the information that they contain.
<P>
When regulating, we will need to exclude the Royal Mail and other distributors who may circulate such lists unknowingly. The regulations might exclude some users from their scope. For example, it would be wrong to make it unlawful for an investigative journalist to use information from blacklisting organisations when exposing their unlawful activities. The amendment is unnecesary and I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will withdraw it.
<P>
I now turn to amendment No. 261. Subsection (1)(b) identifies a prohibitive blacklist as one that is compiled with the intention that it should be used by agencies or employers "for the purposes of recruitment.
<P>
Historically, that is the main purpose to which blacklists have been put. Amendments Nos. 261 and 273 would alter the extent of the prohibition by changing the definition of the proscribed purpose. Amendment No. 261 would ensure that the prohibition was even-handed in its effect. In other words, it would ensure that such lists were not used unfairly to enhance, or to retard, the opportunities for the recruitment for trade unionists. Of course, we associate the compilation of blacklists with the idea of putting trade unionists at a disadvantage. An organisation such as the Economic League did not act as a specialist recruitment agency for trade unionists.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am keen to demonstrate the fair-mindedness of the approach of Conservative Members. The Minister said that he did not believe that the list should be used to enhance or retard the employment prospects of individuals. Does the Minister accept that if someone has been a trade unionist and shows a particular skill at effective negotiation or conciliation, it is perfectly legitimate for an employer to take that into account when deciding whether to employ that person? Positive discrimination in that sense could be legitimate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am about to address that point, but I should say that the hon. Gentleman, who is usually scrupulous in his use of language, did not quote me accurately. I shall quote my remarks once more, so that he can understand the point that I am making. I said that such lists should not be used unfairly to enhance or retard the opportunities for the recruitment of trade unionists--not the recruitment of particular individuals. There is a distinction, which I am sure the hon. Gentleman has already recognised.
<P>
Of course, there may be a limited number of circumstances in which it is legitimate for a prospective employer--a trade union, for example--to recruit individuals with experience of trade union affairs. It might be completely proper for a union to ask a head-hunter to draw up a list of potential candidates with such experience. The regulations will need to make allowances for such special cases. The amendment is unnecessary, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.
<P>
Amendment No. 273 would make it lawful for employers or agencies to use blacklists, as long as they do not use the information to restrict or prevent the recruitment of the individuals on the list. There is a danger that it would provide an easy way for blacklisters and their client employers to evade the law. Both would simply need to argue that they used the lists, alongside other information, to inform recruitment decisions. It would be very difficult to show that they used the lists to screen out trade unionists altogether. They could use the amendment to disguise their true intentions.
<P>
Of course, I accept the stated intention of the hon. Member for South Dorset, but far from achieving what the Government want, it would provide a massive loophole in the legislation and would render it ineffective. At the very least, it would greatly complicate any legal cases that may arise. As the hon. Gentleman's stated intention is to help the Government to achieve their objectives, he can do that by withdrawing his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I now know the new Labour Government's motto, which has been well exemplified in the Minister's reply. It is, "If you are in a hole, start consulting. "The Minister, in effect, is saying, "We think we have a problem. Blacklists have a long history and we don't like them." We in the Conservative party do not like blacklists either, in the sense that the Minister is defining them, as opposed to possibly having reasons for blacklisting certain individuals.
<P>
We do not want to pick on trade unionists. I have made that quite clear. But every time the Minister pursues that objective, he either reduces the scope of the clause or agrees to reconsider the matter in regulations. I do not know whether it had occurred to the Minister until we mentioned it that it would be rational for an employer to prefer to employ trade unionists in certain circumstances. We have done so, and we are grateful that the Minister has taken it on board.
<P>
The Minister's answer exposed--more eloquently than we could--the difficulties of trying to legislate in this matter. My hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset, who approached the problem independently, has added a fresh raft of difficulties. He spoke eloquently about the nature of the powers and the potential dangers of having such a system. I am bound to say that considering his remarks and those of the Minister our main difficulties may well not be with the amendments, or even with their withdrawal, but with the clause itself.
<P>
Having reflected on what the Minister said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment in the hope that we may return to the matter at a later stage.
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 262, in page 2, line 7, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"where the relationship of the complainee and the complainant is an employment relationship.".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Our concern is, small but real, and I hope that the Minister will clarify matters. He has already said that there needs to be consultation and regulations. Subsection (3)(a) states that the regulations may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "confer jurisdiction (including exclusive jurisdiction) on employment tribunals and on the Employment Appeal Tribunal".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
I understand that that all comes about through being an industrial matter--or an employment tribunal matter, as we now know it. That seems well founded, particularly when it is connected with an employer's actions on recruitment on the basis of trade union membership or otherwise.
<P>
The clause, to which the regulations attach, refers to regulations prohibiting the compilation of lists. Subsection (3) applies equally whether we are considering regulations on compilation or on use. I can understand an employment tribunal being invited to deal with a complaint between an individual, or a union on his behalf, and an employer about discrimination. The amendment is designed to probe an alleged criminal offence against the compiler of a list who may not be the employer, has never been involved in an employement tribunal and knows nothing about the procedure.
<P>
I am not legally qualified, so it is not clear whether such cases would be taken in the High Court rather than an employment tribunal, but it is more than a trivial point. If, as the Minister says, there are people still in the business of compiling or disseminating lists, they may be caught up in the regulations, even if they are not the employer. It is not generally the practice of trade unions to sell their membership lists, but they could sell them to third parties and find themselves in the peculiar position of being on the other side of an employment tribunal. The Minister needs to explain what is going on and what the mysterious subsection (3)(a) imports.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> It is the Government's intention to make use of the employment tribunals in the enforcement of the prohibitions embodied in the clause, for reasons that we have already explained. They are accessible, relatively informal and much cheaper than the courts. They are well respected and possess great expertise on employment matters.
<P>
The amendment would restrict access to tribunals to cases in which the applicant and the respondent are parties to an "employment relationship". I suspect that the hon. Member for Daventry knows that he has chosen a vague term. However, it implies that there must be a contract between the two parties--probably an employment contract. If we adopted the amendment, very few cases would go to a tribunal. Individuals could not take action against the compiler of the blacklist because there would be no employment relationship between them. Nor could they act against an employer who used the blacklist because, in most cases, individuals would be applying for jobs and would not yet have a contract of employment with an employer. I suspect that the amendment has been tabled to probe the Government on the use of tribunals. I shall therefore say a little more about our intentions.
<P>
The tribunal's powers will be specified in the regulations. We shall consult on the draft regulations, and there will be an opportunity to debate them. Tribunal presidents will, of course, be included in those consultations. However, it seems sensible to allow individuals to take cases to tribunals against the users of blacklists. Tribunals are experienced in examining employers' recruitment practices. Recruitment issues already surface in tribunal cases under the various discrimination jurisdictions.
<P>
We should also consider whether tribunals could hear cases against the blacklisters themselves. Such cases could be brought either by a blacklisted individual or by his or her trade union. Tribunals already judge issues outside the standard employer-employee matters--for example, if an employment agency refuses its services on the ground of an applicant's trade union membership. We want to provide an accessible alternative to the courts, and we consider that tribunals can carry out that task. We shall consult on that aspect when we issue the draft regulations. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister eventually came to the point that worries us. He said that he will undertake further consultation, and that that would include consulting employment tribunals. I still have reservations about tribunals operating outside their normal area, but they will have so much to do within it that I shall not press the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<H4><center>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I rise to respond to the Minister's answer to my amendment No. 273. He demonstrated that he misunderstood the amendment, and misunderstands clause 3. He has shown why it should be deleted.
<P>
The Minister tried to tell the Committee that the regulation--making power would let regulations be made that would allow some lists in some circumstances but the clause gives no power to allow lists, only to prohibit them. Clause 3(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State may make regulations prohibiting the compilation of lists".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Clause 3(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State may make regulations prohibiting the use of lists to which subsection (1) applies."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The clause does not make lists legal in certain circumstances.
<P>
Several members of this Committee were members also of the Committee that a few weeks ago debated regulations made under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. Our debate demonstrated that the Parliamentary draftsman had to make the regulations achieve what the Government wanted to achieve, even though the Act was worded wrongly; the Government had not listened to advice and got themselves into a terrible muddle.
<P>
I suspect that when we debate the regulations that will be made under clause 3, we shall make the same speeches about how people will be caught for no purpose.
<P>
The Government do not intend to catch such people, but they will complain that we are nitpicking. We are trying to use the English language as it is supposed to be used--so that people understand what is going on.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister did not respond properly to amendment No. 273; he should reconsider the matter. The clause should not stand part of the Bill for the simple reason that we should not legislate for something that is unenforceable. The suggestion that the Government will create regulations that stop someone who wants to "blacklist" an individual--if that is the word that will be used--is nonsense. There are always ways round such matters, yet the Government intend to draft a whole pile of regulations that will catch only those people who innocently did something wrong rather than those who deliberately decided not be caught by the clause.
<P>
A new Economic League, for example, would provide lists that made certain that no one on the list was described as a trade union member. It would use another description if it was trying to stop someone gaining employment. The Minister will clearly have great difficulty in drafting regulations to stop certain lists being compiled.
<P>
Another issue that cannot be raised other than under clause stand part concerns the word "blacklist". I am not being flippant; Labour Members know that Opposition Members are not particularly into politically correct language. I read the clause soon after I had been listening to the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. I was upset by the term "institutionally racist" which, apparently, describes any Organisation that uses a word, term or method that is thought of by ethnic minorities as being discriminatory against them and in language that they feel is wrong.
<P>
The word "blacklist" is racially offensive to some people. It should not be regarded as such. If one goes back in history, it was not seen as offensive, but I am advised that some people think that it is and that the House could be described as being institutionally racist for using such a term. I asked the Library to find out the meaning of the word "blacklist" from a thesaurus and received the information that it precludes, snubs, bars, bans, ostracizes, debars and so on, none of which is a good title for a clause. I came up with the terms "an employment exclusion list" or an "employment discrimination list". As I said, I am not being flippant, but does the Labour party believe in its rhetoric of not using discriminatory language? Does it want to be whiter than white? Although that is normal terminology, I shall withdraw it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Although the last expression used by my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset might have been mildly infelicitous, the fact that it so upset the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Hope) has caused my hon. Friend to rise even further in my estimation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> My hon. Friend will know that I would never intentionally upset the hon. Member for Corby, although he is easily upset.
<P>
With all seriousness, I should like the Minister to reconsider the title of the clause.
<P>
Clause 3 is unnecessary. It is unenforceable and it will catch people who have done nothing wrong. It will take the Department of Trade and Industry an enormous amount of time to write the regulations, using the wording of the clause, that do not catch those who it is not intended to catch.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall be brief because we have had a useful debate. It is appropriate to express the Committee's gratitude to my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset for his characteristic perspicacity in pointing to some of the conceptual problems of the clause. The clause creates criminal offences, which is always a serious matter. That is part of my reservation about the use of employment tribunals--although I am sure that the Minister will want to remind me that there are precedents for that.
<P>
As I listened to the debate, it occurred to me that one way of making the measure more viable would be completely to preclude the criminal offence in relation to the compilation of lists. Producing a list would not then be a matter of law and we would not need evidential arguments on the definition of a list, who had produced it, why it was in someone's possession or what it meant. Anyone could produce a list in code, for example, and unless we had the services of Bletchley Park--near my constituency but now sadly closed down--we could not crack it. The Minister has many virtues, but he may not have complete mastery of the kind of machine that broke the Enigma codes. On reflection--he might reflect on it also--the intention might be captured by referring to the use of a list for discriminatory purposes, rather than about its compilation. If it were illegal to use a list to discriminate against trade unionists, there would not be a big market for compilers.
<P>
The more I study the complexity of the clause, the less I like it. It creates criminal offences in an area that is difficult to define, identify and prove in court. For that reason and in the light of our debate, I advise my hon. Friends--not because we want the practice to continue but because we do not want the cure to be worse than the disease--to vote against the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I do not intend to spend long on the irrelevant semantic argument of the hon. Member for South Dorset about the word "list". It ill behoves any member of the party that did nothing, year after year, to respond to the concerns of the Lawrence family to lecture anyone on the matter. I hope that when he reads Hansard he will regret those remarks.
<P>
In addressing the clause, it is important to remember why it is included in the Bill. It is designed to address a pernicious and iniquitous practice. Opposition Members have been in danger of forgetting a fundamental fact about lists of trade union members. We all know about the instances in the past where organisations compiled and distributed information to employers to encourage discrimination against trade unionists.
<P>
Those blacklists were sometimes sold, for commercial reasons and sometimes circulated free of charge for ideological motives. It did not take much for workers to appear on such blacklists; they were often included for nothing more than being a shop steward or for having sought to recruit other workers. People who were placed on such lists experienced genuine difficulties and some spent years out of work as a result of discrimination.
<P>
Thankfully, there is little evidence that that pernicious activity is widespread today. Some organisations associated with it--such as the Economic League--no longer operate. However, as I said, there is no guarantee that it could not resurface, as long as the law remains as it is. The absence in the UK of protection against the blacklisting of trade union activists has been repeatedly criticised by the International Labour Organisation. Hon. Members will know that it is an offence for an employer to discriminate against an employee because of his or her trade union membership or activities. However, it is not unlawful for organisations to collect and disseminate the sort of defamatory information that I have described. The clause underpins the rights of workers to belong--
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I will finish the point, because it is fundamental to the clause. The clause underpins the rights of workers to belong a trade union--a fundamental democratic right. Under it, the Secretary of State will have the power to act against the compilation or the dissemination of information about individuals' trade union membership or activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
The clause will help protect trade union activists against discrimination in employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I thought that I heard the Minister say that the dissemination of defamatory information is acceptable. Surely, if that information were defamatory--if it were inaccurate, and bore on character of the person involved--would it not be caught by other aspects of the law, at least in principle?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The hon. Gentleman already knows the answer to that question and why we want to want to stop such behaviour altogether.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am sorry, but I am afraid that that was not even the square root of an answer to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. Will the Minister reconsider his answer, and expand on it? Does he accept that he wants to prohibit the circulation not only of defamatory material--which is caught by other aspects of the law, as my hon. Friend said--but of information that is not defamatory but which he and the Government think should not be circulated? That is a different proposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems uncharacteristically ignorant about that matter. Let me elucidate, and then move on. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. No sedentary interruptions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
As Opposition Members might be aware, the remedies for defamation are civil; we are talking about criminal action. I hope that I need not spell out the differences any further and why there must be remedies in such cases.
<P>
I shall deal with the detail of the clause, which is important as it bears on the effect that the provisions will have. I hope that Opposition Members will be riveted by what I am about to say--perhaps not.
<P>
In providing such a power, we have borne in mind the existence of the Data Protection Act 1998, which replaced the 1984 Act of the same title. The 1998 Act is stronger and more wide ranging than its predecessor. In particular, it applies to data held manually--in other words, not on a computer. The 1984 Act did not cover such data. That loophole has been exploited in the past by organisations such as the now defunct Economic League.
<P>
The 1998 Act will help stop such practices. It will impose strict conditions on the processing of sensitive personal information, including that on trade union membership. It provides for new investigatory and enforcement powers to be given to the Data Protection Commissioner, who will succeed the existing Data Protection Registrar. Unfortunately, the full force of the 1998 Act will not apply to manually held data before 2007. We want to act before then to outlaw such practices.
<P>
Under clause 3, the Secretary of State will have the power to introduce regulations that prohibit the compilation and use of lists that contain information about individuals' trade union membership and trade union activities with a view to their being used by employers or employment agencies in recruitment.
<P>
We have opted for the regulatory route, rather than making specific provision in the Bill.
<P>
We have done so for several reasons. It allows for extensive prior consultation with interested parties. I was surprised to hear the hon. Member for Daventry imply that consultation is a problem. The Government believe that it is a good thing in getting measures right. It is a complicated area of the law, and the Government believe that further consultation of the details of the prohibition would be beneficial--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I give way.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> To whom is the Minister giving way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I think that I should give way first to the hon. Member for Buckingham.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, whose manners, as always, are exemplary. Does he also want to prevent through the clause the dissemination of information about people who are actively involved in a trade union and who, at some stage in their working careers, have brought a case of sexual discrimination against an employer, to be heard at an employment tribunal? Will that be prevented under the Bill? That might interest several members of the Committee.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I should like to return to the clause, because, try as I may, I cannot see the relevance of that intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> Will the Minister give way on consultation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I should like to make some progress. I have given way a great deal so far, and would like to continue.
<P>
I was discussing the virtue of consultation on the regulations. hon. Members would at least agree that it is a complicated area of the law. The Government therefore believe that further consultation on the regulations will be beneficial. We hope to ensure that the regulations are effective in preventing what should be prevented and in providing access to that to which access should be provided. Obviously, we must also protect legitimate data processing activities such as are used in journalism or the maintenance of staff records. Those points answer several Opposition Members' questions, and I hope that they are paying due attention.
<P>
The approach that we have adopted in the Bill will also enable regulations to be adapted if necessary to deal with any unintended consequences--a matter of some anxiety for the hon. Member for South Dorset--to take account of the increasing application of the Data Protection Act 1998, to which I referred earlier, and to combat any misplaced ingenuity that may be exercised by people trying to evade the prohibition.
<P>
Hon. Members will have the usual opportunity to scrutinise the regulations, which will be laid before both Houses, and a full debate will take place on the regulations under the affirmative resolution procedure that will apply under clause 33.
<P>
The clause is designed to end a disreputable activity. It helps us to tackle the criticisms that have been made of us in the past and to comply with internationally agreed labour standards in protecting individuals, rights to belong to trade unions. We are legislating with care in a complex area to ensure that our regulations target the people whom we intend to target and do not have any unintended side effects.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I am grateful, Mrs. Dunwoody, for being called to speak again.
<P>
The Minister has relied on continuing to say that consultation will take place. We are obviously grateful to the Government for their continuing to repeat that, but consultation often comes far too late. In the past few weeks, regulations have been introduced that allow fewer than three weeks for people to implement the changes, let alone for consultation on them.
<P>
A little bird told me that the Department of Trade and Industry had had a chance to consider the time that the promised consultation on clause 28 has taken. If that is how long consultation takes, such assurances about clause 3 are meaningless. I remind the Committee of my point of order; the previous Secretary of State for Trade and Industry promised on 25 September that the Government would consult on clause 28.
<P>
We still have not seen the consultation paper, and industry has not yet had the chance to refer to it.
<P>
Will the Minister please tell us how much time will be allowed for consultation on the clause 3 regulations? Shall we have the chance to make a difference to the regulations before they come into force? I hope that the Minister can convince the Committee that we need not vote against the clause, but I doubt it.

Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center> Notice relating to</center></H4>
industrial action
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 263, in page 2, line 34, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"together with a means of communicating such information to those employees.".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The amendment relates to a slightly different consideration, arising from a recent court decision--the rather well-known case of Blackpool and The Fylde College v. the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education. I took an interest in that case because, as members of the Committee may remember, I was at one time--but not at the time of that case--the Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education. I continue to maintain an interest in that sector and, I hope, good relations with all parts of it.
<P>
The amendment has no direct bearing on further education alone; it has a wider application. It is concerned with whether trade unions should be required to provide the names and addresses of their members to employers when holding ballots for industrial disputes. We have covered the subject in a number of ways. I tabled two amendments, and I might also briefly advert to remarks made to me by the Engineering Employers Federation, which has expressed some concern.
<P>
If we are going to restrict the trade unions--I can understand why the Government might be worried about it so that they are not obliged to divulge the names of their members, it is important that ballots should be conducted fairly and with the maximum information. Everyone should have the opportunity to inform themselves, and the employers must be able to inform their members. Information should pass to the employees so that they can make an informed choice, or at least be in no doubt as to the consequences of their actions.
<P>
The amendment would require the trade union, which would possess information on the number, category and workplace of the employees concerned, to notify the employer of that information, but not of individual names. As the hon. Member for Eccles (Mr. Stewart) reminded us at the previous sitting, it would be normal practice for the conductors of the ballot--the Electoral Reform Society or some other organisation--to pass the employer's material to the people who were conducting the strike ballot. If that did not happen, perhaps because the scrutineers refused to carry the employer's material, how could the employer communicate with the relevant members of the work force? Perhaps the Government are driven towards a solution whereby employers, who would not know individual names, would have to send letters to all their employees at their known home addresses to cover union members who might be involved.
<P>
Under amendment No. 263, unions would provide some means of passing on such information to employers. I do not envisage their necessarily doing that themselves--they might not wish to--but someone else could do it as part of the process of sending out ballot papers.
<P>
That and especially the next amendment concentrate on the issue of good faith by the union concerned. I shall refer briefly to the concerns of the Engineering Employers Federation, which it expressed too late for them to be embodied in an amendment. It advises unions to try a bit harder, saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"For example, in respect of the ballot notice, the union is only required to provide information which the union possesses about the number, category and work-place the employees concerned."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That is what is proposed. It suggests that unions should have to go further, and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"provide details of the number, category and workplace of employees concerned even if this involves the union having to make enquiries."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would give a clearer indication to employers.
<P>
Those are sensitive areas, and I can understand the sensitivity arising from the Blackpool and Fylde case. However, I am concerned that employers may be put in a false position and that unions may use the provision to frustrate employers in getting their message across at the time of a ballot. That would be regrettable, and I hope that the Minister will respond to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am not clear what the hon. Member for Daventry has in mind. If the amendment seeks to require unions to pass on to their members details of information provided in the notice to employers, that would extend the requirement placed on unions beyond the legislation's purpose. It would also place an unnecessary burden on the trade union.
<P>
Sections 226A and 234A of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 require unions to give notice to employers that they are organising an industrial action ballot, and that, following the ballot, they are calling industrial action.
<P>
Clause 4 clarifies the law and, in doing so, secures the confidentiality of trade union membership. The legislation is not designed for unions to give details of the notice to their members. Sections 226A and 234A of the Act do not have that effect, and nor will they after the revisions to the law in clause 4.
<P>
We should bear in mind the open relationship between a union and its members, in which it is already customary for unions to pass information to their members. They disseminate information regarding the nature of a dispute and their proposed courses of action to deal with members, grievances. There is no evidence to suggest that union members feel the need for an additional requirement.
<P>
Alternatively, the hon. Member for Daventry may seek through his amendment to place a duty on unions to inform employers how they should communicate with employees. If so it is a curious amendment. Why should a union be better placed than an employer to tell him or her how to communicate with staff?
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall give a simple explanation so that the Minister understands what I am driving at. Basically, the union will know, but will not be obliged to disclose, the names of its members. We are concerned about the efficiency with which the employer act. Of course, he could mail all his employees. However, if he wanted to mail union members, perhaps he could come to an arrangement with the union whereby he could pass the material on, either through an independent scrutineer or otherwise, more efficiently than if he simply guessed that all his workers were members of the union.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The hon. Gentleman wants an inescapable burden to be put on the trade union under the amendment. By knowing where they work, employers should be able to communicate with the workers involve.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I was responding the hon. Member for Daventry and was about come to my second conceivable interpretation of amendment No. 263. I was inquiring whether the hon. Gentleman wanted to place a duty on the trade union to inform the employer how he or she should communicate with his or her employees. If that is his objective, it is curious because I do not understand why a union should be better placed to do that than an employer.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps I can take pity on the hon. Gentleman and allow him a moment to take two deep breaths. This might be a good moment to remind members of the Committee that, when addressing the Chair, they should not turn their backs as our proceedings are being recorded. In the excitement of their interventions, hon. Members occasionally turn towards the member of the Committee to whom they are speaking, not to the Chair. I am sure that all members of the Committee will remember that and I hope that I have now given the Minister time enough to catch his breath.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> 1 am sure that we are all looking forward to the Minister's exposition. I say, in the spirit of helpfulness, that he might like to be aware that several right hon. and hon. Members are enthusiastic and regular attendees of the Living Well health club, including some of his hon. Friends. I attend the club regularly, too, and I would be delighted to welcome the Minister.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B>  Order. We are always grateful for the interesting and frequently imaginative interventions of the hon. Member for Buckingham, but the Committee should now return to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stewart rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B> Mr. Wills:</B> I give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stewart:</B> The drift of the Opposition's line is to say that there is a problem for employers in getting information to employees who are involved in a ballot. The Opposition's solution is that the other party in the ballot--the trade union--should supply information to the employee, through the employer. Even though we accept that there is a problem, it is not one that the trade unions should sort out. That would place a burden on one of the parties, which would not be an acceptable solution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles and the hon. Member for Buckingham for their interventions. I remain baffled about how a union should be better placed than an employer to tell the employer how to communicate with the work force. Surely an employer, who knows where his or her employees work, could post a general notice at the workplace or a general letter to all those who might be involved? I invite the hon. Member for Daventry to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> After those exchanges, although I had never previously thought of it, I began to see the Minister as Ethelred the Unready. However, he later recovered his poise, if only to slap us down.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment was to make the perhaps obvious point that whereas previously, following the Blackpool and Fylde judgment, the employer could have obtained information from the union about the names and addresses of his employees who were members of it, he will not now be able to do so. Any individual communication, as opposed to a notice in the workplace, must therefore be addressed to all his employees or done inaccurately or capriciously. I am not sure that that would better inform the dispute.
<P>
I shall not press the matter now, but the Minister must give some thought to the good practice of ensuring that those involved in the serious step of undertaking a ballot to decide whether to take industrial action should be effectively and properly informed by both parties about their respective position. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 264, in page 2, line 37, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(c) if a notice does not name any employees and the notice makes a reckless claim as to their number then the notice of ballot may be invalidated.".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
As its grouping suggests, this amendment is designed to make a slightly different point, but again relates to the conduct of a trade union. Interpretation of current law suggests that the trade union must supply the names and addresses of its members. The amendment is designed to cover circumstances--which I do not anticipate will arise often, but, as the Minister knows, the Opposition are connoisseurs of hard cases--in which a union makes a reckless claim about its numbers, perhaps to intimidate the employer into submission. A union with 17 members in a shop of 100 might tell an employer that it had 55, or 51, but had not been involved in the statutory collective bargaining process. The employer might collape like the
 The purpose of the clause is to set a minimum standard for good business. We are merely requiring employers to give recognised unions information and to meet them regularly to discuss training policy and practices relating to the workers in the relevant unit. Our proposals are designed to set out a sound basis for constructive dialogue, but without specifying the intricate detail of what the discussions should be about. We have deliberately avoided placing too much detail in the Bill because the more detail there is, the more onerous it will be for employers. It will give more scope for disputes to arise about whether statutory entitlements have been met.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Daventry will concur with our desire to avoid placing unnecessary burdens on business, so I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 267, in page 4, line 2, leave out "six" and insert "twelve".
<P>
The Minister helpfully led into the amendment by talking about withdrawing unnecessary burdens on business. He has moved from the penal mode that he adopted a few moments ago to a more business friendly mode. If we have to go through such procedure, I am not sure that renewal meetings to discuss the training provision need take place more often than every 12 months. If they took place annually, that would be a better basis for evaluating whether they were appropriate. I hope that the Minister will consider the extension of time proposed by the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> We all accept the importance of training, so I am slightly disturbed by the amendment. It would increase the time between consultative meetings on training. We are not placing an onerous burden on employers. We are merely asking them to meet representatives of the union every six months. I am not sure what purpose will be served by delaying the frequency of such meetings.
<P>
Likewise, we are placing modest requirements on employers to provide essential information in advance of the meetings. The employer will be obliged only to give the union any information without which it would be impeded in participating in the meeting, and any information that is in line with good industrial relations practice.
<P>
I am sure that employers would have already produced the information for their own purposes, and it should not be too difficult for them to produce it for the unions as well. Six months is not an unreasonable time. We are setting a reasonable minimum. Most consultative bodies within workplaces already meet more frequently than that and our proposals will not prevent meetings from taking place more frequently if the parties so wish.
<P>
Similarly, most organisations already have specific policies and plans about training. They are usually discussed by management within companies regularly and our proposals require employers to open out those discussions to unions, too. Most businesses plan on a 12-monthly basis, which includes planning for training, and a period of six months will allow scope for employers to have a mid-year review. In the light of my explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Connoisseurs of the Committee will notice that the Opposition and the Minister have now completely changed their positions on consecutive amendments. Having been reproved by the Minister for imposing further burdens on business, he turns round and says to me, "Oh well, I am happy to place a burden on business", and my efforts to mitigate that burden are not acceptable to him.
<P>
I record the irony of the position without any great heat and I will not be minded to press the amendment to a Division. As the Minister replied substantively, however, I shall share with him the concern that has been expressed by the Confederation of British Industry, the observations of which I know that the Minister will take seriously. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a general duty to provide 'information in accordance with good industrial relations practice' is insufficiently clear given the sanctions available for non-compliance. It would be tempting for unions to bring forward speculative claims to win members compensation, but this could only damage industrial relations."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
I am sure that the Minister will reflect on the CBI's next suggestion in the time that I give him by not pressing the amendment to a Division. It goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Either the duty should be clarified, or the available sanctions should be significantly reduced."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
With those comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 268, in page 4, line 23, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or a person acting on its behalf.".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The amendment, as many of ours have been, is designed to be helpful and clarificatory to the interests of the trade union. The Minister will remember that, in certain cases, trade unions may make a joint application for collective bargaining. He will disabuse me if I am wrong because I have not checked it, but it will be difficult for the CAC to impose a joint collective bargaining requirement by statue. There will be circumstances in relation to training matters, when it will not only be convenient but eminently sensible for the trade unions to work together and meet the employer at one meeting.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The clause states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"'the trade union' is a reference to each trade union."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
with the inference that all trade unions have to turn up to the meeting even if they had decided, especially if the representation in the work force was uneven between the trade unions, that only one needed to attend.
<P>
The clause should be amended so that the trade unions could appoint a person who was not an officer of the trade union, but who was, for example, an experienced consultant in further education, to attend the meeting on their behalf as their agent, or in some other capacity, to discuss training. I am not sure whether that is precluded under the clause. The amendment is an attempt to make matters slightly more flexible, and nothing more than that. I should be grateful to hear the Minister's response.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> This is a probing amendment. I shall throw some light on the matter for the benefit of the hon. Member for Daventry. He wants to know whether the clause will allow full-time union officials or other outside experts to attend the meetings. The answer is yes. The union can nominate whomever it wishes to attend the consultations. If unions want their full-time officials, other experts or consultants to attend as their representatives, they can. That will aid and enhance the quality of the dialogue and benefit both the union and the employer.
<P>
Such people often possess more knowledge and have more experience of good training practice in other organisations, which is only to the good. In practice, resources will inevitably limit a union's ability to send full-time officials or consultants to such meetings. There is no statutory duty on unions to make their officials available, nor is there a statutory on requirement other employers to provide leave for employees to attend the meetings.
<P>
It is likely that, in most cases, representation will be limited to lay representatives, probably based around the team that takes part in the parallel collective bargaining talks. The clause is drafted to permit others to attend when they are available and when the union wants them to attend. The possible involvement of outsiders should not inhibit discussions. We have ensured that employers are not required to divulge commercially sensitive material at the meetings, so employers need not fear that such information will leak to competitors through the involvement of outsiders. The amendment is unnecessary and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> When I returned to the Room from voting in the Division and looked at clause 6, it was like joining Alice in Wonderland in going through the looking glass. The clause is wholly unnecessary and over the top. Given that no one in this country is forced to train, it is absolutely bonkers to have detailed rules in the Bill about when people should meet, what they should discuss and everything that should take place. I do not understand what the Government are doing and why they are taking up the Committee's time with clause 6. Even if people are not required to train, a meeting must still be held at which the question must be asked, "Are you training them?", and if the answer is no--end of meeting. That is bonkers, if that is a Parliamentary term. I thought that as I am here, I would express that view.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 16</center></H4>
<H4><center>Collective agreements: detriment and dismissal</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 107, in page 10, line 10, after "he", insert "unreasonably".
<P>
It is perhaps better to debate this clause now, rather than in its place in the Bill, where it is surrounded by a series of other rights. Technically it relates to the rights of an individual, although it deals with the context in which collective agreements will be determined.
<P>
This is one of the cases--I hope that there are not too many--in which I am not absolutely sure of the sense of my amendment. However, I know what I am driving at. I have rehearsed it several times to myself. I have tried changing the word "unreasonably" to "reasonably". I am not absolutely sure that I have got the amendment right because of the construction of the Bill.
<P>
I am anxious to prevent certain cases of detrimental dismissal being taken to a tribunal. I suspect that the Minister will have difficulties explaining the detail, which will emerge only in the regulations, so we have one more bite at the cherry to come. The ground for such a case could be that a worker refused to enter into a contract that included different terms from those of a collective agreement that applied to him. It could be perfectly sensible for the employer to impose such a condition. That might even be good practice for the employer, because the collective agreement might not take account of the circumstances covered by an individually updated contract.
<P>
Such matters are rather complex. The Engineering Employers Federation suggests that a practice might arise
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"where a union is recognised and collective agreements determine in whole or part the terms and conditions of employment of the employees in the bargaining unit and the employer in these circumstances decides that he wishes to change terms ... for instance, to modernise working practices, but the unions and employees will not agree to the change. Then the employer may, if he has pressing business reasons to introduce the change, give notice of termination of employment to the employees concerned combined with an offer to re-employ them on all existing terms and conditions of employment save for the new contractual arrangements about the new working practices. If the employees accept this offer which includes the new working practices, their contracts of employment have effectively changed"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
although only in respect of those new working practices. The EEF suggests:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This way of introducing change should not be made unlawful by the Regulations otherwise a significant"<P>
</UL></FONT>--
<P>
and, by inference, a fairly normal--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"way for employers to introduce necessary changes to their employees' terms and conditions of employment will be unreasonably prohibited.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Under the amendment, I am trying to propose a test that would filter out cases in which the employee was unreasonably sticking out for certain terms, perhaps because he could not agree to a change in terms that others had accepted, and his action was essentially unreasonable, because it frustrated perfectly reasonable proposals for industrial change. It would be useful if the Minister could take us through his understanding of those complicated matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall not dwell on the drafting of the amendment, but I should like to discuss the important point of principle that it raises. The hon. Member for Daventry proposes that employees should not be protected if they unreasonably refuse to enter into a contract on terms that differ from an applicable collective agreement. It is a curious proposition, because contracts are supposed to be freely entered into. People have an absolute right to refuse to enter into a contract. The question of the reasonableness of such a refusal does not, and cannot, arise. The employer may consider it unreasonable of the employee to refuse to change a contract, but that is the employee's right. The employee may equally think that it is unreasonable of the employer to refuse to change the contract, for example to give the employee a pay rise, but that is the employer's right.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Daventry reflects on the matter further, he will, I hope, realise that introducing the notion of reasonableness into the refusal to enter into a contract would be an unwise step on a steep and slippery slope. I am confident that the clause will not have the effect that he says that the Engineering Employers Federation fears. However, we shall, as always, consider his point. In the meantime, I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a fairly helpful response from the Minister. He has not slapped us down out of hand. With the greatest respect, neither he nor I has the legal firepower to resolve the matter. I understand that he does not feel that we should take an ex ante decision about whether a failure to reach a contract between an employer and an employee is unreasonable. However, I am anxious that the clause should not frustrate reasonable industrial change in the round, but protect the individual employee. That is beginning to make sense.
<P>
We have also received observations from the CBI about the corollary of the rights conveyed by the clause. It proposes a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"right for employer and employees to agree individual terms where the terms and conditions of the employees concerned would otherwise be determined by collective agreement."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That is a sort of reciprocity.
<P>
That is not the subject of the amendment, and I shall not press the matter now, but perhaps the Minister will consider it as part of his general reflection. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 108, in page 10, line 11, after "agreement", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"which is legally binding and".
<P>
Given the exchanges that we have just had, and my citations, I need not detain the Committee long on the amendment, which I have tabled because a slight asymmetry could arise. We are worried that the employee's rights seem to be reduced in the event of a legally binding contract to which he or she was a party being overridden by a collective agreement that is not legally binding, as we have explored.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Wills:</B> I should like first to explain the situation on the ground. As I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows, virtually no collective bargaining agreements are legally binding in themselves. Nothing prevents them from being legally binding, but employers and trade unions deliberately choose not to make them so. Instead, such agreements are usually given legal effect by being incorporated implicitly or explicitly into individuals' contracts of employment.
<P>
Amendment No. 108 is designed to narrow the application of the clause so as to render it useless to the very workers--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I wonder if I can encourage the Minister to be a little more forceful. This is a complex subject and a difficult Room; the Minister's voice needs to be heard by those taking the record.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The amendment would render the clause useless for the very workers who might seek to rely upon it. I am not sure what purpose it would serve. Surely it is not the hon. Gentleman's intention to deny protection to individual workers who legitimately wished to remain on collective bargaining terms without career limitations. The amendment completely undermines the purpose of the clause. I hope that he will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Briefly, I shall withdraw it pour mieux sauter--to consider it further at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question put, That clause 16 stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I shall not detain the Committee for long. I am concerned about the content of the clause, not because I think it obnoxious or likely to be detrimental, but because a fog of uncertainty surrounds its wording. I hope that the Minister will clarify it.
<P>
I realise that regulations will be issued in due course for the information of hon. Members, affected parties and the public. However, I hope that in the interim the Minister will give us some inkling of Government thinking on subsection (2). I am not assuming a stance of nescience on the matter. I inquire because I do not know the purport of subsection (2).
<P>
Subsection (2)(a) states that the regulations may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"make provision which applies only in specified classes of case".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister give us examples of what specified class of case could require such specific reference?
<P>
Secondly, can he give an example of the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"different provision for different circumstances"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
mentioned in subsection (2)(b)? Is such provision likely to be temporary or enduring? Thirdly, can he give an example of the "supplementary incidental or transitional" provisions mentioned in subsection (2)(c)?
<P>
If the Minister cannot give examples, will he at least say when we might expect to see the regulations? I must emphasise that I am not suspicious; I simply inquire. If he can offer it, I would like some clarification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, and I hope to give him some good news. However, I shall first say a little about the genesis of the clause and about the Government's intentions. In the annexe of the White Paper "Fairness at Work", which deals with trade union recognition, we said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The terms of agreements resulting from collective bargaining are normally incorporated into individual employees' contracts either explicitly or by custom and practice and thus set the minimum terms and conditions for all employees in the bargaining unit. Under the existing law an employer and employee can agree different terms if they wish. Since the current law allows flexibility and works well, the Government sees no reason to change it."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
We remain of that view. In responses to the White Paper, many employers said that they needed flexibility to offer individual contracts to certain workers--for example, to maintenance workers who may need to be available outside normal hours. Such flexibility can be included in collective agreements, but if not, the alternative of individual arrangements is necessary and useful to both employers and employees.
<P>
It was also pointed out during consultation that, the right to union recognition could be undermined even if the majority of the work force support recognition. If employers recognised a union and reached a collective agreement on terms and conditions, they could threaten or pressure some or all of their employees to give up the terms of that agreement and accept contracts on different terms. Clearly, that would be an abuse and a negation of the right to union recognition.
<P>
We reflected on that point and were persuaded that it was valid. Therefore, in the announcement of our intentions by my right hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson) on 17 December 1998, we undertook to provide protection for workers against pressure to give up terms of collective agreements.
<P>
There are good reasons for dealing with some matters by regulation as opposed to primary legislation. Where matters are complex, technical and merit detailed consultation, but are not controversial, regulations are probably the best way to proceed. As hon. Members will appreciate, we have proceeded that way several times on the Bill, on matters such as those likely to need amendment due to interaction with other legislation, including European legislation. Such considerations apply to the kind of blacklisting that we are debating, in which the law needs to mesh with the Data Protection Act 1998, which comes into force in a series of stages. They also apply to the maternal and parental provisions in the Bill.
<P>
We consider that we are giving effect to the intentions set out by my right hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool by conferring powers on the Secretary of State to make regulations. I have listened to Conservative Members' concerns about the regulations, and I am minded to agree with them. There is less justification for the matters in clause 16 being dealt with through secondary legislation. While not entirely straightforward, they are much less complicated than some of the other issues that we have discussed today.
<P>
Therefore, I hope that Conservative Members will welcome the Government's intention to table substantive provisions to replace the power in clause 16 on Report.

<B>Mr. Bercow  rose --</B><P>

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> If I can continue to give the information to the Committee, I will be happy to give way later.
<P>
I accept that tabling such an amendment on Report is less than ideal. With the benefit of hindsight, I would have preferred matters to have been otherwise and to have been able to include it from the outset. The problem was put to us at a late stage of consultation, which took place as we were finalising policy on the Bill.
<P>
However, I hope that Conservative Members who have complained--not always reasonably--that too much of the Bill has been left to secondary legislation will welcome this move from secondary to primary legislation.
<P>
I do not want to say too much about the amendment--
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow  rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will allow me some leeway to say a few words about what we are likely to table.
<P>
We propose to make it unfair to dismiss workers or subject them to other detriment because they refuse to accept a contract on terms that differ from those applicable to them under a collective agreement.
<P>
Workers will be regarded as having had action short of dismissal taken against them if they are punished or subject to any detriment because of their refusal to accept a contract on different terms. Detriment could take several forms--perhaps a block on promotion for those who refuse to give up the terms of collective agreement, the withholding of discretionary benefits if the employer chooses to award such benefits to those who have accepted contracts differing from the collective agreement, or the allocation of workers who refuse to give up the terms of collective agreement to less favourable duties or locations.
<P>
However, the mere fact that the terms of the collective agreement differ from those of individual contracts will not obviously constitute detriment.
<P>
I hope that you, Mrs. Dunwoody, and the Committee will accept my apologies for proceeding in that way at a late stage. I hope that members of the Committee found 479 480 my brief description of our intentions helpful and that they appreciate that we want to improve the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. Aside from the content of the provisions, Conservative Members welcome the fact that Ministers seem to have concluded that regulation might not be necessary or desirable in this area and that primary legislation is preferable. Although I do not know to which statement of the right hon. Member for Hartlepool on 17 December the Minister referred, the fact that he made that welcome announcement will cause me and I suspect several of my hon. Friends to go about our business with an added glint in our eye and spring in our step, in the knowledge that we have persuaded the Government of the merits of our thinking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I rise merely to acknowledge the Minister's concern on the matter. With the interested parties who made representations, we have smoked out a problem. The Government clearly intend to respond sensitively and we look forward to further detailed scrutiny.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 269, in page 15, line 16, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in connection with the conduct of industrial relations.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 253, in page 15, line 19, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in consultation with representatives of employers and employees".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I realise that our debate is about to deteriorate, after a constructive set of exchanges, but the clause should be considered, particularly in view of Parliament's right and responsibility to consider matters of supply. The clause deals with the important subject of partnerships at work and I am anxious not to give the impression that I am attacking, to be flippant, motherhood and apple pie or, to be more serious, the substance of good industrial relations or partnership working. The notion that people should work together constructively is not the invention of the Government; it was the previous Government who--not without difficulties, but nevertheless inexorably--so improved the conduct of industrial relations that they transformed them. We welcome that and we would be delighted if the Government, perhaps not directly but through the good offices of employers, trade unions and employees, continued that process.
<P>
I shall speak to my amendment and leave the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) to speak to his. The purpose of the amendment is to prevent us from resting in the warm, rosy glow of the need for partnership, thereby taking our eye off the ball. The amendment makes the clause more precise--or, as the Minister will no doubt shortly say, more limiting--because it confines the expenditure of moneys to the conduct of industrial relations. It is an attempt to avoid sloppy thinking.
<P>
I can think of lots of ways in which employers and employees work together. Husbands and wives can work together as colleagues in this place, for example, but that has little to do with industrial relations. The Committee may also know that at the battle of Trafalgar--I suspect not on the back of the good industrial relations policy of the Royal Navy; that was once memorably described, but I shall not go into details--Nelson's gunners were able to reload and discharge their ordnance four times faster than that of their opponents in the French and Spanish fleet which made a major contribution to that redoubted success. That was an example of working together but, whatever its motives, it had little to do with industrial relations.
<P>
Ministers should not give themselves the power to spend money, for nothing other than the general seal of working together. They should be a little more precise in their objectives. While making that point, I invite the Minister to give some indication of his thinking on the likely resourcing and the scale and nature of the activity that is involved. That matter may arise under a later amendment, but if he wants to share it with us now, we shall not complain.

<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): One is almost lost for words after the oratory of the hon. Member for Daventry. I have never heard the principles and clauses of industrial relations cast so wide. I have to pause to remind myself that perhaps the hon. Member for Daventry was not claiming that his party, with all its aspirations to develop partnerships at work, was responsible for "In Place of Strife." He went on to talk about the battle of Trafalgar, and I was almost certain that he was there. Perhaps the excellence and efficiency of the naval gunners at that times was due to the investment in technology and not just to partnerships in the workplace.
<P>
Perhaps I should move on rapidly to speak to my amendment. This miscellaneous clause sets out the opportunity for the Secretary of State to provide money
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for the purpose of encouraging and helping employers (and their representatives) and employees (or their representatives) to Improve the way they work together."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That is a noble cause, with which no one would argue.
<P>
The issue that comes to mind is that the clause gives complete freedom to the Secretary of State of the time to spend such money in whatever way he or she wishes. I do not want the clause to be interpreted as being open to political aims. It should be construed as a positive measure to ensure that state moneys are definitely used to improve partnerships in the workplace. The reason why I tabled my amendment is that I should be much happier if the clause placed an obligation on the Secretary of State to consult first with the relevant representatives of employers and employees to ascertain that it was a good investment to improve partnerships at work.
<P>
I shall be happy to hear what the Minister says about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> The Committee may not want to have a stand part debate, but I want to comment on the two sensible amendments to this open-ended clause.
almost all those who responded to the White Paper. Officials have spoken informally to the TUC and the CBI about the proposed funding and we are continuing to consult them. The hon. Gentleman will just have to be patient and wait a while longer for the details.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked why the Appropriation Acts were not sufficient authority for the measure. It is true that, although such Acts provide general authority for the Government's spending, the measure is a novel area of expenditure and we have seen fit to seek specific statutory authority to cover it. That is appropriate and it sends the right signal about the value that we attach to this particular area of work. We all agree on the importance of partnership.
<P>
As for the hon. Gentleman's remarks about keeping the Teasury in the dark, that is not possible or desirable in such matters--as he knows. Although the amount has not yet been announced, it will be met out of the DTI budget that was agreed as a result of the comprehensive spending review. I hope that the hon. Member for South Dorset will be reassured by my explanation--he should be--and he ought to welcome the ends to which the  money will be directed. I hope that we can agree, and on that basis, I commend the clause to the Committee.
