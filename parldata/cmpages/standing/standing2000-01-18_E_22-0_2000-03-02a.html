<P>
<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I beg to move amendment No. 534, in page 76, line 11, leave out paragraph (b).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 536, in page 76, line 14, leave out lines 14 to 24.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The clause is important because with it we begin to discuss the financial provisions in this part of the Bill. I am moving the amendment principally because we are concerned about what criteria a local authority can use to rule someone out from being invited to tender for a subsidised service. By leaving out paragraph (b), we would remove the authority's right to refuse a tender on the spurious grounds that it does not fit with its bus strategy. I will be interested to hear what the Minister says on that topic.
<P>
Amendment No 536, by leaving out subsection (8), would permit the district to procure the bus services that it wants and allow more flexibility.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> We are beginning to approach the end of part II and as the terminus hoves into sight it might be appropriate to go a little further along the route in my famous guided bus, and to describe the purposes of clauses 130 to 135. [Interruption.] If I am further provoked by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Don Foster), I shall take us along in a tourist bus.
<P>
Those clauses cover several important financial arrangements for the support of bus services and other public passenger transport services. They recognise the role that funding provided by central Government and local authorities plays in ensuring that local authorities have the bus services that they need. The clauses also seek to ensure that the funding is used to best effect.
<P>
The Committee will know that we have already substantially increased provision for the support of bus services, most notably through new grants for rural services and by ensuring that the fuel duty rebate paid to bus operators is increased in line with fuel duty increases. Both those steps have been widely and justifiably welcomed. As it is important to continue to get value for money from the resources, we have asked the Commission for Integrated Transport to examine the whole subject.
<P>
Among other things, this group of clauses provides flexibility for changes to the grant arrangements, should they appear necessary in the light of changing requirements and the commission's report, which we expect later this year. We have no intention of changing or removing the arrangements for any current grant before we are fully satisfied that change would benefit the delivery of our wider transport objectives, or before necessary alternative arrangements are in place.
<P>
The clauses also provide a broad power to make grants to local authorities in support of public transport services and facilities. That will, for example, enable us to put grants in support of rural services, which are covered only by annual special grant reports, on a permanent statutory basis. I think that the Committee would on the whole welcome that.
<P>
The clauses also recognise the importance to bus users of measures to ensure that operators run local bus services reliably. When an operator registers the route and timetable for his service with the traffic commissioner, as he is required by law to do, that is in effect his promise to the public that the service will run according to the details in the registration. The Transport Act 1985 provides for the traffic commissioner, where he is satisfied that the operator has failed to fulfil the terms of his registration, to levy a financial penalty on the operator based on the repayment of 20 per cent. of the fuel duty rebate he has been paid in the preceding three months.
<P>
There are two purposes behind the changes to that penalty which these clauses introduce. First, they provide for a new form of penalty to be introduced on the replacement, should that occur, of fuel duty rebate under clause 131. Secondly, they give the traffic commissioner greater flexibility to match the amount of the penalty to the particular circumstances of the case so that instead of a set figure in every instance he can determine a penalty to suit the seriousness of the operator's failure up to a certain maximum provided for in the clauses.
<P>
Clause 130 introduces a new best-value test for subsidy by local authorities of bus services. It will require authorities, in making decisions on which services to subsidise, to have regard to economy, efficiency and effectiveness, and also to their bus strategy and environmental considerations.
<P>
The clause also tackles what has been seen as a hindrance to local authorities in using their subsidy powers to secure the provision of increases in frequency in bus services. Section 92(1) of the Transport Act 1985 requires that in exercising subsidy powers authorities must not act so as ``to inhibit competition''. It has been argued that that is too inflexible a test. Some authorities have been reluctant to buy additional frequency in circumstances that might prompt complaints from a bus operator that it inhibited his ability to provide a service in competition with the one on which frequency has been increased. Clause 130 therefore also introduces a new, more flexible requirement designed to make it easier for authorities to use the powers to subsidise increased frequency on an existing service The new formulation will simply require authorities to have regard to the interests of the public and transport providers.
<P>
Clause 131 is an enabling clause. It enables the introduction of new arrangements for central Government or National Assembly for Wales grants to operators of bus services. When introduced, the clause will replace fuel duty rebate, currently paid under the Finance Act 1965, with a more flexible power to make grants to operators on a changed basis. The clause provides for the making of regulations on eligibility for the new grants and the method of calculation.
<P>
Clause 132 enables a new form of penalty to be introduced for use by the traffic commissioner where he determines that a bus operator has, without reasonable excuse, failed to operate a registered service or has failed to register a route. Section 111 of the 1985 Act provides for a penalty of repayment by the operator of 20 per cent. of the fuel duty rebate he has received for the previous quarter. In the event that fuel duty rebate is replaced under clause 131, the new penalty under clause 132 will be in the form of a payment by the operator of a sum determined by the traffic commissioner according to his judgment of the seriousness of the case. The penalty will, however, be based on the number of vehicles that the operator is licensed to run up to a maximum of £550 per vehicle. The maximum figure may be amended subsequently by regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): Will my hon. Friend say a few words about his thinking about replacement of fuel duty rebate? The industry is concerned that any replacement should be no less generous than the existing scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am happy to do so and to offer the reassurance that my hon. Friend is seeking. I am well aware of concerns in the bus community—if I may use that phrase In fact, I had a meeting with First Bus yesterday, in the course of which this issue was raised.
<P>
Let me put these enabling clauses in context. The opportunity for a Transport Bill does not occur very frequently. This is the first major Transport Bill for 15 years or more. For that reason, we thought that it was sensible to make the measure more flexible, in case of changes in the subsidy arrangements for bus services. I reassure my hon. Friend that the Government have no current intention to change the fuel duty rebate arrangements. However, as I said, we asked the Commission for Integrated Transport, perfectly reasonably, to consider the matter of bus subsidies; we have no idea what its recommendations will be or whether they will relate to fuel duty rebate. The Government will, of course, consider the commission's recommendations seriously and, if we judge them to be sensible, we will introduce proposals. That said, I assure my hon. Friend that there will be no disadvantage to bus operators, whatever arrangements are made. That is implicit in future clauses. I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): It is staggering that the Government are introducing measures that enable them to do things that they say they have no intention of doing. I am sceptical about the quality of the Minister's reassurances to his hon. Friend that nothing that the Government do will disadvantage any operator in any way. If the hon. Gentleman is saying that the rebate will be available for distribution at the largesse of Ministers, instead of through the automatic mechanism of the rebate, there will be winners and losers. Will the Minister reiterate his assurance to his hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape)?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The Government have no intention of changing the overall arrangements for support offered by central and local government to bus operators. Of course, as the hon. Gentleman knows from the experience of his party when in power, any moneys forthcoming from Government depend on constraints on public spending at any given time.
<P>
I reiterate the general assurance that the bus community has nothing to fear from the Government's future proposals. There is no such anxiety in the bus community, which has welcomed most powerfully the Government's new approach and our commitment to bus services since coming to power in 1997. The bus community is most content with a range of measures that the Government have introduced, not least the Bill's proposals for quality partnerships, about which the Opposition are so sceptical.
<P>
Clause 133 gives the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales, the power to make grants to transport authorities, other than PTAs, for the purpose of establishing, continuing or improving public transport services or facilities. The grants may be paid subject to conditions when that is appropriate. One effect of the clause will be to put on a permanent statutory basis grants given to local authorities for the support of rural bus services which are currently covered by annual special grant reports.
<P>
Clause 134 matches clause 133 in giving powers to make grants to passenger transport authorities for the purpose of enabling the authority, or the passenger transport executive for its area, to carry out any of their functions.
<P>
Clause 135, which will have effect only until such time as clause 132 is introduced, amends the provision in section 111 of the Transport Act 1985 that a penalty imposed on an operator by the traffic commissioner for failure to run a registered service shall be a fixed 20 per cent. of the fuel duty rebate the operator has received in the previous three months. Instead, the clause provides that the traffic commissioner will have discretion to impose a penalty of up to 20 per cent. of the fuel duty rebate over the previous three months.
<P>
I hope that the Committee has found that brief overview helpful. It has set out the purpose of this important group of clauses.
<P>
Amendment No. 534, tabled by the hon. Members for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) and for Poole (Mr. Syms), would remove from clause 130(2) the requirement that in reaching decisions on the award of tenders for subsidised bus services, local authorities must, among other matters, have regard to the implementation of the current bus strategy for the area. That would be an inappropriate and retrograde step.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The authority's bus strategy will set out the general policies that should inform all its decisions on bus matters. It is odd that the hon. Member for Poole should be anxious that the criteria might rule out operators enjoying benefits on the spurious grounds that they do not fit into their bus strategy. Of course, they will fit into the bus strategy. What would be the point of having a bus strategy unless it was applied to the specificities of the policy? In that context, clause 130(2)(b) plays a useful and necessary role in requiring that tendering decisions should have regard to the implementation of the bus strategy. Those decisions should reflect the policies, for example on standards of service, which the authority sets out in the strategy. It would not be appropriate for an authority to devise and apply criteria for tendering decisions that were at odds with the strategy and did not contribute to its achievement.
<P>
Amendment No. 536 is a change following on from that proposed in amendment No. 534. If clause 130(2)(b) remains, as we think that it should, the definition of current bus strategy in clause 130(8) remains necessary.
<P>
In the light of my explanation, I invite the hon. Gentleman to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Under-Secretary gave his open-top tour of the remaining clauses in the chapter, which was helpful. On that basis, I am prepared to allow members of the Committee to comment more broadly, on the understanding that when we consider other amendments and clauses, the debates will have to be more focused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> In the light of what you said, Mr. Gale, I crave your indulgence about whether we debate clauses 130 and 131 together. I do not mind if we forego a separate debate on those clauses. However, taken together, the clauses are a retrograde step to state planning, subsidy and control of the bus industry.
<P>
I note the success with which the Under-Secretary heralds the rural bus partnership and bus grant schemes, which were made in the context of existing legislation. Will he enumerate precisely the difficulties that local authorities and the Government face in providing bus services and explain how clauses 130 and 131 will solve those problems? It seems that the Government are succumbing to the pressures of the old-fashioned town hall bureaucrats that populate the Labour party in large numbers. They are the people who like to own and control, to subsidise and direct, because they can imagine no other way of getting things done. That is why the Labour party historically opposed every privatisation and deregulation during the 18 years of Conservative Government. However, now they are in office, the Labour Government pretend to be Conservative.
<P>
If the intention of the clause is simply to introduce best value criteria for the tendering of bus services, that is already provided for in the Local Government Act 1999. There is no need for the clause. Is it designed to widen councils' powers to subsidise bus services beyond the powers that already exist? The Under-Secretary described the powers, but why are they necessary? What, precisely, will they achieve? What criteria on value for money do the Government expect local councils to use in applying the subsidies? Or, are the Government just pandering to town halls that want to play buses?
<P>
The clause removes the constraint on local authorities imposed by section 92(1) of the 1985 Act that in exercising powers to subsidise services, authorities have to act so as ``not to inhibit competition''. That is sensible, because competition is the foundation of efficiency. The figures that I gave the Committee earlier this week showed how the introduction of proper competition into the bus industry has led to a dramatic improvement in costs per passenger per mile—which eventually leads to the sustenance of ridership, which must be the ultimate test of the policy's success. If competition is inhibited, operators will become sloppy and will cease providing the services that people want. Subsidies will have to be increased to sustain the level of service. I can see no benefit in this back-door re-nationalisation of the bus industry.
<P>
We will come later to an amendment that deals with the subsidies that local authorities can grant to their own bus companies. Local authorities have a rotten record of running their own bus companies. Reading Buses, for example, introduced the much-vaunted Goldline service from Reading to London, on which the Deputy Prime Minister sat as he opened that wretched bus lane on the M4. That service has now been withdrawn. Despite the bus lane and the subsidies from Reading council, it could not be made to pay.
<P>
Successful bus companies are those like that for which the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East sits on the board—his company is successful because it is in the private sector, although I note that he is a bit rattled by the Minister's threat to interfere with the grants under the next clause, which deals essentially with the abolition of the fuel duty rebate for the bus industry. The hon. Gentleman's question about the likely effect of that abolition was perfectly reasonable, but he got the most astonishing answer: that although the Government have included it in the legislation, they do not have a clue about what it will do. That is a novel way of conducting the legislative process—to include something in a Bill without having in mind certain objectives or believing that it will have a certain effect. The Committee are just writing the Government a blank cheque to do what they want and to disturb arrangements that have existed in the bus industry for a considerable time.
<P>
The only effect of removing the bus fuel duty rebate and replacing it with a system of grants that are frankly discretionary is that, year to year, bus companies will no longer be able to plan ahead. They will no longer have any security about their financial projections because they will never know when the Government or local authorities will move the goalposts and cut or transfer the subsidy to another service. The predictability and stability of financial planning in the industry will be destroyed at a stroke, which will add risk to the provision of bus services. There will be fewer bus services if the business becomes more risk and heaven knows that it is risky already. The cost of providing capital for the industry will increase and life will be more difficult for bus passengers.
<P>
We can only imagine that the provisions are in the Bill because the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has been outfoxed by the Treasury, as has happened constantly since he came to office. We all know that the comprehensive spending review resulted in a decline in transport spending in real terms. He fell at the first fence when it came to the roads review, being forced to slash more than 100 schemes of the 144 inherited from the previous Government, and the Treasury pocketed the money. Now that the Government's new Minister for Transport, Lord Macdonald, wants to try to rescue their reputation by building some bypasses, they have to resort to local authority borrowings.
<P>
I can imagine how the conversation went as the Secretary of State was completely outmanoeuvred by the Treasury once again. He probably said, ``Look here, Gordon, I want more cash for buses, because the bus has got to be a racehorse, not a workhorse. It is the centrepiece of my strategy.'' The Chancellor probably replied, ``The more buses you put out, the more money you get from me anyway because of the wretched fuel duty rebate, which I loathe.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson </B>(Harwich): Is the hon. Gentleman using the argument about the abolition of fuel duty as another political scaremongering initiative from the Conservative party?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am impressed that the hon. Gentleman is beginning to be scared. If he asked the bus company that runs the service from Clacton to Harwich, of which he is so proud, whether it was pleased that the Government are to fiddle with the fuel duty rebate and might take it away, the company would say, ``That's a bit worrying, but we hope that the Government are not stupid enough to interfere.'' Why are we putting such a provision in legislation? The hon. Gentleman is about to vote for the clause. Has he discussed the matter with his local bus company?
<P>
<B>Mr. Henderson:</B> I was pointing out that the hon. Gentleman has been caught scaremongering several times on local issues, including the abolition of local parish councils. I believe that he is doing the same again. He has heard the Minister's response—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a limit to my tolerance. I cannot find anything in the Bill directly or indirectly related to parish councils.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Would that parish councils' powers over bus services were to be strengthened, as opposed to the threat that hangs over those councils under the Government.
<P>
We have established that the hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Henderson) has not discussed the matter with his bus companies, so he does not know what he is talking about. If he talks to the bus companies in Essex, he will find that they can plan new bus services on the basis that they have 100 per cent. certainty of the bus fuel duty rebate. The legislation removes that certainty.
<P>
On what basis is the hon. Gentleman happy about that? What reason has the Minister given? He said that the Government want room to manoeuvre in case the Commission for Integrated Transport—another quango that they have created—tells them to do something different from what they are already doing, but that at the moment they do not intend to do anything different.
<P>
What sort of basis is that on which to legislate?
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Secretary of State has asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer for more money for buses. The Chancellor has said that he is already being given too much through the wretched rebate—which the Treasury has historically hated—and has offered to give him more grants in return for the fuel duty rebate. The Secretary of State is a sucker for grants, and does not realise that giving up the fuel duty rebate means giving up the certainty of annual allocation according to the demand of the rebate in exchange for an annual negotiation with the Treasury about how much grant he is allowed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): Is the hon. Gentleman saying on behalf of the Conservative party that, should it ever have the power, it would never tamper with the rebate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I can give the hon. Gentleman the categorical assurance that if we changed the arrangements for the rebate, we would have a reason for doing so, unlike the Under-Secretary. He does not have a clue why the proposal is being introduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the previous, Conservative Government did not remove or lift the cap on the fuel duty rebate. The central flaw in his argument is that the current Chancellor did.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am not sure what point the hon. Gentleman is making. Although the Chancellor has increased fuel duty—contrary to the promises that the Prime Minister made before the general election—he has not allowed the fuel duty rebate to expand as it used to under the Conservatives. At the same time, he has raised the floor of the rebate in order to avoid increasing liability.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Again, I am relieved that the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo) has become shadow Chancellor, rather than the hon. Gentleman. The fuel duty rebate cap was maintained by Conservative Chancellors for many years, and was lifted by the current Chancellor, whom the hon. Gentleman is now attacking and who is saying that he opposes it. He cannot have it both ways.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It is obvious why the Treasury wants to get rid of the fuel duty rebate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> Earlier, the hon. Gentleman said that the Under-Secretary did not know. He cannot have it both ways.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> First, the Government started to erode the rebate by raising the floor above which it is payable. Now, the Chancellor wants to get rid of it because it constitutes an open-ended cheque from the Treasury. The Treasury much prefers negotiating grants in the annual public spending review to granting open-ended commitments to permanent tax discounts. It has no control over how the fuel duty rebate is allocated. The rebate is a market mechanism, and is therefore attractive. It is a tax subsidy that does not have a distorting effect, and a case can be made for extending it. In our commonsense revolution we have argued for extending it to community transport. One of the so-called successes of the Government's rural transport policy is the Wiltshire wiggly bus, which does not qualify for the rebate. If the Under-Secretary proposed some carefully drafted amendments to enable flexible, more demand-related unscheduled bus services to qualify for the fuel duty rebate, we should be pleased to discuss them. However, he has not. He has proposed provisions merely to get rid of the fuel duty rebate at some unspecified date and has assured us, ``Don't worry, everything will be all right. Block your ears and vote for this.'' It is a monstrosity and I am surprised that Labour Members are happy to trust the draconian Treasury with the power to apply leverage.
<P>
Whatever the intentions of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions regarding future negotiations with the Treasury, once the Bill is on the statute book, this provision will be in play. From now on, the bus fuel duty rebate will be in play in every public spending negotiation with the Treasury. Is that what Labour Members want? [HON. MEMBERS: ``No''.] Well, they are going to vote for it because we are going to divide the Committee on both clauses to ensure that Labour Members have to stick their heads over the parapet and be counted.
<P>
It would be a terrible mistake to put these provisions on the statute book. If I could have the Under-Secretary's attention for a moment—he is concentrating on the messages that he is receiving—he must answer this key question. What will the provisions do for bus transport that cannot be done under existing arrangements? The Committee is entitled to a proper explanation, rather than a technical explanation of what the legislation will mean in legal terms.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am always struck by the hon. Gentleman's intimate knowledge of conversations between the Deputy Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I wish I shared his sources. As usual, however, he grotesquely over-eggs the pudding in his responses. Frankly, his scaremongering will not be taken seriously by bus operators or the public. In particular, the bus-using public in rural areas—not least in the hon. Gentleman's neck of the woods in Essex—know full well how they have benefited from the Government. We have no worries that any of the hon. Gentleman's maunderings will be taken seriously outside the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I will, but the hon. Gentleman has already had a good bite of the cherry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I wish to point out that no services are provided under the rural bus partnership in my constituency. Services are still being cut because the hon. Gentleman will not allow local authorities the freedom to use the money to keep vital services going. What advertisement for his policies is that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made repeated pleas in Committee for fuel duty rebate to be extended to community transport—one of the services provided in his locality. If he is concerned about that matter, he should welcome clause 131, which provides flexibility for precisely that change. I hope that he will take that message of hope back to his constituency, even though he intends to divide the Committee and therefore opposes the looming opportunity for the excellent people who live there, who may have serious misgivings about their future support for him.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the purposes of the clause. I have more than adequately described them already, but I shall deal with some of his specific points. He asked why we are introducing best value. Frankly, it makes sense for a bus Bill to express a best-value commitment from the Government to the bus industry.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked why we are not changing the 1985 Act. We are, in fact, introducing a relatively minor modification to it. However, the 1985 Act—in line with the general ethos of the Conservative Government during that period—introduced the least-cost concept in the tendering of bus services. It is reasonable now, in the best interests of the public, to widen the considerations that local authorities can take into account in granting tenders to include the quality of local bus transit, best value, economy, efficiency, effectiveness and so forth.
<P>
The 1985 Act made some authorities reluctant to buy additional frequency out of fear of receiving complaints from bus operators that it inhibited their ability to provide a service in competition with the operator whose frequency is increased. We do not wish to inhibit or change competition in the market; only to allow local authorities to improve the frequency of bus services. That is entirely reasonable, as even the hon. Member for North Essex—if he gave the Committee the courtesy of listening to my responses—might acknowledge. The provision is not, as he claimed, an inhibition on competition.
<P>
Let me remind the hon. Member for North Essex that the clauses are based on competitive tendering to buy services from bus operators. We are not reverting to direction from town hall Stalinists—one of the images conjured up by the hon. Gentleman's observations. Clause 131 is an enabling clause, which offers a trip wire that can be activated, if necessary. It goes without saying that we are not talking about discretionary grants and any changes will be made by statutory instrument. I can offer that assurance to the bus community— though I can evidently not offer it to the hon. Member for North Essex, who is once again engrossed in private conversations. As I said, any changes to the regulations will be made by statutory instrument and proper parliamentary procedures will apply.
<P>
It is only sensible for the powers set out in clauses 131 and 132 to provide flexibility because we must allow for changing circumstances. I reiterate that no changes will take place without the most careful consideration by the Government and by Parliament itself.
<P>
In conclusion, and in response to the scaremongering of the hon. Member for North Essex about the future of fuel duty rebate, let me explain that the rebate has gone up since the general election and has offset the increases in duty. It is now £50 million per year higher than in 1997. Furthermore, fuel duty rebate was frozen from 1993 to 1997 under the previous Conservative Administration. Bus operators and the public know with which party fuel duty rebate is safer—and it is certainly not the official Opposition. I have obviously tempted my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Will my hon. Friend also underline that the majority of UK operators used the additional fuel duty rebate granted by the Government to invest in new vehicles? Any uncertainty provoked unnecessarily by the hon. Member for North Essex, who speaks for the Opposition, is likely to prejudice such investment in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I entirely agree. Fuel duty rebate is now worth £330 million a year to the bus industry and contributes significantly to the effectiveness of both its operations and the investment programme, which is running at record levels in that industry.
<P>
We make no promises in the sense that no Government can ever make an absolute, for-all-time promise about the future of elements of public expenditure. It nevertheless remains a fact that our past actions show our attitude of continuing and growing support to the bus industry. Upon that basis, I ask Opposition Members to end their scaremongering and to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If the hon. Gentleman wants us not to oppose the two clauses, will he give an assurance that any additional flexibility under these provisions will not be used to withdraw bus fuel duty rebate from any operator that is eligible for it, and that he will use the powers to extend the rebate to community transport? That is our policy and it is the policy that we would like him to adopt. If he is asking for additional powers under the legislation to do we know not what and he is not prepared to give those assurances, why should we support him?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I made it clear that the provisions in clause 130 allow an element of greater strength to local authorities to increase support for the frequency of bus services if they so choose. We believe that that is a good idea and we certainly do not retract on it. On flexibility, I made crystal clear that the Government are highly committed, as our record demonstrates, to support the bus industry. We want to allow some flexibility in the light of changing circumstances—that seems only reasonable—but I do not believe that the bus community has any serious anxieties about the intentions and commitment of the Government to the future well-being and prosperity of and the service provided by the bus industry.

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> There was a film a few years ago with Danny de Vito and Gregory Peck in which Danny de Vito played a rampaging capitalist. Apart from liking dunking doughnuts, what he really liked was other people's money. The Government are a little like that, not only because of tax raising but because they have an integrated transport commission. One of the first things that they do is to take a block of money which has been used purely for the bus industry and consider how they can use it differently. It is legitimate for us to raise the concerns of bus companies because they are used to the current regime and there is now a question mark—I put it no higher—over whether it will continue. Even the explanatory notes on fuel duty rebate say that differential rates of grant could be specified for more environmentally friendly vehicles. That may be a laudable aim, but to the bus companies it puts a question mark over how the scheme has operated in the past. The Wilts and Dorset Bus Company said that without the fuel duty rebate, 15 per cent. would have to be added to fares, even if it were reduced slightly or if it were used in a different way. That causes concern and we were looking for a reassurance from the Minister today. The Bill will go through and could effect changes that will affect the industry substantially.
<P>
I thank the Minister for his explanation and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Amendment made: No. 428, in page 76, leave out line 24 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`made jointly by the Passenger Transport Authority for the area and the councils for the metropolitan districts comprised in the area.''.'.—[Mr. Hill.]<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 537, in page 76, line 30, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
As I understand it, the element of the 1985 Act contained in subsection (4) was originally introduced because of the concerns about local authorities subsidising local authority bus companies to allow them to compete with the private sector. That is our principal concern about that aspect of the Bill; changing the relevant part of the 1985 Act could lead to unfair competition. The explanatory notes state clearly that the clause will remove the part of the Transport Act 1985 that instructed local authorities not to inhibit competition by interfering in the market. It says—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is replaced with a new duty to have regard to the interests of the public and of operators. This is intended to make it easier for authorities to subsidise additional service frequency.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not our concern; our main concern is that the Bill will allow authorities to interfere by subsidising services. The provision of local authority bus services could lead those in the private sector to feel that there was a degree of unfairness or, in other words, that the market had been skewed.
<P>
The thrust of this part of the Bill, which includes matters such as quality contracts, is that companies and authorities should make agreements with each other. However, if there is provision for authorities to subsidise a service, we will replace a competitive situation with one in which the market can be skewed by a local authority, not only for legitimate reasons, but perhaps for illegitimate reasons, such as an attempt to keep a private sector company out of the market.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I acknowledge the points made by the hon. Member for Poole. I want to be responsive to them to some extent, but I cannot agree with the amendment.
<P>
The ability to subsidise bus services is a key element of the transport powers available to local authorities. Under section 92(1) of the 985 Act, local authorities have a stark duty in their use of those powers—they must not inhibit competition between bus operators. That constraint is too strong and, as I have said, has made local authorities unduly reluctant to use their powers to enhance the frequency of bus services, even though that is an important way to make them more attractive to the general public. Accordingly, subsection (4) deliberately softens the constraint, so that local authorities must have regard not only to the interests of bus companies— important though they may be—but to the interests of the public. That is the proper balance.
<P>
I should explain that we envisage an amendment that will dovetail the provision with general competition regulation. I hope that that will help the hon. Member for Poole. The amendment that we plan to table will allow a bus operator to go to the Director General of Fair Trading if he feels that a local authority is using its power in a way that is unfair or discriminates between operators. In examining such a case, the Office of Fair Trading will be required to take into account not only competition issues but the likely benefits to bus users and the wider public interest. That is the proper balance. The public interest should be taken into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth </B>(Aldershot): That is an important point. I have received a letter from the joint consultative and advisory committee for public transport of my local authority—Rushmoor borough council—expressing concern that the Competition Act 1998 is working against transport integration, which is the very thing that the Government want. The Minister recognises the difficulties that local authorities and bus operators experience with that Act, I think, but can he tell me when he will discuss it with the Director General of Fair Trading and when the changes needed to overcome the problem will be introduced?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I appreciate the concerns expressed by the hon. Gentleman on behalf of Rushmoor borough council about the potential operation of the Competition Act 1998 on bus services. We have had hours of discussion in Committee about competition. In his extended absence from the Committee I have made a number of explanations and commitments on the subject and I would therefore be grateful if he could identify his precise concerns so that I can deal with them now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and acknowledge that, as he so politely put it, my ``extended absence'' from the Committee on other duties precluded me from being involved in those earlier discussions, but I am not sure that you, Mr. Gale, would rule me in order if I used an intervention to make a point to the Under-Secretary. If the hon. Gentleman agrees, I might more usefully drop him a note so that he might be able to consider the points raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I would be delighted to receive a note from the hon. Gentleman and to respond. This is a listening and responsive Government and I am a listening and responsive Minister. Let me conclude by saying that we feel that it is entirely right that the public interest should be taken into account, but I stress to Opposition Members that competition issues and thus the implications for bus operators—in precisely the way indicated by the hon. Member for Poole—would also need to be taken into account. On that basis, I hope that the amendment can be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am glad that the Under-Secretary acknowledges that there is concern over this section of clause 130. In effect, the concerns of the bus companies are a result of that. Given his assurances that he is aware of that concern and is trying to set out a strategy so that the bus companies can take action if they feel that they are being unfairly treated by local authorities, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> Order. No, we shall not. We shall debate amendment No. 538. The clause has been widely discussed already and I shall be grateful if the Minister will respond to points made on the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> You are right, Mr. Gale. I was simply reflecting that I explained in a debate on Tuesday afternoon that it was custom and practice for Government to consult always before making regulations. I give the hon. Gentleman the same assurances this morning that we intend to consult bodies representative of the bus industry and other interested parties on these regulations. Consultation with those affected is not only standard practice in making regulations, as set down in Cabinet Office good practice guidance, but we also recognise that consultation on these regulations will be necessary to seek views on the effects of the definition proposed. We have made it clear throughout part II of the Bill that consultation with the bus industry and other interested parties is a key aspect of implementation of all the measures involved. We want to hear and value the views of all those who have something to contribute to bus policy and its implementation.
<P>
On the basis of that assurance, which is similar to the one that I gave on Tuesday afternoon, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw his amendment.

<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> I remind all hon. Members that at the start of our sittings, I deemed that the Door at the far end of the Room should not be a Members' entrance, but should be for the public only. The reason for that is that we only have two Officers of the House on duty and they have agreed with me that they will lock the two Members' Doors only and that the far Door will therefore be open at all times. That system can operate only if all Members assist by using the two Doors that we have decreed shall be used by them.

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> These are technical amendments to ensure that the consequences of devolution are carried through to the proper benefit of the people of Wales. The Bill as drafted provides for the National Assembly for Wales to operate in parallel with the Secretary of State, but subsection (4) on the provision of the payment of any penalty simply specifies that it is payable to the Secretary of State. This is not a satisfactory arrangement when the penalty in Wales should be paid to the National Assembly for Wales. Amendment No. 600 and the related amendments are designed to achieve that effect. They bring the new provisions into line with the new responsibilities of the National Assembly for Wales and I hope that the Committee will endorse them.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it is convenient to take Government amendment No. 591.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> These two Government amendments are limited in scope. They are designed to respond to representations made to us by local government. Several local authorities own bus undertakings—public transport companies, or PTCs in legal language. Originally, in the shires, these companies were owned at district council level, but local government reorganisation means that several are now owned by unitary authorities, in which the functions of districts and counties are combined. It is not uncommon for councillors of the parent local authority also to be directors of a PTC. In such cases, the existing legislation prevents the councillors concerned from speaking or voting on matters relating to the PTC. In principle, that is reasonable, but in a unitary authority the county element of the council's responsibilities will include making the local transport plan and bus strategy. Councillor directors might be prevented from speaking or voting on such matters, because there might be an effect—however indirect—on the PTC.
<P>
There is a similar disqualification outside a unitary authority if a director of a PTC is also a member of a county council. Such disqualifications would surely be a pity. The councillors concerned might be the very people who had particular knowledge of transport issues and could make a constructive contribution in the way that has been advocated by my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East, who, sadly, is not with us at present. Accordingly, the amendments allow those councillors to speak or vote on matters relating to local transport plans and bus strategies. I stress that the amendments are deliberately narrowly drawn and would maintain all other existing disqualifications—for example, preventing any voting on contractual matters. They are sensible amendments that make appropriate arrangements for councillors who have knowledge and expertise to contribute to the formation of local transport plans and bus strategies. I hope that the Committee will endorse them.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 605, in page 174, leave out lines 22 to 29.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: new clause 26—Abolition of financial plans of Passenger Transport Executives—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. Sections 3 to 5 of the Transport Act 1983 (duty of Passenger Transport Executives to prepare three year financial plans and determination of revenue grants) shall cease to have effect.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 704, 706 and 707.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The new clause removes the requirement in the Transport Act 1983 for passenger transport executives to prepare three-year financial plans and submit them to passenger transport authorities and the Secretary of State. The other amendments remove the relevant text from the 1983 Act and make consequential changes to that and other legislation.
<P>
In our discussions with PTEs, they suggested that the requirement to prepare these plans is now obsolete. Having considered the matter, we agree. The 1983 Act dates from a period when the then Government was seeking to exert tight control on the activities of PTAs and PTEs prior to the abolition of the metropolitan county councils in 1986. The amendments remove an unnecessary burden from PTEs, freeing resources to be used more productively on work such as the preparation of local transport plans. The accountability of PTEs and PTAs is unaffected. In particular, PTAs will still have to approve any proposal by PTEs to use reserves to cover actual or forecast deficits in any given year. I hope that the Committee will agree these amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take new clause 17—Disposal of interests by local authorities—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>` `.—Any local transport authority which owns an interest in a provider of local transport services must make provision for disposal of that interest at a commercial price within 24 months of this Act coming into force.'.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I shall not detain the Committee long. In our deliberations on other clauses, including our recent debates on 130 and 131, we referred to local transport authorities that own their own bus organisations. The purpose of these two new clauses is not to enable a detailed debate about whether bus organisations owned by local authorities are run efficiently, but to give the Minister an opportunity to assure members of the Committee that nothing in the Bill would preclude the existing arrangements and especially to ensure that nothing will prevent a local authority or local transport authority from using its vehicles to provide bus services where, in their view, that is the most economic, effective and efficient way to do so.
<P>
We are aware that, on occasions, a local authority's transport plan will include services that the authority wants to be provided for the benefit of the travelling public. On some occasions, no bus operator in the local authority's area will be prepared to provide such a service unless it receives a large subsidy. If the local authority can use its own vehicles to provide that much-needed service at a lower cost than the subsidy paid to a private bus operator, it clearly makes sense to ensure that the authority can provide the service. That, in essence, is the purpose of the new clauses. I look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> With new clause 17, we are approaching the problem from a slightly different angle. It follows the concern that we expressed earlier today about the changed arrangements. With quality contracts, local authorities will have a more important role in setting out their services. We are concerned that local authority controlled bus companies may be put in a privileged position. In the light of reassurances that were given in an earlier debate about being able to appeal to the Office of Fair Trading, we shall not press the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall respond briefly to the various matters that have been raised.
<P>
On new clause 17, I reiterate the assurances that have already been given on the protection available under the Competition Act and from the OFT. I trust that that satisfies the hon. Member for Poole.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Bath knows, under the Public Passengers Vehicles Act 1981, local education authorities are empowered to carry fare-paying passengers on buses used to provide free school transport and to use those vehicles to provide public bus services at times when the vehicles are not required for school transport. About 16 authorities make use of that power. I assure the hon. Gentleman that nothing in the Bill affects those powers.

New clause 12—No fare services—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—Where an operator proposes to operate a bus service for which no fares will be collected, that service shall be subject to registration in the usual way.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I shall be brief, not least because my hon. Friend the Member for Bath is champing at the bit to discuss new clauses that, surprisingly enough, relate to open-topped buses. Committee members are obviously raring to discuss such matters as soon as possible.
<P>
The new clauses all relate to a general theme. They attempt to tackle abuses under the existing bus regime, especially anti-competitive practices that have taken place throughout the country. I shall briefly set out the purpose of each new clause and then invite the Under-Secretary to respond.
<P>
New clause 5 would give the traffic commissioner the power to refuse to register a service if he believes that its aim is to disrupt a competitor's operation. We are all aware that large operators have been in the habit of registering services on routes that are, or may become, profitable with the aim of disrupting smaller competitors. A large operator will often register the service and run it at a loss to force a small company off the route. Once that competitor is out of the way, fares can go up and the service can become less frequent.
<P>
On new clause 6, under current regulations any variations in the register of service of more than five minutes must be reregistered. The new clause would result in all variations being reregistered with the traffic commissioner and aims to give him the power to stop operators varying times to put rivals out of business or disrupt their operations. Giving the commissioner that power would ensure that his hands are not tied.
<P>
New clause 8 would introduce a minimum notice period of eight weeks for a bus service to be deregistered. At present, operators need only inform the traffic commissioner that they are stopping a service and it is immediately deregistered. The eight-week period in the new clause would give users time to consider alternatives, would allow local authorities to devise alternatives and would give rival operators an opportunity to consider their options.
<P>
Finally, new clause 12 would prevent operators from offering free services as a way of undermining competitors. The new clauses would tighten the powers of the traffic commissioners and give them the full range of weapons that they will need in what is sometimes an ugly war with some of the larger bus companies. I should exclude the company with which the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East is connected, in case he feels the need to contribute to the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall not be able to deal with these new clauses as briefly as I dealt with the previous set, partly because there are more of them, and partly because I need to distinguish between them so that I can make some helpful offers on some.
<P>
This group of proposed new clauses mainly concerns aspects of the service registration functions of the traffic commissioner. As the Committee knows, all local bus services whose passengers pay a separate fare and whose stops are less than 15 miles apart have to be registered with the traffic commissioner 42 days before the service begins. The registration details required include information on the routes and timetables so that the traffic commissioner may monitor the services to ensure that they are what the operators claim to provide. Under present law, the traffic commissioner has no power to refuse a registration application if it is supported by the requisite information.
<P>
On the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Ettrick, Tweeddale and Lauderdale—[HON. MEMBERS: ``No.''] Have I got them in the wrong order? The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale—I do apologise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): He needs a new seat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> He may be forced to get a new seat. My hon. Friend's seat is entirely secure, not least because of his recent triumph on the bypass.
<P>
New clause 5 would allow the traffic commissioner to refuse a registration or change the timings of individual bus services if he believed that the registration was intended to disrupt the business ,of another operator. The commissioner would have to exercise a judgment about the motivation behind the registration, which would be difficult to do in most cases and a significant extension of his or her task. The commissioner already attaches conditions to operators' licenses that prohibit them from providing a specific type of local service if there has been intentional interference with, or serious misconduct in relation to, the operation of a local service provided by another operator: the commissioner is required to respond to actual bad behaviour, rather than making a judgment of economic interest as the new clause implies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister just told the Committee that the traffic commissioners already have the power to make judgments on what I believe the Bill calls ``intentional interference''. That is not a matter of fact, so they will already be making a judgment of the sort that the new clause suggests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> For the sake of argument, what if—we are always asking ``What if?''—a bus operator decided to take physical action to impede the operation of another operator's services? That is clearly identifiable as intentional misbehaviour. The role of the traffic commissioners is to enforce discipline, not to rule over competitive circumstances and competition policy, which is what new clause 5 would invite them to do.
<P>
If there is a problem with unfair anti-competitive behaviour, I suggest that it is a matter for the Office of Fair Trading, which has powers to act. The Competition Act 1998 gives the OFT powers to act more quickly in cases of abuse of a dominant position—to use the technical phrase. There have been notable examples of action by the OFT against bus cartels in the past year and the Committee will be aware of its significance to bus services in Liverpool and Manchester and school bus services in Hull. There has been some concern about other aspects of the Competition Act on which I have sought to reassure the Committee at various stages. However, the powers of the competition authorities are actually helpful in the sort of case that I imagine the Liberal Democrat party is envisaging.

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Will the Under-Secretary reflect on what he has just said? He told the Committee that it would be possible in a hypothetical situation for a bus company to register a bus timetable that is perhaps two or three minutes in advance of an existing bus company's timetable. It must be assumed that the clear purpose of doing so, would be to disrupt the existing bus company. The Minister has said that the traffic commissioner would not have the power to take action in such a case because he could not make that judgment. The Minister went on to say, however, that it would then be a matter for the Office of Fair Trading. Would the OFT not be in some difficulty in taking action against the company that had legitimately and properly sought and obtained the approval of the traffic commissioner to run that service? Would the OFT not then be being forced to make a judgment about a decision that had been made by the traffic commissioner and not by the bus company itself, which had merely sought permission to do something?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> That is what we expect the Office of Fair Trading to do. We will come to the registration of timetables with the traffic commissioner and the period of notice for such registrations. Let me remind the hon. Gentleman that the traffic commissioner does not approve those registrations; he receives them. That time period allows the OFT to take action. That is how we envisage the arrangement operating.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will agree that the traffic commissioner's existing powers, coupled with the safeguards provided in competition law and the possibility for the Office of Fair Trading to intervene, which is now enhanced in terms of its speediness, are sufficient.
<P>
New clause 6 deals with what is usually called the ``five-minute rule'' under which operators may vary their registered service timetables by up to five minutes either side of the registered time without informing the traffic commissioner. The proposed amendment would abolish that rule and require a new registration to be entered in every case.
<P>
It has been claimed that the rule is sometimes exploited to disrupt a competitor. That is what we have just been discussing. Indeed, our bus consultation document following the transport White Paper includes a commitment to changes to tackle problems caused by the ``five-minute rule'', which is set down in secondary legislation. It is more appropriate to make any changes there, in consultation with the traffic commissioners and the bus industry, than on the face of the Bill. I can assure the Committee that we will table an amendment to the relevant regulations in due course. I hope that that will be welcomed by the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale.
<P>
New clause 8 would extend the period of notice for deregistering existing services from 42 to 56 days, thereby requiring a longer period of notice before a service could be withdrawn—also a matter that we have just been discussing. In this instance it is the operator rather than the traffic commissioner who deregisters the service. Again, we recognise the force of the arguments for increasing the period of notice in the interests of stability and reliability and thus to encourage greater use of bus services. Our consultation document included a number of suggestions for changing the notice period: for example, by increasing it to 56 days for altering or deregistering existing services. Here, too, powers to make changes are in secondary legislation, and that is the better procedure. Again, I can assure the Committee that the Government will produce proposals on that issue. I trust that that will also be welcomed by the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. The hon. Gentleman has now had two wins.
<P>
New clause 12 would require an operator to register a service for which no fare is charged. The present position is that such a service does not have to be registered. That is consistent with the principle underlying public service vehicle law, that it is concerned with services provided for ``hire and reward'', that is where a payment is made.
<P>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's concern that free services might be used as a tactic in a competitive ``war'' between operators.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
A frequently cited case is the famous Darlington case in 1994. The OFT found that use of free services was ``deplorable and anti-competitive'' and the company concerned was required to give undertakings about its future behaviour. However, there have been no significant cases recently. The OFT's strong condemnation of the tactic in 1994 seems to have been an effective deterrent. Of course, we must not be complacent, but I have already referred to the enhanced powers for the OFT which would seem to be relevant and useful. For that reason, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The proposal has another advantage. If a bus is being operated free and is not registered, information about registration is not automatically available to the local transport authority. The Minister will recall that in our debate on new clause 11, on which we have still to vote, he said that operators need not make certain information available on a quarterly basis to the local authority as the information would be held by the traffic commissioner. Now we understand that a service could be operated, unbeknownst to the traffic commissioner or the local authority, and that it would not be taken into account by the local authority when developing its local transport plan.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. I suspect that on the whole it is a fairly unusual situation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> One supermarket chain alone informs me that it is spending more than £3 million on the provision of free bus travel in different parts of the country, primarily for the benefit of its customers. However, the service might be used by people whose intention is not to shop at the supermarket but to use it for travel.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> You will forgive me, Mr. Gale, if I absorb a note, which I fail to absorb because I cannot read it. I understand the interesting point made by the hon. Gentleman. Services provided by supermarkets on such a scale would make a significant contribution to local bus services. I cannot accept the new clause, but his observation is interesting and I will undertake to think about how we can include it in future guidance on such matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I am glad that we have had so many things to settle, not least the opportunity for the Minister to practise the name of my constituency yet again. You said at a previous sitting, Mr. Gale, that we were not to ask Ministers to visit our constituency. Without breaching a confidence, I must point out that the Minister has confessed to having visited my constituency to walk the beautiful hills around it, so I am disappointed that he has not quite grasped its name. However, he is getting better: that much I am pleased to acknowledge.
<P>
I also acknowledge the Under-Secretary's positive response to the points that we raised—particularly in his exchange with my hon. Friend the Member for Bath—and his comments about introducing appropriate secondary legislation. Feeling that we have done rather well, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>New clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Taxis used on stage carriage services</center></H4>
<P>
`.—For the purposes of the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981 a taxi used as a bus on a stage carriage service may have up to 12 seats.'.—[Mr. Don Foster.]
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
This issue is important, but it can be dealt with briefly. The Government recently announced, amid much publicity, their intention to extend the rural bus subsidy grant from 2001 until 2004. People will be grateful to the Government for making that decision, but much of the money goes towards funding taxi buses, as do many of the awards in the rural bus challenge scheme.
<P>
Taxi bus services operate on stage carriage routes, which means that they follow a set route but may stop anywhere on those routes. At the moment, taxi buses are restricted to eight persons, including the driver, which means that only seven passengers may be carried. That creates problems for the adequate delivery of the service. If, for example, two families of four wish to travel together to a neighbouring town, perhaps to join in a protest meeting about open-top buses, current regulations would not allow all the members of the group to travel. Our proposal is that the number of seats be increased to 12. Obviously, it is often difficult—particularly in rural areas, but also elsewhere—to find someone who has a passenger carrying vehicle licence, as required of someone driving a vehicle with more than eight seats. The new clause would overcome that problem by increasing the limit to 12 seats. That raises another issue, but Hon. Members need not be concerned, because under current legislation it is possible, for example, for a schoolteacher to drive a minibus with seating for more than seven passengers.
<P>
The sole purpose of the new clause is to make a small but important change to existing legislation that will allow for improvements to the service, particularly in rural areas, by raising the number of seats in a taxi bus from eight to 12.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Bath for his explanation. We racked our brains trying to understand the purpose of the new clause, and before we saw it on the amendment paper we were not aware of any pressure for a change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Under-Secretary obviously wants an opportunity to read a note that has been given to him, so I shall intervene, merely to say that if he ever has problems understanding the purpose of any amendments that my hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick—pronounced correctly—and Lauderdale and I might propose, he need only ask.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> One of the hon. Gentlemen's constituencies is considerably easier to remember than the other. Of course, I know that both of them would be only too willing to do that. If only time and space allowed. None the less, I shall bear that generous offer in mind.
<P>
I preface my response by making the precise point that long-standing law contains the provision that any taxi, not just taxi buses, must have eight seats or fewer. It would be a big change to alter the provisions as they apply to all taxis. We are doubtful that the changes will really encourage taxi operators into buses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I apologise for intervening again. The new clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For the purposes of the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981 a taxi used as a bus on a stage carriage service.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister will have studied the wording, which is precise to avoid the problem of appearing to suggest that all taxis should have 12 seats. We anticipated the problem and dealt with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me see whether we can deal with the hon. Gentleman's anxieties as we go along. As I said, we are not clear about the purpose of the amendment, notwithstanding the hon. Gentleman's explanation, and I shall explain why.
<P>
Those wishing to run bus or coach services must first obtain a public service vehicle operator's licence from the traffic commissioner. PSV operators running what are now known as local services—services charging separate fares to passengers and running along an identifiable route with stopping places—must also register their routes and timetables with the traffic commissioner. Stage carriage services no longer exist in law. Furthermore, the legislation relating to PSVs makes a distinction only between vehicles having up to eight passenger seats and vehicles with more passenger seats, as we discussed.
<P>
Taxis, or more correctly, hackney carriages, are licensed by local authorities outside London and by the Metropolitan police in London to carry passengers for hire or reward at a single fare, except in certain specific instances, such as taxi-sharing schemes.
<P>
A taxi may also operate on a registered bus route under a special PSV licence issued by the traffic commissioner. Under section 12 of the Transport Act 1985, licensed taxi owners may be granted such a licence allowing them to operate their taxis as buses to provide local bus services. Any service provided in this way must also have its routes, stopping places and timetable registered with the traffic commissioner in the normal way. Such a service gives greater flexibility within different licensing systems, and potentially more choice for the travelling public. To date, some 130 of these special licences have been issued.
<P>
If the vehicle providing the local service has more than eight seats for passengers, by definition it must be a PSV and not a taxi. Accordingly, the amendment serves no useful purpose and I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> It is clear from that response that the hon. Gentleman had difficulty understanding the nature of the problem that the proposal would solve. The Committee is not well served by such confusion. I am not happy with his answer; he rather missed the point, but that may be my fault—
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It was difficult to understand the precise thrust of the hon. Gentleman's proposal However, if he writes to me, I undertake to consider the matter seriously and discuss how to respond to his concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> In his usual, helpful way, the Under-Secretary anticipated what I was going to say. He has assured me that he will consider the proposal, subject to my providing clearer information about the nature of the problem that we want to resolve. I am happy with that assurance and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>New clause 14</center></H4>
<H4><center>Publication by Traffic Commissioners of performance information</center></H4>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
I did not move new clause 13 because I am not sure that I understood what it was and, given the difficulties that we have just experienced, I would not wish to put the Under-Secretary to any further difficulty. I had never heard of ``particulate traps'' until a couple of days ago, but I am getting there now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I suspect that another reason why my hon. Friend has not moved it is that particulate traps themselves are only just about getting there.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> That was an unusually helpful intervention from my hon. Friend. New clause 14 returns to a theme that was tackled under new clause 11, what seems like many weeks or even months ago. It deals with the provision of information by local bus companies to the relevant authorities, which can then be made public. I do not wish to anticipate the Minister's response, but in the past he has been reluctant to go down that road, although he did in the earlier debate say that the traffic commissioners were the people to whom information should be provided and that they could choose to make it public, as they do through their annual reports each year.
<P>
I repeat that our concern is that there is already widespread, publicly available information about the rail services, many of which receive substantial public subsidy. We contend that there should be a good, transparent regime under which the public are able to obtain similar information about the bus services, particularly under quality partnerships and the various arrangements that are now being introduced. With a great deal of public subsidy going into the whole sector, it is important for the public to be able to judge that success.
<P>
We regard the proposals as relatively modest. They introduce a requirement for the local bus operator to provide information on a quarterly basis. We believe that that is important if the traffic commissioners are to fulfil their role and to make sure that they keep on top of matters. Rather than being prescriptive and saying that they must publish that information, we believe that it should be available to them to publish it. Again, if there are poorly performing operators or poor services, people ought to be told about them. The Government have not been shy about naming and shaming in the past, but this might be a useful tool for the traffic commissioners and local authorities.
<P>
Good operators would have nothing to hide or be embarrassed about under such a regime. We hope that the Minister will give positive consideration to our proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has been very nice to the Liberal Democrats this morning, but it has to stop. It should stop on this new clause. I suspect that the clause was put together on a wet Tuesday by a group of bearded vegans who went along in their flip-flops—a typical Liberal Democrat party branch probably.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> In an earlier debate, the hon. Gentleman said that his moustache was a hangover from the 1960s. His memory of the Liberal party is similarly dated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I exclude the two Liberal Democrats present—the one with the constituency that is easy to remember and the one with the impossible one. My strictures are about a typical Liberal party branch. More seriously, Mr. Gale, this is a bureaucratic nightmare. Some of the information requested in the clause is commercially confidential. Most companies would need to hire a few more bureaucrats, which might well suit the Liberal Democrat party. The traffic commissioner is not, in my view, the relevant person to publish that information in any case. He has no responsibility for fuel duty rebate and, other than as a job creation scheme in Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale, I see no purpose in the new clause. I hope that my hon. Friend will resist it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> My hon. Friend is right that the amendment is in error in assuming that fuel duty rebate claims are made to the traffic commissioner. As he knows, but the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale apparently does not, fuel duty rebate is administered by my Department. The traffic commissioner has no role in that respect.
<P>
We obtain information from each operator on scheduled and actual mileage—that is, for the purposes of calculating FDR payments, rather than to monitor service performance. We do, however, in a separate statistical survey collect information on bus use and mileage, which is used to publish aggregated regional data.
<P>
The Committee has already considered an amendment, moved by the hon. Member for Bath, on requirements on operators to provide statistical information for the purposes of local transport plans and monitoring relevant targets. It will be recalled that I agreed to consider tabling an appropriate amendment on that issue. I hope that that will suffice and that the Committee will agree that it would not be appropriate to impose further requirements of this kind via the traffic commissioner or the fuel duty rebate system. I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> It gives us no pleasure to propose defective new clauses and I defer to two great experts who highlighted the difficulty. The principle of making public information more readily available is worth returning to. I hope that the Minister will keep the whole process under review. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
I expect considerable support from hon. Members on both sides of the Committee—for the principle, if not for the details. In our debate on clause 130 earlier this morning the Minister reminded members of the Committee that new transport Bills do not come along very often. If the Minister checked the record, he would find that my recollection is correct. He said that it was important to include several measures in the Bill in the event of future changes because we might not have the opportunity of debating a new transport Bill for some time.
<P>
The new clause, which deals with quiet lanes and home zones, is put forward in the same spirit. We are already aware that the Government support the principle of quiet lanes and home zones. We are already aware that they have initiated several pilot projects around the country. We are delighted that the Scottish Parliament has also agreed to undertake similar trials. We are aware that such measures have been introduced and found to be successful in many other countries—in the Netherlands, for example. Some 6,500 such zones are already in place there.
<P>
In this country, research has demonstrated that home zones and quiet lanes can, through traffic-calming procedures, bring about a significant reduction in accidents. Some of the latest figures show that they are the most effective of all measures for reducing road traffic accidents—a matter of great public concern over the past few days. There can thus be no doubt that all members of the Committee will support the concepts of quiet lanes and home zones.
<P>
The purpose of the new clause is to provide local authorities with the power to designate home zones and networks of quiet lanes and to be able to include them within their local transport plans. Secondly, it is intended to strengthen existing pilot projects by ensuring that motorists give way to vulnerable users of roads, such as walkers, cyclists and horse riders. Thirdly, it would give local authorities the freedom to set mandatory speed limits in home zones—without the approval of the Secretary of State, which is important. It would require the local authority to consult all interested parties prior to designating quiet lanes or home zones and, finally, would require the Government to provide guidance on home zones and quiet lanes.
<P>
I could say a great deal about the importance of quiet lanes and home zones, but I assume that the Committee is already well briefed. I suspect that the Minister will be tempted to say only that it is premature to include the proposal in the Bill because he agrees with the principles of the legislation. If that is how he is minded to respond, how and when will the necessary primary legislation be put before Parliament? In particular, there will be a need to change existing legislation in respect of giving cyclists and pedestrians priority over car drivers in home zones.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will have been well briefed on the technical issues that demonstrate the need for primary legislation on home zones and quiet lanes. If he intends to tell us that it is too early to deal with it now, will he explain how and when it will be done?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I listened with genuine interest to the comments of the hon. Member for Bath on the new clause and I sympathise with most, if not all, of its objectives. I have a passion for home zones and I am well aware of the extensive Dutch experience, at which I have looked carefully. However, I believe that the new clause is, at best, premature and I regret that I cannot therefore support it. Let me explain why.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman said, the Government support the development of quiet roads and home zones within existing legislation. Last summer, we let a contract to monitor nine pilot home zones over a three-year period. I must declare an interest, because one of them, Holmewood gardens, is in my constituency. I hasten to point out that the designation was made before I was appointed a Minister. It is important to place that on record. We are supporting an initiative by the Countryside Agency to examine two—possibly three—pilot quiet roads projects. This research will, I hope, enable us to test the limits of what can be achieved under existing legislation. We have made it clear that we will consider changing the law if the evidence of the pilot projects shows that it is necessary to make them fully effective.
<P>
The new clause raises two difficult issues that make me reluctant to plunge into legislation. The first is the concept of priority for pedestrians and cyclists. At present, the law gives no priority to any class of person or vehicle passing or re-passing along the highway. There may be restrictions or reservations—pavements for pedestrians, motorways for defined classes of vehicle and so on—but on an all-purpose highway there is no order of priority for those moving along it. Pedestrians at a zebra crossing or on the flashing amber phase at a light-controlled crossing, have priority, but only to cross the road, not to walk along it.
<P>
Let us suppose that the proposed new clause became law. That sketch may seem absurd, but I submit that it could be a real scenario that raises important rights issues. Imagine a family out for a stroll on a quiet country lane. A car comes up behind them at the legal maximum of 20 mph. Does the family politely stand aside to let it pass? We hope so, but under the law they have an obligation not to obstruct other road users. Under the proposed new clause, however, as far as I can see, they would have the right to hold the car down to walking speed, however unreasonable that might be.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The solution might be to write into the new clause a requirement for reasonable behaviour. Would that be very different from where we are now? We need to think carefully whether the gain would be worth the pain and consult on it.
<P>
I am reminded of the situation with smoking in taxis and the competing rights of the smoker and the taxi driver. It is important that priority of right should be properly and seriously investigated and considered.
<P>
The other issue is less fundamental, but is of practical importance: the proposed 10 mph limit in home zones. Accuracy requirements for speedometers are not specified for very low speeds. The specification for speedometers could be tightened, but even if the benefits of that exceeded the costs and do not know which way the calculation would go, the specifications are negotiated at European level—to my intense relief the hon. Member for North Essex is no longer with us—and a change would take considerable time to achieve.
<P>
The Government want to lower speeds in home zones. Advisory limits may have a part to play in some cases, but physical measures are likely to be the main method of speed reduction. If they effectively restrict speeds to 10 mph, it is questionable whether there is any value in having a legal 10 mph limit as well.
<P>
I hope that I have said enough to assure the Committee that we are prepared to consider legislation on home zones and quiet lanes, but there are difficult issues to address. If the pilot projects show that we can achieve the results we seek without legislation, so much the better. Legislation may not be necessary. The home zone pilot projects will run for three years and it would be unreasonable to expect the Government to introduce primary legislation before we have tested the pilot projects in full. Let me reassure the hon. Gentleman that if we deem primary legislation to be necessary, although transport Bills are rare, they recur from time to time, and we would seek to ensure that the schemes for home zones and quiet lanes were enshrined in legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> When I moved the new clause, I was supremely conscious of the time and was unable to go into the detail that I would have wished on this important issue. I suggested that I had anticipated the Minister's likely response. If I had had more time, I might have told the Committee that I had also anticipated some of the Minister's other remarks, not least the difficulty of the 10 mph limit given the accuracy of speedometers. Had there been more time, I should have given him a solution to that problem that is perfectly possible and is in place in a number of other countries—self-regulatory speed limit arrangements. Time is short for some members of the Committee, for various reasons, and I do not want to press for details.
<P>
I took seriously what the Minister said about the difficulty of getting subsequent transport legislation for a number of years. The problem that the Government will have when the trial period for home zones and quiet lanes ends is to find what to do about them. One solution that the Committee may wish to consider later is the possibility of including in the Bill the appropriate legislation to enable the Secretary of State to deal by regulation with some of the issues that may arise. I hope that the Minister may at least be willing later to consider that as a way forward. In the hope that that may be the case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Again, through the pressure of time, we may not have the opportunity to make as detailed consideration of the clauses as I would like. Some Committee members may think that I have become obsessed with tour buses. I acknowledge that obsession, but it has not yet led me to grow a beard or put on a woolly hat or strange sandals.
<P>
My obsession has arisen as a result of concerns expressed by a large number of people. Tour buses in tourist areas in towns, cities and the country are a good thing. If they did not exist, many more individuals and families would drive round historic town centres and areas of outstanding natural beauty in their cars, which would be bad. Tour buses bring enormous benefits to those who use them, the environment and people living in the area in which they operate. However, we must consider whether there are too many tour buses. I believe that there are and that they are sometimes empty or nearly empty as a result of difficulties created by existing legislation. Such difficulties concern traffic commissioners' licensing arrangements and arrangements for fuel duty rebates.
<P>
The four new clauses would deal with some of those problems. I shall not go through each one in detail, as their wording makes their intention clear. New clause 21 would ensure that we reconsider definitions of bus services to create a category of service relating specifically to tour buses so that they can treated separately.
<P>
New clause 22 examines the type of vehicle that may be used for such services. New clause 23 would provide for arrangements whereby such vehicles do not undertake journeys without a reasonable number of passengers on board. New clause 24 would provide a solution to all those problems by licensing tour buses. Local authorities take into account their locality's needs in licensing a certain number of taxis and they should be similarly empowered to license tour bus vehicles.
<P>
I do not know whether the Under-Secretary will respond to those suggestions positively. However, as this is our final opportunity, I suspect, to consider such matters in Committee, I trust that he will tell us how the Government intend to proceed. He has heard me raise such concerns before and I know that he has reflected on them. I wish to place on record that the Under-Secretary has been very helpful, whatever he says about the new clauses. He has acknowledged that this is not a frivolous issue, but one that affects many people in towns and cities throughout the country. He has already given some helpful assurances. He has, for example, dealt with the problem of noise from tour buses which, until he gave his assurances, could not have been treated under existing legislation because the noise was coming not from a stationary but from a moving vehicle. He has now given us the assurance that that can be dealt with.
<P>
Most helpfully of all, he has acknowledged that under the procedures that will be in place following the Bill, licensing authorities will be able to take on board the cumulative effects of vehicles in their area. That cumulative effect is at the nub of the issue. He has also been aware of my particular concerns about whether tour operators are meeting the current requirements for the fuel duty rebate. He told the Committee some time ago that investigations were taking place on tour buses in Bath. He may wish to update the Committee on the outcome of those investigations. I am not necessarily hopeful, but I hope that we will at least get a serious response to serious concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> As the hon. Member for Bath pointed out, the consideration of these new clauses brings us to the end of part II of the Bill. I hope that you will not rule me out of order, Mr. Gale, if I thank you at this stage for your firm, fair and unfailingly cheerful chairmanship of our proceedings on part II, which I am sure will continue as we enter gridlock on the congestion-charging parts of the Bill and then move forward hastily by train in part IV.
<P>
Speaking of cheerfulness brings me to the hon. Member for Bath. He has played a prominent and notable role in our proceedings and never more so than on the issue of tourist buses. I suspect that when he dies, which I hope will not be for many years to come, the phrase ``tourist buses'' will be found engraved on his heart. He has worked extremely hard to ensure that the topic is brought to our attention.
<P>
These four new clauses are another way of ensuring that we deal with the tourist buses and I recognise that careful thought has gone into them. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his explanation of that thinking. It goes without saying that I cannot accept them, but I should like to explain my reasons. I shall also seek to end on a rather more positive, upbeat and constructive note on this matter,
<P>
My difficulty with the new clauses is partly technical, although I do not want to hide behind that reason. As far as I can see the phrase ``special services for tourists'' is not defined. It is an issue that is a little more than technical in that it is hard to see who in law might be caught by this. Who is a tourist? Must we have a residential qualification? Who is a tourist and who is some other sort of visitor? Are tourists, however defined, to be put in a special category and given or denied benefits available to others?
<P>
On new clause 21, for example, why are tourist buses not to be required to operate to a timetable? Surely the people using the service might find that valuable. Indeed my mind returns to earlier debates on timetables. Surely those people deserve to benefit from the traffic commissioner's enforcement powers over timetables for local services. Similarly, in new clause 22, I am not sure that it is right for tourist buses alone to be required to have all the undoubtedly desirable features that are listed. We already have legislation on accessibility for buses, although definition raises its head again, and it seems a little stringent to insist that no tourist bus must be more than five years old. Finally, who knows what technical progress will add to the list of green means of propulsion?
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Similarly, with the provisions for local authority powers, I am not persuaded that it would be right to give all those extra powers to cover the specific category of tour buses, or to impose all those extra duties in the case of new clause 24, as it provides that tourist buses could not be operated without a local authority licence. I have some doubts, too, about the practicality of the provision about the minimum number of people on board in new clause 23. Do we envisage local authority inspectors going around checking? What if somebody gets off en route? Without wanting to provoke the hon. Gentleman, I venture to wonder whether the problem of tourist buses is so extensive as to justify the whole regulatory system set up by new clause 24. However, I am under no illusions about the gravity of the situation in Bath.
<P>
I say all that partly in the knowledge of the other powers available to local authorities. We have discussed these before, so I will not go into detail, but the local authority does have the power to make traffic regulation orders, and the traffic commissioner does have the power to impose traffic regulation conditions on local bus services—a power which the Bill enhances to cover noise or air pollution, as well as safety and congestion.
<P>
There is also the question of the fuel duty rebate, a matter of considerable concern to the hon. Gentleman. As he knows—quite possibly better than I do—fuel duty rebate is paid only on certain conditions. He also knows that my officials have recently been making checks in Bath to see whether those conditions are being met by tourist buses. We are looking at the results with our lawyers and if we conclude, as we suspect we may, that not all the conditions are being met, we will take action. I undertake to keep the hon. Member in touch with developments.
<P>
I go further than that. I also undertake to review the fuel duty rebate conditions to see whether they meet today's circumstances, as they should. We may want to make changes. I make no promises as a review must be approached with an open mind, but I can assure the hon. Gentleman that it is as a result of his representations in this Committee that I have felt prompted to carry out this review. I hope that, in that knowledge and with that assurance, he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am most grateful to the Under-Secretary for his comments, which will have offended no one in my constituency, although I suspect that they will have offended the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East as being far too generous to me. I was not expecting the Under-Secretary to accept the amendment. Indeed, I suspect that had he accepted it, I might have suffered that early death he wanted me to avoid.
<P>
I have two brief points to make. First the Under-Secretary asks why such vehicles should not operate to a timetable. My concern is that, often, those vehicles travel around empty because of the requirement to meet the timetable to be eligible for the fuel duty rebate. It may well be far better to operate a system, with appropriate information being provided, that ensures that they do not operate until there is a reasonable number of passengers. I can also see problems with that—there is no easy solution—but the whole point about an imposed timetable that must be strictly adhered to is that many vehicles travel around empty causing pollution and congestion.
<P>
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman says that, judging by my description, the situation in Bath is difficult. I assure him that I am by no means alone in thinking that only my constituency suffers from that problem. I have press cuttings—I shall not bore him with them—about similar problems that are being created in many other areas. The problems that he admits may exist in Bath are equally severe elsewhere.
<P>
I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for the positive way in which he has responded to my concerns. I shall be interested in the outcome of the discussion with lawyers on events in Bath, but I hope that he will ask his officials to consider other parts of the country. No doubt, I shall find a way in to raise that matter yet again later. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As we are about to adjourn I wish members of the Committee a very good weekend—
