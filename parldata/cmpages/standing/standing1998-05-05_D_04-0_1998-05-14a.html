<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. George Howarth):</B> I beg to 
move amendment No. 233, in page 4, line 41, leave out  `section 8' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`sections 8 and (Application of section 7 where data controller is 
credit reference agency)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the 
following: Government Amendments Nos. 234 to 241.
<P>
Government new clause 4 Application of section 7 
where data controller is credit reference agency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The amendments relate entirely to 
subject access in regard to consumer credit.
<P>
As members of the Committee are well aware, one of 
the Bill's purposes is to consolidate into the general data 
protection regime the special arrangements that apply to 
personal data held by credit reference agencies under the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974.
<P>
The matter is dealt with in clauses 7(7) and 59 of the 
Bill, but those provisions do not completely achieve the 
desired effect. The purpose of the amendments is to bring 
the arrangements in the Bill more closely into line with 
the current arrangements under the 1974 Act.
<P>
It might be helpful if I explained to the Committee how 
the provisions work. The key provision is new clause 4. 
The 1974 Act gives individuals a subject access right to 
credit reference agency information. The permitted 
turn-round time is quicker and the fee is cheaper than 
those under data protection legislation.
<P>
Clause 7(7) of the Bill makes provision for individuals 
to request limited information from credit reference 
agencies. It also permits shorter turn-round times and 
lower fees to be prescribed for such cases.



<P>
It implies a turn-round time of seven days, subject to 
subordinate legislation. Under clause 7(7) as drafted, 
however, individuals would have to make it clear in their 
request that they were interested only in the limited 
information. Given the large number of subject access 
requests to credit reference agencies there are about
1 million a year that is the wrong way round.
<P>
The right approach should be for the special 
arrangements to be presumed to apply in every case, 
unless the individuals make it clear that they want access 
to all their personal data. That is the effect of subsection 
(2) new clause 4.
<P>
Subsection 3 of new clause 4 preserves a right that 
individuals currently have under the 1974 Act that is a 
key point. Section 159 of the 1974 Act allows individuals 
to attach what that Act calls a "notice of correction"	 to 
their credit reference agency file. That right will continue 
to exist.
<P>
The Act requires credit reference agencies that respond 
to subject access requests to inform the data subjects of 
their rights under section 159. Subsection (3) of the new 
clause 4 ensures that that right is retained. I hope that 
people will agree that it is a worthy objective.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 233 to 238 make the consequential 
amendments that are required by the addition of new 
clause 4.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 239 and 240 deal with transitional 
relief for manual data to which the special arrangements 
apply. They ensure that individuals continue to have a 
right of access to and correction of their data during the 
first transitional period. As we discussed on Tuesday, that 
period runs from 24 October 1998 to 23 October 2001.
<P>
Amendments No. 241 ensures that subject access 
requests to credit reference agencies that are made before 
the Bill comes into force and which have not been dealt 
with will continue to be dealt with under the 1974 Act 
unless they expressly state that they are made under the 
Bill.
<P>
The provisions are rather complex, but most people 
would agree that the intention behind them is worthy.
I hope that my explanation was helpful, and that the 
Committee will support the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway (Ryedale):</B> The issue is complex, 
as the Minister said. I look forward to reading the Bill 
when the amendments are agreed to as no doubt they 
will be and trying to get my mind round the provisions' 
precise meaning.
<P>
If I understand correctly, subsection (2) of new clause 
4 is the key element of the proposals. Given the weight 
of numbers of requests for personal information, it will be 
presumed that the data subject is seeking only personal 
information unless he makes a specific request for more.
<P>
My guess is that the credit reference agency industry 
would consider that arrangement beneficial, as it will 
uphold the interests of the individual data subject who 
wants access to the file on him while avoiding 
unnecessary work for credit reference agencies.
<P>
If my outline of the provision and of the Minister's 
approach is correct the Minister is nodding in 
agreement and if a note does not come his way to 
suggest that I do not understand something correctly, the 
Opposition will welcome the amendment and agree to it. 
The Committee will discuss other related matters later this 
morning. For the moment, the Opposition are happy to 
accept that the amendment is straightforward and to agree 
to it.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Brian White (Milton Keynes, North-East):
I welcome the amendment. It reflects many changes that 
have occurred since the 1974 Act. Data that are supplied 
to credit reference agencies are often white data, relating 
to payments rather than to defaults. I should like to ask 
about small business men and traders, who often have to 
seek a reference to obtain credit. Such references are often 
from other traders, suppliers and so on. They are not 
necessarily from an individual. Disclosure of the referee's 
identity is not required under the Data Protection Act 
1988 or under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. The Bill 
seems to require such a disclosure, which may lead to 
some small business men not being able to get credit. I 
hope that a way around that problem can be found.
<P>
Will the Minister consider that point? Current 
legislation does not require such disclosures. The 
provisions may change the way in which a small group of 
people obtains loans and credit.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I am grateful to the hon. 
Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) for his contribution, 
and I confirm that his interpretation of new clause 4 and 
of related provisions is correct. The new clause will give 
people the option to obtain the information that they want 
rather than for the whole file, which may or may not be 
relevant. Of course, the right remains to go for everything 
in appropriate circumstances, although generally people 
will want a specific piece of information. That will 
involve less bureaucracy.



<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North 
East (Mr. White) mentioned references, which I hope the 
Committee will have an opportunity to debate. 
Representatives of the Department of Trade and Industry 
and the Office of Fair Trading are meeting a number of 
credit reference agencies this afternoon to discuss the 
issue. If there is a need for change, they should be able to 
thrash something out amicably between them.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 25, in 
page 5, line 1, after `a' insert "detailed"	.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take 
the following amendments: No. 28, in page 5, line 9, after 
`in', insert `a simple and'.
<P>
No. 37, in Clause 8, page 6, line 45, leave out `an' and 
insert `a detailed'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We tabled this group of amendments 
not necessarily as essential additions to the Bill, but rather 
as a means of elucidating the meaning of clauses 7 and 8.
<P>
Amendment No. 25 relates to the explanation that is 
given to a data subject, and seeks to clarify what is 
expected in terms of detail. Specifically to require a 
detailed explanation may place an unnecessary burden on 
business. On the other hand, how scant an explanation 
would the Bill permit? Amendment No. 37 is of a similar 
nature, but relates to clause 8. Will the Minister clarify 
exactly how detailed the explanation and, in clause 7, the 
description, of the personal data is expected to be? What 
is the general presumption?
<P>
Amendment No. 28 relates to the requirement for the 
data controller to communicate to the data subject the 
information about his personal data. The Bill currently 
stipulates that that communication should be in an 
intelligible form. Simplicity would also be advantageous. 
We do not want people running to our surgeries on a 
Saturday saying, "I have got this please can you tell me 
what it means?"	
<P>
The amendments question what is required of data 
controllers, and what data subjects can reasonably expect 
from the Bill's provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor (Esher and Walton):</B> The amendments 
seek clarification from the Government on an important 
matter.
<P>
The last thing that I should wish to do is to put 
increased burdens on data controllers, but I have been 
approached by a variety of people who are worried about 
the potential impact of clauses 7 and 8. Clause 8 feeds 
back into clause 7, and is therefore relevant to our current 
discussions. Clause 8(2)(a) and (b), which we shall come 
to later, deals with disproportionate effort and whether 
the data subject agrees otherwise. We need the Minister's 
clarification on that, particularly in the light of increasing 
use of electronic communication, which may be global as 
opposed to localised. It is important to understand exactly 
what is required of the data controller and what the 
individual has a right to expect. However, leaving the 
matter constantly open-ended would ultimately make it 
impossible to continue the increasingly important business 
of international global electronic commerce.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The hon. Member for Esher 
and Walton (Mr. Taylor) used some interesting words. I 
do not know whether the hon. Member for Ryedale
(Mr. Greenway) has seen the amendment. [Interruption.]
I accept that it is probing in nature.
<P>
Jackie Walster, head of company and commercial law 
at the CBI, said that the CBI opposes the amendment, 
which it considers unreasonable and unnecessarily 
burdensome on data controllers that is similar to what 
the hon. Gentleman said and that it goes beyond the 
requirements of the directive. That is the business 
community view of the burden implicit in the amendment, 
although I know that the hon. Gentleman is not seeking 
to press it.
<P>
I shall deal first with amendments Nos. 25 and 37, both 
of which would require the provision of more detail in 
response to subject access requests. The Bill extends the 
data subject access right provided in the 1984 Act. The 
Act provides for individuals to be able to obtain a copy 
of their data. The Bill makes similar provision, but adds 
a further entitlement for the individual to request a 
description of his personal data as well as the purposes of 
the processing and the recipients of the data.
<P>
This new entitlement in clause 7(1)(b) closely follows 
the directive. Article 12 of the directive requires data 
subjects to be able to obtain, among other things,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"information at least as to"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the matters set out in clause 7(1)(b). It does not say that 
it must be "detailed"	 information, as amendment No. 25 
would require.
<P>
I am not sure, therefore, why the hon. Gentleman wants 
to pursue that point. I think that he now accepts that it 
would impose an additional burden, the utility of which 
is far from certain. The detail of the description will 
depend on the individual circumstances of each case. they 
may be cases in which a detailed description is required, 
but it would be disproportionate to require a detailed 
description in every case. This description of the 
processing is only one element of the information which 
a data subject is entitled to seek. The individual is also 
entitled to ask for and be given a copy of the actual 
information in an intelligible form. By virtue of clause 
8(2), he or she must also be given an explanation of any 
terms used if the information would be unintelligible 
without such an explanation. The point about information 
arriving via modern technology is quite important in that 
context.
                       



<P>
Amendment No. 37 would again require this to be a 
detailed explanation. Similar considerations apply to this 
amendment. The Bill follows the directive, which 
expresses the requirement in a general form. To specify 
the format more precisely would increase the controller's 
obligations. The detail of the explanation will be 
determined by the circumstances. It should be just as 
detailed as necessary no more and no less.
<P>
In the Government's view, amendments Nos. 25 and 
37 are undesirable as they would place additional burdens 
on controllers, going above those required by the 
directive. They are unnecessary, as the Bill already makes 
adequate provision for the data subject to receive all the 
information that he or she is likely to need.
<P>
Amendment No. 28 seems to tend in a direction 
opposite to that of the others in the group, as it would 
require the provision of simplified information. I 
understand the general intention of the hon. Member for 
Ryedale: he wishes to make it easy for data subjects to 
understand the information that they receive in response 
to subject access requests.
<P>
The clause already ensures that the information 
provided must be in "an intelligible form"	. I hope that the 
Committee accepts that that phrase means much the same 
as that proposed in the amendment, and that it has greater 
legal currency. It prevents the data controller from 
providing the information in a code that could not be 
understood without the key, as not everyone receiving 
such information will have access to that key.
<P>
For example, if the information is stored in a 
machine-readable code, it must be translated back into 
human-readable text for the data subjects. That is 
important in our technological age: people lacking the 
expertise to use or get access to the key should not be so 
seriously disadvantaged.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> I do not want to change the Minister's 
line of argument, but he has touched on an important 
point. Increasingly, most information covered by personal 
data, especially that involved in credit references, is 
transmitted through a system in encrypted form. That is 
not the problem, but is the Minister saying that when the 
data subject wishes to access reasonable information "in 
intelligible form"	, that information must be supplied in 
decrypted fashion by the data controller? Will he confirm 
that the distinction is not that encrypted data should not 
exist, but merely that some element of that data must be 
decrypted so that the data subject can have access to it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful for that intentionally 
helpful intervention. The key lies in the use of the word 
"intelligible"	, and I have noted already that any 
information must be provided in human-readable form. 
Thus encrypted data can be used, but to meet the 
requirements of the Bill that data must be decrypted, when 
people require information, into an intelligible format that 
they can understand.
<P>
In addition, as the Committee knows, clause 8(2) 
requires explanations to be provided of any terms used in 
the information that are not intelligible without 
explanation. The point about subject access is that 
individuals should be able to gain access to all the 
information about them in full, if that is what they want. 
That means that they must be able to gain access to the 
unmodified information itself, not as it might be modified 
by some mediating third party, however well intentioned. 
Any deviation from that rule is allowed only in 
accordance with the exemptions for which the Bill 
provides.
<P>
Access to all information is an essential data protection 
right possibly the most important. It is an essential 
safeguard against the misuse of individuals' data. It allows 
individuals to check all the information held about them. 
It is thus the key to the exercise of other rights such as 
the right to seek rectification of inaccurate data, or to 
seek compensation.
<P>
Allowing the information to be simplified would be to 
limit transparency and open a gateway to abuse. I am sure 
that the Committee would not want that. It would allow 
controllers to give data subjects a partial picture and, 
deliberately or otherwise, to conceal inaccuracies. It 
would therefore result in data subjects being misled, 
which would undermine their ability to exercise their 
rights.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not intend to 
undermine data subjects' rights to that way, and I invite 
him to withdraw the amendment.



<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's 
detailed explanation, as I am sure people who will take 
day-to-day responsibility for implementing the measures 
will be. It has served the purpose that I had in mind, and 
we are much clearer about what the phrases mean. On that 
basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 26 in 
page 5, line 7, leave out `or may be'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment 
No. 27, in page 5, line 8, at end add `, and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(iv) the recipients or classes of recipients to whom they may be 
disclosed.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Our purpose in these amendments is a 
little more focused. I hope that we shall persuade the 
Minister that there is a matter for him at least to take away 
and think about.
<P>
Clause 7(1)(b) details the information to which people 
are entitled. It includes personal data that relates to the 
data subject, the purpose for which they are being 
processed and this is the key point 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the recipients or classes of recipients to whom they are or may 
be disclosed"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Two distinct groups are combined in that phrase, and 
the data subject might require two separate lists. I should 
be happy for the Minister to take the matter away to think 
about. If all that the data subject gets is a list of people to 
whom information has been or may be disclosed, he does 
not know to whom it has been disclosed. He really wants 
to know who has hand the information; who else might 
have it is a separate question.
<P>
Two lists would not create a huge burden. We need to 
consider whether two lists would be a more appropriate 
requirement. They would certainly enable the data subject 
to know to whom the information about him had been 
disclosed and to which other organisations it might be 
disclosed in the future. One can think of many 
examples the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, 
North-East raised exactly this point of people who seek 
credit, but find that they do not get the credit that they 
require. They wonder why that is and want an answer. 
They could see separate lists of people to whom the 
information had been or might be disclosed. That could 
create a significant burden, but our amendment would in 
no way add to it because the "may be"	 is in the clause 
anyway. We are simply asking whether an individual 
might make better use of the information if those who had 
had his personal data and those who might get it were on 
separate lists. I cannot put it more simply than that.



<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The hon. Member for Ryedale 
rightly said that clause 7(1)(c)(ii) establishes the data 
subject's right to obtain from data controllers any 
available information about the source of data held about 
them.
<P>
The amendment attempts to draw a distinction between 
data that are obtained directly and those obtained from a 
third party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Clearly, from the Minister's 
comments, one of us is wrong. My understanding is that 
the information that the data subject is given would be 
about the recipients or classes of recipients to whom the 
information about him had been disclosed. It is a question 
not of the source of the information we shall deal with 
that in the next group of amendments but of who gets 
and who has had the information. Is there not an important 
differentiation between who has received it and who 
might receive it?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I am grateful to the hon. 
Gentleman. As he rightly discerned, I was getting 
somewhat ahead of myself. The amendments relate to clause 7(1)(b)(iii), which entitles the data subject to ask 
the controller for a description of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the recipients or classes of recipients to whom they"	 <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
his personal data 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"are or may be disclosed."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The provision is split the first part deals with the 
recipients to whom the data are disclosed and the second 
deals with the recipients to whom the data may be 
disclosed.
<P>
I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman, 
although I was slightly baffled by what he said at the 
time I keep looking at the wrong thing. I do not think it 
necessary to make these changes at this point. The 
amendments would simply rearrange the paragraphs, if I 
am not mistaken. However, if the hon. Gentleman bears 
with me, we might be able to resolve this matter.
<P>
I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman's argument 
relates strictly to the amendment, but it is reasonable. 
With the agreement of the Committee, I am happy to go 

away and consider whether we could reach some 
accommodation at a later stage. I do not want to give a 
firm commitment at this stage, but I shall certainly think 
about the argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am most grateful. As I said, I had 
hoped that the Minister might see that I have a point. As 
the Bill stands, the data subject would receive some list 
or description of the kind of organisations to whom his 
data might be disclosed, which may include people who 
have already had the information. We believe that it 
would be better if he knew who had had the information 
and who else might receive it. [Interruption.] With 
respect, the Bill does not say that. It says that the 
individual will get one list containing the people who have 
had the information or who may get it. Two lists may not 
be required. There is a need to ensure that the data subject 
is able to differentiate between those who have the 
information and those who may receive it. The Bill 
provides that he is entitled to know both things, but all 
jumbled up in one group.
<P>
If, after the Minister has considered this matter, he says 
that the legal interpretation is that my proposal is covered 
in the Bill already, I shall be very happy, although I am 
not convinced that that is the case. However, we are 
grateful for the Minister's generosity in saying that he can 
see our point. If he is not entirely clear about it, perhaps 
we can have a conversation. On that basis, I intend to 
withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Jenkins (Tamworth):</B> I was not going to 
speak on the amendment I had thought that it was fairly 
clear. However, listening to the hon. Member for Ryedale 
has put doubts in my mind. In the first part of your speech, 
I thought that you wanted to reduce the number of people 
to only those who had received the information 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman 
to address the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkins:</B> I apologise, Mr. Welsh. Now we have 
the caveat that the provision should include all the people 
who may receive information. We are creating a category 
here. The recipient should receive one list, not two.
I thought that the Bill provided for that; perhaps my hon. 
Friend the Minister will ensure that it does.



<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> That is my impression. There 
is a difference of interpretation here, and it would be 
sensible to look at it again. My interpretation is the same 
as that of my hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth
(Mr. Jenkins) that it states clearly what we seek to 
achieve in a way that is consistent with the directive. 
However, as there is some disagreement as to the 
meaning, I will be happy to look at it again. The hon. 
Member for Ryedale has approached the matter in a 
constructive way, saying that it is not necessary to discuss 
it again in Committee and that we can resolve it between 
us when we have a proper legal interpretation that 
determines who is right the hon. Gentleman or the entire 
massed ranks of the Home Office.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Others will doubtless wish to go away 
and consider the point. I do not think that it is clear. 
However, the Minister and I can discuss it on another 
occasion, and I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw 
the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 29, in 
page 5, line 13, after `data' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`whether the data has been obtained direct or from a third party'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister anticipated amendment No. 29 in his 
earlier remarks. Line 13 of clause 7 on page 5 of the 
Bill refers to the communication to the data subject of 
information about the source of the data that have been 
made available to the data controller. Presumably, the 
source of the information will be known to the data 
controller.



<P>
When we discuss misleading and inaccurate data later 
in the Committee's proceedings, we shall table an 
amendment in relation to completeness. We should 
consider why people are likely to ask for personal data. It 
will not be a fishing expedition. It will be because 
something has happened and they want to know why. 
People will want to know what information is on their 
personal record not just for fun, but because they have 
been denied credit, for example, or are concerned about 
an item that has appeared in a newspaper.
<P>
More detailed information about the source of the data 
may be appropriate, particularly whether information has 
been obtained direct or from a third party. Is it gossip, 
or information that has been gleaned from another credit 
reference agency? I am especially concerned about gossip. 
During a previous sitting we debated the issues of 
sensitive personal data and data in the context of 
journalistic, artistic and literary expression. Information 
that could be deeply damaging to someone might have 
been obtained from a third party by way of gossip. In such 
circumstances, there is a case to be made for more detail 
about the source.
<P>
The amendment would clarify whether the data has 
been obtained direct by the data controller or whether it 
is third party gossip that may not be quite so accurate 
or reliable.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Richard Allan (Sheffield, Hallam): Liberal 
Democrat Members share the concerns of the hon. 
Member for Ryedale about the breadth of the data that 
will be supplied to somebody when they make a request 
under the provisions of the Bill. I support what he said 
about the source of the data being critical in determining 
whether the information supplied to satisfy a person's 
request is of any use. A person who makes a request to 
an agency will want to be able to see whether the 
information is correct and, if in doubt, to be able to trace 
it back. the Minister may say that the Bill already covers 
that contingency, but increased data sharing between 
agencies such as credit reference agencies and insurance 
companies means that data recovered from the end point 
could be three or four times removed from the original 
source of collection.
<P>
Like the hon. Member for Ryedale, I hope that the 
Minister will reassure the Committee that people will 
always have sufficient information to allow them to trace 
data back to the original source. that will enable data 
subjects to seek genuine correction and remedy if they 
believe that the originator of the data has provided false 
information.
<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer (Broxtowe):</B> I appreciate the 
amendments intention, but it would not achieve its aim 
and could have some unfortunate side effects.
<P>
I offer a concrete example. A data controller gets 
information from, say, an insurance company, that
Mr. Smith has had a problem in the past. The amendment 
would require it to be made clear that insurance company 
X got the information "from a third party"	, but it would 
not require Mr. Smith to be told whether that third party 
was insurance company Y or bank Z. That would not be 
much of a help, as Mr. Smith would still have to go back 
to insurance company X and ask where the information 
came from.
<P>
The amendment would require the data controller to 
store more information that it is reasonable to expect. 
The data controller collects information from various 
sources, but the amendment would mean that he would 
have to ask for a trace to ascertain the provenance of 
the information from each of the suppliers. That would 
constitute a substantial additional burden.
<P>
The clause requires the data controller to provide
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any information available to the data controller as the source of 
the data"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would require the data controller to 
accumulate additional information, and thus would place 
a responsibility to ask every data supplier for a trace on 
the history of the data. That would be a major additional 
requirement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> As the hon. Members for Ryedale and 
for Sheffield, Hallam, (Mr. Allan) rightly said, the 
amendment attempts to draw a distinction between data 
obtained direct and data obtained from a third party. 
However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe 
(Dr. Palmer) noted, the amendment is not entirely clear. 
Whatever its intended effect, it will add nothing to the 
Bill, as I shall explain.




<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ryedale for his 
explanation of the purpose of his amendment. I must 
confess that, on reading the amendment, I found that its 
intention not immediately apparent. Having listened to the 
hon. Gentleman, I understand his purpose better, but I do 
not think that he made a successful argument for the 
amendment.
<P>
The meaning of clause 7(1)(c)(ii) is plain enough, I 
think. The words at present make it clear that the data 
controller must communicate any available information 
about the source of the data. The word "source"	 is not 
qualified, nor do I think that it needs to be. Any source, 
whether direct or not, would be within the terms of the 
Bill. The clause is worded in such a way as to achieve 
exactly what is intended in the directive.
<P>
The amendment would not add anything. My hon. 
Friend the Member for Broxtowe spoke of the burden that 
it might create. It might also lead to confusion. For 
example, what is meant by "obtained direct"	? I do not 
wish to engage in unduly lengthy consideration of 
semantics, however, every hon. Member in the Room, 
could interpret the meaning slightly differently. The 
amendment would not, therefore, add any clarity or 
improve the wording of the clause.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I understand what the hon. Member for Ryedale is 
seeking to achieve, but the clause achieves it already. The 
term, "any source"	 means just that. I hope that the hon. 
Gentleman will agree that the amendment is unnecessary 
and withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Again, I am grateful to the Minister 
for his explanation. He could not have been more positive 
and forthright. He said that any source meant any source. 
The Opposition take that to include the gossip to which I 
referred earlier. Having obtained that clear explanation, 
the Opposition do not wish to press the matter. I beg to 
ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 31, in 
page 5, line 17 after `logic', insert `and assumptions'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to 
consider amendment No. 56 in clause 14, page 10, line 
39, after `logic', insert `and assumptions'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Amendment No. 31 is another probing 
amendment that seeks to clarify meanings. To set out the 
background, I should say that clause 7(1)(d) refers to 
automatic processing being the sole basis of any decision 
that significantly affects the data subject. If such a 
decision is taken the data subject has a right to be 
informed by the data controller of the logic behind that 
decision.
<P>
In trying to come to terms with the meaning of "the 
logic involved"	, one has to ask what assumptions are 
involved in reaching a decision and in formulating the process behind it. For the sake of, clarity and explanation, 
the Opposition suggest that in clause 7 and in clause 14, 
in which the phrase arises again in much the same context, 
the insertion of the words, "or assumptions"	 in addition 
to the word "logic"	 might be beneficial to the data 
subject's understanding.
<P>
We are trying to clarify the intentions of the clause. As 
I understand it, it is intended that the data subject should 
be able to understand how a decision was taken. On that 
basis, the assumptions should be known. I cannot use a 
better word. That is why the amendment would add clarity 
and would make the legislation more meaningful for the 
data subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Subsection (d) is interesting. Historically, 
while agencies such as banks and insurance companies 
have often been willing to give out basic data concerning 
credit information, they have always jealously guarded the 
algorithms that they use to reach decisions. With or 
without the amendment, the clause suggests that data 
subjects will have a right to see components of the 
algorithm if an automatic decision has been made. 
Increasingly, with basic credit scoring and insurance 
companies using expert systems to decide levels of risk, 
decisions are being made on an automated basis. Liberal 
Democrats seek clarification of the clause's scope. Does 
the Minister believe that algorithms will become more 
available?



<P>
<B>Mr. David Lock (Wyre Forest):</B> Will the hon. 
Gentleman clarify whether the amendment would require 
insurance companies and banks to disclose their complete 
modus operandi and all their historical data on how they 
reach decisions about applicants for mortgages or 
insurance? Such data would determine whether a person's 
insurance premium was £200 or £300, and so would 
contain a great deal of confidential information, disclosure 
of which would be of considerable assistance to 
competitors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That is exactly the point that I want to 
make. The use of the word "logic"	, and the question of 
where logic stops, will be tested in the courts. If the logic 
is to decide a person's credit rating by comparison with 
an ideal rating, people will ask what assumptions lay 
behind the ideal rating.
<P>
Therefore, the provisions in the Bill, once they become 
law, will be challenged in the courts. The refusal of credit 
has a major impact on people's lives: those people will 
wonder how far logic can be taken and will ask for the 
amendment's proposed insertion of the phrase "and 
assumptions"	.
<P>
The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Lock) 
described the problems that might be encountered, and
I am sure that the clause will be tested in the courts of law.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> As the hon. Member for 
Ryedale said, amendment No. 31 would insert the word 
"assumptions"	 in clause 7(1)(d), and the consequential 
amendment No. 56 would amend clause 42 accordingly.
<P>
Clause 7(1)(d) entitles people to be informed by data 
controllers of the logic the key word that has aroused so
much discussion involved when certain decisions about 
them are based solely on the automatic processing of their 
personal data. The decision in question are those to which 
clause 13 applies. The circumstances are as described by 
the hon. Member for Ryedale and by my hon. Friend the 
Member for Wyre Forest. Clause 7(1)(d) has no effect in 
other cases.
<P>
In that, the Bill follows very closely the directive, 
article 12 of which requires member states to give people 
the right to gain "knowledge of the logic"	 involved in at 
least the decision making to which clause 13 applies. The 
directive therefore gives us no option but to include such 
a provision in the Bill. That does not necessarily rule out 
the amendment, but I shall explain why it would be 
difficult to accept. However, the directive obliges us to 
apply the provision to certain cases, and we have limited 
its application to those cases.
<P>
I thought it might be helpful to set out the limits of the 
provision, as I know that there is considerable anxiety 
about its scope. In using the word "logic"	, we have chosen 
to follow the directive without elaboration so as to ensure 
that we do not require controllers to provide any more 
information, or allow them to provide any less 
information, than the directive requires. That approach is 
important when considering the amendment.
<P>
Given the concern that exists about the provision, it 
would, in the Government's view, be unwise to depart 
from the simple word "logic"	 used in the directive, and it 
is what we want to introduce into domestic legislation. 
Adding the words "and assumptions"	 carries the risk of 
the Bill requiring data controllers to provide more 
information than the directive requires. That might not 
be helpful.
<P>
I do not want to get involved in semantics, but future 
judgments may be based on our proceedings, so it is 
important to clarify our reasoning. If "assumptions"	 are 
part of "logic"	, the Bill already requires information about 
them to be provided. However, if assumptions are not part 
of logic, it would be imposing an additional and 
unnecessary burden on data controllers to require 
information about them to be provided. I realise that this 
is a complicated linguistic exercise, but it is more 
important than that. We must be precise about how we 
interpret the directive and careful that we do not do so in 
a way that leads to undue burdens or gives people 
increasing opportunity for challenges that would not 
necessarily be supported by the intention of the directive.

<P>
The safest way forward is to stick to the wording in the 
Bill. I am afraid that I am therefore obliged to reject the 
hon. Gentleman's amendment. I do not want to cause 
ambiguity and it is much safer to rely on the meaning 
of the word, "logic"	 than to get too involved in making 
judgments about assumptions.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> May I have one small clarification? Is 
there not a concern that this requirement will be evaded 
by a token human involvement? People could say, "With 
regard to the sole basis"	, because there is one person in a 
bank, say, who can review such judgments, although that 
person may do it once in a blue moon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Is my hon. Friend the Member for 
Broxtowe talking about the Bill as drafted?
<P>
<B></B><P>
Dr. Palmer: Yes.



<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I have no reason to believe that that 
would be the case. I think that different arrangements will 
apply in different sets of circumstances. In respect of the 
clause as a whole, it is best to rely on the current drafting. 
We have stuck as closely as possible to the terms of the 
directive.
<P>
As everything hinges on the meaning of the word, 
"logic"	, I thought it might be as well to give a dictionary 
definition. I realise that it was always dangerous to give 
definitions, as that could trigger off another, entirely new, 
debate, but here we go. The concise Oxford Dictionary 
includes the following in its definition of "logic"	:
{**p10 **}"Science of reasoning, proof, thinking or inference; particular 
scheme of or treatise on this; chain of reasoning arrangement of 
elements in computer to perform specified task."	
<P>

<P>
If that is helpful, I offer it to the Committee. However,
I do not know what assumption the hon. Gentleman may 
make.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> First, the hon. Member for Broxtowe 
came to the same conclusion as me when I first read the 
provision. On my first reading I used a black pen and, on 
my second, a blue pen. As this is in black pen, it must 
have been written on my first reading. I wanted to change 
the word "sole"	 to "main"	. There would be many 
circumstances in which decisions were taken with a 
combination of the two, but studying the provision more 
closely shows that that is not its object. The object is to 
protect the data subject from decisions that are taken 
about him entirely on an automatic transaction with no 
mental input. That is why the word "logic"	 is so 
important.
<P>
I think that the Minister was right in saying that there 
are a number of interpretations or assumptions that could 
be made. I understand that the word, "assumption"	 does 
not appear in the Concise Oxford Dictionary as part of 
the definition of "logic"	, but my impression is that, to 
apply logic, certain assumptions must be made to come to 
a logical conclusion.
<P>
It has been helpful to have a short debate on the 
measure so that people who have to deal with it clearly 
understand the intention, as the hon. Member for 
Broxtowe said. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to 
withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 185, in 7, 
page 5, line 19, at the beginning insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Subject to subsection (2A)<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government 
amendment No. 111 and amendment No. 186, in page 5, 
line 21, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) A data controller who is a Minister of the Crown, civil 
servant or other person representing or acting on behalf of
a government department or an executive agency shall be obliged, 
in establishing procedures for responding to requests under this 
section 
<P>
(a) to treat all data subjects making such requests as having a 
prima facie claim to ownership of any personal data 
relevant to those requests; and
<P>
(b) to charge only such fee as is necessary to offset the marginal 
cost of supplying the information requested.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Amendments Nos. 185 and 186 are linked 
and seek to explore view of data which the Government 
and agencies that act on their behalf hold. We recognise 
the distinction between data held by the Government and 
data held in the commercial sector.
<P>
The amendments have two purposes. First, they would 
establish the general principle that the data subject owned 
data held by the Government, who merely held them in 
trust. That is an important issue of principle. The second 
purpose concerns the charges that the Government and 
their agencies can make when supplying data to data 
subjects. On the basis that data subjects are treated as the 
owners of the information, only a marginal charge should 
be made to offset the cost of delivering it.
<P>
Constituents will have come to many members of the 
Committee with grave concerns about information which 
Government agencies hold on them. This is perhaps an 
extreme example, but we might mention information 
concerning membership of radical political organisations 
in the 1970s such as the Labour party. We might also 
mention information about one's health, and school and 
educational records. Governments have made moves in 
recent years to respond to people's concerns, and 
legislation was introduced on access to medical records, 
which was welcome.
<P>
We are trying to explore the Government's views on 
the principles that I have described. We want to explore 
their understanding of the way in which they hold their 
data and of how citizens' rights relate to those data.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> The amendments are interesting, 
although I have not studied them in the same depth as 
the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam. Naive Opposition 
questions are always the most dangerous, but I have a 
genuinely naive question. Does the term "data controller"	 
as defined in clause 1 include the Government? It would 
be interesting to know whether that was the case in regard 
to the present amendments.
<P>
I do not entirely go along with the remarks that the hon. 
Member for Hallam made about the relationship between 
the data subject and the Government, and about the data 
being held in trust, but I shall listen carefully to the 
Minister's comments on that.
<P>
There is a grave danger is not asking for information 
from the Government on the same basis as one would 
under any other arrangement that is defined in the Bill. 
How one defines marginal costs depends on whether one 
is in business or in another field. I have caveats about the 
amendments tables by the hon. Member for Hallam, but 
that is the purpose of having a Minister who is an expert 
on such matters in Committee.
<P>
On Government amendment No. 111, will the Minister 
define what a request in writing is? We would 
traditionally define it in terms of a pen and paper. Does 
the modern definition include any form of electronic 
communication? Increasingly, that would mean e-mail.
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> I correspond by e-mail with a company. I 
have no idea where it is, so I cannot write to it; I can, 
however, e-mail it. I have talked to the company via 
e-mail about what information it holds on me, and it gave 
that information voluntarily. At that point, however, I 
would have been unable to write to it because I could 
obtain its address only by e-mailing it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, 
North-East raises a serious point, which supports my 
concern. This is the moment that the Minister has been 
waiting for it is time for him to define the words "in 
writing"	.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I have been waiting with 
bated breath.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I hope that the Minister has not bated his 
breath so much that he cannot get the words out.
<P>
The way in which one requests data is fundamental. 
There is no point in a Bill that does not anticipate 
technological changes. The fact that transactions are 
increasingly conducted on the telephone raises a separate 
issue. Credit agencies and stock brokers, for example, 
increasingly record conversations. Given the existence of 
separate legislation providing for people to be notified of 
that recording, would that classify as "in writing"	? What 
is the definition of the phrase "unambiguous consent"	 in 
that context? I am sorry to raise these questions at this 
point, but they are important.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> They are not only important, 
but interesting. Clause 60(1) and (2), covers the hon. 
Gentleman's first point. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This Act binds the Crown.
<P>
For this purposes of this Act each government department shall be 
treated as a person separate from any other government department."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In effect, each Department will have its own controller.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's second point is the most 
interesting one. We are aware of the issue and are still 
considering it in the Home Office. It may well be 
necessary at a later stage in our consideration to come 
back with a clarifying provision. The term, "in writing"	 
can cover any number of possibilities, including e-mail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I wear my former Minister's hat for this 
question. Will the Home Office consult the Department 
of Trade and Industry about how such clarification might 
best be framed, given the DTI's responsibility for 
encouraging the use of electronic commerce in the 
economy as a whole?



<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> As the hon. Gentleman well knows, the 
DTI's tentacles reach far and wide, within the 
Government and all over the world. A representative of 
the DTI is here today so I am sure that that point will be 
taken most seriously.
<P>
The hon. Member for the Hallam tabled amendments 
Nos. 185 and 186. I would have been a member of what 
the hon. Gentleman defines as a radical organisation in 
the 1970s the Labour party. Quite how one would define 
a radical organisation in the 1990s is a matter upon which 
I shall leave the hon. Gentleman to reflect. However, I do 
not want to go too far down that path; I am sure that you, 
Mr. Welsh, would pull me up if I did.
<P>
The hon. Gentlemen's amendments are identical to 
those tabled in Committee in another place by his noble 
Friend, Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne. In preparing 
for today's debate, I read the Baroness's comments on 
that occasion. Her concern, which the hon. Member for 
Hallam articulated again today, was to establish a 
mechanism for ensuring that individuals' personal data are 
properly protected when processed by Government 
Departments and their agencies. Several points should be 
made in response to the amendments.
<P>
The Bill, like the Data Protection Act 1984, applies in 
full to the processing of personal data by Government 
Departments and their agencies in exactly the same way 
as it applies to private and voluntary sector processing. It 
does not distinguish between any of those sectors. 
Processing by Government Departments is bound by the 
requirements of data protection principles. The purpose of 
those principles is to provide safeguards for individuals 
of the kind that are sought by the hon. Member for 
Sheffield, Hallam.
<P>
I shall probably get myself into trouble by meandering 
down this path, but why not? There is an interesting 
comparison to be drawn with the type of information that 
we all hold as Members of Parliament. The similarity lies 
in the fact that we have to communicate with Government 
Departments about constituents' personal details. It would 
probably be sensible for all hon. Members to investigate 
whether they should be registered as individual Members 
of Parliament.
<P>
The processing by Government Departments must, as 
in other sectors, be fair and lawful. Governments are not 
exempt from the law in respect of their relations with 
individuals. They must be fair in their handling of 
personal data in fact, they are morally obliged to be 
more so than other bodies. The processing must be done 
for specified and lawful purposes. The data must not be 
further processed that includes the important principle 
of disclosure for any non-compatible purpose. The data 
must be adequate, relevant, non-excessive, accurate and 
kept up-to-date, and there must be appropriate security 
arrangements. Those are all crucial safeguards for 
individuals, which must be respected as much by 
Government Departments as by any other data controllers.
<P>
It is important to recognise that the rights that the Bill 
creates for individuals may also be exercised in respect of 
processing by Government Departments. Of those rights, 
the most important is that of subject access, to which the 
amendments of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam 
refer. The Bill already places on Government 
Departments the obligation mentioned in the first part of 
amendment No. 186. Government Departments, like any 
other data controller, must already communicate to data 
subjects all the personal data that the Department holds 
about them. In passing, I should say that English law does 
not recognise the ownership of information, to which the 
amendment in effect refers. However, the general point 
underlying the amendment is already dealt with by the 
Bill.
<P>
I am unsure about whether the hon. Gentleman is 
satisfied that the general data protection standards that the 
Bill sets are sufficient in relation to Government 
Departments. I cannot share his reservations, although I 
agree that there may, in certain circumstances, be a need 
to complement the general provisions of the Bill. In 
saying that, I am not focusing specifically on Government 
Departments: the need may arise in any sector. The Bill 
already addresses that point as well. It does not in direct 
response to the points that were made by the hon. 
Gentleman's noble Friend in another place.
<P>
Clause 50 gives the Data Protection Commissioner an 
important role in the promotion of good data protection 
practice, particularly in relation to codes of practice. She 
has the power to issue codes of practice on her own 
initiative. She can, and indeed must, comment on codes 
of practice that are proposed to her by others. 
Furthermore, the Secretary of State is empowered to direct 
her to issue codes of practice. The latter provision was 
added to the Bill on Report in another place, following 
discussions with the hon. Gentleman's noble Friend about 
the points that he raised today. The noble Lady brought 
forward the provision and the Government willingly 
accepted it.



<P>
I am afraid that my response has been somewhat 
lengthy, but I thought that it would be helpful to set out 
in detail how the Bill will apply to Government 
Departments. I hope that I have managed to persuade the 
hon. Gentleman that the Bill provides the safeguards that 
he seeks.
<P>
Government amendment No. 111 is technical. It 
introduces the potential for charging no fee, and relates to 
the Secretary of State's power to prescribe maximum fees 
for subject access. Clause 7(2), (10) and (11) allows the 
Secretary of State by regulations to set various maximum 
subject access fees for various cases. It does not allow 
him, however, to prescribe cases in which no subject 
access fee may be charged.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Bill brings within the scope of the provisions 
certain manual records currently subject to other subject 
access regimes, at least one of which, involving education 
records, requires access to be given free of charge in 
certain circumstances. The Government wish to be able to 
maintain that requirement under the Bill. We do not want 
to reduce existing rights. We cannot maintain the existing 
circumstances without a power to prescribe cases in which 
no fee may be charged. Amendment No. 111 will give the 
Secretary of State just that power.
<P>
I hope that the Committee agrees that that small change 
is desirable. I invite the hon. Member for Sheffield, 
Hallam to withdraw the amendment in the light of the 
helpful changes made in co-operation with his noble 
Friend in another place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The provision involves important issues of 
principle. Access to information exists on a spectrum, at 
one end of which is the police state, in which records are 
held by the state and people have no rights. The free state 
is at the other end. I accept the Minister's assurances that 
the Bill and other recent legislation move in the right 
direction. Liberal Democrats tabled the amendment as a 
hook to obtain ministerial assurance and clarification with 
regard to the Government and agents of the state. We have 
received that assurance and clarification, and are grateful 
for the Minister's positive response, especially in respect 
of the work done by my noble Friend Baroness Nicholson 
of Winterbourne in another place.
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the 
following amendments: Government amendment No. 151.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and '
<P>
(e) whether the information requested may affect the

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The Government amendments will 
make changes to clause 7(4). They are consequential to 
the changes made in relation to the Gaskin judgment, 
which was debated at some length on Tuesday.
<P>
Amendment No. 150 deletes clause 7(4)(b). Clause 7(4) 
states that data controllers giving subject access need not 
disclose information that might lead to the identification 
of a third party. Paragraph (b) states that that principle 
does not apply to health records when the third parties are 
health professionals who have contributed to the records.
<P>
Bringing within the scope of the Bill the records now 
covered by the Access to Health Records Act 1990 means 
that clause 7(4)(b) no longer works properly. That is done 
through the amendments relating to the Gaskin case, 
which was discussed on Tuesday. Clause 7(4)(b) must be 
deleted. The provision that it makes will not be reinstated 
in the Bill, because the Government must make similar 
provision in respect of other professionals, such as social 
workers.
<P>
It would not be appropriate to include a series of such 
provisions in the Bill, each dealing with a limited category 
of records and third parties. Clause 29 provides a power 
for the Secretary of State to modify the subject 
information provisions, including clause 7, in respect of 
health and social work records. The Government intend 
to use the power to replicate current orders made under 
the Data Protection Act 1984, with any necessary 
improvements. We shall include provision corresponding 
to clause 7(4)(b) in each of the orders.



<P>
Amendment No. 151 makes a simple change. It deletes 
the definition of health records in clause 7(1). That 
definition has been included in new clause 1, which has 
been added to the Bill as part of the Gaskin group of 
amendments.
<P>
I hope that the Committee agrees that the amendments 
are sensible and necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Government amendments are 
consequential on the amendments and new schedule in 
relation to Gaskin that we discussed on Tuesday.
<P>
Amendment No. 34 sought to amend subsection (10), 
which the Minister proposes to delete, so I see no reason 
to detain the Committee further.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Should not the word "or"	 in subsection 
(4)(b) survive because (a) and (c) are alternatives?
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> That is an interesting question, 
and the answer would be equally interesting if I had it.
I suspect that the matter has been examined and that the 
word should not survive. If my hon. Friend in his 
characteristically thorough way, has hit on something that 
does not work, we shall make the necessary changes at 
the appropriate time. I am, however, unable to assess the 
point as fully as he might like in the seconds available 
to me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> If I may help, I think that the hon. 
Member for Broxtowe is wrong. The words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"leave out from beginning to `or' in line 33"	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
mean that "or"	 stays in. Drafting amendments is difficult, 
but the words "leave out to `something' "	 meant that 
"something"	 remains in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I think that we have unanimity. If that 
could ever be achieved in the United Nations, we would 
have world peace. The hon. Member for Ryedale is right 
to say that amendment No. 150 should stay in its present 
form. For probably the first time in his life, my hon. 
Friend was not quite right.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 32. in 
page 6, line 4, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and 
<P>
(e) whether the information requested may affect the 
employment prospects of the individual concerned.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Amendment No. 32 touches on an important part of 
the subject access provisions and on what happens when 
information includes data that relate to other people, 
which cannot be disclosed without reference to them.
<P>
Should the data controller disclose the information or 
should he decline to comply with the request? As the 
Minister said, a request may be complied with under 
subsection (4)(c) if it is reasonable in all the 
circumstances to comply with it without the other 
individual's request.
<P>
Subsection (6) sets out four considerations that the data 
controller should have in mind when determining whether 
it is reasonable in all the circumstances to comply with a 
request. Those considerations include any duty of 
confidentiality that might be owed to the other individual, 
which would be important. I suppose that that suggests 
that the information might not be disclosed. Any steps 
that had been taken to try to obtain the other individual's 
consent are important. If the other individual had refused 
to answer recorded delivery letters, for instance, would he 
deserve much support? Of course, he might not be capable 
of giving consent they might not be able to find him, 
for example, The possibility of express refusal to give 
consent must also be taken into account.
<P>
We are talking about a subject seeking information 
about records containing his or her personal data. What 
would happen if a subject requested access to information 
that also related to another person?
<P>
An important consideration, which the data controller 
ought to bear in mind when considering "reasonableness"	, 
is whether the effect of his decision might have some 
bearing on the individual's employment prospects. The 
Minister will know that the directive I cannot put my 
finger on the precise article gives added status to 
employment prospects. It is an important issue. I am sure 
that hon. Members can think of various scenarios. What 
would happen if, for instance, two people had been in a 
partnership that had failed and one partner went off to 
seek employment, only to find that he did not get an 
interview or got an interview but not the job because 
certain information had been made available to the 
prospective employer?



<P>
The subject would want to know what that information 
was and whether it was accurate. It could be connected 
with the failed partnership, or relate to a previous 
marriage breakdown or perhaps joint court proceedings. 
Subsection (6)(a), (b), (c) and (d) prescribes matters to 
which the data controller should have regard when making 
a difficult judgment about whether to grant the 
information and thus technically breach the confidentiality 
of a third party. In the spirit of the directive and the Bill, 
the employment prospects of the subject seeking the data 
might well be one of the issues that the data controller 
should have to consider.
<P>
Perhaps such protection, building on another part of the 
directive, is provided elsewhere in the Bill, but it is not 
apparent in clause 7(6). As and when a data controller is 
faced with such a problem, he and his sources of legal 
advice wil look to that list. They might just find extra 
comfort in seeing employment prospects included. I am 
sure that all hon. Members would regard that as very 
important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> As I read it, the amendment would add 
an express requirement to take into account the effect of 
withholding disclosure on the employment prospects of 
the individual concerned. It is not clear perhaps the hon. 
Gentleman will explain whether that is the person 
making the request or the third party, or both. We do not 
need to be over-exercised about that.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Greenway: I had in mind the person making the 
request. I can predict the point that the Minister was about 
to make that is, that the Bill may not make it clear 
whether the employment prospects of the third party, 
whose consent has not been obtained, might be involved. 
I accept that, but my concern was for the data subject who 
is making the request.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I was trying to tease out the hon. 
Gentleman's intentions, rather than make a strong point 
about the matter.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
We discussed earlier a group of amendments that are 
intended to give effect to the ECHR judgment in the case 
of Gaskin, regarding certain manual records that are not 
covered by the Bill. I said then that the Bill already dealt 
with the Gaskin judgment tin respect of the records that 
are within its scope. Taken together, subsections (4) and 
(6) represent an important part of the mechanism for 
achieving that. Clause 7(4) allows data controllers not to 
give subject access where to do so would allow a third 
party to be identified, unless one of three conditions 
applies. the third os those conditions is that it would be 
reasonable in all circumstances to grant subject access 
without the consent of the third party.
<P>
Clause 7(6) sets out the factors to which regard should 
be paid, particularly by the controller in determining 
whether not granting access on "third party grounds"	 
would be reasonable. If a data controller refuses subject 
access because a third party would be identified, the data 
subject can seek a court order or the help of the Data 
Protection Commissioner to secure access. In considering 
whether access should be granted, the court or the 
commissioner would have to take into account the factors 
mentioned in clause 7(6).
<P>
I thought it right that I should explain the mechanism 
so that Committee members can fully understand the 
effect of the hon. Gentleman's amendment. It would mean 
that the possibility of affecting the employment prospects 
of the "individual concerned"	 would always have to be 
taken into account in assessing the reasonableness of 
withholding subject access. I should say in passing that it 
is not clear whether the "individual concerned"	 is the data 
subject or the third party. However, we have already 
discussed that.
<P>
The list of factors that clause 7(6) requires to be taken 
into account is non-exhaustive. The use of the words, "in 
particular"	 means that regard can also be given to other 
factors. Indeed, all the relevant circumstances must be 
taken into account. Either party's employment prospects 
must, therefore, be considered if they are relevant to the 
question of disclosure. We have sought in clause 7(6) to 
identify the factors that must be taken into account in 
every case. They are general criteria that will be relevant 
in every case. One could, of course, add many more 
criteria to the list to cover all sorts of situations. However, 
that might not always be helpful. It would mean that the 
criteria would always have to be considered, regardless of 
whether they had any relevance to the circumstances of 
the case in question.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out, employment 
matters may not be relevant in every case. Not all cases 
in which subject access is refused on third party grounds 
involve possible effects on employment. That is a 
weakness of the amendment. It would require 
employment to be considered in every case, even where 
it was not a relevant factor.
<P>
The Government believe that the approach that we have 
adopted is better that is, to limit the mandatory criteria 
in the Bill to those that are of general relevance, and to 
leave other relevant criteria to be taken into account as 
required by the circumstances of each case.
<P>
I apologise if that explanation was somewhat lengthy 
and involved, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will now 
feel that it is sensible to withdraw his amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister has given an explanation 
that goes wider than the one that we sought, which is 
extremely helpful. I understood him to say that, in 
reaching a decision, regard must be paid to the four 
criteria listed in subsections (6)(a) to (d) in every case. I 
underlined the words "in particular"	 on my first reading 
and wondered what they meant, but assume the Minister 
to mean that other factors can be taken into account as 
well as those four criteria.
<P>
I hope that the fact that we have had this discussion 
will prove helpful to the Committee and to those who 
have to implement this measure. Subsections 6(a) to (d) 
are not exhaustive, but the criteria they contain must be 
considered in every case when assessing reasonableness. 
With that clarification, the Debate has served a useful 
purpose, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the 
amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I beg to move amendment

out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in such cases as may be prescribed'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendment No. 131.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The Government amendments make a 
number of comparatively small changes in the procedural 
arrangements for subject access in clause 7 and the 
associated provision for parliamentary scrutiny in clause 
63.
<P>
Amendment No. 112 allows individuals to seek subject 
access to part of their data rather than to everything that 
the controller holds about them in circumstances 
prescribed by the Secretary of States by regulations. 
Amendments Nos. 113, 114 and 115 make consequential 
changes to clause 7. Amendment No. 131 makes the 
associated changes to parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>
The essential purpose of the Government amendments 
is to increase the flexibility of the procedural 
arrangements. The main change is made by amendment 
No. 112. Under the Bill as drafted, individuals may only 
request access to all the data held about them by a data 
controller. They may not, as of right, request access to 
only some of their data. We think that that is too 
inflexible. On the other hand, it would be burdensome to 
data controllers to leave completely at large the possibility 
of limited or specific access requested, requiring 
tailor-made responses in every case.
<P>
Amendment No. 112 makes provision for the Secretary 
of State, by regulation, to prescribe circumstances in 
which individuals may seek access to limited categories 
of data. He may prescribe the cases, and the descriptions 
of the data. As I said, amendments Nos. 113, 114 and 115 
are consequential. Amendment No. 131 makes necessary 
associated changes to the parliamentary scrutiny 
procedures to which I have already referred.
<P>
I hope that the Committee agrees that the increased 
flexibility provided by the amendments is desirable and 
that they will benefit data subjects without being 
disadvantageous to controllers. Therefore, I hope that the 
Committee will support the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Not for the first time, We have tabled 
an amendment that touches on a similar issue to a 
Government amendment. The Minister more than 
adequately described the effect of the changes in 
procedure under his amendments, but did not address the 
reasoning behind our amendment. It is a tool to probe 
what the Government intend, and to draw attention to 
the phrase.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in such cases as may be prescribed"	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in Government amendment No. 112. I hope that the 
Minister will say what cases will be prescribed. if he 
cannot do so today, I should be grateful if he would write 
to me. What circumstances will the Secretary of States 
bear in mind when considering making special 
regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I shall deal with amendment No. 35. As 
has been noted, clause 7(1) allows people to seek a range 
of information from data controllers about the data that 
those controllers hold on them. Some of the subsection's 
four paragraphs are further subdivided. People can request 
information about whether the controller processes their 
data, and they can also ask for a description of the data, 
the purposes of the processing and the recipients of the 
data. In addition, people can request the data themselves 
and any available information about their source. Finally, 
people can request information about the logic involved 
in the automatic decision-making process, which we have 
debated and defined already today.
<P>
The 1984 Act contains only two of the present 
elements: the right to be informed whether the 
individual's data are being processed, and the right to 
request a copy of the data.



<P>
Section 21(2) of the 1984 Act states that, unless there 
is an indication to the contrary, a request for general 
information about processing is to be taken as including 
a request for the data themselves. The provision in the 
Bill is different. We are extending the categories of 
information that the individual may request. As I have 
said, those now extend considerably beyond the
1984 Act's two categories. The possible permutations are 
more numerous than under the 1984 Act.
<P>
If individuals make a request for one or more of those 
elements, they may not always want everything else. For 
example, if they ask for the data themselves, they may not 
want all the information about purposes and recipients, 
and automated decision-making. Such circumstances 
might be readily envisaged. The regulations will establish 
some basic rules about what one will be taken to be asking 
for if one makes certain forms of request. That also 
enables data controllers to be spared unnecessary burdens. 
The Bill provides for different fees to be prescribed, 
depending on the extent of the request.
<P>
In view of that, the Government thought it preferable 
to build some flexibility into the system, rather than 
follow the rigid approach in the 1984 Act. That is why 
clause 8(1) provides a regulation making power. That 
allows the Secretary of State to provide that a request for 
one type of information under clause 7(1) may include a 
request for another type of information.
<P>
To provide the maximum flexibility, the power allows 
the regulations to prescribe different situations for 
different cases. That is the purpose of the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in such cases as may be prescribed"	,
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which amendment No. 35 would delete.
<P>
We believe that those words are necessary. Without 
them, the Secretary of State may be unable to achieve the 
desired effect without either burdening data subjects with 
more information than they need or want, or burdening 
data controllers with providing more information than is 
sought.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale recognises 
the value of this approach. The principles behind what he 
wanted to achieve are important, but amendment No. 35 
is unnecessary.

Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I seek confirmation on a point. We 
shall need to consider the amendments in a little detail 
because they are important, although amendment No. 41 
is arguably more important than amendment No. 33.
<P>
We have been discussing the vexed problem of data 
subjects seeking information from data controllers about 
their records when a third party is mentioned in them. We 
have spoken about the difficult job that the data controller 
faces in making a reasonable judgment about whether to 
release information that might lead to a breach of 
confidentiality.
<P>
I have no idea how much such cases there might be. 
Let us, however, look at the issue from the other point of 
view. There will be cases in which the data controller uses 
his judgment, exercises his reasonableness and follows all 
the guidance. One of the parties might not, however, like 
the judgment that he reaches, which would be 
understandable. Someone who requests information and 
is refused it is more likely to be unhappy. Clause 7(9) 
makes it clear that the mechanism available to such a 
person is to take the matter to court. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If a court is satisfied on the application of any person who has 
made a request under the foregoing provisions of this section that 
the data controller in question has failed to comply with the request 
in contravention of those provisions, the court may order him to 
comply with the request."<P>
</UL></FONT>	
<P>
Amendment No. 33 would not, as the Confederation of 
British Industry suggested in a letter to Committee 
members, impose further burdens on business quite the 
opposite. The intention is to find a more informal means 
of arbitration. Amendment No. 41 to clause 9 is much the 
same, although there are different connotations.
<P>
When I saw the clause, I was struck by the fact that we 
have a Data Protection Commissioner we do not want 
to overload him either and a tribunal. They will be asked 
to rule on all sorts of cases, as we shall find as we proceed 
through the Bill. The Bill requires data subjects to go to 
the great expense of going to court to challenge a 
decision, and it seemed to me that informal arbitration by 
the Data Protection Commissioner might be a better 
mechanism.
<P>
It is difficult to envisage how many instances there 
might be of data controllers being unable to comply with 
a request under subsection (4). The Minister said that the 
implications of the Gaskin ruling have been largely taken 
on board, so I do not envisage a huge number. That is 
why we propose in amendment No. 33 that a data 
controller who cannot comply with a request reports his 
decision to the Data Protection Commissioner. The data 
subject can then ask the commissioner to review the 
decision to establish whether it was reasonable in all the 
circumstances. Obviously, in the case that I mentioned, it 
was reasonable not to comply with the request. Of course, 
the amendment puts it the other way round.
<P>
We do not want the Data Protection Commissioner to 
make rulings in a quasi-judicial role. If, however, he 
thinks that a decision is not entirely reasonable, we want 
him to be able to request we put it no more strongly 
than that the data controller to reconsider his decision. 
The Government have made it abundantly clear, 
particularly in the debates in another place, that they want 
to improve data subject access rights, and that would be 
one way of doing so. It would also accord with the spirit 
of the directive.
<P>
It is a difficult issue, but we simply want to know 
whether it is feasible not just in clause 7, but in other 
parts of the Bill to provide for a more informal means 
of resolving disputes, thus avoiding the obvious expense 
of individuals going to court over decisions that they did 
not like.
<P>
The CBI misinterpreted the intention of the 
amendment, but I cannot accuse it of misinterpreting the 
effect because that is entirely for it to judge. It is, 
however, equally our intention to spare businesses the 
huge expense of having to defend such cases in court. 
Individuals of relatively modest means, such as you,
Mr. Welsh, and I, may think that we could not afford to 
take the matter to court because our parliamentary salaries 
would not run to it. We might decide to let the matter rest.



<P>
In reality, I suspect that if such a case went to court, it 
would have reached there because a campaign group has 
decided that there was an issue of principle at stake. Funds 
would therefore be made available to ensure that court 
proceedings went ahead. The person for whom one should 
feel sorry is not the individual, who would be supported 
by the resources of the campaign or pressure group, but 
the small business man of modest means who must decide 
whether to change his mind or go to the expense of 
defending the decision in court.
<P>
The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East is 
smiling, which means he understands my point. In 
ensuring that hon. Members get the point, we tend to use 
colourful language and we are prone to exaggeration.

<B>Dr. Palmer rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I should just like to sum up my point. 
Will the Minister consider whether the Data Protection 
Registrar and the tribunal, as they already exist, could be 
asked to provide informal arbitration when a data subject 
does not like a data controller's decision, rather than them 
having to fight it out in court?
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I seek clarification. Supposing the Data 
Protection Commissioner writes to the data controller 
suggesting that he takes another look at his decision 
amendment No. 33 uses the word "consider"	 while 
amendment No. 41 says "review"	, but it is the same 
thing and the data controller says, "I have reconsidered 
and come to the same conclusions"	, surely the case will 
still go to court or to a tribunal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right; the issue 
would then go to court. However, I suspect that that might 
not happen, for two reasons. First, the data subject may 
not appreciate the data controller's reasoning, but the
Data Protection Commissioner is likely to be more 
dispassionate and independent minded and might be more 
included to understand.
<P>
You and I, Mr. Welsh, meet people in similar 
circumstances each weekend. The data subject may be 
very unhappy with the decision but, because he knows 
that he cannot afford to take legal action, his alternative 
is to trot off to his Members of Parliament and ask, "Can't 
you do something about this?"	 [Hon. Members: "Oh."	] 
clearly, that has woken up the Committee. I do not pray 
in aid of the amendment Labour Members likely 
agreement that accepting it would lighten the load of their 
Saturday morning surgeries. However, all hon. Members 
have experience, week in and week out, of people who 
are unhappy because they neither understand nor agree 
with some major decision taken about them. Such people 
cannot always afford to go to court, so they seek an 
informal resolution of the problem.
<P>
The hon. Member for Broxtowe was right: if people 
remain unhappy and the data controller refuses to change 
his mind, they have to go to court. There is no alternative, 
other than to cut their losses and say, "I still don't like it, 
but at least someone else has had a look at the problem."	 
That is why cases, at local government as well as at 
Parliamentary level, are often sent to the ombudsman.
<P>
The hon. Member for Broxtowe was right on a second 
count. There may be circumstances in which the data 
controller refuses a request because he is worried about 
the third party and the potential breach of confidentiality. 
He may be nervous about incurring the wrath of that third 
party and may come to a negative conclusion. The 
formality of the involvement of the Data Protection 
Commissioner might provide the comfort that he seeks.



<P>
Although it is conceivable that the Data Protection 
Commissioner would be dispassionate and agree with the 
data controller's decision, it is equally possible that the 
data controller's nervousness, and uncertainty about what 
to do would be overcome by the commissioner's 
involvement. To put the matter as its simplest, in most 
cases data subjects will seek information from commercial 
organisations, but they will not all be large.
<P>
Amendments No. 33 suggests a way to provide a less 
expensive but more user-friendly type of informal 
resolution. I accept that the amendment's implications for 
the quantity of work for the Data Protection 
Commissioner and his staff is an unknown, but that is true 
about many elements of the Bill.
<P>
Experience alone will determine the amendment's 
effect. However, if a number of cases were brought to the 
Data Protection Commissioner, they would help him to 
improve and modify the guidance given to data 
controllers.
<P>
Amendment No. 41 is linked to amendment No.33 and 
applies to clause 9, which deals with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"processing likely to cause damage or distress."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause provides a potential remedy to a data subject, 
who will be able to ask a data controller for information 
on the basis that the processing is causing him "damage 
or distress"	. That is clearly an important feature of the 
Bill. A similar mechanism of informal resolution would 
be sensible, and that is the basis of amendment No. 41.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>

<P>
Committee members will be aware that the credit card 
industry is worried about the potential for fraud arising 
from the Bill's provisions, which go much further than 
those of the 1984 Act. Concerns about clause 9, which 
deals with damage or distress to an individual, were 
expressed by the Credit Card Research Group. During a 
previous sitting, my hon. Friend the Member for Esher 
and Walton pointed out that the credit card industry is 
worth about £100 billion a year. It therefore represents a 
massive part of our commercial life. Regarding clause 9, 
the Credit Card Research Group stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"As it stands an individual can require a data controller to cease 
processing his/her personal data at any time simply by alleging that 
it is causing unwarranted damage or distress. As the section 
currently stands an individual is merely required to furnish a written 
notice to this effect and need not substantiate the claim. This could 
open the floodgates to fraudsters."<P>
</UL></FONT>	



<P>
The Credit Card Research Group suggested that, at the 
very least, an individual should be required to prove the 
fact of the damage or distress before a court or other 
competent authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I shall make this point first, and then 
give way.
<P>
On seeing amendment No. 41 on the amendment paper, 
the Credit Card Research Group told me that it would do 
the job perfectly because it would provide some comfort 
by way of an informal resolution by the Data Protection 
Commissioner. A company might say, "We do not think 
that you are right, Mr. Data Subject, in making this 
allegation that what we are doing is causing you damage 
or distress, and therefore we are going to refuse your 
application."	 That would be reported to the Data 
Protection Commissioner. It would then be up to the 
individual to write to the commissioner asking for the 
decision to be reviewed. The practical effect of that would 
be to create a disincentive to the fraudster.
<P>
It is not hard to imagine what information contained in 
people's records could cause damage or distress. There 
may be matters relating to their payment of outstanding 
debts, or the way in which they have conducted 
themselves with credit card, finance or leasing companies. 
The damage or distress would be caused by the fact that 
as a result of the disclosure of that information, a person 
may not get the credit that they seek.
<P>
It is for the Committee to judge whether I have 
explained the credit card companies' anxiety adequately. 
However, I was struck by the extent to which they felt 
that the informal resolution option would provide the 
disincentive barrier that they would like to see in the Bill. 
That would overcome what is, in their view, the problem 
inherent in clause 9 that the data subject needs only to 
allege that damage or distress is being caused, and to ask 
for the processing to be stopped. Stopping the processing 
would mean that the avoidance system that is in place to 
prevent credit card fraud would grind to a halt as far as 
the person involved would be concerned. The processing 
would have to be stopped, which would provide an 
opportunity to commit fraud.
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> Taking the opposite view, it is clear that, 
at present, giving the same credit reference information to 
two separate companies can result in one acceptance and 
one rejection. The information itself is not necessarily the 
problem; it is more the logic behind the decision, which 
the Committee discussed ealrier. The data subject has the 
right to understand that logic without necessarily going 
straight to the Data Protection Commissioner. The hon. 
Gentleman is choosing the wrong time to make his point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> There is undoubtedly some sense in 
the hon. Gentleman's comments. I accept that the 
Committee should have other debates about clause 9. We 
have had to stray into the territory of clause 9 because 
of the grouping of amendments. The mechanism that the 
amendments would introduce is much the same as that in 
the clause, and would be used to seek informal resolution.
<P>
The matters involved are weighty. I have spoken about 
credit card fraud in depth to demonstrate that the 
amendments are not without support and friends. An 
alternative means of resolving the difficulty may be 
agreed when the Committee debates clause 9. 
Nevertheless, there are two or three instances in the Bill 
where data controllers' decisions or requests made to 
them by data subjects could be contentious. In the light 
of the circumstances in which decisions will be taken and 
their effect on the people and companies concerned, the 
Committee should consider whether a mechanism should 
be found to resolve differences more informally by using 
the expertise and experience of the Data Protection 
Commissioner and her support staff.
<P>
As the Minister knows, the Committee will consider 
other contentious issues. Clause 31 is arguable the most 
contentious clause. It provides for the Data Protection 
Commissioner to make rulings and judgments. The 
concept is not novel in relation to the Bill as a whole.
<P>
I hope that I have explained the logic behind the 
amendments. They are intended to help data subjects and 
data controllers, to avoid costs for both, and to call upon, 
enhance and improve the experience of the Data 
Protection Commissioner in dealing with some of the 
Bill's more contentious aspects.



<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> I should like to add briefly to my hon. 
Friend's comments. I, too, have had information from the 
credit industry fraud avoidance system. Its concern is that 
the provision is open to abuse by fraudsters on a persistent 
and deliberate basis. In conjunction with that, the Minister 
might consider whether the exemptions under clause 28 
should be extended to cover clause 9. There are real 
concerns as to how the matter should be addressed and
I should be interested in the Minister's response.
I apologise in advance if I am absent during the Minister's 
response. I apologise in advance if I am absent during the 
hon. Gentleman's response, but I am sure that my hon. 
Friend the Member for Ryedale will be all ears.

<P>

<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> In typical new Labour style, I should like 
to defend the position of the CBI. [Laughter.] As a result 
of clause 8(2)(a) and (b) and the equivalent new sections 
(3A) and (3B) proposed in amendment No. 41, appeals to 
the Data Protection Commissioner will be either relatively 
rare or extremely frequent. I suspect that, as is the case 
with the Child Support Agency, appeals will be extremely 
frequent and any negative decision will automatically be 
referred to the Data Protection Commissioner. That is 
what we would expect it is human nature. If it does not 
cost anything, it is just a matter of writing another letter, 
people will bump the matter up to the next level and see 
what is said. There will be considerable round-trip traffic 
to and from the Data Protection Commissioner.
<P>
If that does not happen and people are more reticent 
than I have supposed, clause 8(2)(a) will nevertheless 
force businesses to write to the Data Protection 
Commissioner in every case. Even if they have an 
extremely convincing answer for the applicant and are 
confident that the applicant will not appeal to the Data 
Protection Commissioner, under clause 8(2)(a), they will 
be obliged to inform the commissioner who will receive 
the letter and file it. So some work will be created even 
when no appeal is made. I wonder why the provision is 
in place and whether it would be more appropriate, if one 
foresaw appeals to the commissioner, for the details to be 
supplied at the time rather than routinely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for 
Broxtowe made some interesting points about the 
technical detail of the provision and also about the CBI. 
He made them with humour, but it is important that the 
interests of businesses are taken into account.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale gave a Socratic 
dialogue I think that is what it was about what he was 
proposing and what the CBI said would be the effect.
I found it most interesting. His conjecture about the 
various actions that might follow was a little fanciful, but 
nevertheless interesting and entertaining. At one stage, he 
brought into the equation the case work that we all 
encounter at our surgeries. It would probably be unwise 
for us to get too deeply into that subject. Suffice it to say 
that in the 11 and a half years since I have been in the 
House, I have had all sorts of people in my surgery. 
Mostly, they have had serious problems with which they 
need help but I have encountered everything from people 
who have aliens in their loft Knowsley council very 
kindly cleared them to someone who had poison gas 
pumped into the house by the Central Intelligence 
Agency. That individual subsequently went to meet the 
then hon. Member for St. Helen's North now Lord 
Evans who a week later said that he had had a word 
with the CIA which had admitted that it was doing it but 
had now stopped. [Laughter.] The constituent was quite 
happy with that explanation. I apologise for distracting 
the Committee, Mr. Welsh.



<P>
Clause 41, as distinct from amendment No. 41, allows 
any person to apply to the commissioner for an 
assessment for whether any processing that affects him 
complies with the Bill. It specifies the action that the 
commissioner must take. If, having made such an 
assessment, the commissioner takes the view that there 
has been a breach, she has the power to take the 
necessary action.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The important principles that the hon. Member for 
Ryedale enunciated when he moved amendment No. 33 
are covered by clause 41 and the commissioner's powers. 
I understand his purpose in moving the amendment, which 
he made quite clear. It is intended to strengthen 
enforcement of the subject access right. He goes too far, 
however. Furthermore, the amendment is not necessary in 
the light of the provision in clause 41.
<P>
I shall deal first with the subsections in amendment
No. 33 because they hang together. They would introduce 
a new bureaucratic mechanism into the subject access 
arrangements. Whichever way one cuts it, there must be 
bureaucratic implications. The amendments would go 
further than was necessary or consistent with the Bill.
<P>
The proposed subsections would impose a duty on data 
controllers to inform the Data Protection Commissioner in 
every case in which they refused a subject access request 
because they did not want to disclose information that 
identified third parties. The Government have much 
sympathy for data subjects who are refused access, but it 
is asking too much of data controllers to make them pass 
on information about decisions in every circumstance.
<P>
We should bear in mind the fact that clause 7(4) is a 
particular application of general rules. An applicant's 
right to subject access and a third party's right to 
non-disclosure have to be balanced when they come into 
potential conflict. Should either party be aggrieved, the 
usual remedies and enforcement mechanisms for their 
respective rights are fully in place. If the data subject has 
been refused access, he can already go to the Data 
Protection Commissioner and ask for an assessment under 
Clause 41.
<P>
The Commissioner is obliged to make an assessment 
and can take action if necessary. That is the right approach 
and it is consistent with the Bill's general thrust. It gives 
data subjects stronger rights and effective means of 
having them enforced. At the same time, it avoids putting 
too many unnecessary burdens on data controllers, 
businesses, Government Departments or voluntary 
agencies. That is an important principle.
<P>
The final subsection was a little difficult to understand, 
but I hope that my inability to understand it will not affect 
our general conclusion. It seems to require data controllers 
to tell data subjects when their data are disclosed to third 
parties. The reference to subsection (5) was a little 
confusing; I wondered whether it was intended as a 
reference to subsection (6). If the hon. Member for 
Ryedale accepts my assurance, that will not matter. If the 
amendment is right, however, there is a deficiency as 
there is with the other subsections.
<P>
Data subjects are already entitled under clause 7 (1) (b) 
to be told who the recipients of their data are, which is 
adequate. The amendment goes a step too far, and I hope 
that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.



<P>
Amendment No. 41, as distinct from clause 41, deals, 
as the hon. Gentleman said, with cases in which 
controllers have given notice under clause 9(3)(b) of their 
reasons for not complying with an individual's request to 
stop processing his or her personal data. It would add to 
clause 9 virtually identical provisions to those in the first 
three subsections of amendment No. 33, which I have just 
discussed. Exactly the same arguments apply to this 
amendment it would impose unnecessary burdens on 
controllers. Therefore the Government cannot accept it, 
and I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Greenway: There are a number of points to make. 
I know that members of the Committee want to make 
progress, so I will not deliberate at length.
<P>
In essence, the Minister appears to be saying that he 
understands the motivation behind the amendment but 
thinks that it would create too much of a burden. In 
respect of clause 7, I take his point. With clause 9, 
however, the boot is on the other foot. Credit card 
companies sought reassurance that they could refuse 
requests to cease processing on spurious grounds of 
damage or distress.
<P>
As I said, we shall return to the issue via other 
amendments. Although he did not touch on it in his reply, 
I am sure that the Minister will acknowledge that the 
concern of the credit card anti-fraud movement must be 
addressed. If, as I anticipated, he thinks that my 
amendment is not the way in which to do that, I am sure 
that it does not mean that he does not recognise the 
problem, or the need to tackle it.
<P>
More important was the Minister's reading of clause 
41. We will debate the clause later, but his 
interpretation does not cover the eventuality that I was 
addressing. If the Minister is saying that the Data 
Protection Commissioner can be asked to make an 
assessment on all matters within the scope of the Bill, 
that seems to be a wider interpretation than the more 
obvious meaning that I draw from clause 41.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Perhaps I could help the hon. 
Gentleman by reiterating what I said, so that there is no 
room for any doubt. Clause 41 allows any person to apply 
to the Commissioner for an assessment of whether or not 
processing affecting him or her is in compliance with the 
Bill. That is fairly different from what the hon. 
Gentleman said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That is the narrower interpretation. We 
will not press our amendment, but we may try to amend 
clause 41 so that it carries the wider interpretation. I am 
not entirely sure that the decisions of data controllers or 
those requests of data subjects that data controllers regard 
as unreasonable are covered by clause 41(1). I understand 
that it provides a mechanism for data subject, but that is 
in respect of whether
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"processing has been or is being carried out in compliance"	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
with the Bill, rather than whether a data controller has 
made a defensible decision in respect of clause 7.



<P>
I suspect that the Minister's earlier intervention was 
right it is subsection (6) and not subsection (5), as in the 
amendment. I am not sure whether it was my fault or the 
fault of the Clerk in the Public Bill Office. I shall plead 
guilty my writing is not always as legible as it could be.
<P>
I have tugged on the issue at length because I want 
the Minister and his officials to understand where we are 
coming from. We will be able to return to the matter and 
to issues relating to the credit card industry when we 
debate the role of the Data Protection Commissioner. For 
now, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> There is a final point in respect of 
clause to which I wish to draw attention. I hope that the 
Minister will confirm that a potential mischief is covered.
<P>
Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A data controller is not obliged to comply with a request under 
this section unless he is supplied with such information as he may 
reasonably require in order to satisfy himself as to the identity of 
the person making the request and to locate the information which 
that person seeks."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provision is entirely proper. Will the Minister 
confirm that, as well as covering security, it will deal with 
potential hoax callers and those who might want to obtain 
information for other, possibly criminal, purposes? I 
assume that that is the intention, as it is important that the 
bill achieves a balance.

Mr. Howarth: I am grateful for that question.
