							<b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): I am delighted to
see the Minister back in his place. I know that he has had a busy lunch
time. We hope that he remains with us and is not reshuffled or promoted
anywhere, after the multi-tasking he was doing on the lunch-time news.
We do not want him to go until we have seen the guidance on the Welsh
elements of the Bill. We hope that there will not be any drift in the
Wales Office in preparing those, for obvious
reasons.</div>
					<a name="080124100000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to
the point that I was making, the amendment relates to advice for
potential applicants and others. I was discussing a concern that the
Campaign to Protect Rural England raised in their written submissions,
which has also been raised with us by a number of practitioners in the
field.</div>
					<a name="080124100000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not a
problem with the giving of advice and assistance, as I hope that I have
already made clear. I do not have any problem with greater use of
pre-application discussions, for example, between applicants. It is
sensible to involve other affected parties at that early stage, hence
our reference to the great success of the Shortlands scheme in the
London borough of Bromley, between the constituencies of my hon. Friend
the Member for Beckenham and myself&#151;just to eke out the press
release.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column424" />Column number: 424</div>
					<a name="080124100000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concern raised is over the
propriety of the commission being the organisation to give that advice.
That concern arises because, ultimately, the commission has to act as
the decision maker in the process; it must be the holder of the ring.
The commission must maintain the confidence both of applicants and of
affected parties, for reasons that we have rehearsed at considerable
length, and that I will not
repeat.</div>
					<a name="080124100000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Against that
background, is there a risk that, if the commission is the giver of
advice, its impartiality as the decision maker will be compromised?
That is why we put forward in our amendment an alternative formulation
and suggest that other Government agencies could happily provide that
function.</div>
					<a name="080124100000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, the Planning Inspectorate, the planning advisory service, and
the advisory team for large applications already exist. If they were
used, and we leave it open in our amendment as to which would be most
convenient, there would be the advantage of ensuring that bodies
discrete from the decision maker provided advice to applicants. There
could not then be even any suggestion of discussions behind the scenes
that might be misinterpreted by those who are affected and are unhappy
at applications. It would enable the commission, if we are to have one,
in spite of our reservations, to be more readily seen than
Caesar&#146;s wife in the matter, so to speak. In essence, that is
the reason for the amendments. I hope that the Minister will realise
that we are trying to be helpful to the work done by the
commission.</div>
					<a name="080124100000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000722"></a>The
Minister for Local Government (John Healey):
						</b> The hon.
Gentleman is right to probe that area, to be concerned about standards
and propriety and to want to be sure that the commission&#146;s
process for giving advice is as clear and open as possible. I argue,
however, that it is a good thing that it will be the commission giving
advice about the process to potential applicants because its members
will be experts on the application process for major infrastructure
projects.</div>
					<a name="080124100000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
obviously of equal importance that any contact and discussion between
the commission and potential applicants does not prejudice the
decision-making process in any way, that it is seen not to do so and is
accepted as not doing so. That is the purpose of the regulation-making
power covering the commission&#146;s role in giving advice,
particularly with regard to the disclosure of that advice more widely
and to the public.
</div>
					<a name="080124100000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">By way of practical
example, the regulations could require minutes of the
commission&#146;s meetings or the advice that it will give to
potential applicants to be made available to all parties. The
commission will, of course, be subject to freedom of information
legislation and to the powers of the ombudsman over questions of
administration.</div>
					<a name="080124100000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst will accept that
there is rightly further work to do on the nature of appropriate
advice, that it is probably better not to put it in primary legislation
and that the regulation-making power is important. I hope that he will
accept that that will help to ensure that it is clear to everyone that
the commission acts impartially, openly, with complete propriety and
that it will be seen to do so.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column425" />Column number: 425</div>
					<a name="080124100000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that the provision is
underpinned by a commitment to make the process as transparent and
unquestionably proper as possible, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will
be willing on the basis of that reassurance to wait until the details
of the regulations are specified. In preparing those regulations, we
will discuss and consult widely because that is the way that we are
most likely to get a framework of regulations that meets his concerns
and can command the confidence of those who want to see the commission
acting properly.</div>

recognises the sensitivity and importance of the issue and, with that
reassurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

							<a name="080124100000726"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> It looks a bit of a mouthful, but essentially the
point that we seek to deal with in this regard is an important one that
we will return to elsewhere in the Bill. We have already flagged up the
fundamental importance of the ability to have oral submissions and the
cross-examinations of witnesses, and we differ with the Government on
that. I know that the Minister has said, in relation to other aspects
of the Bill, that there will be scope for the commission to allow
cross-examination and oral submissions in certain cases. I take all
that on board, but we do not regard it as adequate. This issue is so
fundamental that it should be a right, not something that is at the
behest of the commission. That is the fundamental difference between
our position and the Government&#146;s. The reason for this is
profound: people could be affected not only in their personal lives,
but in their livelihoods, their professional situations and their
proprietary interests in
land.</div>
					<a name="080124100000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">In certain
circumstances, the commission will be able to issue a development
consent order that includes the compulsory acquisition of land. It
seems to us absolutely inconceivable that a person confronted with that
possibility should not have the right&#151;not just the
discretion&#151;to present their case in the way that they choose.
They should be able to do so themselves or through the representative
of their choice, to ask the questions that they want to ask and to test
any evidence that is called to support the proposal that could deprive
them of their
land.</div>
					<a name="080124100000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
we do agree, we are anxious to stress it. Subject to that right, the
commission should be able to control cross-examination through the test
of relevance, as do planning inspectors. As will be remembered, we have
already rehearsed our alternative construct. If policy issues are
decided in the national policy statements, it will not be necessary to
go down the route of the terminal 5 inquiry, which had the longueurs of
repeated cross-examination trying to reopen the issue of whether there
should even be an
airport.</div>
					<a name="080124100000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our
judgment, at the application stage, there should be a debate simply
about the merits of the particular site. That could be controlled in
the same way as it is in other judicial circumstances. I will not bang
on about this point because we have made it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 427</div>before. We are sorry that the Government have not
gone down this route, but if that test were applied, the
cross-examination need not be oppressive, repetitious or the cause of
the inquiry being dragged
out.</div>
					<a name="080124100000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important
that there is a balance between seeking efficiency in the process and
respecting the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing has
been enshrined in common law almost since mediaeval times. It is also
consistent with human rights legislation. The Secretary of State has
signed the usual certificate saying that the Bill is compliant with the
European convention on human rights. However, we suspect that if there
is no clear right to cross-examination in the Bill, it will be a
potential charter for more and more challenge through judicial review.
In terms of planning, it will be the usual lawyers who are making the
money. That is not a threat, but a statement of reality. Those who feel
aggrieved and do not think that they can get a fair crack of the whip
through the commission process will feel pressed to go to court to seek
a
remedy.</div>
					<a name="080124100000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
use an analogy, the Government are falling for a false economy. They
think that they will save money by making the process quicker by this
prohibition. We think that it may make the situation worse through the
amount of challenges and the damage that will be done to the
commission&#146;s reputation for being independent. That is why we
tabled the amendment, which is mirrored in other amendments that we are
proposing throughout the Bill. It would ensure that even at that early
stage in the process, part of the advice to the applicant or,
crucially, to other interested parties is about making representations
on the application. The Bill should spell out explicitly the right to
make oral submissions and cross-examine. That is the point of principle
that we seek to flag up through the
amendment.</div>

							<b class="B">Dan
Rogerson</b> (North Cornwall) (LD): I support the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument for the protection of the right to
cross-examination. He has a lot more experience of that than me, but I
have appeared before a planning inspector as a witness on behalf of a
dedicated band of constituents. I was up against two barristers: one
from the Environment Agency and one from a water company. It was great
fun.</div>
					<a name="080124100000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I stand to speak
to amendment No. 319, which I
tabled.</div>

							<a name="080124100000728"></a>John

						</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s previous
involvement in the process, but does he accept that having fun is not
one of the objectives set out for the IPC in the application
process?</div>

							<a name="080124100000729"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> It may not be the intention, but it will be a
happy by-product.</div>
					<a name="080124100000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
return to the issue of the time that objectors have to participate in
various stages of the process. Based on our previous discussion about
the pre-application stage, I appreciate that the Minister said there
would be an incentive for the applicant to ensure that the consultation
is as thorough as possible to prevent later delay in the application
stage. I can see his point, although it pains me to admit it.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div>
					<a name="080124100000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
application stage, however, it certainly is not in the interests of the
applicant for the objectors to have plenty of time to put their point
across. Amendment No. 319 therefore refers specifically to the period
in which any potential objector has the right to notify the IPC or the
applicant that they want to be heard at an open-floor hearing. That is
a crucial part of the process for the objectors, because it is where
they can get their point across and make their voice heard; if for any
reason, the time scale was not appropriate, it would mean that they
missed out on that chance. That would be hugely to the detriment of any
sense of fairness in ensuring that the application was considered
properly, and anyone who had that experience would be very
disillusioned with the process.</div>
					<a name="080124100000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the Minister agrees
that we should consider a longer time frame for this crucial issue to
ensure that people can appeal to have their views heard at an
open-floor
hearing.</div>
					<a name="080124100000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080124100000730"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Clive Betts</b> (Sheffield, Attercliffe) (Lab): I will speak
briefly to amendment No. 88. I am not convinced by the argument that
everybody and anybody should have the right to cross-examine. It has
been suggested that that right exists now under planning law, but the
vast majority of planning applications are considered by the planning
committees of local authorities, where the right to cross-examine does
not exist. Indeed, the format of procedure that the commission is
likely to adopt will be adopted by committees now. Individuals will be
allowed to state their case and they may be asked questions by members
of the committee&#151;a form of cross-examination&#151;who will
then reach a view.</div>
					<a name="080124100000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is up to the commissioners whether they adopt that form or allow
cross-examination, as the proposal states. However, a category in the
interpretation  clause 92 at the end of chapter 4 specifically
defines a relevant local authority as a recognised &#147;interested
party&#148; throughout the process of the
hearings.</div>
					<a name="080124100000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">To meet
concerns about the potential removal of democratic accountability and
the voice of the people, my amendment recognises that the commission
will conduct the hearings as it so chooses&#151;there is no automatic
right for everyone to cross-examine&#151;but that representations
from local authorities should be treated differently because they are
different and distinct. Therefore, if a local authority representing
its community in a democratic, elected way, asks for the right to
cross-examine, it should be allowed to do so because it is a different
and distinct organisation, as the Bill
recognises.</div>
					<a name="080124100000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000731"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> We discussed most of the issues and principles
that the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst raised at some length
in our debates on parts 1 and 2. I also dealt in detail with some of
his concerns in the memorandum that I submitted to the Committee two
days ago. I shall try to deal with a couple of the main points that he
made when moving his amendment. He is right in his observations about
the present system and the extent to which there are rights at present.
As I have said, rather than simply importing the 2005 rules relating to
major infrastructure and basing a system entirely on them, we are
trying to create a new system of examination for considering nationally
significant infrastructure
projects.</div>
				
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 429</div>
					<a name="080124100000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
the Bill sets out a way of proceeding for the IPC that strengthens the
pre-examination process; tries to identify and deal with issues that
might be contained in the proposals up front rather than leave them to
be argued over at great length in the inquiry stage; draws on a
national policy statement so that matters of policy do not become the
meat and drink of the inquiry; makes much greater use of written
representations while ensuring that oral hearings will be heard when
necessary; and aims to test, probe and assess the evidence through
direct questions led by the IPC rather than by cross-examination. Such
cross-examination is normally conducted by hired third-hands and
lawyers who are only available to those with deep pockets, particularly
in long inquiries. We have already seen and discussed the situation
where even a local authority&#151;the borough of
Hillingdon&#151;ran out of money and was unable to maintain its
involvement in one of the Heathrow
inquiries.</div>
					<a name="080124100000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be
clear about the new rules and the suggestion that they somehow will not
provide a tried, tested and established system and that we should
simply use what is currently in place of the IPC, I suggest that no
major infrastructure project has yet been dealt with under those rules.
As we sit at the start of 2008, we can anticipate that it might well be
2009 before the first major infrastructure project is put forward as an
application, and that would be on the table as a matter to be dealt
with by the Planning Inspectorate under the current system. Therefore,
it is not as if we have a tried, tested and established model that we
could be confident is up to the job.</div>
					<a name="080124100000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Cross-examination might have a
place in hearings and can be a useful method for testing and probing
evidence and ensuring that people&#146;s concerns are properly
established. However, as I have said to the hon. Gentleman, to somehow
equate the right to be heard and have views registered with the right
to cross-examination is to make a profound mistake.</div>
					<a name="080124100000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, cross-examination has
its problems. It can be costly and time consuming, and it can be
difficult to estimate how long that part of the process might take. It
can add to the uncertainty for all involved in any inquiry for which it
is the major method for trying to establish the facts. It can be
legalistic, adversarial and, therefore, intimidating, particularly for
ordinary members of the public who perhaps have neither the experience
nor the access to the sort of resources that are required for
professional cross-examination.</div>
					<a name="080124100000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those reasons, it is
better to have an IPC process that allows for cross-examination but is
nevertheless essentially predicated on the view that the commission
will lead the evidence testing in a similar way to how Select
Committees conduct their business, with which we are familiar as
Members of the House. Of course, the commission will also have access,
should it require it, to additional expert
advice.</div>
					<a name="080124100000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
subject of those who may be subject to compulsory purchase orders as
part of the consent order regime and process for a major project, again
we are taking a slightly different approach to the current system, but
one that helps us to achieve our objectives while ensuring that there
is sufficient reassurance and rights for those who might be affected.
First, the Bill explicitly gives parties subject to CPOs the ability to
trigger an oral hearing, and a right to be heard at that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div>hearing. Secondly, I have talked about cross-examination as one method,
but not necessarily the primary or only method of testing
evidence.</div>
					<a name="080124100000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000732"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> If the property of those parties is likely to be
subject to compulsory acquisition and they are to have the right to an
oral hearing, what mechanism will there be to guarantee them not only
the ability to put their point of view, but to challenge the basis of
the assertion on which compulsory acquisition is sought? It is terribly
important for whatever form we have that someone who may be going lose
their land, perhaps for the greater good, has the chance to challenge.
That, almost invariably, involves testing and probing the evidence
put.</div>
					<a name="080124100000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000733"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> Indeed. I think that I made it clear a moment ago
that the responsibility for testing and probing will rest with and be
led by the commission, but it may involve cross-examination. Clearly,
any party giving evidence at an oral examination would want to try to
ensure that the right questions and testing were undertaken by the
commission. It can use cross-examination if it wishes. The framework
that we have set out emphatically does not rule that out if it is
necessary.</div>
					<a name="080124100000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two principal reasons for which cross-examination might be
necessary. The first helps to address the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point, and the second is equally important. Cross-examination may be
necessary to ensure that adequate testing and representations have been
made to the commission, and an interested party potentially affected by
a CPO may have views on that. However, if cross-examination is
necessary to ensure the representation of interested parties, clause 85
allows that to happen and for the commission to ensure that it happens.
I hope that that is a sufficient
explanation.</div>
					<a name="080124100000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000734"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> The Minister makes it sound reasonable, but we are
concerned that things will not work out that way in practice. That is
why we regard the matter as one of important
principle.</div>
					<a name="080124100000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is suggested that cross-examination is somehow useful only to those
with deep pockets. The reality is that the situation will probably be
the reverse. The ability to cross-examine is likely to be most
important to the little people, as it will probably be the only means
by which they will be able to get their case across and to challenge.
They will not be able to have a detailed written submission put in by
an expert in the same way that the applicants and the big battalions
will be able to do. Their ability to have their say and to ask
questions is probably more important. So it is, in fact, a protection
for the little people, rather than the well
resourced.</div>
					<a name="080124100000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
respect to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe, I do not think
that his first point entirely follows, because the type of applications
that we are talking about are not of the class likely to be considered
by a local authority planning committee. Even in the current situation,
they will invariably be called in and there will be a public inquiry.
Therefore, there would be a hearing of one kind or another. That is the
distinction.</div>
					<a name="080124100000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s other point about local authorities, although
superficially attractive to those of us with backgrounds in local
government, runs into one problem. A situation could occur perfectly
easily in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column431" />Column number: 431</div>which the local authority broadly supports a proposed development, but
it has concerns about certain details and wants to pursue a particular
way of dealing with the development. It has a right to cross-examine,
but members of the local community who do not share its supportive view
are then placed at a disadvantage. There is almost an inequality of
arms created under those circumstances between different classes of
people who are interested parties at the hearing. In a sense, that
disadvantages the little people as opposed to those who are well
resourced. In practice, it might not have the benign effect that I am
sure he intended, which is why we cannot support
him.</div>
					<a name="080124100000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">As it is an
issue of principle&#151;I will not repeat it because we have
crystallised the issue in the way that the hearing would seek to
do&#151;our view is that cross-examination can be sensibly
controlled.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000735"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right: he has crystallised
the issue. Does he not accept that he has done so by testing and
probing the position and the representations that I wish to make to the
Committee, rather than by
cross-examination?</div>
					<a name="080124100000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000736"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> If the hon. Gentleman were putting himself forward
as an expert witness, I might need to cross-examine him in a different
format. It is often said, rightly by those who do rather more of this
work than I ever did at the Bar, that the more expert witnesses there
are&#151;there will be tonnes of experts on these type of
applications&#151;the more the skilled professional is needed to
test, probe and cross-examine. It will not be the little objector who
will be subjected to heavy cross-examination, but the expert witness
for the applicant who will need to be pushed hardest in
cross-examination. It is the little people for whom the measure is most
important. Although we want to see all the controls put in place, which
we have agreed can be done through a different route, we regard this is
as a matter of principle and so will press the matter to a
Division.</div>

						</b> I was doing something dangerous for a man: I was
attempting to multitask while the Minister spoke. I am not sure whether
he addressed my point about time issues. Does he have anything further
to add about the time frame involved in securing the right to an
appeal? I cannot remember the clause, but it is up in the 80s. It has
been grouped with this amendment because we are talking about
open-floor hearings. I would welcome anything that the Minister can say
on that. If he cannot respond, I shall press amendment No. 319 to a
vote because it is a crucial issue. It would be a huge problem if
someone missed out on that fundamental
right.</div>

						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 202, in
clause 45, page 21, line 21, leave
out subsection (4) and
insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4) The Commission
shall disclose a person&#146;s request for advice under subsection
(1) and the advice given under subsection (1) to a person to the public
generally.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="080124100000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment returns to the first issue that we discussed about
transparency and the disclosure of requests for advice. I agree with
the Minister&#146;s points about the importance of transparency and
probity in such cases. It is precisely because we set such store by
that that we believe it should be in the Bill, rather than having the
power as set out in the clause to achieve it by creating regulations.
The transparency issue might give rise to legal challenge and so would
be better spelled out in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="080124100000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
could be circumstances in which objectors or affected parties want to
know what has taken place between the commission and applicants,
particularly when they are drawing up their own cases. I accept that
the Freedom of Information Act 2000 will apply, but sometimes it takes
a long time to get information under that process. I am also concerned
that sometimes applicants might seek to pressure the commission into
not disclosing all of the discussions, sometimes under the guise of
commercial confidentiality. The amendment would strengthen the
Government&#146;s desired position of ensuring that there is the
maximum possible openness about pre-application
discussions.</div>
					<a name="080124100000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
this is a Caesar&#146;s wife point. Because of the important
principle that is involved, we think that it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column433" />Column number: 433</div>would be better for this power to be in the Bill,
rather than it being left to regulations. I am interested in how the
Minister thinks we can guarantee the preservation of these
people&#146;s rights so that they can have access to material

					<a name="080124100000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment deals with a fairly simple point. We do not have a problem
with the basic concept of a notice being served in the way proposed in
the clause, because it is appropriate to obtain such information.
However, the applicants will often be large organisations that are very
well resourced, and they may well be serving notice to very small
organisations or individuals. In fairness, it is not unreasonable for
the recipient of the notice to claim back reasonable costs from the
applicant in such circumstances. We are rightly trying to front-load
much more of the work into the process for the reasons that we have
discussed, but it is a question of equality and
fairness.</div>
					<a name="080124100000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision has the potential to be onerous for a private occupier or
small farmer whose land is affected, if they have to comply fully with
a notice, particularly if there are complications over ownership. In
financial terms, there will be no skin off the nose of the applicant
for a project of that magnitude when set against the overall scheme of
things, but the amendment would do something to redress the balance in
favour of the little people. In particular, it would add to the sense
of fairness that I am sure the Minister wants to achieve in the
commission&#146;s working. I hope that it would not do any damage to
the scheme of the Bill.</div>

the hon. Gentleman accepts that the costs of compliance are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 434</div>likely to be negligible. It would not be reasonable for the commission
to authorise the serving of a notice in circumstances where the
applicant could readily obtain the information by other means, such as
a Land Registry search. In those circumstances, it would not be
reasonable to get them to do so, so I am not sure whether the
amendment, which I suspect is a probing amendment, serves a
particularly useful

Rogerson:
						</b> I return to my recurring theme of time scales,
which we will probably revisit when we debate subsequent clauses. I am
concerned about the imposition of fines. Where there is the potential
for a fine to be imposed, we need to look at the length of time
proposed. As the Bill is drafted, the time scale is 14 days, but
someone could easily miss out if they are on holiday for 14 days. If
that were a problem, it would be fair enough if they got a stern letter
on their return and had to forward the information, but we are talking
about a level 5
fine.</div>
					<a name="080124100000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
for those of us who are uninitiated in the ways of the courts, perhaps
the Minister will confirm what a level 5 fine is. Secondly, does he
feel it appropriate to fine someone just because they happen to have
been away on holiday when the letter landed on their doorstep? I think
that 14 days is far too short a period, so our amendments suggest the
somewhat more generous period of 56 days. The Minister might feel that
that is too long, but perhaps we can reach an accommodation, if he is
prepared to examine the matter and return to it at a future stage. That
would be welcome, because two weeks is a very short period of time,
particularly if people are at risk of incurring a
fine.</div>

than most people, I ought to know what a level 5 fine is, but I must

<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> The hon. Gentleman asked me, but I
could not tell him, so I did not charge him anything&#151;I am sure
that the Minister has the information to hand. My recollection is that
a level 5 fine is at the top end of the scale. I agree that that could
be thought to be onerous, for the reasons that the hon. Gentleman has
set out. If there is scope for accommodation, I commend our figure of
28 days, which is a middle point in the spectrum that is achievable as
a businesslike proposition for the
Minister.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000771"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> First, a level 5 fine is a maximum of
&#163;5,000. Secondly, I do not think it unreasonable to have a
minimum time scale in the Bill, and we judge 14 days to be a good
minimum. The hon. Member for North Cornwall has bid for a fourfold
increase in that amount, and the hon. Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst has bid to double it, but neither of them made a strong
case why the minimum time scale should be
increased.</div>
					<a name="080124100000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of clause 46 is to allow the commission the power to authorise
a promoter or applicant to serve such a notice on the occupier of the
land. Anyone who receives rent for it, manages it, is a mortgagee or
has an interest in the land is required to provide the names and
addresses of people with an interest. That is the purpose, which is
quite narrowly drawn, and not a cause, as far as I can see, for the
level of concern expressed by Liberal Democrat and Tory
Members.</div>

out 14
days?</div>

is a minimum, and the commission can specify a longer time period, if
it judges it to be right in the circumstances. Clause 46 relates to the
notice period that must be given before a right of entry can be
exercised&#151;no more, no less. If hon. Members have a stronger case
to put, then I will, of course, listen, but as things stand, for the
power that the clause bestows, I do not hear the strength of argument
from them that would persuade me that 14 days is not an appropriate
minimum. If the hon. Gentleman wants to press his amendment to a vote,
I shall ask my hon. Friends to

					<a name="080124100000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are talking about 14
days, someone might not receive notification for all sorts of
reasons&#151;they could have gone on holiday or into hospital, and we
have heard about busy times of the year and so on. We can say that 14
days is the minimum and that the maximum fine is &#163;5,000, but, if
we think that either end is extreme, we should change the Bill. We have
to acknowledge that that minimum time period and the maximum fine may
be imposed. We are not necessarily talking about companies or local
authorities; we could be talking about private individuals. The time
scale and fine are tough things to impose on someone in connection with
an application.</div>
					<a name="080124100000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have been having an auction on the number of days, and I am open to
suggestions on a more reasonable minimum. However, we need to take
seriously the possibility that someone could have a &#163;5,000 fine
slapped on them for simply being unable to respond, for whatever
reason, within 14 days, which would be overly onerous. A lengthier
period would not delay an application hugely, and I cannot see a huge
argument against it. I shall withdraw my amendment, but the hon. Member

home, for example, is a significant interference with their legal
rights, such as their rights under the European convention on human
rights. The Government are anxious to comply with that convention,
which should not be ignored, save on the most compelling grounds. That
is why a provision that allows an intrusion into someone&#146;s
private property, albeit for justifiable purposes, should not be
brought into force without the House being able to vote on it. If it
became apparent that there would be a delay in seeing how the 2005
rules work out, we need not wait for that. It is that
interference&#151;perhaps I should have stressed that more in my

					<a name="080124100000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think
that it would be right and proper to apply the same requirements that
currently exist for local authorities to the community generally.
Although there will frequently be an overlap, one can think of many
cases in which representations from members of the community will be of
a different kind to those made by the local authority. That requirement
would not add to the time scale, but it has the useful purpose of
requiring the applicant to apply their mind to the issues raised by
community objections. It is also important that they are seen to apply
their mind to such things, which is a useful discipline that could
result in time being saved later. We also think it right and proper,
and much more consistent with good practice under domestic and European
law, that reasons should be given for the views that applicants
take.</div>
					<a name="080124100000670"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Amendments
Nos. 203 and 204 would extend the requirement to members of the
community. Amendment No. 205 would require the applicant, as well as
taking account of the objections, briefly to set out their responses,
which would demonstrate that the applicant has applied their mind to
what all the consultees have said. They can set out their stance
succinctly, and it need not be an onerous task. That would help with
the crystallisation of issues for the next stage of the process, and it
would help the process to be seen to be fair and
transparent.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman and I share a concern to see
good, thorough consultation as part of this stage of the process of
dealing with applications. If I clarify how the clause works, perhaps
he might be
reassured.</div>
					<a name="080124100000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reference to a &#147;local authority consultee&#148; in subsection
(4) would not prevent other parties from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column439" />Column number: 439</div>submitting representations about how adequate the consultation had been
or mean that the commission could ignore them. Indeed, if someone were
to write to the commission raising concerns about how adequate the
consultation had been, it would be obliged by the basic principles of
administrative law to take that into account in coming to a
decision.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="080124100000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The wording in
clause 49 simply means that representations from the relevant local
authorities about how well the promoter has consulted the local
community should be given particular attention by the IPC for two
reasons. First, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe
pointed out, local authorities have a unique knowledge about their
area, a democratic mandate and experience of how best to ensure that
local people are involved and that their views are taken into account.
We want to ensure that that special experience and knowledge is
captured and made available to the IPC.</div>
					<a name="080124100000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the Bill therefore puts a specific duty on promoters to consult the
relevant local authorities when they are working out how to consult the
local community that may be affected by their proposals. Local
authorities will have been involved in the promoter&#146;s planning
of the pre-application consultation from an early stage. They will know
what the promoter committed to doing during that process and will be in
a strong position to pass judgment and comment on how effective the
consultation has
been.</div>
					<a name="080124100000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those
reasons, it is appropriate that the IPC has regard to the local
authority&#146;s views, as proposed in the clause as
drafted.</div>

						</b> I do not disagree with anything that was said about
local authorities. I spent 16 years on a local authority and I am a
pro-local authority person. However, I do not entirely see why it
should not be practical to look beyond the local authority at other
people, too. The Minister did not respond to the fact that in some
cases, but not in others, the views of the local authority and of the
residents will coincide. I would not want the&#151;perhaps
unintended&#151;consequence of advantaging one set of consultees at
the expense of another, which would be unfair.</div>
					<a name="080124100000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not press the amendment
to a Division, but I hope that before Report the Minister will reflect
on how we can take account of the valued input of local authorities and
also ensure fairness to individuals, residents associations or other
representative groups. If only a small part of a local
authority&#146;s area is directly affected, there may be different
perspectives that should be given equal weight. I beg to ask leave to

Mr. Illsley.</div>
					<a name="080124100000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 179 relates to
the time periods available to objectors in notifying the commission of
their objection. The Bill as drafted specifies 28 days. For the reasons
that we discussed earlier, and may well return to, that may be too
short a period.</div>
					<a name="080124100000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
mindful that the IPC&#146;s work load will be about 40 applications a
year and it may well increase. I would hate it to become very busy, as
lots of applications are submitted in mid to late December and late
July, so people in the community receive notifications at a time of
year when they may be otherwise occupied. That might sound as if I am
cynical and deeply suspicious of these processes, but my reading of the
Bill is that the notification period in clause 50(5) is not up for
negotiation with the commission, but is set by the applicants
themselves.</div>
					<a name="080124100000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I find
it rather odd that the applicant decides how long people have to
register an objection, but if that is to be the case, 28 days is overly
generous to them in dictating that period. I hope that the Minister
will consider the matter again. It is very important, as it is a real
opportunity for people whose concerns have not been met at the
pre-application stage to get involved at the application stage, and to
ensure that all the evidence that they have to bring to bear is put
forward. It is a crucial question, and I hope that he will be slightly
less rigid at this
juncture.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000796"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I do not disagree with the principle of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point. I am always willing to try to be an honest
broker between him and the Minister. If we split the difference in this
case, between 28 and 56, we do indeed arrive at 42 days. That is
perhaps the only logical justification for 42 days that I have yet
heard since it was produced. We may have answered the question of my
right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon, and found a reason,
for once, for the figure of 42 days which is principled as well as
pragmatic.</div>
					<a name="080124100000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to
make a different, although related, point on our amendments, moving
from the time aspect to minimum standards of publicity for the
application. As anyone who has looked at good practice in the planning
field will know, we have adapted what is good 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column441" />Column number: 441</div>practice anyway&#151;giving two consecutive weeks&#146; notice in
the local newspaper and the <i class="I">Gazette</i>, ensuring that it is posted
up in a reasonably convenient location, because one can imagine a large
rural area where getting to the local civic centre is quite a trek for
people, and recognising the right to obtain copies at a reasonable
cost. None of that is in the slightest bit onerous to an applicant for
the sort of applications that we are considering. Perhaps the
Government intend that those things should happen in practice, but our
amendments spell out more specifically rights that are valuable,
especially to the individual concerned. They do not harm the scheme of
the Bill either.</div>
					<a name="080124100000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even
at an advanced hour, there is occasionally the opportunity for a degree
of flexibility and charity. I know that the Minister is a charitable
man at heart. The amendments would be a concession to the smaller
people, which would do no harm at all to the Government&#146;s
objectives, and would not hurt anyone. Against that background, I hope
that he reflects favourably on them.</div>

							<a name="080124100000797"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> We are breaking some interesting political ground
this afternoon. The Tories are triangulating and trying to stake out
common middle ground, and the Liberal Democrats are being
consistent.</div>
					<a name="080124100000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree
with that it is important that people who are affected by an
application have suitable and sufficient time to formulate any
representation that they want to make to the IPC. As things stand, I
believe that 28 days is the appropriate length of time for interested
parties to do that. I will try to explain
why.</div>
					<a name="080124100000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, let us
not forget that, by the time an interested party is formally notified
of an application, they are likely to know a great deal about the
proposals in the application. It is highly unlikely that it will be the
first that they have heard about it, or that it will be the first time
that they turn their mind to it. Instead, the application process will
have been preceded by an extensive period of consultation and
discussion at the pre-application stage, which we considered in part 5.
By the time an application is submitted, people who may be affected
will be well aware of any problems that they could have with it. In
that context, 28 days is an appropriate length of time for them to
respond. Of course, the period can be longer if the applicant thinks it
necessary.</div>
					<a name="080124100000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
hon. Gentleman said, amendments Nos. 264 to 266 would put some minimum
standards for publicising an application in the Bill. I ask him to bear
it in mind that the Bill already allows for the Secretary of State to
make more detailed regulations about how publicity should be carried
out. In particular, subsection (7) gives the Secretary of State powers
to prescribe minimum standards for publicity and
notification.</div>
					<a name="080124100000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 266 would impose a deadline of at least 28 days, by which
representations relating to an application must be submitted. That
would apply to those who are not notified directly by the applicant,
but who respond to the publicity. Regulations are better placed to deal
with the issue in a more detailed way, and they will do so. We have
deliberately allowed for flexibility in the regulations under
subsection (8) so that the deadlines by which people must make their
representations 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column442" />Column number: 442</div>take account of different circumstances. I give the hon. Gentleman the
reassurance that we have no intention of using that flexibility to set
a deadline of fewer than 28
days.</div>

be seen to be fair and objectors might find it somewhat odd if it were

help the commission to do its job. However, if one person is asked to
be the repository for all of that experience and knowledge with regard

<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 444</div>fair, that the Secretary of State should have some involvement in making
that decision and choosing who will serve on that
body.</div>
					<a name="080124100000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
potential issues about people being unhappy with certain commissioners.
We are talking hypothetically about a new body, but the longer
commissioners serve on the panel, the more their track record and
particular areas of expertise will become apparent, and that is an
important part of the process on which someone else can express a view.
On that basis, I hope that that someone would be accountable. I will
not rehearse the debate about how accountable the Secretary of State is
with regard to planning, but it would only be right and proper that the
Secretary of State makes the decision on who would consider each
application.</div>
					<a name="080124100000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
tabled amendments in this group that deal with the ability of the local
authority to be consulted on that. A local authority will have people
in its planning department who keep a close eye on the track record of
individual commissioners and might have a view on what each
commissioner could bring to the panel. That does not mean that they
could be chosen because an interest might incline them to be for or
against an application, but because they have reassured the local
community through their local authority that they have the broad range
of skills necessary to consider a complicated application. Therefore, I
think that the Bill would benefit from the ability of the local
authority to have some input in that decision.</div>
					<a name="080124100000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
concerns about the use of single commissioners, but we will no doubt
return to that when we deal with later clauses. I would, however, be
interested to hear the Minister&#146;s justification for having an
internal decision within the commission to decide whom to appoint to
each project. There could be a perception that unfortunate things were
going on within the commission, so it would be more transparent to have
the Secretary of State make that decision. The basis behind the
amendments is that the Secretary of State should be responsible for
allocating the personnel to consider each application and that the
local authority, in particular, should be able to contribute to that
decision.</div>

							<a name="080124100000804"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I broadly support the thrust of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s comments and associate myself with them. I also hope
that the Minister, in his response, can assist us a little more by
fleshing out the sort of circumstances in which it is envisaged that
the single commissioner procedure would be used, because I share the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s misgivings about it We have flagged that up
earlier in debate, so I will not repeat it now. However, I would like
to note just what the Minister sees as the justification for it, in
what circumstances it would be used and what the practical effects
will.</div>
					<a name="080124100000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080124100000805"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Curry</b> (Skipton and Ripon) (Con): I am also a little
bothered about that. The principle of the Bill is to isolate certain
questions relating to large infrastructure projects and the purpose of
the commission is to bring together a range of expertise. The Minister
said that that had to cover expertise in human relation and in dealing
with communities as well as expertise on the material substance of
project, such as nuclear or transport issues. Therefore, unless 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 445</div>we will have a renaissance man or woman on the panel, a single person
will find it difficult to have the necessary range of expertise, which
is very wide. There is social as well as technical and economic
expertise that will deliver this. I find it almost a contradiction in
terms to set up a commission specially to handle these large projects
and then to say that one person can deal with it. That seems
curious.</div>
					<a name="080124100000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
commissioners can be taken ill. If there is a single panel and that
person becomes ill or is involved in an accident or has pressing
personal circumstances, it is unreasonable that the whole process
should be halted while that is sorted out. Nor would it be possible to
ferry in a new commissioner to do it without having to recapitulate all
the evidence because otherwise it would be wide open to legal
challenge. Surely it makes sense on the pure grounds of an insurance
policy to have a number of commissioners so that if one of them has an
accident, is taken or there is a problem, the other commissioners can
carry on without there being any doubts about the range of expertise
that is still available to the trial. I presume there will be some
rules at some stage about what happens if a commissioner has to be
absent from some parts of a proceeding and whether they can come back
and carry on or would have to count themselves
out.</div>
					<a name="080124100000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly as the
hon. Member for North Cornwall said, commissioners will inevitably
begin to acquire individual reputations. Planning inspectors have
individual reputations now. People ask, &#147;Who are we going to be
heard by?&#148; They do have different performances. People will
inevitably prefer one commissioner over another because they seem more
sympathetic and deal with matters in a different way. It is equally
important that there should never be any taint that the person
appointed should have some particular affinity with the sector that is
being dealt with. All those three items seem to indicate that we might
have a streamlined panel, but there has to be a minimum range of
expertise to enable it to carry on in the circumstances in which events
of one sort or another buffet
it.</div>
					<a name="080124100000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister may
say that in the early stages there would be no question of a single
panel with a single commissioner. But precedents will be set and there
will be the first cases. I am sure that it will make sense for the
early cases to be heard by a group of commissioners, not least so that
a sort of case law is built up and established practice is built up in
which people have confidence. By the time they are getting their 56th
application for a nuclear power station, which is a long way down the
line, they could say that so many other decisions have been taken that
it takes on more of a routine and predictable character.</div>
					<a name="080124100000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">There again one runs into the
objections from objectors who say, &#147;Hang on. This is our
application. This is my backyard and I am concerned about that.&#148;
I should be grateful if the Minister could outline in what
circumstances a single commissioner would hear the entire case. Would
that be down the line when a significant body of case law had been
built up? What would be the provision if that single commissioner were
incapacitated so that the proceedings were brought to a halt or
significantly delayed?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000806"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> Clauses 53 to 58 are essentially about the powers
and role of the chair in putting together 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column446" />Column number: 446</div>either a single commissioner or a panel in which to make applications
and also in the freedom in certain circumstances to make changes to the
arrangements. The hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst and the right
hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon asked about the circumstances in
which a single commissioner may hear an application. It is certainly
the case that many of the major infrastructure projects will be
complex. They will be major applications and will need to be looked at
by a panel of commissioners but a range of smaller or less complex
projects will be heard by the IPC under the framework of this
Bill.</div>
					<a name="080124100000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked
for specific examples. Two might suffice in this context. They could be
smaller projects on the strategic road network or electricity
transmission and distribution system. Such projects may not be
particularly large or complex&#151;for example, they may be
improvements to a key road junction&#151;but because they are
critical to the operational effectiveness of the network as a whole
they are nevertheless of national significance and therefore a matter
for the IPC. We considered in parts 3 and 4 what constitutes a
nationally significant infrastructure
project.</div>

							<a name="080124100000807"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I accept that there will by comparison be
schemes that are smaller than others. However, by their very nature if
they are of nationally significant importance they will be bigger than
the average planning application to the local authority. There will be
people in the area who are affected by them who will be interested in
who will determine the application, as the right hon. Member for
Skipton and Ripon said. What I am trying to say is that it is all
relative. Does the Minister
agree?</div>
					<a name="080124100000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000808"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> No. It is not all relative. It is not a matter of
size. Projects may be appropriately determined by a single commissioner
not because they are big or particularly complex but because they are
part of infrastructure such as an electricity or road network that is
of national significance. That is what brings them into the ambit of
the IPC. However, some applications could be heard by a single
commissioner and not require the sort of commission panel that an
application for a new nuclear power station, for example, might
justify.</div>

							<a name="080124100000809"></a>Mr.
Curry:
						</b> The Minister and I both represent Yorkshire
constituencies, so I assume that we are equally familiar with the A1.
The hon. Gentleman, and you, Mr. Illsley, will know that
there are three major roundabout improvements in north Nottinghamshire
and south Yorkshire, which are intended to solve a problem that I have
never encountered in all the time I have been driving up and down the
A1. Are those projects key small parts of a national network? How would
the Minister classify them? If applications for those roundabout
improvements were made after the Bill became law, how would he classify
them in terms of their relationship to the A1, which has been a
national link since the Romans built
it?</div>
					<a name="080124100000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000810"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The right hon. Gentleman would not expect me to
pre-empt a decision on a hypothetical situation. The A1 is clearly a
network of major national significance, but how an application or
project 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column447" />Column number: 447</div>may be treated will be determined by the criteria set out in the Bill
rather than in view of any observation that I might
make.</div>
					<a name="080124100000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill provides that projects can be examined by a single commissioner
who would not take the decision alone but submit a report with
recommendations to the council of the commission. In all circumstances
a group of commissioners rather than a single commissioner would take
the decision for the commission.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000811"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> The council then becomes a more crucial body,
which we have not explored in depth. Can the Minister confirm that the
council would be chaired by the chair of the commission? There is a
facility in this part of the Bill for the chair of the commission, who
has a vital role in the commission as it is currently structured, to
appoint himself&#151;or herself&#151;to be the person who considers
that application. The chairman takes a decision to appoint himself to
be the single commissioner, then conducts the inquiry, handles the
application, makes the recommendation and chairs the commission as
well. That might be a rare, hypothetical situation, but it is
possible.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000812"></a>John

						</b> A chair who adopted all those roles would have to
be a super-workaholic. It is likely to be the proper role for the chair
to chair the council or, in some circumstances, that could be
undertaken by one of the deputy chairs of the commission.</div>
					<a name="080124100000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose that underpins
these clauses is ensuring that we have a way of considering any
application that is proportionate to the complexity and the demands of
the
case.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="080124100000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the
question of appointments being a matter for the commission. I will
explain why I take the view that they should be a matter for the
commission rather than for the Secretary of State, as proposed by the
hon. Gentleman. Under the circumstances in which an application would
be received, the commission and, in particular, the chair of the
commission will be much better placed than the Secretary of State to
make decisions about whether it should be handled by a panel or by a
single commissioner, and, subsequently, whether it would be
appropriate, for example, to switch to a panel rather than a single
commissioner. Adding to the Bill the requirement for a statement of
those reasons would be adding a paper
exercise.</div>
					<a name="080124100000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s central point is that it should be the Secretary of
State and not the chair of the commission who should make such
decisions. I think that the Secretary of State would accept that they
do not know the details of each particular case. The commission will
have all the documentation, including the reports on the
pre-application consultation; it will know the issues that need to be
resolved; it will know how complex the issues are; and, from the
experience that it will build up, it will have a good sense of the
appropriate way of dealing with such issues. In practice, if it were up
to the Secretary of State to take such decisions, they would almost
certainly have to rely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column448" />Column number: 448</div>on the advice of the commission. In addition, these are essentially
practical decisions and so not appropriate for the Secretary of
State.</div>
					<a name="080124100000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
question of appointments, it is our intention that every commissioner
will be capable of considering each and every application, whether as a
member of a panel or as a single commissioner. The correct role for the
Secretary of State within that system is surely to appoint members of
the commission who have the right qualities. That is the role that
schedule 1 will  give
them.</div>
					<a name="080124100000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is rightly a matter for the chair of the commission to decide which
member or members should handle a particular case, subject to the
provisions of clause 62 about applications in Wales. The chair of the
commission will be the chief executive. They will know which
commissioners are available to handle a new application; whether any
commissioners have experience that would be valuable; and about any
interests that commissioners have that will prevent them from
considering an application. It is for those reasons that we are placing
this power and this responsibility with the commission rather than the
Secretary of State. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept those
reasons.</div>

							<a name="080124100000813"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I was hoping that the Minister would help on the
other point that was raised by my right hon. Friend about what will
happen if a single commissioner is in some way incapacitated. That is
not a fanciful situation. A few years back, there was some publicity of
a long and complicated copyright case in the High Court. The judge
reserved judgment and died before he had given his final judgment. How
would we deal with such
circumstances?</div>

and the right hon. Gentleman look at clause 74, it has provision to
deal with such
circumstances.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000815"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for taking the
time to consider the amendments. I am not entirely convinced by what he
is saying about the Secretary of State having to rely on the advice of
the commission. In other debates, we have heard about instances in
which the Secretary of State under the current regime has decided not
to go along with the advice of the Planning Inspectorate on individual
applications. The Secretary of State does have his or her own mind.
That issue should be considered together with what we have said about
the local authority being able to express a view as to the suitability
of a particular commissioner. The local authority is acting not in a
vacuum, but as the representative of the local community, so it can put
forward the views of the local community to the Secretary of State in
those
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="080124100000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has sought to advance the principle throughout the Bill that
the framework for considering decisions on policy, structure, and
regulation is set by democratically accountable politicians, through
the relevant Department, the Secretary of State, the Ministers and
secondary legislation. The decisions take place within that structure.
One can argue that that is the distinction and that it stacks
up.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column449" />Column number: 449</div>
					<a name="080124100000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
would argue that the decision on who the commissioners are could be
regarded as a political one, and, therefore, it ought to rest with the
Secretary of State and the person who is setting the framework within
which the decision will be taken. For that reason, I am of the opinion
that it could be an important question later
on.</div>
					<a name="080124100000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
may have the opportunity, as we look at other clauses and hold stand
part debates, to consider the notion of the single commissioner, and
whether it is an appropriate mechanism for hearing an application. The
question of who sits on the panel is crucial, and if the decision is
taken among the members of the commission, it could bring the whole
process into question. I certainly do not want that to happen.
Therefore, I seek the Committee&#146;s leave to press the amendment
to a
division.</div>

							<a name="080124100000816"></a>Mr.
Curry:
						</b> I have not been able to resist the temptation of
looking at clause 74, and it helped, although not that much. It states
that if a new commissioner takes over, they can pretend that they were
the old commissioner:</div>
					<a name="080124100000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the new single Commissioner may,
so far as may be
appropriate&#148;&#151;</div>

Commissioner as done by or in relation to the new single
Commissioner.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080124100000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the next clause, it states that the commissioner is under an obligation
to ensure that he knows what he is talking about. At the very least,
there will have to be an interval in which the new commissioner reads
himself or herself in. The nature of the applications is such that that
will not be done in a weekend with a wet towel. It could cause a
significant
delay.</div>
					<a name="080124100000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, people
who are concerned about an application will be given a soft target in
being able to say, &#147;Well, the new commissioner did not
understand all that happened in the past. They seem to have missed
crucial things.&#148; It suggests that one should be very cautious
before taking the risk of going to a single commissioner, as opposed to
three, for example. I think that it is something to return

						</b> May I own up to the Committee, Mr.
Illsley? We have spotted a loophole. We did not spot it earlier, but we
have spotted it now, and the amendments are designed to close it. I
hope that if I briefly explain to Members what the loophole is, they
will agree that the amendments are appropriate. It involves a curious
situation that could arise. Clauses 59 and 73 could allow an
ex-commissioner to opt to prolong their term of office until the end of
a particular examination, regardless of whether or not they had been
removed from that examination by the chair&#151;in other words, even
though they were no longer conducting or involved in the examination.

would be treated as a commissioner, paid a salary and any other

						</b> Sadly, I grew up in Cornwall at a time when the
language was not receiving funding and was not available in school. I
am sure that the Minister is following the debate on a single written
form, which will allow it to be pushed out into schools in the
community a lot more. However, the amendment relates to the Welsh
language, which has a significant and growing community that includes
not only those who use it as a second language, but those who use it as
their first language. That is the
point.</div>
					<a name="080124100000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
have been debates and Bills in this place and consideration in the
courts about the use of the Welsh language and the ability of people to
be cross-examined in Welsh and to have their case heard by a
Welsh-speaking jury. Where we are discussing provisions for the Welsh
Assembly to advise on the appointment of members to the commission, it
would be beneficial for one of those members to have an understanding
of the Welsh language. We have already heard about the many wind farm
applications in north Wales, and there may be other significant
projects that fall within the provisions of the Bill and that are heard
by the commission. I am sure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column452" />Column number: 452</div>that it would benefit those people who have Welsh as their first
language to be able to give evidence in Welsh. I hope that the Minister

							<a name="080124100000848"></a>Mr.
Curry:
						</b> On a point of information, Mr. Illsley.
European regulations, which are printed in all sorts of different
languages, can sometimes lead to great confusion simply because one
concept does not translate easily into another language. For example,
the German word &#147;Raum&#148; is not the same as the English
word &#147;room&#148;, and I remember that huge problems arose with
the regulations concerning the slaughter of poultry on the question
whether rooms had to be provided for vets or whether there simply had
to be spaces. If there is a dispute between the Welsh and the English,
which text will take
precedence?</div>
					<a name="080124100000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080124100000849"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Jones</b> (Clwyd, West) (Con): I feel constrained to
make a contribution to this debate. Over the years, the Conservative
party has shown its adherence to and support for the Welsh language.
The Conservative party piloted the Welsh Language  Act 1993
through Parliament, so we yield to no one in our support for the Welsh
language. My concern is not that the commissioner should, so far as is
possible, be able to speak Welsh; it is just a question of
capacity.</div>
					<a name="080124100000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
talking about appointing commissioners who are experts in their
individual fields. Wales is a small, but highly talented nation.
Unfortunately, the number of fluent Welsh language speakers who are of
working age is relatively small. Among their number are some
distinguished hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Meirionnydd
Nant Conwy and the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth. I
am concerned that it may be difficult to find a sufficient pool of, for
example, Welsh-speaking nuclear engineers to form part of the panel.
Welsh-speaking nuclear engineers would probably find it far more
profitable to be employed as expert witnesses rather than as
commissioners. Although I sympathise with the thrust of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment, in practice it is probably
unattainable.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000850"></a>Alun
Michael:
						</b> This is probably an attempt by the Liberal
Democrats to look positive and sympathetic about the Welsh language,
which is always welcome, but it is inappropriate in these
circumstances. The fact of the matter is that, because of the greater
use of Welsh in a variety of circumstances, such as court and tribunal
proceedings, public bodies in Wales are used to dealing with the
language and ensuring that that is done appropriately. I hope that the
Minister will tell us that, in accordance with the modern requirement
for public bodies to have policies on how to deal with the Welsh
language, the new body will always look at making it possible for
people to give evidence in the language of their choice and for
appropriate arrangements to be made, if a commissioner were to need
that capacity.</div>
					<a name="080124100000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
the hon. Member for North Cornwall that the important thing is to have
the right people in place with the right competencies, rather than
having artificial constraints on the appointment of commissioners. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column453" />Column number: 453</div>The issue is more about how things have changed over the years, in part
because education has developed over many years.</div>
					<a name="080124100000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Clwyd,
West has mentioned the Conservative party&#146;s support for the
Welsh Language Act 1993. The increased use of the language in areas
where it was not previously available or spoken is largely due to the
considerable generosity of Labour authorities, often in
non-Welsh-speaking areas, in promoting the teaching of Welsh over many
years.</div>
					<a name="080124100000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point is
that the artificial limitation proposed for the appointment of
commissioners is inappropriate. I hope that we will hear from the
Minister that appropriate provision will be made for Welsh in those
arrangements, as in all others.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Elfyn Llwyd</b> (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC): May I first
apologise for not being present at the beginning of the debate? The
right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth made the point well
that, as a public body, the new body must have a Welsh language policy.
Therefore, the points that concern the hon. Member for North Cornwall
will be dealt with within that
body.</div>

							<a name="080124100000852"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> Clause 62 will ensure, as hon. Members have
recognised, that as far as is reasonably practical, any panel that
considers an application for a major project in Wales will have among
its members a commissioner who has been nominated by Welsh Ministers.
We have said that there will be two or three such commissioners, or a
commissioner whom Welsh Ministers are content should be considered in
that way.</div>
					<a name="080124100000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would add a third option, so that a member of the panel
would be able to speak Welsh. We all agree that it would be excellent
if at least one member of a panel considering a Welsh application were
able to speak Welsh and to understand anyone who wished to be heard in
that language. However, it is extremely likely that one of the criteria
that any Welsh Minister will want to consider when nominating a
potential member of the commission will be the ability to speak Welsh.
We will discuss that matter with Welsh Ministers when we come to
specify in our advertisements the skills and competencies that we are
looking for in potential applicants. In the spirit of devolution, I
think that that is something that the Committee should leave in the
hands of Welsh Ministers. Well intentioned as the amendments are, I am
not sure that they would either add flexibility in appointing
commissioners or, in the case of a panel or single commissioner
considering an application in Wales, ensure that someone is found with
the right skills for the job.</div>

							<a name="080124100000853"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that reply and
to all hon. Members who have given me the benefit of their experience,
particularly the three former Welsh Ministers who have participated in
the debate. The amendment is not an attempt to make a political point
for the Liberal Democrats; it is a personal point, as I am a great
supporter of all the Celtic languages, and wherever I see the
opportunity to try and promote them, I will. In passing, I will mention
that my mother is Welsh, although she is an English 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column454" />Column number: 454</div>speaker from the valleys. I was also at university in Aberystwyth, where
I had the benefit of hearing the Welsh language in action a great
deal.</div>
					<a name="080124100000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept what
the Minister is saying. We do not want to fetter too greatly the Welsh
Ministers in deciding whom they would like to recommend. However, we
have added to the list of qualities that the special people whom the
Government will seek must have. The issue of social skills was raised
earlier. When considering applications in Welsh, an important
consideration could be that the candidate can understand contributions
made by members of the public and objectives in both languages that are
in common use in Wales. I certainly will not push the matter to a vote,
but I am glad that we have had this debate and that the Minister has
considered the importance of the Welsh
language.</div>

					<a name="080124100000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is simple. It would not damage the Bill or obstruct what the
Government are trying to achieve in any way, but it would mean that
people concerned about individual commissioners taking individual views
would have the evidence in front of them. It may help the Government,
because it would help to allay any fears by showing that there is no
bias and that the commissioners are considering each individual
application on its merits, with no trends developing at all. It could
work both ways, but whichever way it works, I cannot see how it would
be anything other than helpful, and I therefore hope that the Minister
will consider taking it on
board.</div>

Curry:
						</b> I normally find myself in agreement with my Cornish
friend, and the fact that this time I am not sure that I do probably
means that the Minister is about to accept the amendment. If the
commission is to work, it must operate on the basis of collective
responsibility, which means that the decisions must be indivisible. The
trouble is that if commissioners get a reputation for voting in a
particular way, like the Bank of England&#146;s Monetary Policy
Committee, the minute that they are appointed to a case, the first
thing that will happen is that their past history will be wheeled out
and presumptions made about how they are likely to react.</div>
					<a name="080124100000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">I see the
obvious attractions of recording and publicising votes, but I also see
the drawbacks in terms of developing collective wisdom, with individual
commissioners being separated out and comments being made about the
appropriateness of certain appointments to carry out certain tasks. It
is a conundrum to which, happily, I am not in the position of having to
provide an answer, but the Minister is, and I am interested to know
what it is.</div>

						</b> All members of the Committee accept that, as far
as possible, the commissioners sitting on a panel will operate best if
they operate collectively, reflecting the equal role of the members and
the skills that they bring to the table in consideration of any
particular application. At the same time, there are circumstances in
which commissioners will disagree, and it may be that a vote on a
decision will be necessary in order to avoid a deadlock. In those
circumstances, a panel would take a decision by a majority and the lead

<div class="Column"><a name="Column456" />Column number: 456</div>commissioner&#151;the commissioner chairing the panel&#151;would
have a casting vote, if there were a tie.</div>
					<a name="080124100000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">In order to
avoid confusion, significant splits and some of the drawbacks outlined
by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, the Bill provides that
once a decision has been taken, in the spirit of the ambition to see
the panel and the commission operating collectively, all members of the
panel will be bound by collective responsibility. The proposal to
record and publicise votes in such circumstances would undermine that
principle. I hope that the hon. Member for North Cornwall will not
press the amendment to a
vote.</div>

						</b> I understand the argument put forward by both
the Minister and the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon. However,
it depends where one is coming from on this issue. If we want the
commission to build up the reputation that the Minister is talking
about, it might help to have a collective responsibility, which is
unfashionable nowadays. My concern is that such allegations will be
made anyway. If two or three members of a panel are looking at an
application within a certain sector, it may well be that, because of
their expertise, they find themselves on another panel considering
another application of a similar type. People will start to read into
that. They may say, &#147;Mr. Smith was on the last panel
and that decided that, and this one has decided that.&#148; It might
help if people can base whatever they say on evidence rather than
supposition. I do not think that we can stop potential criticism of the
panel. It is more likely to be unfounded or founded on supposition
rather than the facts. I will not press the amendment to a vote, but
there could be concerns about opacity in the decision taking of a
commission or a
panel.</div>

					<a name="080124100000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">To delete
clause 70 would have a fairly drastic effect on the function of the
single commissioner. As far as I can see, single commissioners should
not be considering applications of national importance. Having moved
away from the issue of democratic accountability, I will not go over
again the arguments about whether the infrastructure planning
commission is a beneficial part of the Bill, but I will say that if we
are going to have such applications considered, it should be done by a
group of commissioners rather than a single
one.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000876"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I am somewhat torn between both arguments. On
balance, however, the practical potential impact of having a single
commissioner who is sick or who has to pull back from presiding
overrides the argument that the Minister makes for what is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column457" />Column number: 457</div>relatively small application. Evidence was cited to us about the north
Yorkshire grid application and substations being held up for many years
for all sorts of reasons. Even a small application for a substation
would be affected.</div>
					<a name="080124100000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have also been given an
example about roundabouts on the A1. It may be no surprise that I, too,
am familiar with those roundabouts. I can imagine that any proposal to
replace them with whatever might be the right solution at those
junctions would be controversial. There is an interesting debate to be
had on whether such projects are of national significance and whether
it is more appropriate for the IPC or the Planning Inspectorate to deal
with them. If such projects are to be classified as projects of
national significance, and they are controversial, then however speedy
the process could be under the system that we are trying to achieve
with our amendments or under the Government&#146;s system, we need
more than one commissioner on even the smallest project.</div>
					<a name="080124100000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">The likely consequence is that
although the number of applications might stay the same, the number of
applications that the commission can deal with in a year will go down.
That backs up the arguments that we have long made that the number of
commissioners appointed and the deadlines that are implied will clog up
the system and not speed up the decision-making process. I therefore
support the objection of the hon. Member for North Cornwall to the
clause and will join him in voting against it.</div>

commissioners to receive a note saying, &#147;Dear commissioners, you

							<a name="080124100000897"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> &#147;Frivolous&#148; refers to a
representation that the person who is making it knows in advance has no
merit. The amendment would make it unclear whether the IPC is required
to consider frivolous representations during the examination of an
application. Although we all share the aim of ensuring that IPC
examinations are thorough, efficient and accurate, we should agree that
frivolous representations, which may be irrelevant, pointless or
patently of no merit, have no place in the system. I hope that the hon.
Gentleman is reassured that the IPC should not use that as a means of
excluding people from submitting evidence that has merit. Were it to
try to do so, the normal procedures of administrative law would apply
to the IPC, just as they do to any other public body. Those who believe
that their evidence has been unreasonably disregarded in that respect
could also make use of the mechanisms for legal challenge set out in
clause
104.</div>
					<a name="080124100000447"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments Nos. 378, 379 and 383 to 385 would strengthen the
thoroughness of the IPC&#146;s examination by ensuring that parties
do not try to wreck the proceedings by using vexatious representations.
They are consequential amendments to clauses 92 and 96 and were tabled
to ensure consistency throughout the Bill in the treatment of vexatious
representations. It should not be too difficult for the IPC to identify
when representations become vexatious&#151;there will be a large
quantity of repetitive, burdensome and unwarranted representations in
which the intention is not so much to explain the issues as to try to
do down or subdue the other parties.</div>
					<a name="080124100000448"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government amendment No. 382
concerns a different matter. As the hon. Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst has pointed out, it will allow the Secretary of State to
prescribe the form and manner of a relevant representation for the
purposes of clause 92 to facilitate the clear and efficient
communication of information and objections. The amendment would ensure
that the IPC can quickly identify the key issues that underline an
application in order to concentrate its examination on the most
important and relevant underlying
issues.</div>
					<a name="080124100000449"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
standardised method of communicating representations could also make
the examination of the main issues more effective, which is the purpose
of the amendment. There will, of course, be consultation before we
finalise the proposals, and although it may be possible for the IPC to
specify those things through its own procedural rules and powers, it is
appropriate in this case that the Secretary of State should specify 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column460" />Column number: 460</div>them rather than the IPC. The reason is that the
decision whether a representation is relevant is the gateway to a
participant being included as an interested party to the examination
with the rights to be heard that flow from that. The hon. Member for
Bromley and Chislehurst is nodding his head, and I think that he
recognises the significance of the
amendment.</div>

						</b> We seek clarification on clause 79, and we return
to the important issue of cross-examination once again. Amendment No.
409 would insert the word &#147;or&#148;, which may not seem much
in itself, but it deals with the compulsory purchase element of the
matter, and we think that it would provide greater clarification.

No. 410, to move on slightly, would leave out from

danger of somebody saying, &#147;I want to go on to the merits of
nuclear power, beyond what the national policy statement says.&#148;

Neill:
						</b> May I say, Mr. Illsley, how grateful I
am to you for your perspicacious decision to adjourn the Committee for
a short
time?</div>
					<a name="080124100000468"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I can deal with the amendments quite briefly. It is clear to
anyone that they are on compulsory purchase. Taken together, amendments
Nos. 409 and 410 would reverse the exclusion from the ambit of the
clause of issues relating to compensation for the compulsory
acquisition of land, so that they are not disregarded by the examining
authority. The subsequent amendments follow that pattern elsewhere in
the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="080124100000469"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason for that is the importance to the individual of the compulsory
acquisition of land. It seems right that an individual should be
entitled to make representations to the authority examining such a
proposal to protect the small person who may have real worries about
it. If the Minister can reassure me that there are other mechanisms by
which such problems can be satisfactorily vented, I shall be interested
to hear
them.</div>
					<a name="080124100000470"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Government are saying that compensation is irrelevant and not to be
regarded, how can that be reconciled with the provision elsewhere in
the Bill that one ground for departing from a national policy statement
is if the local impact would outweigh the benefit? That is a balancing
act. If it is decided that that the impact of a proposal outweighs its
benefit, surely the financial consideration might be significant. A man
might come along and say, &#147;This will put a firm out of
business&#148;. It is not unreasonable to seek some quantification on
that. What is the rationale for the argument that compensation should
be excluded? Will the exclusion be automatic, or will the examining
authority have discretion, as appears to be the case? If so, how will
that discretion be
exercised?</div>
					<a name="080124100000471"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000906"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> Am I right in thinking that the reason for striking
out compensation for compulsory acquisition of land from the ambit of
the clause is so that the Lands Tribunal can continue its operation as
the main avenue through which land acquisition compulsory payments are
discussed if there is a default on an agreement? I am trying to assist,
because I, too, am a bit bemused. I suspect that that may be the
reason&#151;so that the Lands Tribunal remains intact as a
body.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000907"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
valuable and helpful point. If that is right, which it may well be,
does he think that it runs contrary to the idea of having all the
consents brought
together?</div>
					<a name="080124100000473"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000908"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> That was one of my concerns. The hon. Gentleman is
right to raise the matter, and I am glad that he has. Perhaps, in due
course, the Minister could address that apparent conundrum and confirm
whether it is intended that the Lands Tribunal will operate as it
currently does when compulsory acquisitions of land have to be
effected.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column462" />Column number: 462</div>

							<a name="080124100000909"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> Perhaps I can come to the concerns of the hon.
Gentleman and the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst in a moment.
I hope that I shall be able to deal decisively with
them.</div>
					<a name="080124100000475"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important
not to overlook amendment No. 429 or let it pass without comment. It is
designed to prevent the IPC from refusing to allow representations at
hearings if it considers that they relate to the merits of policy as
set out in the national policy statement.</div>
					<a name="080124100000476"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
discussed at some length, particularly in part 2, the importance and
benefit of Ministers setting out a clear policy framework in a national
policy statement, which will be extensively consulted upon and subject
to scrutiny in this House. There has been a general recognition that
there is merit in moving away from the current situation in which
applications and hearings are possible in which the questions of policy
are reopened and examined during the course of the inquiry. I do not
want that to be the case or risk with the
IPC.</div>
					<a name="080124100000477"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall turn to the concerns raised by the hon. Members for Bromley and
Chislehurst and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. The Bill prevents
individuals from making representations about the levels of
compensation that they should receive for being compelled to sell
individual pieces of land, or their interests in it. The amendments
would alter that position. I tried to explain this when I gave evidence
to the Committee. If there is a dispute about the levels of
compensation for the compulsory purchase of pieces of land, it is a
matter for the Lands Tribunal, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant
Conwy surmised, not for the IPC. Nor is it a matter for the Secretary
of State if he, and not the IPC, took the decision on a particular
application.</div>
					<a name="080124100000478"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the other hand, amendment No. 412, relating to clause 109, touches on a
different question. If individual levels of compensation rightly remain
a matter for the Lands Tribunal, it is appropriate and
necessary&#151;on reflection I hope that Members will
agree&#151;that the IPC can include in an order granting the
development consent a provision to ensure that the legislation relating
to the assessment of compensation applies to it. It is also appropriate
that compensation for land compulsorily purchased is assessed on the
same basis as generally applies. That is a provision to ensure that
compensation is assessed in accordance with the Land Compensation Act
1973 or the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.</div>
					<a name="080124100000479"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, Members know that I
have a lot of sympathy with the aim to create a single consent regime,
with the intention that promoters can include the totality of their
proposed work in a single application. In many cases, applicants will
include in their application works connected to the operational
effectiveness of the new facilities, such as connections to the
national electricity network for a new power station. An electricity
undertaker in such a situation might need to acquire land at some
distance from the power station to put up pylons or as a means to gain
access for overhead line maintenance. The clause simply enables such
compulsory purchase provisions to be included in applications for
development
consent.</div>
					<a name="080124100000480"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment No. 419 would remove the need for the IPC to be satisfied
that there was a compelling need in the public interest for land to be
compulsorily purchased. I assume that it is either a probing amendment
or a drafting deficiency. Surely Members 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column463" />Column number: 463</div>would want the IPC to have the ability to issue compulsory purchase
orders only, and would not want it to do so without having to be sure
that there was a case for it in the first
place.</div>
					<a name="080124100000481"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that my
comments have been useful and that Members do not feel the need to
press their
amendments.</div>

which a single commissioner is examining a case, and then the council

Minister prolonged the whole inquiry because he made a calculated or an

						</b> The hon. Lady must bear in mind that we will be in
an entirely different situation from the one that exists currently. The
IPC will only consider and determine applications in which a national
policy statement is already in place. It will be the national policy
statement that will be the primary framework within which any of the
applications will be considered and determined. Therefore, the
situation would not be the same as the example that she
cites.</div>

application may also be submitted in circumstances in which the IPC is
set up and in which there is no national policy statement in place. In
those circumstances, the IPC will be responsible for examining an
application but will then report to the Secretary of State, who will
then take a decision. In that case, the panel or the single
commissioner will have up to six months to complete the examination
followed by three months to prepare their report and recommendations to
the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State will then have a further
three months to take the
decision.</div>

						</b> Perhaps my chronology is wrong, but given the

quickly.</div>

exactly the same. It will take longer if the IPC&#151;whether a
single commissioner or a panel&#151;is conducting an examination but
has to make recommendations to the Secretary of State, who will then
take the decision. That will add a further three months to the

						</b> Does the Minister accept that if one is to have a

scheme that links bits of the network, it is curious that it should
take as long as appointing a full panel? I thought the whole idea was
to get on with the job.</div>

Gentleman&#146;s problem is. I am describing the limits that will
apply to each stage of the process. I am not prescribing how long each
stage will take. He may be right that the rather more straightforward
cases&#151;ones being considered by a single commissioner&#151;may
not take as long as others, but the limits will be the same.</div>

State of his decision and the reasons for it, and set them out in the
commission&#146;s annual report. If the Secretary of State is the
decision maker, he, too, may extend the deadline for the decision. In

Secretary of State in some circumstances, should take account of the
national policy statements. We discussed in an earlier sitting the
importance of those statements and how they would shape, and in many
cases determine, the decisions that are eventually reached by the
commission on particular
applications.</div>
					<a name="080124100000594"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 330 would give greater responsibility to the commissioner or the
Secretary of State to look at other relevant information. While the
Bill allows the commission or the Secretary of State the discretion to
look at other matters that they think are important and relevant, there
should be a requirement for them to consider planning policy
statements. Those give the Government&#146;s guidance on planning
that any local authority would have to follow in coming to a decision
about a planning application. I cannot see any good reason why similar
consideration should not be given by the commissioner or the Secretary
of State in cases where they make the
decisions.</div>
				
					<a name="080124100000688"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div>
					<a name="080124100000595"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also seems
to me that there should be regard for local development plans when any
application is before the commission. The local development framework
will be a document on which there has been thorough consultation and it
will have been approved by the Secretary of State. We are not trying to
slide in any undermining of the process. We are not attempting to stop
applications in their tracks or provide more obstacles for
them.</div>
					<a name="080124100000596"></a><div class="hs_Para">The planning
policy statements and local development plans are very important
documents that should be at least considered by the commission or the
Secretary of State in coming to a view on an application. They could,
of course, consider them and decide that they are in contradiction to a
national policy statement. The intentions of the national policy
statement override any planning policy statements or local development
plans, but that would be for the commission to determine in each case.
As it stands, it is possible for the commission or the Secretary of
State 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column470" />Column number: 470</div>legally to reach a decision that cannot be challenged, if they decide
that a planning policy statement or local development plan is not
relevant for them to consider. That is quite a difficult position to
understand.</div>
					<a name="080124100000597"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
amendments in the group are smaller ones that try to tease out the
reasoning behind the wording in the Bill. I am told that amendment No.
331, which would change the wording to &#147;other material
considerations&#148;, uses the wording found in other planning
legislation. That concept is well understood in planning and planning
law. I would like to know why it was thought necessary to include the
different wording in the clause when &#147;other material
considerations&#148; is traditionally used in such legislation. That
would also give a little more scope to the commission to consider
matters in the round, rather than in the prescriptive way proposed in
the Bill.</div>
					<a name="080124100000598"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
summarise the most important points. It is right that the commission or
the Secretary of State must take account of national policy statements.
Of course, they should be able to take other matters that they feel are
appropriate into account, but surely they must take into
account&#151;if only to disregard them as inconsistent with the
national policy statements&#151;the Secretary of State&#146;s own
planning policy statements and the local development plans, which have
been consulted on and arrived at by local councils, and approved by the
Secretary of
State.</div>

							<a name="080124100000966"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> As we did not run fast enough to the Clerk, I am
very happy to support the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe in his
supplications to his Minister on these issues. I want to expand briefly
on amendment No. 331, which would insert &#147;material
considerations&#148; in place of &#147;important and
relevant&#148; matters. We all know that the Town and Country
Planning Act was enacted in 1947, although I am advised that it took
until 1970 before the courts had defined what &#147;material
considerations&#148; meant in planning terms. That means that there
was a period of some 23 years before it became clear, in planning
terms, exactly what had to be taken into consideration when coming to a
decision. I would be most grateful if the Minister would explain
whether the use of the term &#147;important and relevant&#148; in
the clause is the Government&#146;s attempt to change the
definitions, or whether there is some advice that &#147;important and
relevant&#148; equals &#147;material considerations&#148;. If
that is the Government&#146;s advice, why bother? If they are trying
to change the criteria for making decisions, are they actually prepared
to spend the next 23 years tied up in legal cases while this is all
sorted out?</div>
					<a name="080124100000600"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that
is the consequence of changing from &#147;material
considerations&#148; to &#147;important and relevant&#148;, it
rather shoots the Government in the foot when they argue that this is a
way of speeding up the planning system. One suspects that the only
people whom this will benefit in the long run is my hon. Friend the
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst and other learned Members. I am sure
that that is not&#151;we keep being assured that it is not&#151;the
Government&#146;s intention.</div>
					<a name="080124100000601"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have also tabled amendment
No. 414. Should the Government accept the amendment proposed by the
hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe regarding &#147;material
considerations&#148;, we would, as a consequence, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column471" />Column number: 471</div>have to amend our amendment to take out &#147;relevant&#148; and
insert &#147;consistent&#148;. I am sure that the Government
recognise that this is a consequential amendment and that, in essence,
it makes the point that has already been
made.</div>
					<a name="080124100000602"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
426 reiterates the need to ensure that sites already protected under
the habitats directive, or any other protected site, would be regarded
as a material consideration&#151;I use that phrase rather than
&#147;important and relevant&#148; for the sake of the Government
and their policy&#151;in the decisions of the panel and
council.</div>

						</b> Not because of the hon. Lady&#146;s speech,
which, as always, enlivened the debate, but because of my lack of sleep
last night. I am also grateful to the hon. Member for Sheffield,
Attercliffe for stepping into the breach and moving the amendment, not
only because of the argument that he advanced, which is very similar to
one I would support, but for giving me time to realise that
amendment  No. 323 is in my name.</div>
					<a name="080124100000607"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have re-read that excellent
amendment, which would do something similar to what the hon. Gentleman
has already spoken about: making it clear in the Bill that we ought to
look at documents that mean a great deal to people in the local
community, who might have invested a great deal of time in getting them
right, in terms of their provision for the community&#146;s
future.</div>
					<a name="080124100000608"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposal
should be consistent in some way with the local authority&#146;s
local development documents. Any conflicts should at least be
considered, with the likely impact on communities within the relevant
local authority area examined and some account taken of the general
approval of people in the area. The amendment would ensure that a local
dimension was brought to bear. I certainly support the arguments that
the hon. Gentleman
advanced</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000971"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> In clause 94, we are trying to set out in the
clearest possible terms the factors that the commission should take
into account when considering an application: first, the relevant
national policy statement; secondly, other matters which may be set out
in secondary legislation; and, thirdly, any other matters that the
commission thinks are important and relevant to its
decision.</div>
					<a name="080124100000610"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have stressed to the Committee a number of times, the primary factor
is the national policy statement. The application must be decided in
accordance with the national policy statement&#151;all members of the
Committee have expressed strong support for that concept&#151;except
when one or more of a list of considerations apply. Broadly, those
considerations are that an application must be lawful, that any adverse
impact of the proposal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column472" />Column number: 472</div>would outweigh its benefits, and that other conditions that might be set
out in secondary legislation are met. By and large, the amendments in
the group would widen&#151;some might say dilute; I would say
confuse&#151;that clear framework for decision making by the
IPC.</div>
					<a name="080124100000611"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me deal
first with local authorities and the understandable concern
expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe
about their position. Local authorities&#151;local planning
authorities&#151;and the devolved Administrations will already be
consulted by the promoter of a project under the provisions of part 5.
No doubt they will make clear to the promoter in those consultations
how the proposal fits&#151;or perhaps does not fit&#151;with their
development plans. Local authorities and devolved Administrations will
also be statutory parties to the examination of an application and no
doubt will use the opportunity to explain in their evidence how the
proposal fits&#151;or perhaps fails to fit&#151;with their
development plans as well as with the views of their residents. The
commission will have to take those factors into account in weighing up
whether any adverse local impacts of the proposal outweigh its
benefits. I hope that that much is clear from the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="080124100000612"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it is
very important to our objectives that the national policy statement,
developed after wide consultation and parliamentary scrutiny, should be
the primary consideration for the commission in taking its decisions. I
say to my hon. Friend, in particular, that adding in other factors with
the amendments as if they had equal weight in the Bill would confuse
the clarity of that framework and widen significantly the scope of
factors that the commission would have to take into account on a
similar basis. As we discussed in relation to part 2, national policy
statements will incorporate existing planning policy when it is
relevant. In time, we would expect local development plans to reflect
the national infrastructure policy
statement.</div>
					<a name="080124100000613"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
point raised by the hon. Member for Beckenham, the IPC, in reaching
decisions, can depart from a national policy statement when not to do
so would lead the UK to be in breach of its international obligations,
or would lead the commission to be acting unlawfully. That will ensure
that the hon. Lady&#146;s concern about the habitats directive is
met, because the Bill does nothing to compromise that directive. We do
not need to mention it in the Bill because it is already part of UK
law, so the commission will be required to comply with the terms of the
directive in this
context.</div>
					<a name="080124100000614"></a><div class="hs_Para">On material
considerations, the hon. Lady might or might not be right that it has
taken 23 years to get to the current point and a body of case law that
relates to what counts as a material consideration. In a sense, she
makes the point for me about the case for a different approach. It is
precisely because the phrase &#147;material considerations&#148;
has proved to be so unclear in practice that such a vast amount of case
law has been spawned. As a result of that accretion of case law, the
definition is not necessarily clearer. Often, as a result of the
accretion of case law and precedent, the picture is muddled and
confused and can hinder rather than help the effective examination of
an application and the resulting decision.</div>
					<a name="080124100000615"></a><div class="hs_Para">We seek not
to incorporate material considerations in that context, but to limit
the additional matters to which the IPC must have regard to those that
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column473" />Column number: 473</div>commission can explain as being important and relevant to the decision.
I submit to the Committee that the Bill is much clearer about what
should and should not be taken into account by decision makers
alongside, or in addition to, the national policy statement.</div>
					<a name="080124100000616"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that my explanation has
helped and that the Committee will not feel it necessary to support the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="080124100000972"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> Should the provision go through, I hope that the
Government are prepared to spend the next 23 years defining
&#147;important&#148; and &#147;relevant&#148;. I am not a
lawyer, but I could undoubtedly ask a lawyer whether there is a legal
definition of important or relevant. However, I suspect that the
Government could be setting up another 23 years of litigation to define
those words.</div>
					<a name="080124100000618"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
advised that the legal definition was clarified in 1970, and that
during the next 38 years there was no challenge to it. It will surely
be safer to stay with that body of case law. Everything the Minister
has said that the panel and the council have to take into account can
in my mind be described as material consideration as much as it can be
described as important and relevant.
</div>
					<a name="080124100000619"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am still
struggling with why the Government wish to change what is now
understood in planning law not for one but for two new
concepts&#151;important and relevant. I originally thought that we
might vote against the provision, but I am tempted to take further
advice in the light of what the Minister had to say; I believe that it
is potentially so important that we may have to return to the subject.
The definition of important and relevant could shoot holes through
everything that the Minister is trying to
achieve.</div>
					<a name="080124100000620"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124100000973"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. It is
reinforced by the thought that material consideration in the current
context is clearly distinguished from immaterial
considerations&#151;those that make no difference to the
consideration of the application. If they are material and they make a
difference to the application, one would think that anything important
or relevant would be caught.</div>
					<a name="080124100000621"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister does not seem to
have said what might be excluded that is material that would not be
important or relevant. My hon. Friend is right that it will be a field
day for litigation and
confusion.</div>

point.</div>
					<a name="080124100000623"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
take further advice about the Minister&#146;s explanation. Much as we
all want the planning system speeded up&#151;although we may disagree
on how the Government propose doing it&#151;a new concept that would
take 23 years to be defined is enough to strike a chill down all
developers&#146; spines, whether they work for national
infrastructure projects or, dare I say it, on an extension to a
house.</div>

that is what shapes and guides 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column474" />Column number: 474</div>them, and they will have to be approved by Parliament. I am not sure
whether there will be secondary legislation to flesh out subsection
(2)(b), which deals with</div>

						</b> These are probing amendments as this seemed to
be a part of the Bill where debate could be had. As I have said before,
the Minister has been very careful to make the distinction between the
role of Governments in setting policy and the role of the commission in
determining applications. One of the benefits of national policy
statements is that they provide a framework of which everyone is aware.
Once they are in place, they should speed up applications because
various issues do not need to be revisited on each occasion if the
national policy is
clear.</div>
					<a name="080124100000642"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
limitation of national policy statements in that context is that they
are set by a Government who have been elected. At the next general
election, when one of the statements may have become a cause of
controversy, an alternative Government may be elected on a mandate to
overturn the statement. I am sure that the Minister, and indeed the

					<a name="080124100000647"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point I am trying to make
is that circumstances may change, and a national policy
statement&#146;s virtue is that it should exist for a period of which
applicants are aware and within which they can work. The point that
provoked the amendments is that, in fact, the statements may be time
limited up until the next general election, because there may be
changes&#151;even within a party. If the same party stays in power,
its balance and views may change based on who leads it following a
general election. All sorts of factors may change, and a national
policy statement can be guaranteed only until a general election,
because if there is a change of Government the statement may change.
What view has the Minister taken on that issue? Does he feel that it
undermines the concept of the national policy statement? This is really
a probing amendment to provoke that
discussion.</div>

						</b> An interesting point has been raised, but I shall
not add to what has been said. One assumes that the power of
intervention will be extremely limited, but I am intrigued, and we
return to a previous discussion prompted by my hon. Friend the Member
for Beckenham. If one considers subsection (3), which sets out the
second set of conditions for an intervention, it is noteworthy that the
test throughout is materiality, as opposed to, let us say, importance
or relevance. It seems to me that there is an internal inconsistency in
the Bill. It is sensible to use materiality, because it covers all the
important issues, and is well known and well established, but the fact
that the Government think it appropriate to use materiality in this
clause undermines the use of a different test
elsewhere.</div>

							<a name="080124100000988"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I am not sure that the amendments proposed by the
hon. Member for North Cornwall would do what he thinks they might,
because if they were agreed to, the Secretary of State, to intervene,
would have to be satisfied not only that all the conditions in clause
98(3) had been met, but that the national policy statement in question
had been given effect in the previous Parliament. In other words, the
amendments would prevent the Secretary of State from intervening in any
cases where the relevant national policy statement had been designated
during the current Parliament. I am not sure that that is what the hon.
Gentleman wants.</div>
					<a name="080124100000650"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a good case for
intervention when defence or national security matters are involved,
and there is also a good case when a national policy statement is out
of date and bears on a decision that cannot wait until the review of
the statement is complete. Those conditions are set out in the Bill. I
am struggling to grasp the hypothetical situation that the hon.
Gentleman introduced to the Committee, but&#151;perish the
thought&#151;those conditions may meet his concerns rather better
than his amendments would.</div>
