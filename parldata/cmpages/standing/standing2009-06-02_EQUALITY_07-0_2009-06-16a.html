<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000381"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> It is a pleasure to welcome you back to the Chair,
Mr.
Benton.</div><a name="09061635000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to speak briefly to the amendments tabled in my name and that of
my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green. The group has
three separate components, the lead amendment being
amendment 114, which would take out reference to
&#147;long-term&#148; when defining an impairment. I shall explain
the
reasoning.</div><a name="09061635000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other amendments in the group, specifically amendments 179 and 186 to
188, would clarify whether there is an ambiguity in the Bill&#151;a
minor point, on which I do not intend to spend long. Amendment 180 is a
more detailed attempt to get at the same issue as amendment 114,
questioning whether there is a way to define an impairment so that we
capture those that, while not being long term in themselves, are likely
to recur. I do not claim great faith in the wording of amendment 180 as
appropriate to that aim, but that is the
intention.</div><a name="09061635000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
long-standing concern of the disabled community, and among those of us
who support equality, has been the need to ensure that all the people
who need to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div>benefit from the protection provided by existing anti-discrimination law
and what is proposed can benefit without matters of definition
preventing them from doing so. The concern about the use of
&#147;long-term&#148; and how it is described in schedule 1 is that
that might prevent those people&#151;I am quoting the Equality and
Human Rights Commission briefing on the
amendment&#151;</div><a name="09061635000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;with
short-term conditions, particularly mental health conditions such as
depression&#148;</div><a name="09061635000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">from
benefiting from the
protection.</div><a name="09061635000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Long-term&#148;
is defined in schedule
1:</div><a name="09061635000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
effect of an impairment is long-term if... it has lasted for at
least 12 months... is likely to last for at least 12 months,
or... is likely to last for the rest of the life of the person
affected.&#148;</div><a name="09061635000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concern, therefore, is with chronic but fluctuating conditions in which
the effect cannot be seen to last continuously for 12 months, but is
liable to
recur.</div><a name="09061635000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Equality and Human Rights Commission welcomes the removal of the list
of normal, day-to-day activities from the definition of disability in
the Bill, but it is concerned that the clause repeats the requirement
for the effects of the impairment to be long
term.</div><a name="09061635000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000382"></a>The
Solicitor-General (Vera Baird):</b> I want to ask the hon.
Gentleman about something he said a minute ago&#151;that the
definition is inadequate for conditions that will not last 12 months
but are likely to recur. Of course he knows that paragraph 2(1) of
schedule 1 specifically provides that if an impairment stops having a
substantial adverse effect on someone&#146;s ability to carry out
day-to-day activities, it is to be treated as none the less continuing
to have that effect if it is likely to recur. That covers precisely
what he was talking
about.</div><a name="09061635000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000383"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful to the Minister, because that is the
meat of the issue. I tabled amendment 114, which would take out
&#147;long-term&#148; and consequently render that part of schedule
1 ineffective, but amendment 180 probes the question of &#147;likely
to recur&#148;. That is perhaps where we can have most of the
substantive debate on the
group.</div><a name="09061635000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
180 uses the
words</div><a name="09061635000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;leave
out &#145;effect is likely to recur&#146; and insert
&#145;impairment is of a nature where it, or its effects, is liable
to
recur&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="09061635000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem with &#147;likely to recur&#148; is that one is not certain
whether one&#146;s particular condition, which is liable to recur, is
likely to
recur.</div><a name="09061635000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000384"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I looked at how the hon. Gentleman
changed &#147;likely&#148; to &#147;liable&#148; and checked in
the dictionary, but they are synonymous. I was surprised, because I
thought &#147;liable&#148; was less than &#147;likely&#148;,
but they are synonymous, so I do not think he has a
point.</div><a name="09061635000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000385"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Two dictionaries, three definitions. However, I
accept the key point behind what the Minister says. If it is her
intention to say that &#147;likely&#148; is not a balance of
probabilities but a liability to recur&#151;I can go into examples,
although I am not keen to get bogged down in them&#151;that would be
helpful and enable us to go away and consider whether what she said by
means of clarification would be useful not only for the courts, but for
people to know their rights. There is a difference, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 193</div>however, and I am seeking to identify a lower threshold than
&#147;likely&#148;, which at least implies a balance of
probabilities.</div><a name="09061635000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
conditions can and are liable to recur, but they may not recur on the
balance of probabilities. The fact that they are liable to recur, but
there is uncertainty, is part of the effect that they have on someone.
People often have to make life-changing decisions and adjustments to
their lifestyle and day-to-day activities because of the fear of
something
returning.</div><a name="09061635000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
look forward to hearing a precise definition of &#147;likely&#148;
from the Minister. A common understanding is that
&#147;liable&#148; to recur is not as strong as
&#147;likely&#148;. However, if her view is that
&#147;liable&#148; is as strong as &#147;likely&#148;, we might
need to find new wording, such as &#147;has the potential&#148; to
recur. For example, depression is a condition that can recur and
doctors might not be able to say &#147;likely to recur&#148; when
an employer or potential complainant asks the question. Part of the
point of treatment, even for conditions that can recur, is the hope
that they are
treated.</div><a name="09061635000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
there is ambiguity about what the &#147;it&#148; refers to in
schedule 1(2)(1) because it
says:</div><a name="09061635000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
effect of an impairment is long-term
if&#151;</div><a name="09061635000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
it has lasted for at least 12
months&#148;.</div><a name="09061635000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
ought to have clarity on whether the &#147;it&#148; is the
impairment or the effect. I have argued that it is the effect and my
amendment addresses that. I do not claim to have absolutely certainty
that it would be useful to clarify that, but it seemed to me that it
would.</div><a name="09061635000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think there is much more to say except that there is widespread
support for doing something about the threshold that is felt to be
there by the disability community on the question of
&#147;long-term&#148; and the definition provided. It is noteworthy
that the EHRC is even supportive of what might be considered the
strongest amendment in the group, which would remove
&#147;long-term&#148; entirely. It is important that there is
clarity and confidence that people can access the protection. All
members of the Committee will recognise that disabled people need and
deserve that.</div>
<a name="09061635000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061635000386"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): I am pleased to
welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. Benton. I want to speak
to the amendments briefly. The hon. Gentleman raises an important issue
about fluctuating conditions. I have tabled an amendment to schedule 1,
looking at one issue in particular, where we can have a more useful
discussion. We had good evidence in the evidence sessions and Ruth
Scott of the Disability Charities Consortium raised the issue about
fluctuating conditions, particularly depression, which we will discuss
in relation to schedule 1. She also pointed out that removing
&#147;long-term&#148; probably was not the way to go because, for
example, &#147;long-term&#148; features in the UN
convention.</div><a name="09061635000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue of fluctuating conditions really needs to be addressed. The
Minister has already raised that and said that schedule 1 deals with it
adequately. We will come to that. Although the hon. Member for Oxford,
West and Abingdon has raised an important and valid issue, I do not
think his amendments are the way to go about solving the problem. I
look forward with great interest to what the Minister has to
say.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div><a name="09061635000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061635000387"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): Briefly, it is right to flag
up the concerns of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, which
will exercise many across the
Committee.</div><a name="09061635000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
aspects of the matter also occur to me, and are relevant to the
provision of services by a public authority generally. One is that
while the hon. Gentleman is entirely right to say that long-term and
fluctuating conditions are, by themselves, the main remit of the
measure, people may have short-term disabilities that may be finite and
discrete&#151;they might arise, for example, from an accident at
work&#151;but are, nevertheless,
real.</div><a name="09061635000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
messed my shoulder up some years ago&#151;hardly a matter of interest
to the Committee, but one of record. It is quite difficult to be a
Member of Parliament and to find that one cannot drive, or do anything
else, for a period. It gives one, perhaps providentially, some insight
into the problems of people who have a long-term disability that is
then forgotten about. We should consider that, because I hope that
local authorities and others will.</div>
<a name="09061635000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
there are issues, for example, about how people are handled in relation
to parking, where they need help and where, once again, although their
condition may not be long-term, their need is nevertheless real. I hope
that as we build up policy on this and some related issues on human
rights, which I may wish to deploy before the Committee later, we give
this matter sympathetic consideration and try to find a better way to
deal with it than has sometimes been the case in the
past.</div><a name="09061635000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000388"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Welcome back to the Committee,
Mr. Benton. I agree with the hon. Member for Forest of Dean
that we have a better amendment than this to deal with the question of
&#147;likely to recur&#148; and, in particular, the question of
depression, which is the meat of where any perceived difficulty arises.
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon says that there is
long-term concern about this, which would be likely, assuming that he
represented the disability sector, but we have talked and consulted
extensively with it about this and he is overstating the issue. He has
missed it, anyway, with the amendments.</div>
<a name="09061635000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I looked up
&#147;likely&#148; and &#147;liable&#148; in the
&#147;Shorter Oxford&#148;. I can do no better than that, and if he
wants to include redefinitions in the &#147;Evan Harris English
Dictionary&#148;, that is absolutely fine. However, we will go with
the normal meaning of those words. There has to be a line drawn
somewhere and we think that 12 months is not unreasonable. Of course,
the hon. Member for Daventry is right: people have to be considerate of
those who have hurt themselves&#151;they have their human rights in
any event, if I can put it like that, although that is an odd phrase to
use about human rights&#151;but he clearly would not have expected
reasonable adjustments to be made by his employer because he had a sore
shoulder for a short time. That is the scale of what we are trying to
balance&#151;interests of that kind.</div>
<a name="09061635000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 12-month
requirement has applied since the introduction of the Disability
Discrimination Act 1995 and we do not think that there is any real need
to change it. Some of the amendments are consequential on the first, so
let me consider amendment 180 as quickly as I may, which is a quest to
clarify paragraph 2(1) of schedule 1. To make sense of that
paragraph, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div>question is whether it is the effect or the impairment that has to be
&#147;long-term&#148; or &#147;likely to recur&#148;. It is
perfectly plain that the paragraph
says:</div><a name="09061635000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
effect of an impairment is long-term
if&#148;</div><a name="09061635000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
goes on to say how it becomes long term. The amendment is therefore not
needed because the sense of the schedule is entirely
clear.</div><a name="09061635000058"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000389"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I note the Minister&#146;s view that the meaning
of the schedule is clear. That will no doubt be considered here and in
another place. On the question of the views of the disability
community, it depends who one speaks to. The Disability Rights
Commission was charged with monitoring and reviewing the definition and
when it conducted its research for its review of the DDA in 2002, it
concluded that the &#147;long-term&#148; requirement, if I can call
it that,
was</div><a name="09061635000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
persistent problem for people with depression and anxiety
disorders.&#148;</div><a name="09061635000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not claim to speak on behalf of disabled people or the
non-governmental organisation community, but I hope that the Minister
accepts that there is concern out there. That is why even the
organisation that has taken on the work of the Disability Rights
Commission, the EHRC, has concerns about the use of &#147;long
term&#148; and supports the lead
amendment.</div><a name="09061635000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not convinced that the Minister&#146;s reference to the
&#147;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&#148;, fine tome as it is,
is sufficient fully to deal with the issue behind amendment 180. The
amendment speaks of the impairment being</div>
<a name="09061635000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of a nature
where it, or its effects, are liable to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000392"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The amendments have been discussed with the
Disability Charities Consortium and are supported by that organisation
and the EHRC. They would provide an explicit definition of persons who
are perceived to be disabled so that people experiencing discrimination
on the grounds of a perceived disability would enjoy effective
protection under the law. I want to probe the Minister on the four
clauses that would be amended to find out whether the Government
believe that the difference between direct discrimination of those who
actually have a disability and those who are perceived to have one are
covered by the existing wording of the Bill.</div>
<a name="09061635000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill&#146;s wording is wide enough to cover direct discrimination and
harassment based on perception. However, in the view of the DCC and the
EHRC, the approach is not sufficient in the case of disability. That is
partly linked to the issue that we have just considered in the previous
group of amendments. Unlike other protected characteristics, for a
person to be considered disabled for the purposes of claiming
disability discrimination, they must meet the stringent definition of
disability, including its long-term nature. The person who is
discriminating against them, based on the perception of whether they
are disabled, clearly will not have in their mind a specific legal
definition of disability. The reason behind the amendments is to make
clear that for cases that involve discrimination based on perception of
disability, it is the defendant&#146;s motivation for discrimination
that matters, not whether the claimant meets the legal definition of
disability. In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act
of 1990 specifically provides that a person is regarded as being
perceived to be disabled if they are discriminated against based on
that belief, whether or not the effects of the perceived disability
meet the definition of disability under that
Act.</div><a name="09061635000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the stigma surrounding a large number of disabilities, especially
hidden ones such as mental health problems and HIV, discrimination
based on perception may well be widespread. We tabled the amendments to
probe whether the Minister feels that the Bill already covers the
matter and, if so, so that she can give the Committee an explanation.
The view of the DCC and the EHRC is that it does not. The EHRC has
specifically said that it does not think, on a normal reading of the
clauses to which I have referred, that discrimination against people
with a perceived disability is sufficiently covered. Will the Minister
set out what she feels the wording in the Bill does, and whether it
already covers those
issues?</div><a name="09061635000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000393"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern. I
have tabled several amendments to clause 13, which we will come on to
later, so I will not speak long on this group. I am asking, in respect
of all protected characteristics, whether the definition of direct
discrimination in the explanatory notes in paragraph 71 on page
E9&#151;</div><a name="09061635000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;broad
enough to cover cases where the less favourable treatment is
because...the victim is wrongly thought to have
it&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09061635000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">already
covers perception. That is not explicit in clause 13, but it
is clearly important that the provision not only covers disability and
other strands, but is seen to do so. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 197</div>Simply working on the basis of case law or intention behind legislation
without making things clear, when we can, represents a missed
opportunity.</div><a name="09061635000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that the Government are keen to ensure that such legislation is
accessible to individuals and organisations. Even if the
amendment&#146;s wording is not exactly right, it would serve
that purpose well if, as I suspect, the Government&#146;s view is
that the statute should cover perceptions of disability and, I hope,
other strands.</div>
<a name="09061635000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000394"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Perhaps I should make it clear that, in
our view, &#147;related to&#148;&#151;this is probably what
amendment 175, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Forest of Dean,
is directed towards&#151;is wide enough to cover association and
perception. That is our intention, and it is an important point. I want
to make that clear at the outset, even though the hon. Gentleman did
not lay great emphasis on that amendment. I understand why he set out
that query, as he is probing a particular aspect of the
Government&#146;s thinking.</div>
<a name="09061635000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 166
would provide that a person perceived as having a disability would not
have to meet the requirement that their perceived impairment must
have</div>
<a name="09061635000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a substantial
and long-term adverse
effect&#148;</div><a name="09061635000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">on
their ability to carry out day-to-day activities in order to be
protected by the Bill. However, somebody who had a disability would
continue to have to prove that. It would be most inequitable for
somebody who did not have a disability to have a lighter test to gain
protection than somebody who did, and that is the logical fault in the
proposal. However, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the perception
aspect of discrimination is targeted on the intention of the person who
is &#147;discriminating&#148;&#151;I will put that in inverted
commas for the moment. The mischief occurs when a person intends to
discriminate against somebody who is in the protected strand, even
though they have misperceived that person&#146;s identity, and they
are not in fact in that protected strand. This is another way of
protecting those who are in that strand, not of protecting those who
are outside it.</div>
<a name="09061635000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">To pursue the
point further, there is nothing to be gained from requiring people to
make reasonable adjustments for somebody who is perceived to be
disabled but is not disabled and does not need those adjustments, which
would follow on from what the hon. Gentleman is saying and one of his
later amendments. In one sense, he is right. A person who is not within
the strand, even though they are perceived to be in it, is not covered
for all purposes as if they were disabled, running through the gamut of
protection that we give to disabled people. However, such people are
protected against discrimination and, importantly&#151;this is a
point that the hon. Gentleman honed in on&#151;the person whose
motivation is discrimination is dealt with under the legislation. We
think that that is the right way forward, and with respect, having
proved the point, I invite him to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="09061635000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000395"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for that
reply. Her point about amendment 166 is sound, and I will withdraw it
in a moment.</div>
<a name="09061635000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to take the Solicitor-General back to her first point. Following on
from our earlier discussion, I would like verification on clause 24
regarding harassment. She is right to say that someone who does not
have a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div>protected characteristic does not need a reasonable adjustment because
they are not disabled. However, there could be people who have a
disability, or who are perceived to have a disability, and that leads
to harassment. That is the mischief, as opposed to them needing a
reasonable adjustment&#151;which clearly they do not. Such people
might suffer a detriment based on the fact that they have no
disability, but are perceived to have one. For example, a person might
be ill treated because someone wrongly thinks that they have HIV or
a  mental health problem. Is she confident that
without  amendment 175, the harassment provisions in clause 24
would adequately protect a person who does not have a protected
characteristic but is suffering harassment none the
less?</div>
<a name="09061635000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000396"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Yes, we are confident of that&#151;I
am sorry if I said it too briefly. Let me set out the position more
extensively so that it is
clear.</div><a name="09061635000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
175 relates to clause 24, which uses the formulation &#147;related
to&#148; in the definition of harassment. It means that protection is
not limited to a person who has a protected characteristic. It also
covers a person who is harassed because of their association with
someone who has a protected characteristic or&#151;this is the thrust
of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point&#151;someone who is harassed
because they are perceived, whether incorrectly or not, to have a
protected characteristic. To set out an explicit provision, as under
amendment 175, would cast doubt on the issue that the formulation of
being &#147;related to&#148; a protected characteristic would be
broad enough to cover harassment based on perception. That would be an
unwelcome outcome of such a provision, which I am sure would be
unintended. I hope that I have made our intentions absolutely clear. We
are satisfied with clause 24, and I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will not press that
amendment.</div><a name="09061635000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000397"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for her
response.</div><a name="09061635000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000398"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The hon. and learned Lady&#146;s response was
helpful in respect of harassment, but what does the hon. Gentleman feel
about amendment 168, to which I spoke, which covers direct
discrimination under clause 13. Is he satisfied that the
same thing that applies to  harassment, as opposed to the
definitional amendment that leads the group, should apply? Is there
more virtue in amendment 168 than in the intention behind
amendment 175? Does he intend to refer to that when we
discuss clause
13?</div><a name="09061635000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000399"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
intervention. When studying the group of amendments, I focused
specifically on the issues relating to disability. The
Solicitor-General was right when she said that people who do not
actually have the disability will clearly not require a reasonable
adjustment and that, if someone does not make appropriate provision,
they will not suffer a detriment. That is not the case with harassment,
and she has adequately satisfied me that that is covered by the
Bill.</div><a name="09061635000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

other than disability, which we shall indeed cover in due course when

carry out normal day to day activities shall always be treated as if
that effect is likely to recur if the person has had within the last 5
years a previous episode of such impairment which had a substantial
adverse effect on the person&#146;s ability to carry out normal day
to day activities for a period of 6 months or
more.&#146;.</div><a name="09061635000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have already referred to this amendment. It deals specifically with the
long-term issue of depression. We tabled the amendment to probe whether
the definitions in the Bill would adequately cover all those types of
disability that fluctuate, but might recur. The amendment is supported
by the Disability Charities Consortium, which says that the Bill covers
only recurring or fluctuating conditions if they are based on an
underlying long-term impairment&#151;in other words, the impairment
is long term while its symptoms or effects
fluctuate.</div><a name="09061635000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue of depression goes to point of what the hon. Member for Oxford,
West and Abingdon set out when he cited information from the Disability
Right Commission. According to my information, people are rarely
diagnosed with the related underlying condition, so separate episodes
of depression are effectively the effects of the condition and are not
covered under the current definition if they do not last for at least
12 months. There are differences of opinion within the
medical profession about when episodes of depression are manifestations
of an underlying long-term condition, or whether they are discrete
episodes. There are often disagreements in court among expert witnesses
about the
matter.</div><a name="09061635000348"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11

chance of having another episode within five years. Depression can
carry considerable stigma, in particular with regard to employment. My
amendment would rectify that gap in equality legislation, and protect
people who experience short-term, recurrent episodes of depression from
discrimination arising from their impairment and the surrounding
stigma. It focuses specifically on depression alone for the good
reasons outlined by the Minister for holding to a definition of
&#147;long-term&#148; in the generality. That specific condition is
felt not to be well captured by the existing
definition.</div><a name="09061635000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
set that out, I am looking to the Minister to say whether she feels
that the existing definition of fluctuating conditions, which she
touched on in the previous debate, will adequately cover mental
illnesses 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div>such as depression, which may not be accurately diagnosed. There is
already evidence of cases in which people suffer recurrent episodes but
are not adequately protected under the existing

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000401"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> That illustrates the problem with the definition
of &#147;long-term&#148; in schedule 1 that I probed in amendment
180. I support the idea behind the amendment, although the problem is
that it is disease-specific. There are plenty of mental health
conditions for which the chance of recurrence might not be as high as
the 70 per cent. figure that the hon. Gentleman quoted or about which
there is less certainty, less data and less research information on the
likelihood of the condition&#146;s recurrence or of the recurrence of
the effects. Therefore, the amendment should be seen as
illustrative.</div><a name="09061635000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points, however, urge the Minister to
reconsider her reliance on the wording that
the</div><a name="09061635000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;effect
is likely to
recur&#148;,</div><a name="09061635000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">because
in many cases in which protection is needed, physicians will find it
difficult to say that they believe that the condition is likely to
recur. It is far better to have a definition that does not require
independent medical reports to stretch to cover what is required by the
law, but to have common sense apply. Therefore, the amendment
illustrates again that we need to find alternative wording that does
not depend on a likelihood that covers a balance of probabilities,
which would be the wrong threshold for many disabling and debilitating
diseases that can and do recur but are not necessarily likely to recur.
The amendment covers just one example of
those.</div><a name="09061635000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000402"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Overall, the broad view is that the
issue is one for the medical profession and its diagnosis of
depression, rather than for anti-discrimination measures, which already
provide for recurring conditions. I remind hon. Members that schedule 1
defines the effects of an impairment being long term, specifically
saying in paragraph
2(2):</div><a name="09061635000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
an impairment ceases to have a substantial adverse effect on a
person&#146;s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities, it
is to be treated as continuing to have that
effect&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09061635000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">even
if it does
not&#151;</div><a name="09061635000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">if
that effect is likely to
recur.&#148;</div><a name="09061635000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a doctor can say that a condition is likely to recur, if evidence from
the past on how the individual has reacted suggests that it is likely
to recur, or if the evidence suggests that it is likely to recur, the
person will rightly be treated as having a fluctuating illness, which
is capable of meeting the definition in paragraph 2. However, if we are
talking about an awful personal event that puts someone into depression
for a period, but they are not depressed in any other sense and do not
have an underlying difficulty, and within five years some other awful
event occurs&#151;such things can, unfortunately, happen in that
sequence&#151;that quite separate element of perfectly sensible
depression, as it were, which is a response to an event in a
person&#146;s life and would throw anyone into depression, ought not
to make them
disabled.</div><a name="09061635000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
people in such a situation would not want to be classed as disabled. It
would be extremely difficult to know what anyone else could do to help
them through the interim period, when they have been perfectly healthy 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 201</div>because the impact of such an event has not been playing upon them. It
is the reverse of what the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon
said. We should not be looking for a way of defining every instance of
depression to ensure that it is within the protection of disability
provisions. If something is likely to recur, that person obviously has
a long-term illness and must be protected. That is the way around the
problem, as common sense, which he prays in aid, and medical evidence
require it to
be.</div><a name="09061635000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000403"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I want to probe the Minister on one point about
medical evidence. If someone has a condition and there is a fair amount
of consensus among medical practitioners regarding diagnosis and the
likelihood of recurrence&#151;this returns us to the point made by
the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon&#151;what she says is
perfectly fair and straightforward and will capture all the cases at
hand. However, the case put forward by the DCC shows that there is a
lack of consensus about the diagnosis of depression in the medical
community, and there is a debate about whether it is an underlying
condition or whether there are separate episodes. That is why the
amendment focuses specifically on depression. There is an argument
about the likelihood of recurrence, with no particular agreement
reached, and it could end up with cases going to court and experts
arguing with each other. That might be inevitable, and the court would
then have to take a view.</div>
<a name="09061635000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
information does the Minister have, and what research has the
Department done, on depression or any other long-term conditions? To
what extent are there differences in medical opinion? Is the diagnosis
and the likelihood of recurrence in any way controversial, likely to be
challenged or at variance? Some people have an underlying condition and
suffer recurrent bouts of depression and its disabling effects. It is
not in anyone&#146;s interest to force such people into a courtroom
or a situation in which they have to weigh up different medical experts
against each other. As far as they are concerned, they have a disabling
condition that periodically recurs. Will the Minister give more
information about the state of medical opinion on that
condition?</div>
<a name="09061635000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000404"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> As with all conditions, the question of
whether depression is likely to recur must be a question of fact, and
medical evidence will help the determination of that. Obviously, it is
likely that such matters will be determined as a question of fact long
before they get to court, but there is a limit on what one can do in
statute to clarify every possible situation that might arise. I think
that the provision is clear, and if the diagnosis is not, that is
outwith what can be captured within discrimination legislation. We
cannot set down a list of criteria that can be used to determine
whether depression is likely to recur. That would be outwith our
expertise.</div>
<a name="09061635000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">All we can
do, which seems a very adequate measure and I think that it works, is
set out a fair definition based on, &#147;Is it likely to
recur?&#148; The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon equates
that with the balance of probabilities and all sorts of things that it
is not equated with in any way or case. It is an ordinary question: is
it likely to recur?</div>
<a name="09061635000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Forest of Dean gave an example&#151;I hope that I am not
misquoting him&#151;that there is a 70 per cent. chance of
depression recurring within five 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 202</div>years if it is not a situational depression. Should evidence suggest
that someone has depression that is likely to recur, that person will
be well protected. When it is not possible to say whether it is likely
to recur, we are in a hinterland that can only be determined by
evidence of earlier recurrences or by medical opinion. At that point,
we are outside the territory of the provision.</div>
<a name="09061635000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
definition of &#147;long-term&#148; is important and we must
distinguish it from people who have a short-term problem or who have a
disability as correctly termed. Making an exception for the condition
covered by the amendment would probably be unfair on people who have
conditions that are subject to the same problems of definition. The
hon. Gentleman has adequately probed the issue raised by the disability
charities, and probing is what they sought. He has done that job and
can now withdraw the amendment to let us go
forward.</div>
<a name="09061635000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000405"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Before I do that, I want to say that given that
there is a fair bit of dispute and debate about the issue&#151;she is
quite right, there are other conditions&#151;perhaps we can place
some guidance on the record. Once the Bill has progressed through the
House and the other place, perhaps the EHRC, when it is drawing up its
statutory guidance, will consider fluctuating conditions and see
whether its guidance is as comprehensive as possible and gives
employers and others who will be relying on it a proper understanding
of the nature of fluctuating
conditions.</div><a name="09061635000108"></a>

Boswell</b>: I beg to move amendment 195, in
clause 7, page 5, line 25, leave
out &#145;proposing to undergo&#146; and insert &#145;considering
undergoing&#146;.</div><a name="09061635000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will remember that we had a full discussion in
Thursday&#146;s debate on the issues affecting persons who are in the
process of, or contemplating, transgendering. It is unnecessary and
inappropriate to pick up the whole of that discussion, but I said that
I had missed out by not moving an amendment on the specific point
raised. I have now done that to give the Minister a chance to respond.
My hon. Friend for this purpose, the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood
Green, might want to say something on it, too.</div>
<a name="09061635000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
knows&#151;we debated this and it is not an issue between
us&#151;that any persons contemplating transgender issues and their
future are not in a simple situation. They are a small minority, and
that is why they need our support and attention. The
decision  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div>might be initiated at an early age, or it might take years to make a
decision. It might not, in certain cases, go forward to surgery,
medical treatment, the formal process of gender reassignment or the
acquisition of legal status in the new gender as set out in the Gender
Recognition Act 2004. It is a complex and sensitive picture and almost
all individuals will be
different.</div><a name="09061635000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are grateful to the Solicitor-General for introducing a more sensitive
definition. The amendment simply seeks to tidy up something where the
definition could be even better. The difficulty with the words chosen
by the Government, which appear in clause 7, are that they require the
person at the first stage to be &#147;proposing to undergo&#148; a
process of reassignment of their sex. I think that is a little too
precise for the circumstances of the case. I vaguely recall the Oxford
philosopher, J. L. Austin, who created a new class of what he called
&#147;performative utterances&#148;&#151;if someone got up and
said, &#147;I name this ship the Queen Elizabeth&#148;, it was
difficult to deny that they were actually naming the ship the Queen
Elizabeth. It could be that if a person said formally and put it in
writing, &#147;I am proposing to undergo a process&#148;, that
would be a performative utterance. They would have deemed themselves to
be doing so, and they would automatically receive the benefit of
protection of the protected characteristics.</div>
<a name="09061635000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the real
world, it is not like that at all. People are ambiguous&#151;they
make tentative inquiries, go and see a doctor, talk to a
counsellor and start thinking about it. It would be better and more
sensible in those cases if the protection, which is rightly
intended by the Committee, was extended to those persons whose status
is not wholly determined, but are thinking about it. That is why I came
up with the phrase &#147;considering
undergoing&#148;.</div><a name="09061635000349"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="09061635000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
stress to the Committee that that would not be a test with no evidence.
If there was an act of discrimination, the person involved would have
to show some evidence that they had been &#147;considering&#148;.
They could not make it up afterwards&#151;or rather, they would have
to convince a court that they had such evidence. But it would be more
informal than saying, &#147;I am proposing to undergo a
process.&#148; It would be saying, &#147;I am not quite sure where
I am, but I need to think about it. It might transpire in the process
of gender reassignment.&#148; It would be a softer but not
non-existent test. It is entirely consistent with the advances that we
have already made&#151;we are just taking it a stage
further.</div><a name="09061635000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
say to the Solicitor-General that I have proposed those words because
they were the first ones that came into my head&#151;I have no
proprietary interest in them. If she can come up with a better way to
catch the more nuanced definition of people starting on the process and
extending the protection to them&#151;indeed, some of them will
really need it&#151;the Committee will be grateful. As I said, I will
not stand on the words, but I think the issue is worth
considering.</div><a name="09061635000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061635000409"></a><b class="B">Lynne
Featherstone</b> (Hornsey and Wood Green) (LD): I will not
hold up the Committee for long as we discussed the issue the other day.
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Daventry for tabling the
amendment, which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 204</div>goes part way to where I was trying to reach, but not the whole way. It
is important to introduce the idea of uncertainty and confusion, which
populates the transgender world to a far greater extent than the world
in which people are settled in their decision to live in one gender or
the other. I felt that we had not touched on that complexity or allowed
for that confusion, although the amendment goes some way towards that.
Paragraph 56 of the explanatory notes
states:</div><a name="09061635000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
clause also explains that a reference to people who have or share the
common characteristic of gender reassignment is a reference to all
transsexual people. A woman transitioning to being a man and a man
transitioning to being a woman both share the characteristic of gender
reassignment, as does a person who has only just started out on the
process of changing his or her sex and a person who has completed the
process.&#148;</div><a name="09061635000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment still does not capture those who are not considering a
change&#151;those who are confused, but not considering living in or
transitioning to another gender&#151;but who may still experience
discrimination because they are not physically identifiable as either a
man or a woman, whatever their latent state. I think that the amendment
still leaves that area somewhat unexplored, but it is certainly better
than where we were. I will also be happy if the Minister considers
bringing that into the Bill in some form that gives a voice to those
who are not covered by
reassignment.</div><a name="09061635000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000410"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I can see the point made by the hon.
Member for Daventry; it does arise&#151;he already made that point in
our debate last week. I am incredibly impressed. Having read Professor
Austin myself&#151;he was a positive jurisprudentialist&#151;I can
tell the hon. Gentleman that his one reference to Professor Austin
makes it clear that he got a lot more out of studying the
professor than I ever did, despite many years of application. However,
I am not sure that the amendment would help. If it would, we would of
course consider
it.</div><a name="09061635000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">After
working as hard as we could on the right definitions for clause 7, we
concluded that the phrase &#147;proposing to undergo&#148; provides
the best practical coverage. It gives a degree of certainty and more
sureness, which the term &#147;considering undergoing&#148; does
not. A person can have lots of ways of thinking about their gender. At
what point that amounts to &#147;considering undergoing&#148; a
gender reassignment is pretty unclear. However,
&#147;proposing&#148; suggests a more definite decision point, at
which the person&#146;s protected characteristic would immediately
come into being. There are a lot of ways in which that can be
manifested&#151;for instance, by making their intention known. Even
if they do not take a single further step, they will be protected
straight
away.</div><a name="09061635000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alternatively,
a person might start to dress, or behave, like someone who is changing
their gender or is living in an identity of the opposite sex. That,
too, would mean that they were protected. If an employer is notified of
that proposal, they will have a clear obligation not to discriminate
against them. If anything, a good employer would help them. However,
without a clear decision even to propose to do that, it is difficult to
see how, practically, an employer will know that the
assistance is
necessary.</div><a name="09061635000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
what is going on is an internal cogitation, with no external
manifestation, it is difficult to see how this can work practically. We
want to ensure that people start their personal
journey&#151;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000411"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The problem is the other way around. Often, one
can have an external manifestation without an internal decision being
made. The fundamental point that we have made in both these debates is
that we need to find a way to cover people who, for example, may
cross-dress. It is therefore obvious that they may be a target for
discrimination, and indeed harassment in certain circumstances. They
may not necessarily have made a decision or, in respect of harassment
and discrimination outside employment, they may be too
young&#151;below the age of Gillick competence or Fraser
competence&#151;to be legally able to start or to propose externally
that they should undergo gender reassignment. There is still a
fundamental difference between our
positions.</div><a name="09061635000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000412"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> No. The hon. Gentleman has that
completely on its head, to be frank. No one is too young to cogitate
about their gender identity. The consequences of doing so may be very
different. We are not, as he seems perpetually to be stuck on, talking
about the medical model of gender reassignment, on which some people
may well be too young to be responsible enough to decide. This is not
gender reassignment on a medical model. He really needs to come off
that tramline and look at this for what it is. It concerns a personal
journey and moving a gender identity away from birth sex. I am sure
that that is as capable of being done by a young person as by an older
person, and it is indeed likely to have manifestations. Those
manifestations are the things that will indicate that some sort of
process is in place.</div>
<a name="09061635000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a person
makes the proposal&#151;it is a proposal, not a decision where
someone says, &#147;I will do it and never turn
back&#148;&#151;that they may move along that pathway, at that
point, and at that point only, does it become practical to protect
someone. Someone who is having internal concerns about themselves is
not manifesting it in any way that can be acknowledged and protected by
any external person. As soon as there is a manifestation&#151;as I
have said already, and we discussed this last week too&#151;the duty
not to discriminate comes
in.</div><a name="09061635000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000413"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I would like the Minister to elucidate on
the situation in which someone is not considering living in another
gender, but the external manifestation leaves them looking
indeterminate. How would they get protection if they were to be
discriminated against for being unable to be identified as male or
female?</div><a name="09061635000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000414"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It would depend upon the definition in
clause 7. If she feels that such people are neglected, I should point
out that nothing in the amendment would help them. We are talking about
an amendment changing the definition of when someone triggers this
particular protection, not extending the definition within clause 7, so
we can focus on the remarks made by the hon. Member for
Daventry.</div><a name="09061635000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said already, if we thought the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
proposals would help, we would consider them further. However, we do
not, for the reason I have outlined, which is that there has to be a
practical way to trigger protection against discrimination. Let us
remember the perception element. If people manifest what is thought to
be a tendency to move towards the opposite sex&#151;away 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 206</div>from their sex identity&#151;they might be perceived to be within the
definition under the provision. They will therefore have protection
when they make those manifestations on the basis of perception. Any
behaviour that may be a precursor to an individual proposing to undergo
gender reassignment may be covered by perception, so anyone who has
gender diaspora and experiments with transvestitism before starting the
process of living full-time or even from time to time in what they see
as becoming their acquired gender will be
protected.</div><a name="09061635000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
does not seem to be a problem about people who are considering
reassigning their gender. We have covered the territory directly under
the definition and through perception to cover those who are making
manifestations or who may be misperceived to be in the process of
gender reassignment. We have to cope with the fact that the public are
probably not massively well informed and will make relatively simple
judgments about people. The individual who is misperceived to be on a
journey, when, in fact, they are manifesting something that is not part
of a journey, will be protected. We have deliberately cast the
definition widely to cover all those who need protection against
discrimination. We have no evidence that there is a need for anything
wider.</div>
<a name="09061635000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000415"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> As for whether the perception works in a way that
the Minister identifies, Equality Network noted in the
Government&#146;s equality impact assessment at paragraph 2.20 her
view that protection on the basis of perceived gender reassignment will
provide new protection for people who are &#147;considered as being
transvestite&#148;. I, like Equality Network, welcome that assertion.
However, the concern is that such people might not be adequately
protected on the basis of perceived gender reassignment, because
relying on that provision would perhaps require proof that the
discriminator wrongly perceived the person to be
transsexual&#151;proposing reassignment, as the Minister put
it&#151;as opposed to knowing or perceiving that they were
transvestite, inter-sex or androgyne. If the perception has nothing to
do, in the mind of the discriminator, with gender reassignment but
relates to whether someone is a transvestite, would that be covered by
the perception
provision?</div><a name="09061635000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000416"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am not sure of the nature of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument, because I was sitting down when he began
to speak. However, I am happy to help him as best I can, although it is
a fairly endless job. The matter of perception rests on whether someone
is perceived to come within clause 7. It is as simple as
that.</div><a name="09061635000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000417"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I suppose that it is an indulgence that we end up
second-guessing the Minister&#146;s response before we have finished
with the amendment. In this case, I did almost precisely that. The
Minister understands why we tabled the amendment, and she has been
generous about it. In effect, she has put the counter case in that such
things are difficult to tie down without a fairly clear evidential
test. I accept that, but I hope that I had at least entertained the
possibility that any relevant evidence could be considered as part of
the process of &#147;considering undergoing&#148;. We are really
talking about what would be a test, and as the hon. Member for Oxford,
West and Abingdon has reminded the Committee, that is considered not
only by the individual, but by the potential discriminator.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div><a name="09061635000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I probably
have to give ground to the Solicitor-General. The only point that I
would stick on with my amendment is that, in a sense, No. 1 for a
gender discrimination counsellor or medic consulted by someone who is
contemplating the process should be to say, &#147;Sign a chit here,
saying you are proposing a process of reassignment and that will
protect you, otherwise you might get hit&#151;discriminated against,
or whatever.&#148; That could trigger a decision or perceived
decision that might not be helpful to the person&#146;s
interest.</div><a name="09061635000350"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="09061635000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are going to have to leave the argument on that side of it, legally,
except that the Solicitor-General has introduced some rather
interesting additional tests, which go some way towards meeting the
concerns of Liberal Democrat Members&#151;clearly not far enough for
them, but far enough for
me.</div><a name="09061635000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment is pinned on a specific issue: is the performative action
saying, &#147;I propose to undergo this&#148;? The
Solicitor-General has said that that could be one example. If I wrote
that I was consulting a specialist about the situation, that would be
incontestable. She also said that a number of actions, including
cross-gender dressing, behaving in a way that is not consistent with
the natal gender or whatever, might be regarded as similar performances
and would activate the protections under clause 7. If so&#151;that is
obviously her view&#151;we should record that that is the case. That
is a welcome advance, because it gives additional
protections.</div><a name="09061635000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to come back to the real-world situation. People with considerable
vulnerability may be treated badly in different ways, whether through
formal discrimination or not. Often those people who are mistreating
them are unfamiliar with such conditions and will not have the
appropriate sensitivity. It may well be that the Solicitor-General is
right and that we cannot capture all that in the anti-discrimination
legislation without stretching the test of what is proposed beyond its
normal limits or the possible evidence. However, it is important always
to bear in mind that there are people who have such problems and need
to be treated properly. Perhaps it cannot be done under
anti-discrimination law; certain cases could be a matter of criminal
law, if people are hit, threatened or abused, which is not
acceptable.</div><a name="09061635000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the Minister&#146;s assurances and the extension of what might be
termed the literal-minded approach to take other factors into account,
I am minded to withdraw my amendment on the understanding that the
Solicitor-General will continue to review the matter. If she can come
up with any better ideas that are a little more pointed but meet such
cases, we would be grateful. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000420"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> The amendment has been tabled to probe the
Government&#146;s thinking on why single and cohabiting people have
been left out. Why are marriage and civil partnership protected? Why
are they protected and a cohabiting couple or a single person not? It
is about relationship status and, in an anti-discrimination Bill, we
would not expect any relationship status not to be as important
as another. If the provision is not amended, surely single people and
cohabiting couples will face the possibility of real discrimination. I
would welcome the Government elucidating whether there is something
particular that they had in mind that applies to married couples and
civil partnerships and from which they, but not cohabiting couples and
single people, need protection
that.</div><a name="09061635000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000421"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Lady would help me enormously
if she defined a cohabiting

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000422"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I would define a cohabiting couple as two
people living together&#151;perhaps as simple as
that.</div><a name="09061635000308"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000423"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Brothers and sisters? Mothers and

<a name="09061635000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000424"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> Not a familial relationship. The point is to
probe the equivalent of a married couple or a civil partnership, which
involves love and a sexual relationship.</div>
<a name="09061635000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point is
that the cohabiting couple and a single person are likely to face the
same kinds of discrimination. If they are excluded from the protection,
it will create a whole new disparity: treating people differently
according to their relationship status. To give a couple of examples,
would it not be wrong for a landlord not to want to rent to a single
person because he believes that a single person is less likely to be
responsible or settled, or more likely to have late-night parties? What
about an employer who refuses to give work to a single person applying
to look after children because they believe that only a married person
is appropriate for such a job? What about a hotel that refuses to give
a cohabiting couple a room because they are not married, even though
they may have been cohabiting and in partnership for years? I would be
grateful if the Minister would elucidate why those in the particular
relationships of marriage and civil partnership are included in
protection and not cohabiting couples or single
people.</div><a name="09061635000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000425"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am grateful for the definition, which
saved me from raising questions of uncertainty about brothers and
sisters and so on. The hon. Lady makes an interesting point about hotel
discrimination. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div>There is a nice story, which now goes way back, about the then
Archbishop of Canterbury going with his wife to a hotel, signing the
register &#147;Geoffrey Cantuar and Mrs. Fisher&#148;
and being asked to leave because they were not married, although of
course they were. For the sake of those who are not Latin scholars,
unlike the hon. Member for Daventry and me, &#147;Cantuar&#148; is
how the archbishopric of Canterbury is described in Latin.</div>
<a name="09061635000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
is right that life is fraught for all sorts of people, but the point of
the Bill is to provide protection against discrimination where it
exists and where protection is necessary. We would add further
characteristics to the scope of protection under the Bill if that were
an appropriate and proportionate response to a real problem, but we
have not had any evidence that such problems are faced by those who
cohabit or are single. In fact, as part of the discrimination law
review, the Government consulted on whether to remove the existing
marriage and civil partnership protection, because there is not a lot
of evidence of discrimination on that basis either. We listened to the
responses on whether to remove it. They were pretty much 50:50. Some
responses suggested that incidents of discrimination on that basis
might still be taking place, but there was no indication of
discrimination against those who
cohabit.</div><a name="09061635000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a difficult definition. At which point does someone stop being a
single person and become a cohabitee, after how long would someone
qualify for that separate category and might they be in danger of
losing their protection under the other category too quickly? It is an
issue of certainty of definition as well. I hope that I have reassured
the hon. Lady that it is a sensible course&#151;just about&#151;to
protect married and civil partners, even though there is only the
slightest evidence that they face discrimination, and that it would be
both impractical and unnecessary to extend the measures following her
amendment. I invite her, having probed the issue, to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Featherstone:</b> I have listened carefully to the Minister.
With little evidence for marriage and civil partnerships and no
evidence for cohabiting couples and singletons, I can understand the
difficulty. It goes against the grain to leave a measure that bestows a
differential between people in different relationships in an
anti-discriminatory Bill, but as I do not have the evidence to bring
before her, I will have to leave that disparity in place. However, I
would like to put it on the record that I think it creates a
differential.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000427"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The hon. Lady is making a point about creating a
differential. The provision is carried forward from the existing law. I
was interested in the proposed amendments, so I went back to the look
at the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. Some of the language in that Act
seems rather strange now. The Solicitor-General will correct me if I am
wrong, but the clear intention of that measure was to protect married
women who may be discriminated against, specifically in an employment
field because employers felt that they were not sufficiently committed.
Employers might, for example, discriminate because they thought that
women were going to have children. That was why the measure was
introduced. The Solicitor-General was saying that the evidence today is
that such discrimination does not exist widely if it exists at all.
However, the decision on introducing the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div>provision was finely balanced. The hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood
Green raised an important issue, but it shows how the world has changed
since some of the provisions were introduced. It is not a new
provision, but simply one that exists in law and is being carried
forward.</div>
<a name="09061635000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000428"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his
intervention. It is therefore interesting to ask this question: if the
intention of the original Act was to prevent discrimination against
women because they were married, why is there not more evidence of such
discrimination? I am surprised that there is not more evidence. For
example, Nicola Brewer, the outgoing chief executive of the Equality
and Human Rights Commission, has said that married women were being
discriminated against before they were even employed, because maternity
packages were reckoned to be so good.</div>
<a name="09061635000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000429"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> A person can get pregnant without being
married, so is that not discrimination on the basis of sex? That is
very adequate coverage. May I tell the hon. Lady that the only bit of
evidence that we could find of prejudice or discrimination at all was
one case that showed that there were instances of discrimination when
an employer did not allow married people to work together, because that
might interfere with their commitment to the business? That is the only
example we could find.</div>
<a name="09061635000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000430"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> It is a bit like not being able to go out
with or date people in the same office, which often
happens.</div>
<a name="09061635000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061635000431"></a><b class="B">John
Mason</b> (Glasgow, East) (SNP): The hon. Lady was looking for
examples. Some years ago, I wanted to visit a Scottish island, but
there was no bed and breakfast accommodation for single people
whatever&#151;I suppose because the establishments only had twin or
double rooms. I accepted that because it was a commercial decision.
They are quite small establishments and they cannot cater for
everybody, so I did not feel discriminated against, but is that an
example of such discrimination?</div>
<a name="09061635000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000432"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> When I was preparing for the debate on this
amendment, I wondered whether those sorts of issues would be dealt with
in this part of the Bill, but I was unsure whether marketing and sales
was a legitimate or justifiable way to go. There is an unfairness in
people having to pay a single supplement when they take a single room
in a hotel and a whole raft of similar things. What is the
Solicitor-General&#146;s view?</div>
<a name="09061635000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000433"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> That is not about marital status, but
about going on holiday alone, which is a difficult strand of
discrimination to protect someone against. We are having a whip-round
now to buy the hon. Member for Glasgow, East a
tent.</div><a name="09061635000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000434"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I came to the same conclusion, which is why
I did not use such an example as an argument. It makes me slightly
uneasy to leave a differential 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div>in relationship status in a Bill that is meant to bring things together,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000435"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I wish to raise two issues. First, the fact that
the Bill clearly extends the provisions to colour or nationality is to
be noted and welcomed. Secondly, however, why have the Government
chosen not to go down the path of including the question of dissent? As
I understand it, the provisions in the original directive enable the
Government, if they so choose, to talk about discrimination on the
grounds of dissent as part of racial discrimination. It is not clear
whether the Government have not taken that course for a specific reason
or whether they think that it is already covered.</div>
<a name="09061635000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
questions about whether we have sufficient coverage of discrimination
if the specifics of racial discrimination, including that on the basis
of someone&#146;s descent, are not covered. There is clearly an
overlap into issues of genetics and so on, and questions about caste
discrimination would come under that. It would be helpful if the
Minister clarified the Government&#146;s position. This is a
significant clause on race discrimination.</div>
<a name="09061635000351"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="09061635000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000436"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman suggested that this
is an extension, but I am not sure why he thinks that that is the case.
It troubles me, and I would be grateful if he would set his case out
further. This is not an extension of the definition; we have covered
discrimination on the basis of colour for a long time. All four of the
limbs&#151;colour, nationality, ethnic and national origin&#151;are
there, and always have been. I need to understand what he thinks has
been extended, so that I can answer him
appropriately.</div>
<a name="09061635000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000437"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am looking at my briefing again. As I understand
it, because the regulations with respect to the EU race discrimination
directive were introduced under section 2 of the European Communities
Act 1972, they could not go further than the provisions of
the directive. Therefore, when they were originally introduced, the new
regulations could not cover race discrimination complaints brought on
the grounds of colour and nationality. That means that for the new
definitions of indirect discrimination and harassment, the shift in the
burden of proof relating to the genuine occupational requirement
exception will apply only to discrimination on grounds of race, ethnic
or national origin, and not to colour or nationality.</div>
<a name="09061635000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was the
previous position as I understood it, but I thought that it had been
dealt with effectively in primary legislation. There was primary
legislation, and the Government were not restricted&#151;as they had
been&#151;to implementing that directive through secondary
legislation. I hope that my understanding is correct&#151;if it is
not, I will apologise.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 212</div><a name="09061635000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000438"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman suggests that we
have not outlawed discrimination on the basis of colour before today,
which is an outrageous and bonkers suggestion. The
briefing&#151;which I think the hon. Gentleman needs to read
again&#151;states that we have changed where the burden of proof
lies. The directive separated colour and nationality from ethnic or
national origin, and put the burden of proof in tribunal proceedings on
one side for one group, and on the other side for another group.
Discrimination on the basis of colour and nationality, as the hon.
Gentleman knows, has been outlawed in this country for a generation.
There is no extension in the definition, which is what we are talking
about. When we come to talk about the burden of proof, I will explain
to the hon. Gentleman how it has been extended. The definition has not
changed.</div>
<a name="09061635000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000439"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I was not proposing a probing amendment or talking
about the definition. I do not see why the Minister should consider it
bonkers and misunderstand my point, which is that the Bill fully
extends that protection in other areas, which previously we were not
able to do. I return to my main point about whether the Government have
a view on the question of descent being part of the definition of
race.</div>
<a name="09061635000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000440"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It is extraordinary that somebody who
appears to focus so closely on some arcane points of discrimination law
can suggest that this is an extension of cover in clause 9. It is not.
It is carried forward from the old legislation. I am very surprised.
However, to look at another issue, in our view descent is likely to be
part of ethnic or national origin. In due course, we will get to the
meat of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s briefing note, and he will need to
find it again later in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09061635000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000441"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am disappointed that the Minister refuses to
answer the question and resorts to a delaying tactic of criticism and
abuse. That is not necessary in a Committee where, so far, we have had
effective scrutiny and a good dialogue. She may see it as an
opportunity to show-boat and grandstand her great expertise, and we
recognise her experience as a lawyer. The question that I urge the
Minister to address is for what reason have the Government chosen not
to include descent in the definition of race under the clause? Does she
think that it is adequately protected otherwise? Is not extending the
clause in that way a policy decision made by the Minister, whose
responsibility is to steer the Bill through the
Committee?</div><a name="09061635000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000442"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000448"></a>Dr.

to probe the extent to which the Government agree with the case law
that has emerged. Amendment 215 would clarify that</div>
<a name="09061635000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
meaning of religion or belief does not include whether, or the degree
to which, a person has one or more of another protected

are two other amendments on the amendment paper, which were not tabled

relation to the protected characteristic of religion or belief, so that
a reference to a person&#146;s religion or belief would not include
reference to that person&#146;s other protected
characteristics.</div><a name="09061635000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point about the amendment is to question whether the Government agree
that it is not acceptable for people to seek to use the opportunity,
which exists rightly, to discriminate on the grounds of religion in
certain matters such as employment where certain conditions are met, on
the basis that a criterion is set for religion, which is not met in the
definition of religion, because someone is gay, or, less
directly&#151;although I think it goes to the heart of what
one&#146;s sexual orientation is&#151;because someone is having
sexual relations outside marriage. For example, someone may be having
sex with someone of the same gender and, by definition, that will
always be sex outside
marriage.</div><a name="09061635000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had assertions from people representing religious organisations
that they should be entitled to discriminate on the basis of sexual
orientation, although they point out that it is not on the basis of the
fact that a person is attracted to someone of the same gender, but on
the basis that they act on that attraction and are engaged in otherwise
lawful sexual relationships with someone of the same
gender.</div><a name="09061635000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
case law, we have had a number of judges who were very
clear.</div>
<a name="09061635000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000449"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am not trying to pick on the hon. Gentleman, but
he said that amendment 215 was not as brilliantly drafted as it might
have been. I sat here,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div>wishing to stop him before he got on to the specifics. Amendment 215
says:</div>
<a name="09061635000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
meaning of religion or belief does not include whether, or the degree
to which, a person has one or more of another protected
characteristic.&#148;</div><a name="09061635000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
may be that I am particularly dense, but I do not have the faintest
idea what it means. Perhaps other members of the Committee do not
either. Will the hon. Gentleman explain what he is getting
at?</div><a name="09061635000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000450"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I was going to through the example that I gave. It
may be argued by some people that someone cannot be of the religion,
criteria having been set on that, if they are gay. That is basically
what I am saying. For example, there is a provision in the Bill, which
I think we all support, whereby a religious test could be required for
some employment. The definition of religion is given in the Bill.
Prospective and actual employers might be under the impression that
they can say, &#147;This person does not practise the right sort of
religion.&#148; I do not want to name any particular religions,
because it gets invidious, but I fear that I may have to.</div>
<a name="09061635000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us take
Catholicism as an example&#151;I do not say that this occurs, but one
can see how it might. Such an employer would say that someone has to be
a Catholic in order to work for them. That person might indeed be a
Catholic but, if they are gay, it could be the view of the employer
that they do not fulfil a religious criterion because orthodoxy in that
religion&#151;Catholicism might not be a good example&#151;cannot
include someone who is gay or, more frequently, expresses a sexual
orientation that by definition leads them to be outside the religion.
An amendment that we will come to later deals with that. So a potential
employer will say, as they have in briefings to this Committee, that
they do not seek to discriminate against people who are gay, but that
they want to be able to discriminate against people who have gay
sex.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000453"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I will give way in a moment, if I may, to the hon.
Gentleman who asked the original question. I want to ask him whether he
understands the point that I am making.</div>
<a name="09061635000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Employers
want to be able to discriminate on the basis of religion, not on the
basis of sexual orientation, where they have less scope, for reasons
that we will come on to discuss. The person may not fulfil the
religious criteria that they are laying down, because their lifestyle
may be incompatible with religious orthodoxy. May I ask the hon.
Gentleman if he understands the point that I am
making?</div>
<a name="09061635000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000454"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that explanation. I
am clear about the point that he made and, now that he has made it more
clearly, I can see that I do not agree with it. The example that he
chose was a particularly poor one. As a Roman Catholic, I should
declare an interest, but I do not think his point was well made. I do
not know of any mainstream religion that actually discriminates, or
says that someone cannot be a believer in that religion because of one
of the protected 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 215</div>characteristics. There is nothing in Catholic teaching that says someone
cannot be a Roman Catholic if they are
gay.</div><a name="09061635000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s particular point about employment, which we
will come on to later, the teaching does say that if, for example,
someone wants to be employed in a particular role within that Church,
their behaviour&#151;what they do, not what they are&#151;has to
meet certain standards. Those are two very different things. That is
why I was having trouble following the meaning of his amendment 215,
which talks about someone having protected characteristics and not
being able to be part of a religion, rather than carrying out certain
behaviours, which do not necessarily follow from that protected
characteristic.</div>
<a name="09061635000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000455"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> First, I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman
understands my point. I accept that one can make the differentiation. I
just seek to make it clear that a test on conduct has to be argued on
that basis and not on the basis of religious criteria. The point I am
making is that we will see exceptions, based on sexual orientation or
conduct issues, that are entirely separate and, in respect of
discrimination allowed in employment by religious organisations on the
basis of sexual orientation, far narrower than those allowed on the
basis of religion or
belief.</div><a name="09061635000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
could go into where that is in the schedules but the hon. Gentleman
should take it from me that there is more scope&#151;there are fewer
qualifying conditions to be met&#151;in order for an employment
exemption to be made on the basis of religion than sexual orientation.
I think one can understand why, and I am not opposing those per se. It
is important that the religious criteria, which can be used in more
cases, are not used as a proxy for discrimination on the basis of
sexual orientation, or sexual practice, which is closely linked to
sexual orientation.</div>





<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000456"></a>John
Mason:</b> I rise to follow on from the point made by the hon.
Member for Forest of Dean. I wonder whether the hon. Member for Oxford,
West and Abingdon would accept that, for most religions, including
Christianity, Islam and Judaism, sexual behaviour is dealt with within
the religion. There are certain standards that are expected. The
religion also goes into people&#146;s attitudes, but the main point
is that sexual behaviour is dealt with and is a concern to the major
religions.</div><a name="09061635000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000457"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Indeed. I do not think that we can change the fact
that it is a concern. However, we are talking about the law of the
land, and I am clear that what I want to be confirmed is that, if
people want to discriminate against others in a post or in a religion,
on the grounds of sexual orientation, they need to do so on the basis
of the framework set out in the schedules for sexual orientation and
not seek to do it on the basis of religion&#151;I will go into why

noon</div><a name="09061635000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue that the hon. Gentleman has just raised underlines the point that
many religious people hold the view that one cannot, in some
orthodoxies, for example, be a Muslim if one is gay or is having gay
sex. I am not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div>seeking to castigate them for doing that&#151;they
are entitled to their view&#151;but we have to make sure that people
do not suffer in employment and other areas from the pursuance of that
view. That should not be provided
for.</div><a name="09061635000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000458"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Can the hon. Gentleman clarify, to me at least,
whether he is prepared to consider that sexual behaviour, as opposed to
sexual orientation, could, in certain circumstances, be a legitimate
interest for religion? If he is saying that the religious hierarchies
are unable to make judgments, on the basis of their moral view, about
what is, or is not permitted by way of behaviour, as opposed to
orientation, we should know that that is his position, which I do not
share.</div>
<a name="09061635000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000459"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I refer the hon. Gentleman to schedule 9, if I
may, because it is important to understand what exemptions exist. I am
not arguing against them. I am arguing that the exemptions should be
used in the  right way, dealing with the right thing. Paragraph
2 of  schedule 9, on page 181 of volume II of the
Bill, is headed, &#147;Religious requirements relating to sex,
marriage etc., sexual orientation.&#148; In sub-paragraphs (1) to
(8)&#151; sub-paragraph (8) has been mentioned
previously&#151; paragraph 2 sets out the basis upon which
sexual orientation can be used as a basis for discriminating in
employment and it is a good example. One can see that that is
limited&#151;an issue that we dealt with in Committee&#151;by
sub-paragraph (8), which states that employment, where
allowed,</div><a name="09061635000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
for the purposes of an organised religion only if the employment wholly
or mainly
involves&#151;</div><a name="09061635000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
leading or assisting in the observation of liturgical or ritualistic
practices of the religion,
or</div><a name="09061635000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
promoting or explaining the doctrine of the religion (whether to
followers of the religion or to
others).&#148;</div><a name="09061635000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
view is that the Government are right to put in statute the narrow
definition of that exemption that is allowed for in the original
directive and stems from the Amicus judgment. The Government won that
in a positive way for the people making the claim because the view was
that the provision in the original employment discrimination
regulations in 2003 had to be interpreted
narrowly.</div><a name="09061635000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
draw the attention of the hon. Member for Daventry to paragraph 3 over
the page, where there is a separate exemption headed, &#147;Other
requirements relating to religion or belief.&#148; It is a short
paragraph, where there is not that restriction on what can be done.
Therefore, an organisation with an ethos can put down &#147; an
occupational requirement&#148; which
is</div><a name="09061635000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
proportionate means of achieving a legitimate
aim&#148;</div><a name="09061635000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">or
similar wording, as that itself is subject to amendment. Paragraph 3,
sub-paragraph (c) states
that</div><a name="09061635000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
person to whom A applies the requirement does not meet it (or A has
reasonable grounds for not being satisfied that the person meets
it).&#148;</div><a name="09061635000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is broader. My point is that, if someone wants to discriminate against
a person on the grounds of sexual orientation, they need to fit within
paragraph 2, rather than paragraph 3.</div>
<a name="09061635000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
that I raise that concern is that in evidence to us&#151;both oral
and written&#151;the Catholic Bishops Conference states, for example,
in written evidence E14 that it wants to be able</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div><a name="09061635000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to exclude from
a Parish position dealing with young people a candidate who
had&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09061635000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
it goes on to describe something to do with behaviour. A parish
position goes wider than someone dealing just with liturgy, as set out
in sub-paragraph (8). The Catholic Bishops Conference is saying that it
wants more room for manoeuvre. It gave the example of someone</div>
<a name="09061635000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;who had
divorced their spouse, civilly re-married and created two broken
families within the same Parish
community.&#148;</div><a name="09061635000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not necessarily need to go into that example, although that is a
rather subjective way of looking at someone&#146;s circumstances.
However, in its oral evidence, the Catholic Bishops&#146; Conference
says that it might wish to exclude from employment someone who is
having sex outside marriage. My point is that it should not be able to
do that on the grounds of the religious
exemption.</div>
<a name="09061635000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000460"></a>John
Mason:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that it would be
strange if, for example, a youth worker for a religious organisation
such as a Church were teaching that organisation&#146;s teachings to
young people, but living a life that was the opposite of what they were
teaching? Surely, the way in which they were teaching would lose
credibility.</div>
<a name="09061635000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000461"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> For obvious reasons, I do not want to go too far
into the wording of the schedule, but that is dealt with in
sub-paragraph (8), which says that if the employment</div>
<a name="09061635000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;wholly or
mainly involves...promoting or explaining the doctrine of the
religion (whether to followers of the religion or to
others&#148;</div><a name="09061635000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
person is entitled not simply to apply an indirect condition saying,
&#147;Don&#146;t have gay sex,&#148; but to discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation, where it is otherwise justified.
Sub-paragraph (8) is what should be relied on. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s example could fit that, and that is what the
organisation should use. However, one could not apply that to any youth
worker doing anything, because that would not necessarily
&#147;wholly or mainly&#148; involve</div>
<a name="09061635000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;promoting or
explaining the doctrine of the
religion&#148;.</div><a name="09061635000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Youth
workers employed, for example, by the Catholics do a great a job. It
will come as no surprise when I say that that is not simply because
they promote or explain the doctrine of their religion, but because of
the important wider work that they do, which is pastoral and not
necessarily religious&#151;indeed, many of their clientele will not
be religious at all, but will appreciate their
intervention.</div>
<a name="09061635000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000462"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am prepared to concede that there might be
cases in which I have some sympathy for what the hon. Gentleman is
arguing. Nevertheless, will he at least consider the possibility that
if conduct that is scandalous or an affront to the teachings of the
religion becomes public knowledge, that is likely to make it difficult
for a youth worker or somebody else in a pastoral position to discharge
their responsibilities, even if those are not within the rubric of
wholly, mainly or primarily</div>
<a name="09061635000215"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;promoting or
explaining the doctrine of the religion&#148;?</div>
<a name="09061635000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Something that is
clearly contrary to what is taught is, by itself, offensive and may be
subversive of the organisation&#146;s
teaching.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000463"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The hon. Gentleman puts his finger on the nub of
the whole question of sexual orientation discrimination in the Bill as
regards religious organisations.</div>
<a name="09061635000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000464"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> The hon. Gentleman says that this is the nub, but
he also used the words &#147;sexual orientation&#148;. Much of the
concern of the organised Churches and others relates to sexual
practice, rather than orientation. I just wanted correct
him.</div>
<a name="09061635000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000465"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> It is important that I deal briefly with this
question now because it comes up in the definition of sexual
orientation in another group of amendments, and I do not want to queer
the pitch, if hon. Members will excuse the expression.</div>
<a name="09061635000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">At paragraph
29 of the Amicus judgment, the judge, the honourable Mr.
Justice Richards, said:</div>
<a name="09061635000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Part
of the background to the wording of regulation 7(3),&#148;</div>
<a name="09061635000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">which was at
stake,</div><a name="09061635000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and
one of the matters that will need to be considered in examining the
challenge to that provision, is a distinction drawn between sexual
orientation and sexual
behaviour&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09061635000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">he
italicised the words &#147;orientation&#148; and
&#147;behaviour&#148;. He continues:</div>
<a name="09061635000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
regards the protection conferred by the Convention, however, I do not
consider there to be any material difference between them. Sexual
orientation and its manifestation in sexual behaviour are both
inextricably connected with a person&#146;s private life and
identity.&#148;</div><a name="09061635000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the subject of a later amendment, but it needs to be understood that
I, and more importantly case law, do not recognise that distinction in
discrimination law, as opposed to people&#146;s opinions. Whether the
Government agree is critical, and we will deal with that when we debate
another group of amendments.</div>
<a name="09061635000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000466"></a>John
Mason:</b> The hon. Gentleman is basically saying that sexual
orientation and sexual practice are so closely linked that they cannot
be separated in reality. Does he also accept that religious belief and
religious practice are so closely linked that they too cannot be
separated?</div>
<a name="09061635000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000467"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> It is not what I think, but what judges who have
interpreted employment regulations, the EU directive and the human
rights convention think. I quoted a judge. Judges have recognised that
sexual orientation and its manifestation&#151;not any sexual
conduct&#151;are inextricably connected with a person&#146;s
private life and identity such that one cannot draw a
distinction.</div>
<a name="09061635000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Case law may
not show that judges have taken a similar view on religion. We could
head down a series of paths had they done so. We will deal with that
question separately.</div>
<a name="09061635000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000468"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The reason why I have tried to probe the hon.
Gentleman on what amendment 215 meant is this: given the nub of his
argument about the nature of discrimination and employment and that we
are going to spend quite a lot of time talking about schedule 9, would
it not be better to deal with the issue there, rather than trying to
introduce a sweeping amendment about the definition of religion? I am
not aware of any mainstream 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div>individual who is outwith a religion because of one of the protected
characteristics, as opposed to their practice and
conduct.</div>
<a name="09061635000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000469"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> First, I concede the point that the amendment may
not be the best drafted&#151;I refer the hon. Gentleman to others on
the amendment paper that were not selected. The debate may well be
better placed or dealt with by a parliamentary agreement on the
intention of the measure.</div>
<a name="09061635000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the second
point, I think that the hon. Gentleman has made a concession. He said
that some people believe that sexual practice is a fundamental tenet of
religion that has to be followed. My point was that convention law, and
I believe our discrimination case law, make it clear that the
manifestation of sexual orientation, whether heterosexual, homosexual
or bisexual, is inextricably connected with sexual orientation. We are
saying that in law, religious organisations are not entitled to justify
religious discrimination to make a distinction between sexual
orientation and sexual
practice.</div><a name="09061635000230"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061635000470"></a><b class="B">Sandra
Osborne</b> (Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock) (Lab): Although I
accept that many organised religions do not accept homosexual sexual

Christians do not agree with that position. The General Assembly of the

minister who is currently living in a gay relationship and it is
looking at the general issue. What would be the implication of a Church

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000471"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> On the narrow issue, I welcome that, but I am
saying that what religions should believe is not my business. I am
interested in protecting people under discrimination law from the
potential impact of such beliefs. I have enough arguments with people
of religion to seek new ones. I understand that some people sincerely
feel that a person cannot be gay and be a
priest.</div><a name="09061635000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
paragraph 2(8) makes it clear that a religion is entitled when it
selects priests to apply discrimination based on sexual orientation. I
do not have a problem with Churches doing that. Whether or not I
support the view of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, it
is its business, as it should be. It should use the exception in
paragraph 2(8) if it does not wish to take such decisions. The fact
that the assembly has decided that it does not need to use paragraph
2(8)(a), even in a proselytising role, is of interest, but it is not my
main point. My main point is that religions should not be able to use
sexual orientation or its lawful manifestation as a basis for religious
discrimination.</div><a name="09061635000353"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000472"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I will be brief. First, the hon. Gentleman said
that it was not his business to tell religions what to believe, but
amendment 215 does exactly that. It says that the meaning of religion
or belief has something to do with protected characteristics and what
they can or cannot believe. Secondly, given that he has such a problem
with schedule 9 and some of its contents, why has he not tabled any
amendments to it?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div><a name="09061635000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000473"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I did not believe that we were dealing with
schedule 9 this week. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I think it
is useful to have the debate on this clause before deciding how to
handle schedule 9. I support it in its current form. It would be
bizarre to table amendments to something that I agree with, other than
to probe the background. I do not think that saying in discrimination
law that religion does not include sexual orientation in its definition
is in any way telling religions what to believe. Under article 9.1 of
the convention they have an absolute right to believe what they wish,
as we all do. What they believe is a matter for them. The state has an
interest and Parliament has an interest in protecting people from
discrimination.</div><a name="09061635000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000474"></a>John
Mason:</b> The hon. Gentleman emphasises the link between
sexual orientation and sexual practice. Would he accept that there is a
link between religious belief and religious practice and that it could
be discrimination against religious belief if we criticise and try to
tell religious people not only what they have to believe but what they
can put into
practice?</div><a name="09061635000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000475"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> We are all free to criticise everything. It would
be a huge restraint on freedom of expression if we were not free to
criticise anyone&#146;s views, especially  if they are
contentious. As the hon. Gentleman knows, I fundamentally support the
right of religious organisations to contend with each other as much as
possible. That is why I have supported free speech initiatives in this
House for a long
time.</div><a name="09061635000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Case
law&#146;s view is
this:</div><a name="09061635000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Sexual
orientation and its manifestation in sexual behaviour are both
inextricably connected with a person&#146;s private life and
identity&#148;</div><a name="09061635000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
so cannot be dealt with separately. We will come on to deal with
whether a manifestation of religious belief is part of the definition
and can be subject to a direct discrimination claim. The ruling in the
Ladele case by the Employment Appeal Tribunal was very clear. If a
service provider such as a council discriminates against a person who
believes it is wrong to provide a service to gay people, it is not
direct discrimination to subject them to detriment. It is indirect
discrimination, clearly, and in the Ladele case it was found to be
objectively justified. We can go into that when we get to that part of
the
Bill.</div><a name="09061635000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
need to deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Daventry. He
talked about scandalous behaviour. It will not be
sufficient&#151;that is the whole point about anti-discrimination
law&#151;for gay people to be sacked on the basis that their lawful
behaviour is deemed by their employer to be scandalous, whether that is
a religious employer or someone else, unless  the religious
employer can cite the exemption given in  paragraph 2 to
schedule 9. The requirements need to be met. If it is a priest, it is
not material whether they  think it is just because the Bible
says it is wrong,  they think it is scandalous, or there is
some other reason. The justification is not required as long as those
conditions are met, but if it is clearly random it will make it more
difficult to fulfil some of the conditions.</div>
<a name="09061635000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Simply saying
that something is scandalous tends to discriminate on the basis of
sexual orientation. That could enable someone to set a criterion in
employment that someone who is gay cannot&#151;or would
not&#151;meet 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div>if they act out their sexual orientation in their private life in a
normal manifestation, which is their absolute right. It means that
there will be no protection in employment law from discrimination based
on sexual orientation. That is why the amendment, or a version of it,
is needed somewhere, preferably in statute. I believe that it exists in
case law to protect individuals from such discrimination, but I would
be interested in the Minister&#146;s view as to whether that is the
case.</div>
<a name="09061635000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000476"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
elucidation of my point. He says that it is necessary to produce a
justification under paragraph 2 of schedule 9. As currently drafted,
paragraph 3, which deals with &#147;Other requirements relating to
religion or belief&#148; refers to</div>
<a name="09061635000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a proportionate
means of achieving a legitimate
aim&#148;.</div><a name="09061635000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
he saying that that is not, or could not, be relevant in this context
of behaviour? For this purpose, I draw a distinction between
orientation and behaviour.</div>
<a name="09061635000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000477"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> In my view, the distinction that the hon.
Gentleman makes between a lawful manifestation of sexual orientation
and sexual orientation is not valid, and I am backed up in that by the
judgment that I read out. That issue will be dealt with later. I accept
that we will have a shorter debate on the subject, Mr.
Benton, as we have covered much of the issue now. However, I do not
accept part of that premise.</div>
<a name="09061635000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 3
of schedule 9 cites</div>
<a name="09061635000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a requirement
to be of a particular religion or
belief&#148;.</div><a name="09061635000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
requirement cannot refer to sexual orientation, or its manifestation in
the terms that I have described&#151;its own manifestation, not any
manifestation or an unlawful one. That is what the probing amendment
seeks to clarify. I think that I have got that point across.</div>
<a name="09061635000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">A person can,
however, seek to make that distinction in paragraph 2. In sub-paragraph
(5), the application of a requirement on sexual
orientation&#151;which covers orientation or behaviour&#151;engages
the compliance principle, or the non-conflict principle in
sub-paragraph (6), which is to comply with doctrine. That means that
for proselytising or representative roles as set out in sub-paragraph
(8), the distinction can be made.</div>
<a name="09061635000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am trying
to ensure that people are clear that they cannot make that distinction
under the lower threshold in paragraph 3. The hon. Member for Daventry
nods, and I think that he understands the distinction that I make, even
if he does not necessarily agree with it. I hope that he will agree
with it, as there is clearly an option that allows religions to do what
he would wish them to do, if it can be justified under
sub-paragraph (2), regardless of whether something is
considered scandalous or simply
non-doctrinal.</div>
<a name="09061635000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000478"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> For the avoidance of doubt, and so as not to
weary the Committee with a long speech, I agree with the hon. Gentleman
regarding the prevention of employment to somebody on the grounds of a
characteristic that one does not like, which may not be under the
person&#146;s control. However, notwithstanding the strictures that
he has brought about, I feel that we must have regard to a situation
where the conduct of the person in practice, or their commitment to
refrain from that conduct, is not sufficient to satisfy the authorities
that it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>will not give rise to a scandalous situation. I do not think that it is
sufficient to put that in terms of the representative activities that
are adumbrated in  paragraph 2 of schedule 9. However, I agree
with the hon. Gentleman that that is the area in which we need to look
for relief.</div>
<a name="09061635000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000479"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I regret that the hon. Gentleman has put it in
that way and I hope that we can discuss what he is saying outside the
Committee. We are going back to the &#146;50s. If being gay is
scandalous&#151; <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am not saying
that the hon. Gentleman thinks that, but there are some religions that
think it is scandalous. Those religions should not be able to use that
as a basis for dismissing someone, or not employing them, unless they
comply with the role set out in paragraph 2(8), which regards
priesthood, or activities that are wholly or mainly involved in
representative or religious promotion or work. I defend the right to
make that distinction, but when it comes to a caretaker or a teacher in
a faith school, lawful private behaviour associated with a
person&#146;s sexual orientation cannot be used as a basis&#151;in
my view, under the schedule&#151;for their dismissal and the wrecking
of their life and career. That is why we have modern
anti-discrimination legislation. I do not seek to persuade religious
people that it is not scandalous; I only seek to ensure that the law
protects people from employers who hold that view about them either on
the basis of their sexual orientation or because they are
divorced.</div>
<a name="09061635000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">My last point
is that the example used by the Church in its written
evidence&#151;it did use the gay example in its oral evidence, which
was appropriately honest&#151;would also be unfair. If someone has a
role not otherwise covered by paragraph (2)(8) of schedule 9, the fact
that they get divorced&#151;which might happen for all sorts of
reasons, including domestic abuse&#151;should not be a basis for
losing their job unless they do a job where that is incompatible under
paragraph (2)(8), which is itself an expression of the European
directive to which we have signed up and essentially a treaty
obligation to which we are committed, as well as being compliant with
the European convention on human rights. It is only right that at some
point we should meet the lobbying of Church and other religious
organisations four-square, as I have sought to do. Not to do so would
mean that they were wasting their time in urging us to address such
points.</div>
<a name="09061635000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000480"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> The hon. Gentleman is beginning to draw out a
sensitive argument. Does he not agree that in cases where the Church
authorities have legitimate concerns, as opposed to cases involving a
blatant attempt simply to pay somebody off because of their
orientation, given that there is an interaction between religion and
belief and other rights, it would be much more appropriate to seek some
kind of mediation or resolution of any dispute rather than simply
reaching for the litigation revolver and pursuing the matter through
the court? It is a prudential issue. It would be possible for the
Church authorities, for example, to explain the nature of their concern
and the likely pastoral impact of the situation that might arise: in
other words, an implied justification under paragraph (2) of the
schedule.</div><a name="09061635000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000481"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> We are all in favour of mediation, but in the end,
minorities who are discriminated against&#151;there is no doubt that
they are, and I know the hon. Gentleman&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>personal commitment to ensuring that we eliminate such
discrimination&#151;must have recourse to the law, and the law should
be clear. If it says clearly that paragraph (3) of schedule 9 cannot be
used to say to someone who is gay or having gay sex, &#147;You are
not an orthodox member of X religion if you are sexually active
according to your sexual orientation,&#148; it would be helpful. Then
the organisations will know that they must be able to defend their
actions under some other provision.</div>
<a name="09061635000253"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061635000482"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Drew</b> (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op): I have been biting my
tongue for some time now. Can the hon. Gentleman understand the problem
that some of us will have with it? If someone is dismissed, for
whatever reason, they might immediately come back to the organisation
that employed them and allege religious discrimination. Is that not a
real and ongoing problem? We need to be assured that that is not what
lies behind his amendment. We might wish to have this debate later in
consideration of the Bill, when it might be more appropriate. That is
what is at the root of the problem: religious discrimination could be
alleged, regardless of the original reason for the
dismissal.</div>
<a name="09061635000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000483"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman means that one
could allege sexual orientation discrimination regardless of the
trigger for the dismissal. There is not a huge number of such cases,
thank goodness. The Reaney case in the diocese of Chester went to an
employment tribunal, which at first gave a ruling that did not satisfy
either side as to the scope of the conditions in which sexual
orientation can be used as a criteria. That is why, when we come to it,
paragraph (2)(8) of schedule 9 is very useful, because it puts things
clearly in a way that does not exist at the
moment.</div><a name="09061635000354"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="09061635000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there are not that many cases. We want there not to be that many cases.
It would be helpful if the law were clear that if someone has gay sex,
it is a sexual orientation matter, not a religious matter. Regardless
of what our views are, I hope that that need not divide the Committee
on the grounds of individual religious belief. I shall deal with the
second amendment in the group more briefly, but I hope that hon.
Members will recognise that my contribution has been so long mainly
because I have taken interventions.</div>
<a name="09061635000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 216
would, again, clarify the fact that the definition of religion or
belief for the purposes of the Bill should not include support for
matters of public policy or the policies of a political party. That is
also restated in amendment 236, which was not selected because it was
tabled after the deadline for selection. Amendment 216 makes the point
that it is important that, for example, religious
employers&#151;although it extends beyond employment&#151;cannot
say that someone will not fulfil a religious criterion if they are, for
example, pro-choice. It is certainly the case that orthodox Catholic
doctrine is not pro-choice; it is anti-abortion. However, that issue
should not be the basis on which a religious criterion should be judged
to be met, because it goes too far away from doctrine and theology
towards matters of public policy. In a sense, we would be allowing a
political 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div>test&#151;not necessarily a party political test&#151;that should
not otherwise exist, to benefit from the wider exemption that exists
for religion or belief. It may well be the case that employers
require&#151;as we do in Parliament&#151;a political test, and that
is lawful. However, that should not be dressed up as part of the
definition of religion or
belief.</div><a name="09061635000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000484"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> This is the second amendment in this group in
relation to which the hon. Gentleman is attempting to define what is or
is not a religious belief. The point that he just made goes to the
heart of the issue. For religions that take a pro-life position and
have a particular view of when life starts, such opinions are a
fundamental part of their belief. Indeed, that is recognised as such in
our present law&#151;I think that he acknowledged this during the
evidence sessions&#151;given that we allow professionals involved in
medical services not to be involved in delivering and procuring
abortions if that is something that offends against their conscience. I
think that he did not disagree with that, because he recognised it was
the law. In relation to this part of the Bill, why is he again trying
to define what religions are or are not allowed to
believe?</div><a name="09061635000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000485"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his useful
intervention. One of the reasons why I am seeking to clarify the matter
is that I believe that exemptions such as those that exist in the
Abortion Act 1967 and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990
should be statutory. They should be set out in statute&#151;as,
indeed, they are&#151;and in so far as that legislation goes, I
support such measures. However, I am seeking to clarify the fact that I
do not believe that such provisions should be applied generally. In
other words, people should not be able to look to non-discrimination on
the basis of religion and belief and seek protection from
discrimination when they are, for example, a doctor who says that it is
their religion or belief that unmarried women should not be prescribed
the contraceptive pill. If their medical employer or the General
Medical Council seeks to insist that they do what I would consider to
be their job as a doctor and says that they should provide the
appropriate clinical care&#151;including providing a prescription or
a supply of contraception to women who are entitled to have it whether
they are unmarried or not&#151;they cannot rely on a claim of direct
discrimination. It would be helpful to make that clear, which is why
the hon. Gentleman has done us a service by making that
point.</div>
<a name="09061635000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
saying that there should be no statutory exemptions on the grounds of
strongly held religious belief&#151;for example, in relation to
doctors who do not want to play a part in providing abortion services.
I am on the record as supporting the compromise that was fashioned in a
room in the basement in 1967 by Lord Steel and others, and I do not
seek to remove it. It is a separate statutory exemption, and I believe
that it needs to be; we should not allow any creep of protection from
religious discrimination to cover
it.</div><a name="09061635000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other area that I am concerned about is the increasing politicisation
of religion in the form of religious parties, such as the Islamic party
of Britain and the Christian Peoples Alliance. I strongly support their
right to exist and to run as political parties. I am in favour of free
expression and of religious organisations coming directly to the
political table, as well as indirectly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 225</div>through the impressive lobbying work that they do as lobbying
organisations. However, when bodies such as the Christian Peoples
Alliance are seen as political parties, it is important that they do
not think that they uniquely, as a political party, could cite
protection against discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief
to give them special privileges, in a way that the Conservative party,
the Labour party, the Liberal Democrats or the Scottish nationalists
could not. For example, if the Christian Peoples Alliance and other
smaller parties were not invited to a hustings&#151;although I
believe that everyone is entitled to be invited, including the British
National party if it has paid its deposit and is standing&#151;such a
party could not claim religious discrimination on the basis of who the
people signed up to it
are.</div><a name="09061635000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
final point on this matter is intended to make it clear that the
theological basis for believing that life begins at conception is okay.
There is nothing wrong with that, or with the political expression of
that in public policy. All the amendment says is that one cannot rely
only, or at all, on the degree of support for matters of public policy
or for the policies of a political party. Therefore, it is fine if
someone happens to support the ProLife Alliance and also happens to
demonstrate that they are of that religion, but it is the latter limb
and not the former that is the important provision. Otherwise, one
could have people who are not theologically of that religion but who
subscribe to that policy platform to seek the protection of the
anti-discrimination legislation that exists for matters of religion or
belief but not for maters of political belief. It is therefore
important that we recognise that the religion or belief that we are
seeking to protect is a theological one and not a matter of public
policy. On the basis of probing those two important areas, I commend
the amendments to the
Committee.</div><a name="09061635000262"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000486"></a>John
Mason:</b> As this is the first time that I have spoken on a
matter of religion in this Committee and as I suspect that we will have
a lot of discussion on religion in the sittings ahead of us, I want to
make it clear that I speak personally and not as a spokesperson for my
party.</div><a name="09061635000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Among
the wider public there is a lot of concern about some of these issues,
but I accept that those of us who are seriously involved in religion
are probably a minority in society. I guess that the committed
Christian population is around 5 per cent. I know that there are people
in my party and I guess in other parties here who would question
whether we should even be discussing some of these issues, as we try to
tie together sexual orientation, sexual behaviour, religious belief and
religious behaviour and practice. This can be a difficult area, but the
Committee should have the opportunity to discuss the place of religion
in our
society.</div><a name="09061635000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
people feel that religion is the poor relation of the protected
characteristics, and there is some evidence that employers and others
will tend to decide against religion if there is a clash of rights. If
it is the considered opinion of the Committee and of Parliament as a
whole that religion should come last, let us make that clear and accept
it. However, the matter should be discussed. I accept that the wider
Church has been very intolerant of minorities in the past, and perhaps
the rest of society now feels that it is time for the Church to take a
bit of a kicking for the next few years. If that is what society feels,
it has some right to do it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div><a name="09061635000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I might
disagree with the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon on a few
things, but I respect his consistency and the fact that we know where
he is coming from. I hope that the Committee will not accept the two
amendments, which are not necessary and would damage religious freedom.
One purpose of the Bill is meant to be protection against
anti-religious discrimination, not enshrining it. The explanatory
statement accompanying amendment 215
says:</div><a name="09061635000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
is to make sure that organisations or individuals cannot use exemptions
based on religion or belief to discriminate on another ground for
example against persons whose lifestyle, because they are gay or
unmarried, is not consistent with orthodox practice of that religion or
belief.&#148;</div><a name="09061635000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
recognises that the orthodox teaching of most of the main world
religions&#151;Christianity, Islam and Judaism, although there are
others&#151;is that sexual activity outside marriage is morally
wrong, yet the amendment seeks to dictate to adherents of those
religions that they could not apply such teachings in their own
affairs. It would tell them that they could not live those teachings
out and ensure that certain manifestations of orthodox religious faith
were
illegal.</div><a name="09061635000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
used the words &#147;seeks to&#148; because, as we heard last week
in the evidence session relating to schedule 9, there are large
question marks over whether the Bill narrows the already fairly limited
protections for employment in Churches. All such religious
organisations want is to be able to insist on staff whose lifestyle
does not contradict the teaching of their religion. It might be that
the effect desired under amendment 215 is already achieved under the
Bill, but we shall return to that another
day.</div><a name="09061635000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
views on sexual ethics that amendment 215 targets are mainstream views
that religious groups generally hold and have held. Along with views on
many other ethical issues untouched by the Bill, those views are very
dear to them. They have upheld such beliefs in their churches and
places of worship, in their own internal affairs, with little
complaint, and it is what they teach from the pulpits and what they try
to practise in their own
lives.</div><a name="09061635000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether
we agree with those religious groups is not the real issue, and as
parliamentarians surely we do not exist to legislate on the beliefs of
adherents to any religion. It is hard to see why there should be
opposition to the idea that religious groups should regard living in
accordance with their teachings on sexual ethics as a necessary part of
observance of their faith. There are two sets of employment protections
for religious groups&#151;that has already been referred to. One set
allows for discrimination based on religion or belief, while another
allows discrimination on other grounds, such as sexual orientation.
They are referred to under paragraphs 3 and 2 respectively of schedule
9.</div><a name="09061635000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
215 would impose further limits and protections, which already require
religious groups to jump through hoops just to maintain their basic
freedom of association. It would provide more opportunity for people
hostile to the views of religious organisations to try to haul them
before employment tribunals in an effort to make them change their
beliefs. We have already seen that in cases brought against Christian
organisations by the British Humanist Association and by
Stonewall.</div><a name="09061635000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Churches
and other religious organisations&#151;and, I would suggest,
non-religious organisations&#151;should have the right not to employ
someone with views seriously at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div>variance with their basic teaching. Surely we should leave such cases
well alone and promote diversity and understanding, rather than a
uniform greyness in our
society.</div><a name="09061635000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is my desire not that the Churches impose their will on everyone else,
but that we, as minority groups, should be able to live with each other
in society. Do we really want to make it easier for people to sue
Churches?</div><a name="09061635000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000487"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that it would be
illegal, and rightly so, for a gay organisation or a gay bar to sack
someone on the basis of their religious belief? Are not the amendment
and the Bill, with which he disagrees, just asking for reciprocity and
recognising that there are narrow exemptions that get religious
organisations and employers out of that duty of reciprocity? Does he
accept that religious people benefit from anti-discrimination
legislation because they are protected from being dismissed on account
of their religious
views?</div><a name="09061635000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000488"></a>John
Mason:</b> I am totally committed to reciprocity, if that
means that we treat each other equally and respect each other&#146;s
differences even when we disagree. I am not looking for special
protection for religious groups. However, I suggest that a gay
organisation should expect, when recruiting, that someone working for
it should be committed to its ethos, as I would expect in the Churches.
If someone is working for a gay organisation and changes their views to
the extent of being opposed to that organisation, the long-term
employment relationship would be extremely
difficult.</div><a name="09061635000355"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="09061635000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000489"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Further to the intervention that the hon.
Gentleman is dealing with, before the memory of it fades, would he not
agree that one of the concerns for people with religious faith is that
some of the protections already in place may not be as strong as
previously thought, or may be faltering? I am thinking, for example, of
persons of faith and their attitude to Sunday
employment.</div><a name="09061635000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000490"></a>John
Mason:</b> A number of religious groups&#151;I am not saying
that it is all of them&#151;would perceive that there is a move in
society broadly against religion. Things that were assumed in the past,
such as no ferries in the Western Isles on Sundays and such like, are
being challenged or questioned, whereas in the past people accepted
them without really thinking about the
matter.</div><a name="09061635000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000491"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I want to bring the hon. Gentleman back to his
remarks on ethos&#151;I know he has his notes to hand. Is he saying
that one can be correctly perceived as opposing the ethos of an
organisation merely on the basis of one&#146;s sexual
orientation?</div><a name="09061635000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000492"></a>John
Mason:</b> Earlier, the hon. Gentleman was saying that we
cannot distinguish between sexual orientation and sexual practice. I am
now wondering whether he is suggesting that we are separating the two.
I must admit that I am somewhat confused by his
position.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 228</div><a name="09061635000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000493"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I shall ask the question in two parts. Regardless
of whether the hon. Gentleman believes that sexual orientation and the
manifestation of that sexual orientation in a lawful way are one and
the same, does he believe that simply by being of a certain sexual
orientation one can be against an ethos of an organisation? Or does he
believe that, by practising the manifestation of that sexual
orientation within the law, one can be against the ethos of that
organisation? Is that his
contention?</div><a name="09061635000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000494"></a>John
Mason:</b> What I am trying to say is that a religious
organisation might perceive its ethos and standards as tighter than,
and being of a different level from, what is allowed in society
generally. Going back to the example of a youth worker, which is
specifically mentioned as an example on page 181 of the explanatory
notes, someone who is working for a Church as a youth worker,
effectively in a pastoral role with young people and teaching them that
the only place that they should have sex is within a committed
marriage, it is difficult to consider how that person could themselves
believe the exact opposite, whether it be sex outside marriage with the
opposite gender or with the same gender. I find it hard in that
situation to split between sexual orientation and sexual
practice.</div><a name="09061635000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Going
back to my speech, these are religious matters that are internal to
religious organisations. We should tread carefully before legislating
on such sensitive issues. People who disagree with the beliefs of
religious organisations have the freedom to seek employment elsewhere,
but religious organisations have nowhere else to go to exercise their
freedom of association if the law forces them to employ people who
reject the tenets of their faith. I am happy to accept that it is more
difficult once someone is in employment and changes their position.
However, the large majority of cases that we are thinking about arise
when recruiting staff. Strangely enough, although the explanatory
statement mentions the unmarried, it is perfectly legal to dismiss a
church youth worker who moves in with a partner of the opposite sex.
Nothing in the Bill would change that&#151;it would still be lawful.
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon explained a little more
about what he meant by amendment 216. I have been left guessing as to
what kind of organisation he was referring
to.</div><a name="09061635000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000495"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am not sure that that is right. I would be
grateful if the Minister clarified the situation in her remarks. I am
not sure that a heterosexual, having lawful heterosexual sex, is not a
manifestation of their sexual orientation. I agree that the issue is
trickier, because they are not usually a discriminated-against group. I
caution the hon. Gentleman against asserting so solidly that someone
can be dismissed on the basis of a lawful relationship in their private
life unless they are covered by the narrow provision that deals with
those in a proselytising role&#151;if I may describe paragraph 2(8)
of schedule 9 in that way&#151;especially under the European
convention on human
rights.</div><a name="09061635000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000496"></a>John
Mason:</b> I stand to be corrected by those with greater legal
knowledge, but as a general principle, many associations that have
nothing to do with religion have sets of rules that it is possible to
break while remaining within the law. An example is having to wear a
tie in Committee. There is therefore a distinction.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column229" />Column number: 229</div><a name="09061635000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">We received
clarification earlier on the kind of organisations at which amendment
216. For example, political parties with a religious bent should not
receive special treatment. I am happy to agree with the hon. Member for
Oxford, West and Abingdon on that point. I am probably less sympathetic
to religious parties than him because I would rather see people of
religion in all parties. However, the proposal could damage religious
organisations whose beliefs overlap incidentally with certain public
policy positions. For example, a requirement that an employee believes
in good stewardship of the environment would be a natural outworking of
the faith of many religious bodies. However, it appears that amendment
216 would allow somebody who rejects that belief to claim that they are
being unlawfully discriminated against if they are turned down for a
job. Similarly, religious groups that believe that marriage should be
promoted in public policy could be sued, even though a belief in that
view is an obvious requirement for them to make of a new
employee.</div><a name="09061635000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
religious bodies are also registered charities. They cannot advocate
support for political parties, but the Charity Commission recognises
their freedom to advocate positions that overlap with those of
political parties. The commission&#146;s guidance document, CC9,
&#147;Speaking out: Guidance on Campaigning and Political Activity by
Charities&#148;, states under the heading, &#147;Support for
policies&#148;:</div><a name="09061635000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is acceptable for a charity to advocate support for a particular policy
advocated by a political party or candidate, provided that the policy
supports the charity&#146;s purposes. However a charity must not
support a political party or
candidate.&#148;</div><a name="09061635000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
if a charity advocates a policy and is recruiting a worker to promote
it, the charity must be able to insist that he or she supports that
policy. The fact that the charity is religious should not deprive it of
that
freedom.</div><a name="09061635000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
amendment 216 achieved its goal, it would create an obvious injustice,
because we as political parties can impose requirements about
supporting policy positions on our staff, yet religious groups would be
deprived of that freedom. As it happens, some politics is not protected
ground. Any employer, religious or not, could require support for a
political party as a pre-condition of employment and nobody could sue
them. I do not advocate that, but I simply point out that one cannot
sue for political discrimination&#151;and rightly so, because that
would create a
minefield.</div><a name="09061635000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
it is ironic that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon tabled
amendments 215 and 216, as well as amendment 217 in the next group. I
do not intend to speak to it, but it is worth pointing out that
although amendments 215 and 216 would impose new limits on the
manifestation of religion, amendment 217 would widen the legal right to
manifest sexual orientation. That would mean religion being further
relegated within equality law and more narrowly defined than other
strands. I hope that the Minister and the Committee will not give
religious bodies further cause for concern about the impact of the new
legislation and will oppose the two
amendments.</div><a name="09061635000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061635000497"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The intention behind amendment 215 is
to ensure that organisations or individuals do not misuse the various
exceptions available to religious organisations to discriminate against
people unlawfully because aspects of their lifestyle, such as sexual
orientation, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div>are not in keeping with the tenets of the religion or belief in
question. My note says that that fails entirely to understand the
construction of the Bill, but I will not read it
out.</div><a name="09061635000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill identifies each of the nine characteristics that we are seeking to
protect and gives precise definitions of what constitutes each of them.
As such, it is clear what each characteristic is and what level of
protection is afforded to it. Although I appreciate that a
person&#146;s religious belief should not be used to justify unlawful
discrimination, I consider that the Bill makes it entirely clear that
that is not
permitted.</div><a name="09061635000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
discrimination takes place, the protected characteristic is the ground
on which the discrimination takes place. Any protected characteristic
that the perpetrator of the discrimination may possess is not relevant.
For instance, the exception available to religious organisations in
schedule 23 sets out exactly what such organisations can and cannot do
in relation to other protected
characteristics.</div><a name="09061635000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
a person is discriminated against because of his or her sexual
orientation, the reason for that discrimination is because of their
sexual orientation, irrespective of the motive of the person actually
causing the discrimination. It would not matter that a person claimed
that they were acting in a particular way because of their religions
beliefs. The discrimination would still be because of the
characteristic of sexual orientation, so any exception that could be
considered applicable because of religion or belief would not come into
play.</div><a name="09061635000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
pause just to appreciate and acknowledge the concerns of the hon.
Member for Glasgow, East, were the Government to accept the
amendments&#151;which they will not do. He knows that there are some
religious exceptions. Indeed, Committee members have debated those a
little bit this afternoon, even though we have yet to reach them
because they are in schedule 9. However, we do not think that those
exceptions have narrowed. We have no intentions of facilitating a
kicking for religion in any way at all. The religious exceptions have
been carried forward in the way that they were before.
The hon. Gentleman made a number of significant
points, but, with respect to him, I will not rehearse them in detail,
because we will not accept the amendments. Therefore his worries can, I
hope, be set
aside.</div><a name="09061635000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 216, the same answer that I have given on the question of
sexual orientation applies to public policy. Adhering to a particular
aspect of public policy is not a protected strand, but if there were
some way in which it was discriminatory to deal with somebody for
holding a particular belief, somehow, within one of the protected
characteristics, then the reasoning why it was done and the religious
position that gave rise to that discrimination would not facilitate the
actions of the person who, none the less, discriminated, because, as I
have already said, the discrimination would be because of the
characteristic protected. Despite there being a religious motivation,
that does not save anyone from being guilty of
discrimination.</div><a name="09061635000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill makes it clear&#151;I am not sure whether the hon. Member for
Oxford, West and Abingdon thought it did not&#151;that a
person&#146;s political beliefs are not captured by any of the
provisions that apply to religion or belief. There is abundant case law
showing that political beliefs are not covered by the current
legislation, which the Bill mirrors, pretty well precisely, and that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div>case law will still apply. The explanatory notes reiterate that point. I
am sure that the hon. Gentleman has read those notes and seen that that
is
so.</div><a name="09061635000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is pretty clear already that a person&#146;s political
beliefs would not be captured in the way that amendment 216 seeks to
prevent. I hope that I have dealt with the point regarding public
policy and I have said all that the Government wish to say about
amendment 215. I respectfully urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw
amendment 215. It has been a most interesting
debate.</div><a name="09061635000298"></a>

being a factor. I will reflect on that. I think that we will be able to
