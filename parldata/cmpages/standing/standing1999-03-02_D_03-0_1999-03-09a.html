<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): I beg  to move amendment No. 9, in page 2, line 6, at end  insert   
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5A) The fourth condition shall not be satisfied if the scheme  does not allow a member   
<P>
(a) to leave the scheme and transfer all his funds from the  scheme without charge; or  
<P>
(b) to change his contribution level at least once every year  without charge or penalty.'. 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. McWilliam. You are  stern but fair, and I know from experience that if I am  tempted to stray from the hard and steady path of  righteousness and virtue, you will brusquely rein me back.  There is little danger of that happening, however, even for  a second or two.  
<P>
The Bill is, as I have said, important. Few people will  not be affected by it. Those who work will have to look  seriously at how they provide for their pensions. Every  employer will be affected by stakeholder pensions and,  later in our proceedings, we will deal with important  issues relating to divorce and benefits. It is right that  Parliament takes seriously its classical role of ensuring  that the Government's legislative proposals are  thoroughly examined. The clauses should be fully  explained so that we can anticipate any problems.  
<P>
I hope that the Government will accept amendment No. 9. It is an important provision that is mentioned in  the Green Paper, "A new contract for welfare: partnership  in pensions"  , on which the Bill is based. The Bill should  also be based on the statutory consultation period, but the  Opposition believe that that period has been breached.  The Government have introduced their legislative  proposals without waiting for comments from the general  public, experts outside the House or those on whom the  provisions might impact.  
<P>
It is strange that my amendment deals with an issue  that is tackled in the Green Paper but not in the Bill. Had  the consultation period been allowed to run to 31 March,  people may have commented on that and the Government  would have explained any discrepancy between the Bill  and the Green Paper. They have not been able to do that  because there has not been a period of consultation.  
<P>
We take the Green Paper seriously. Chapter seven deals  with stakeholder pensions. The end of paragraph 32 on  page 54 sets out the provision. It states that the  Government propose  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that members are able to transfer their funds to another scheme at  any time, and without any additional charge on their funds"  .     
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
That is enshrined in the amendment and I hope that the  Minister of State, Department of Social Security will  accept it. If he can improve the wording, I shall not argue,  because I am sure that he is good at drafting legislation  and he has experts to help him. If he can accept the  principle of the amendment but wishes to rephrase it, we  would support a Government amendment that achieves  the same purpose, but it would be strange if the  Government could not accept the principle of the  amendment.  
<P>
There is protection for occupational pension schemes  in the Pension Schemes Act 1993 and scheme members  can take out the capital equivalent transfer value without  charge or penalty and purchase a personal pension if  they so wish. However, there is no statutory protection  for people to transfer out of a personal pension scheme  into an occupational pension scheme or another personal  pension scheme without charge. There are no statutory  maximum charges or protection for such transfers,  which were made possible by the previous Government,  and there is no regulation of costs, charges or penalties.  I hope that it is common ground on both sides of the  House that that is a lacuna in the system. Some people  believe that they have been hard done by as a result.  To ensure that as we add to the corpus of pension  legislation we steadily improve it, it is important that  the Bill is explicit, as is the Green Paper, in providing  for cost-free transfer.  
<P>
The other part of the amendment would provide a right  for members of stakeholder pension schemes     
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to change his contribution level at least once every year without  charge or penalty."    
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
That is a reasonable compromise between enabling  someone to plan his pension provision and to alter it in  the light of changing circumstances and the need to ensure  that the scheme does not incur excessive costs from  people making changes every month or week, which  would be irresponsible. I hope that the Minister of State  will be able to accept that.  
<P>
I am not sure whether the Minister and I see eye to eye  on the importance of a right of transfer. We have tabled  other amendments to enshrine the right of employees to  choose their own stakeholder scheme and to use an  existing personal pension scheme or other pension scheme  to be designated a stakeholder scheme so that the  employer will then be able to discharge his liability under  the Bill by opening a payroll deduction facility in favour  of the scheme chosen by the employee. We also  propose I am not being paid by the Treasury for putting  forward these proposals that a lifelong individual  savings account should be an adequate stakeholder  pension scheme, and that an employee should be able to  designate a LISA so that the employer can discharge his  liability by opening a payroll deduction facility in favour  of the LISA. Our principle is to allow as wide a range of  sound pension products as possible.  
<P>
We want people to be able to exercise choice.  Parliament should not state definitively what is the best  product. There is continual technological progress in the  financial services and other industries. Increased  productivity is characteristic of all successful industries,  so costs can fall over time. We want to be able to take  advantage of that. We want a competitive and dynamic  financial services industry that can address the market and  offer improved products. Therefore, pensioners must be  able to move from one pension vehicle to another that  may be cheaper or more attractive.  
<P>
We also recognise that people's circumstances change.  If people want to make a larger pension provision, they  may want to change. Again, the type of vehicle that they  want to invest in may be a function of their ability to save  or the structure of their savings portfolio. They may own  a house and may want more liquid assets, more equities  at certain times, or more fixed interest in their financial  portfolios. All those possibilities must be provided for.  
<P>
We do not want a rigid system, nor do we want people  to be locked for years into a single stakeholder scheme,  which the employer may have designated in accordance  with the provisions in the bill that we are seeking to  change. An instance may arise when it makes sense for  employees to change or transfer out.  
<P>
Under the Bill employers will be able to designate a  stakeholder pension. Our amendments seek to change that,  but the Government have made a once-and-for-all  provision, which they do not have to review or change.  The Bill does not have a time limit. I have not been able  to find a sunset clause in the Bill, so it goes on for the  rest of time. If the Government are left with the Bill as  drafted, employees who continue to work for an employer  will be locked in indefinitely and may be faced with  prohibitive costs and charges if they want to transfer.  Therefore, lead handcuffs will be attached to the  stakeholder pension that the employee takes out.  
<P>
What is more, the Bill provides, although we seek to  amend it, for an employer to designate a single  stakeholder scheme. We do not like that approach, but if  the employee is to have the choice that our other  amendments will give him, he must be able to exercise it  without facing penal costs and charges. Otherwise, the  liberty of choice that we seek to enshrine elsewhere in the  Bill will not be given effect in practice.  
<P>
The provision is a natural, correct and entirely desirable  development of existing pensions law. It reflects the  sophistication of the financial services industry and the  likely change in products. It reflects the need to give  individuals the maximum flexibility to plan their own  financial arrangements and pensions savings over time,  without locking them into a single scheme designated by  an employer or chosen by the employee, if he has the  liberty that we shall seek in later amendments to make his  own initial choice.     
<P>
If all that sounds like the Conservative party's agenda,  which it is, at least in the first half of our amendment we  simply seek to enshrine in the Bill the provision in the  Green Paper that I read out earlier. I hope that the  Government will show that the colour of their money is  genuine and that the intentions and principles set out in  the Green Paper were in good faith. If they were, I have  no doubt that we shall be able to reach agreement, at least  on the principle of the amendment.  
<P>
<B> The Minister of State, Department of Social  Security (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> I too, welcome you  back, Mr. McWilliam, to presiding over our  deliberations. Labour Members have a particularly good  reason to welcome your firm grasp on our deliberations,  for which you are rightly renowned.  
<P>
I also welcome the support for these parts of the Green  Paper given by the hon. Member for Grantham and  Stamford (Mr. Davies). There was a warmer hue to his  remarks today about the Government's proposals, which  I hope will increasingly characterise our discussions  during the coming weeks. I think that I can be more  helpful on this occasion than I have been in relation to  previous amendments considered by the Committee.  
<P>
<H5>10.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment would include in the Bill two  conditions for stakeholder pension schemes that we expect  to set out in regulations under powers that are already in  the Bill. We made it clear in the Green Paper that we  expect to include a requirement that stakeholder pension  schemes should allow members to move their funds to  another scheme without any additional charge. I entirely  agree with the points raised by the hon. Gentleman about  the importance of enabling people who are saving for their  retirement to make transfers between schemes, as their  working circumstances change and as the best vehicle for  them to make provisions changes. We want to prescribe  that condition under the powers in subsection (5).  
<P>
A key part of the flexibility of stakeholder pension  schemes will be the ability of individuals to vary their  contributions when they need to without penalty.  Subsection (7) already requires that members should be  able to make such contributions as they see fit. That will  be subject to prescribed restrictions, as it would obviously  be impractical for members to be able to change their  contributions every week, for example. However,  allowing contributions to change once every year without  penalty, as the amendment proposes, is the least that we  would wish to provide.  
<P>
Therefore, the aims of the amendment will be reflected  in the detailed conditions of stakeholder pension schemes,  but it would be wrong to include them in the Bill, which  provides the framework within which the detail will be  decided. We are consulting, through the Green Paper, on  the proposed minimum standards for stakeholder pension  schemes. We have said that we will consult on the detail  of the conditions before they are set out in regulations. I  do not think it sensible, at this point, to pre-empt the  outcome of that consultation.     
<P>
There is a divergence in the arguments advanced by the  Opposition. On the one hand, we are told that we should  not introduce legislation before the consultation period is  over. On the other hand, we are told that we should go  into great detail in the Bill before the consultation period  is over. I believe that our approach is the right one. We  are setting out the framework, which has been widely  discussed, consulted on and accepted by the pensions  industry and elsewhere. When the consultation period is  over, we shall introduce the detailed regulations that will  underpin the framework provided by the Bill.  
<P>
It is also important that we maintain the flexibility to  vary conditions in future in the light of what happens in  practice. We need to be in a position to update the  conditions as time goes by in the light, for example, of  precisely the technological change to which the hon.  Gentleman drew attention. It may be that the minimum  period for maintaining a given level of contribution will  vary as a result of technological change. It may well be  possible, in future, to allow for greater flexibility than it  is possible or sensible to do at the outset. That is why  the Bill provides for regulation-making powers, to allow  conditions to be set and updated without the need for new  primary legislation.  
<P>
We are certainly minded to incorporate conditions such  as those set out in the amendment, for which the hon.  Gentleman made a persuasive case. Those issues will be  dealt with in regulations, whether in precisely the same  form or rather differently we cannot say at this stage.  However, I hope that, in view of my assurances, the hon.  Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): On behalf of the  Liberal Democrats, I am glad to welcome you to the  Chair, Mr. McWilliam.  
<P>
We sympathise with the amendment and, had the  Conservatives wished to press it to a vote, we would have  been inclined to vote with them. However, I was pleased  to hear that the Minister of State is considering allowing  changes to contribution levels that are more frequent than  once a year. The amendment would allow a member to  change his contribution level.  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"at least once every year"  ,  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
and that is to be welcomed. However, as the Minister  suggested, once a year may prove insufficient. I hope that  he will take his own suggestion seriously and introduce a  rather larger figure when the regulations are introduced.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The Minister of State criticised  our complaint that the Government had introduced  legislation without waiting for the conclusion of the  consultation period. That complaint, which I set out in  detail during the debate on the sittings motion, is serious  and genuine, and I stand strongly by it. The Government  have set a deplorable example on this occasion and I hope  that they repent their ways. Even if they do not, the  damage has been done because, in future, people will no  longer want to spend time, money and effort considering  and commenting on the Government's legislative  proposals. Consulting on such proposals and giving the  Government the fruit of their considerations is a  time-consuming business that people will no longer be  willing to undertake. The Government have cried wolf  and it is a bad day for the cause of good and open  government.  
<P>
We also said that the Bill should be sufficiently detailed  to allow the public to know what they are letting  themselves in for, and to make it clear to Parliament what  it is being asked to endorse. The Government once they  have got round to deciding what they want to do should  not be allowed to write a blank cheque by creating  whatever legislation they like. That matter was debated at  length in our previous sitting.  
<P>
The Minister said that our request for a more detailed  Bill contradicts our complaint that the Government failed  to wait for the conclusion of the consultation period.  Sadly, there is a contradiction between those two  principles, but there ought not to be. The contradiction is  the Government's fault, and results from their decision  not to wait for the end of the consultation period. Had  they waited, we would have known the opinions of those  who participated in the consultation process. For example,  the pensions industry could have given its opinions on  transfer payments and on the frequency of change in  contribution levels and associated cost implications, and  pensioner groups could have made clear the interests of  their members. We could then have asked the Government  for their conclusions on the consultation exercise. A  debate could then have taken place on, for example, the  extent to which transfer costs act as a brake on capital  mobility and on the flexibility of individuals to plan their  financial futures. We cannot have that debate because the  Government drafted the Bill before the consultation  period had run its promised term.     
<P>
The Government's only way out is to say, "Well, we  don't know the answer to these things yet, so we are afraid  that the best we can do is to ask for a blank cheque, and  we'll think about the matter afterwards and draft  regulations."   That is not good enough, because it is the  Government's fault that they cannot take a decision.  
<P>
I say to the Minister of State that contradiction there is,  and it is a result of his bad behaviour in this matter, and  of the Government's incompetence or deliberate decision  to make a mockery of the whole consultation process. The  Government should be aware of how that will impact on  legislation: it will be more difficult to enact good  legislation and to secure the thorough parliamentary  debates that we all want. The Government's rhetoric about  the role of Parliament endorses that role. To make a  serious charge, it will be the Government's fault if we do  not have good legislation or thorough debates. When the  Minister raised that matter, he scored a major own goal,  and I do not apologise for rubbing it in a little he asked  for it.  
<P>
I now turn to the substance of the amendment and to  the Minister's response to it. I moved the amendment in  a constructive spirit this morning. I hope that I shall  always move amendments in that way, unless there is a  special reason, which may well be the Government's  fault, not to do so. We shall always be constructive and  helpful unless there is a reason not to be. I set out at the  beginning of the Committee stage the principles that will  guide us throughout our proceedings.  
<P>
The Minister said that he accepts both of the principles  in the amendment. Before I came to the House, I earned  my living in the City. The motto of the old stock exchange  is, "Pactum verbum meum,"   or "My word is my bond."    although I do not know whether that is still adhered to. I  take it that an undertaking that a Minister gives in  Standing Committee is in effect given on behalf of the  Government and that it is a cashable undertaking. the  Minister put on the record a promise that the regulations  will at least achieve the amendment's aims about  maximum transfer costs and about a person's right to  change his contribution levels at least once a year without  being charged. The Minister said that he may be able to  do better than the annual rate.  
<P>
On that basis, it would be wrong to press the  amendment to a vote. We accept the Government's  assurances in good faith, and I am glad that the Liberal  Democrats support the amendment. I therefore beg to ask  leave to withdraw the amendment.  
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 5 in page 2, line 12, leave out  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and other restrictions as may be prescribed' and insert `up to a  maximum of £5,000 a year or of the proportion of earnings which  may be relieved of income tax if invested in an eligible pension  scheme for a person of the relevant age in accordance with current  Inland Revenue rules, whichever be the higher,'. 
<P>
</UL></FONT>    
<P>
This is an extremely important amendment. It deals  with the tax shelter for pension funds and for pension  contributions and, specifically, with the extent to which  and the direction in which the tax rules for sheltering  pension contributions will be different, in relation to  stakeholder pensions, from the rules that currently apply  to other pension contribution funds.  
<P>
Our position on that matter is absolutely clear: we  believe that the savings ratio is too low. It is a sad fact  that that since the Government came to power that ratio  has fallen further. In 1997, it was in the order of 10 per cent. of real disposable income, and it is now  of the order of 7 per cent. perhaps slightly less of  real disposable income. That is strange. Normally, a  downturn in the economy's growth rate and a move  towards a more recessionary mode is accompanied by  a rise in the savings ratio. The growth rate has fallen  significantly since the Labour Government came to  power, but the savings ratio has fallen as well. There  has been a counter-cyclical fall in the savings ratio,  which is worrying because it means that the real  underlying savings ratio has probably fallen by a good  deal more than the 30 per cent. or so indicated in the  nominal figures that I quoted. The Government's  pensions tax has been a major contributor to that fall.  Clearly, if you tax savings or abolish the tax incentives  to save, you will have people saving less   
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This may appear to be  tiresome, but I have done none of those things. When the  word "you"   is used, it refers to me and to no one else.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I realise that I make that mistake from  time to time, Mr. McWilliam. You will be interested to  know that a couple of weekends ago the hon. Member  for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) will be amused by this I read  some of Mr. Gladstone's speeches, which is not  something that I often do. As the hon. Gentleman will  know, they are well worth reading in good English and  very long. They also make enormous use of the  impersonal second person. It is clear that Mr. Gladstone  did not have the benefit of the thorough and effective  chairmanship that we now enjoy.  
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> Neither did he have the benefit of the  speakership structure, Standing Committee structure or  Standing Committee rules that we now have. They  changed after his time.     
<P>
<H5>11 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I will return to my theme, Mr. McWilliam.  Opposition Members are worried about the fall in the  saving ratio and about why it is falling counter-cyclically.  There can be no doubt that the reduction in the tax  advantages of saving for pensions in the form of the  abolition of dividend tax credit, which the Opposition  rightly call the pensions tax as it takes £5 billion out of  pension funds according to the Government's estimates  is a major factor. We all agree that if the return on  investment is reduced, the propensity to invest is reduced.  The Government are reducing arbitrarily at a stroke the  return on pensions and investments by £5 billion a year.  That is a retrogressive and damaging step, which we  deplore.  
<P>
The fact that future disposable incomes the money  that will be available to pay people's pensions rather  than present disposable incomes will be reduced makes  the measure no less damaging. People may not notice such  a reduction as much as a rise in inflation, a reduction in  their wages or an increase in indirect or direct taxes,  which is precisely why a Government driven by a media  manipulation agenda have decided to raise money in this  way. The British public will not be deceived in the long  term the Government seriously underestimate their  intelligence. The Government will reap the harvest of  their action even if the opinion polls do not yet show  that and I warn them not to be complacent. That is a  damaging aspect of the taxation of pensions.  
<P>
Opposition Members believe that aggregate savings are  too low, and that our economy will be handicapped by  having the lowest savings ratio in Europe. We also believe  that individuals who have properly taken account of the  increasing means-testing of benefits, and for whom it  makes sense to make provision for their future retirement  by saving especially through pensions vehicles should  be encouraged to do so. We want more people to save,  which would be good for individuals, so long as they can  break out of the welfare trap that the Government are  steadily increasing through the means-testing of benefit.  People who can expect to save sufficient amounts to have  hundreds of thousands of pounds in a pension fund or  the equivalent at the time of retirement clearly have an  interest in saving, and we want them to do so. People who  are free of the pension trap or can expect to be free of  the welfare trap and who are on lower incomes should  be especially encouraged to save.  
<P>
Clearly, increasing the return on saving will increase  the propensity to save, and increasing the return on  pension saving will increase the propensity to save  through pension vehicles. It is good for individuals and  society if such incentives are strengthened, and they  should not be weakened in any way. Sadly, the  Government have already done so in one important  respect.  
<P>
The Conservative party's position on this matter has  been entirely consistent. When we were in government  we introduced a range of incentives to save, such as  personal equity plans, tax-exempt special savings  accounts and so forth, as well as personal pensions.     
<P>
Good tax incentives are particularly necessary for  pensions as opposed to other forms of savings. A tax  incentive is generally desirable, for the reasons that I have  set out, but it is vital that people who save through a  pension vehicle have significant tax benefits. Otherwise,  there is no reason to do so, because a pension saving is  probably the most illiquid form of saving. One puts  money away and one is not allowed, under the Revenue  rules that approved schemes must observe, to have access  to that money expect in the ways defined in part XIV of  the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. Those rules  make it clear that one cannot take a pension until one is  50 or, under an occupational scheme, reaches retirement  age. One must then buy an annuity, except that we  introduced a provision for income draw-down. No doubt  we shall come to those matters later in the Bill. The rules  are restrictive, so many people who put money away for  a pension will not be able to touch it for 20 or 30 years.  Even when they can, the means to do so are restricted.  Therefore, it is the most illiquid form of saving.  
<P>
Why should people use that form of saving when they  can save money in other ways and get it tomorrow if they  need it for a particular purpose or switch it from one fund  to another without having to observe the Revenue rules?  The only reason to do so is if there is a countervailing  advantage, so that the loss of liquidity is compensated for  by an increased return. The only way to do that is to  provide a tax break. For that reason too, we believe in tax  breaks. There would be no such thing as pensions if  people were not compelled to save for them and I know  that the Government came close to doing so when  considering the stakeholder proposals and at the last  minute shied away. So quickly did they shy away and so  great was the shambles that they were in at the end of last  year that they had to revise the text of the Green Paper  after it went to the printers and take out the references  to "compulsion"  . However, they forgot one reference to  "compulsion"   on page 105, where the Green Paper  refers to  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"compulsory funded pensions for those earning over £9,000 a year"  .  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
That provision is not in the Bill, or in the remainder of  the Green Paper, but it shows how close we came to it.  
<P>
The Government thought, "We can wind down the  tax benefits of saving, both the contribution tax  advantages and also, through the abolition of the  dividend tax credit, the advantages that pensions obtain  from rolling up the dividend income that they receive  without tax. It will not affect people's pension  provision, because we shall compel them."   That was  clearly how the Government were thinking two or three  months ago. We still do not know the full story;  perhaps the Minister of State will tell it, as it is very  interesting. Only at the last minute, in the complete  panic and shambles in December when the Green Paper  was about to be published, did the Government  suddenly change their mind.  
<P>
The amendment would do two things. First, it would  provide that a person could continue an existing individual  or group personal pension scheme, which under the  Government's proposals would not count as a stakeholder  pension under the amendment it would be a stakeholder  pension, and the employer could arrange a payroll  deduction facility in favour of that scheme. Other  amendments that you have selected, Mr. McWilliam, will  provide for individuals to designate their own personal  pension or their LISA, when LISAs become available, and  for the employer to discharge his liability under the Bill by  providing a payroll deduction facility. Indeed, we have  tabled amendments to introduce other vehicles that make  sense and are approved by the Inland Revenue, which  neither the Department of Social Security nor the Treasury  has dreamt up. Once approved, they could be designated by  the individual as his stakeholder pension.     
<P>
If that happens, it follows that the tax regime as it  applies to that pension should not be changed or restricted.  The Government's proposals will allow a stakeholder  pension scheme to be defined as a scheme for tax  purposes, under which contributions of up to but no  more than £3,600 a year can be made free of tax. There  will be no further tax breaks. If someone wants to  contribute more than £3,600 a year to a personal pension,  he would be barmy to put it into a stakeholder pension  scheme.  
<P>
I hope that the Committee will accept our amendments  to enable individuals to designate their personal pension  scheme, LISA or other approved vehicles as a stakeholder  pension fund. It would be a mistake if people could not  utilise those vehicles without suffering a major tax penalty  when their contributions were higher than £3,600 a year.  The amendment is logical because it widens the scope of  stakeholder pensions beyond the Government's proposal  of a single, trust-based, employer-designated scheme.  
<P>
Irrespective of who does what whether an employer  or employee designates a pension it is extraordinary,  crazy and undesirable that we should deter people from  contributing more than £3,600 a year to a stakeholder  scheme. I deliberately began by referring to the aggregate  interest for the economy of maximising the savings ratio,  which should be increased substantially, and of  encouraging in principle except where it involves  mis-selling because of the Government's welfare trap  as many people as possible to provide for their retirement  and to build up capital in the form of pension provision.  
<P>
We want the Bill to be permissive, but the  Government's proposals on tax are restrictive because  people cannot put more than £3,600 into a stakeholder  pension. That makes no sense. The sum of £3,600 is not  enormous. Why not increase it to £5,000 as suggested in  the amendment which, I hope, makes the correct use of  the second person singular?

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am glad that the hon.  Gentleman has noticed that previous amendments did not.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam.  
<P>
It makes sense to raise the limit. After all, £5,000 might  plausibly be saved if someone does not have enormous  financial responsibilities. A person who earns £25,000,  which, although above average earnings, is not a vast sum,  might make a heroic effort to save £5,000. People on  average and slightly above average earnings will be  attracted by the benefit of a single limit a year, with no  questions asked by the Inland Revenue and no  consideration of what proportion of their earnings that  represents.     
<P>
We are not suggesting that any amount of money  £50,000 or £100,000 a year could be put into a pension  scheme with no questions asked and without relating it to  the Inland Revenue's scale of share of salary or its overall  limits on pension provision. We do not want stakeholder  pension schemes to be a tax refuge for fat cats, so I hope  that the Minister will not try to rubbish our proposals  along those lines. In my opinion, £5,000 a year is not a  fat cat level of saving. Indeed, it is the amount of  money this is not entirely coincidence, the point did  cross my mind when I was drafting the amendment that  the Government, under their ISA proposals, think it  appropriate to encourage ordinary people to put aside,  although the ISA does not have a front-end tax break. In  other words, one cannot make a deduction from one's  current tax liability in respect of money put into an ISA,  whereas one can in respect of money put into a pension.  
<P>
In this case, the £5,000 would be put into a stakeholder  pension. However, we want the provision to be  permissive. I make no apology for the fact that you will  hear me use that word in relation to many of our  amendments, Mr. McWilliam, because it represents our  approach to the Bill.  
<P>
<H5>11.15 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
That is, perhaps, the salient division between the  Government and the Opposition: they have a restrictive  approach, whereas we have a permissive approach. We  want the bill to add to the range of choices for individuals  and to add to the incentives in the system for people to  provide for their pensions. We want the Bill to allow, in  pension terms, 1,000 flowers to bloom. We do not want  to exclude any particular pension product that may be  good value or may, in future, be good value for  pensioners. We want to make all these things possible,  subject to Revenue consents and approvals and subject to  the regulatory framework, on which we have some  differences with the Government about the mechanics.  However, in principle, we are at one with them in  believing that we need a tough regulatory structure,  although perhaps a rather more coherent one than they  are proposing.  
<P>
We do not want to shut anyone out, nor to shut out any  possibilities. We want a pension system that is flexible,  modern efficient and as productive as possible, and which  encourages as much competition as possible between  suppliers and gives as good a deal as possible to  participants.  
<P>
We suggest that £5,000 makes sense, as what the  French would call a "forfait"   something from which one  can get the tax benefit without any further argument or  calculation, and which has the merit of simplicity.  However, we also propose this is a vital part of the  amendment that people should retain the right, in a  stakeholder pension, if it is a better deal for them, to claim  their pension tax allowance on the existing basis, which  starts at 17.5 per cent. of eligible earnings and goes up at  the age of 60 to, I think, 40 per cent. on a sliding scale.  We do not want to change that, but we think it  extraordinary that someone in a stakeholder pension  scheme should not benefit from it.  
<P>
We are simply saying that the individual who wants to  put aside £5,000, should be able to do so without any  questions being asked and without he, she or the Revenue  having to take any time or go to any expense in calling in  accountants to fill out tax forms. As long as the amount  is no more than £5,000, it should be totally tax deductible.  By definition, stakeholder pension schemes apply to  employees who pay tax under schedule E of the PAYE  system, so adjustments can be made extremely easily. If  that is not the case, it is easy to imagine how systems can  be put in place to rapidly change people's tax codes. That  would reduce their taxable income by £5,000 a year.  
<P>
Alternatively, as now, people can claim on the sliding  scale, because we want the legislation to be permissive.  That is vital. If the amendment is rejected, it will not be  possible for people too utilise their existing personal  pensions, LISAs or other pension vehicles and put them  into a stakeholder pension. They will be forced to run  down, or bring to an end, existing schemes and then open  a separate stakeholder scheme, if they want to take  advantage of the stakeholder system at all. That is  completely barmy and involves people and the industry in  costs, which, ultimately, will have to be paid by the  beneficiaries.  
<P>
Such a system fragments and segments the pensions  market terms that I shall use again because they  characterise precisely what the Government are doing in  these ill-thought-through proposals which we want to  make as open and fungible as possible, so that people's  arrangements can be flexible and so that we do not restrict  the products or vehicles beyond the absolute minimum.     
<P>
The second effect of the Bill, unless our amendment is  accepted, is that someone whose earnings are rising so  that £3,600 become less than 17.5 per cent. of his eligible  earnings as he gets older the relevant proportion of his  earnings rises and may be more than £3,600 will be  artificially prevented from contributing what he wants to  contribute to the stakeholder pension. What a crazy state  of affairs. The Government are preventing people from  making pension provision, so this is not a pension Bill,  but an anti-pension one. That is the effect of what I have  described.  
<P>
The Government may say that the employee should  wind down his stakeholder pension scheme and start up  a new personal pension scheme so that he can account  to the Revenue on the basis of the scale rising from  17.5 per cent. to 40 per cent. but that is nonsense. The  employee would incur the significant front-end costs of  setting up a new scheme and his pension portfolio  would be fragmented. He would have a frozen  stakeholder scheme to which he is not contributing  because he is not allowed to contribute to the  stakeholder pension scheme and the new personal  pension scheme. If he wants to contribute more than  £3,600 a year, he must set up a new scheme with all  the costs involved in managing it separately. He will  have a double task in looking at what the fund  managers are doing in the two different schemes and  deciding whether to switch from one to the other. That  will be an additional headache.  
<P>
Are there any other consequences? There seem to be  only two. Either the employee will say, "Blow it. I cannot  save more than £3,600 a year in a stakeholder pension  scheme so, although I would like to save more, I won't"  .  The Government are artificially constraining people's  saving and pension provision and, in aggregate, artificially  constraining the savings ratio of the nation. The other  possibility is that the employee is forced to set up a new  scheme and he may end up with several schemes because  he may want to return to a stakeholder pension scheme if  his income falls and he decides that that is a better deal.  That is complexity for a negative purpose, because the  effect will be less pension saving and more costs. The  available pension saving will be less attractive to those  who make it and the return will be lower.  
<P>
Unless the Minister of State is about to say that I have  fundamentally misunderstood this crazy system, the  Government have done an appalling day's work in the  Bill. The reason may be it cannot be used as an  excuse that they did not think through the consequences.  There is textual evidence in the Green Paper that the  provision was drawn up in desperation at the last moment.  Having been in power for 18 months and having made  promises in their manifesto, they were unable to come up  with anything so they threw something together. In the  Green Paper they promised to consult but they decided  perhaps to cover up the inadequacies of their proposals  not to have a consultation period after all, so the public  and the experts could not comment on the proposals.     
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am having difficulty relating  the hon. Gentleman's comments to the amendment. The  amendment covers contributions and the tax liability of  those contributions or otherwise, but the hon. Gentleman  is discussing other matters. I should be grateful if he  would speak to the amendment.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Yes, but the whole point is that the  Government's tax proposals are irrational. They have  decided on a £3,600 limit to the contributions that can be  made to a stakeholder scheme and they thereby decided  to fragment the pensions system, giving everyone greater  costs. They will limit the contributions of people who  would otherwise be happy to make pension provision of  more than £3,600. That will reduce an individual's  income in retirement, because he will not have made such  a high level of provision and it will reduce the savings  ratio aggregate in the country. It is extraordinary that any  half-sane Government could spend time producing  complexities that do not serve any positive purpose and  which damage the values that they seek to promote   
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand all of that, but  those matters do not arise from the amendment or the Bill.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I must speak about the tax position that I  am seeking to change. The tax regime will be fragmented  into a stakeholder regime with a limit of £3,600 and a  regime involving the existing revenue proportion of  eligible earnings. Those regimes will run alongside each  other. That approach can properly be described in the  English language as involving fragmentation it will  divide up a regime that was previously integrated and  coherent into two separate regimes, which will have the  perverse consequences that I outlined. If I repeat myself,  Mr. McWilliam, it is basically because you asked me to  do so

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I precisely did not do that. The  only effect that the amendment will have and I can read  very well is to allow someone to opt for the Inland  Revenue rules or for the £5,000 maximum. It involves no  more and no less. It does not question the Inland Revenue  rules it may not do so although the hon. Gentleman is  trying to do so.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The amendment would create a unified  regime. It would allow a taxpayer who is considering what  pension provision to make either to benefit from the  £5,000 tax deduction, which he would realise by investing  in the stakeholder scheme, or to utilise the Revenue's  rules, which are based on a proportion of eligible  earnings. In other words, he would choose whichever  scheme he preferred he would have a choice. The two  systems would not be divided.  
<P>
The Government's proposals will fragment the system  by creating two separate regimes they will cut the  pension regime into two watertight compartments. As I  said, that will constrain people who want to save more  than £3,600 a year and/or it will force people into  incurring the additional costs of having a separate  personal pension scheme that is outside the stakeholder  regime and which they would not otherwise need. If costs  are increased, the return and the incentive to invest in a  pension would be reduced.  
<P>
Why should the Government have done anything so  extraordinarily destructive and foolish? They said that  they liked the idea of people providing for their pensions  and saving. However, their proposals are bound to  constrain savings or to make aggregate pension provision  more costly. How could any half-sane person do  something so fundamentally foolish, destructive and  because it is contrary to the Government's apparent  declared aims self-destructive? I ask that no rhetorically,  but because I hope for a response from the Minister. The  answer may be that the Government did so in a fit of  absence of mind.  
<P>
In that context, I adduced evidence of the absence of  mind with which the Government drafted their Green  Paper and the Bill. That absence of mind presumably also  lies behind the Government's embarrassment and it  explains why they do not want experts, the industry or  the general public to appreciate the chaos and the internal  contradictions in the Bill. It must also be a factor in  explaining their extraordinary decision not to allow the  consultation period to run its course and to pre-empt      
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is now  repeating arguments that he used when speaking to the  previous amendment.  
{**fc
<p5**}Mr. Davies: Indeed, but I was trying to explain    <P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman must not  argue with me. The amendment is not connected with the  consultation period. It deals with the hon. Gentleman's  idea to change the tax exemption structure of pension  schemes. The consultation period and anything related to  the consultation period have nothing to do with the  amendment.  
<P>
<H5>11.30 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I was drawing logical conclusions from  the shambles with which we are faced.  
<P>
The Government have a chance to do something about  the matter and I hope that they will take the Committee  seriously. So far, only one contribution has been made  from the Labour Back Benches. The Government have  made one our two undertakings to tackle through  regulation matters with which the Bill, if amended, would  deal. Perhaps the Government will accept our analysis  and, in principle, our proposal on tax, and will make the  necessary changes in the Finance Bill. Perhaps the  Chancellor will announce that this afternoon I simply  cannot say for sure.  
<P>
What is certain is that the Government need to think  again on the matter. Stakeholder pensions will fragment  the existing pension regime and constrain people who may  want to save more for their retirement. That makes no  sense. If that was the Government's intention, they should  have called the Bill the pension limitation Bill. I do not  use the word, "limitation"   in a perjorative sense  limitation will be the logical consequence of their  proposed tax regime.  
<P>
We want to establish the legislative basis for greater,  not lesser, pension provision and to encourage people to  save. In that spirit, I hope that the Government will accept  the amendment.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): I should like the  Minister's help. Labour and Opposition Members alike  are worried about the fact that Britain has the lowest  savings ratio in Europe and about the increasing cost of  annuities, to which the hon. Member for Birmingham,  Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) referred yesterday in her excellent  question. Our debate is pertinent to that wider one.  
<P>
Why is it necessary for the Government to be so  prescriptive? You have rightly insisted, Mr. McWilliam,  what we should refer to the Inland Revenue limits, which  are clear. With regard to an occupational scheme,  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Inland Revenue limits the amount that can be contributed to  pension schemes that qualify for tax relief...to 15 per cent. of the  individual's earnings"  .  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
The limit includes additional voluntary contributions, and  is well known and easily understood. There is also a  maximum pay level which, for 1998-99, is £87,000.  However, that probably need not concern us, because we  are not discussing people whose salaries approach that  level. Such sums would fall foul of Inland Revenue rules.     
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and  Stamford alluded to personal pensions. I am no expert on  such matters, but Inland Revenue rules on personal  pensions seem to be clear, unlike the rules on occupational  pensions, which are slightly more complicated. The  Minister could do the Committee a service by making  those matters clearer. The percentages of net relevant  earnings that qualify are age related. My hon. Friend  referred to those percentages. Up to age 36, the rate is  17.5 per cent., and it rises to 40 per cent. at age 61 or  over. The percentages include employers' contributions  and there is a provision to carry back employees'  contributions and to carry forward used tax relief. The  age-related rates are additional to the national insurance  rebate for contracting out with an appropriate pension.  
<P>
If I understand my hon. Friend's point, given that the  Inland Revenue rules exist, what is the reason for the  £3,600 limit? That is directly relevant to subsection (7),  which states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The sixth condition is that, subject to such minimum contribution  levels and other restrictions as may be prescribed"  .  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
First, why have the Government set the level of £3,600?  Secondly, what are the "other restrictions"  ? I suspect that  we shall refer to this point often in our debates.  
<P>
It is difficult to have a realistic debate when a Bill  contains general, enabling clauses that allow the  Government to do what they want later. The Green Paper  and the Bill are rather vague. The scheme must comply  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"with such requirements as may be prescribed"  .  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
I am not sure that the Government have told us, but the  Library tells us that examples of matters likely to be  specified in regulations include the scope of the trustees  they have the power to appoint and dismiss people the  composition of trustee boards and whether a scheme  should provide additional benefits. But I do not know  whether the Government will give us any further  information relating to the limits and to Inland Revenue  contributions.     
<P>
We also know that the scheme must be a money  purchase scheme, again  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"subject to such exceptions as may be prescribed"  ,  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
although we still do not know what the exceptions are.  We know that the Government do not envisage that  stakeholder pensions will be allowed to provide benefits  related to final salary, as most occupational pension  schemes do. The benefits will have to be related to  individual contributions, plus investment returns on those  contributions, less charges and expenses, and the fund will  normally be used to purchase an annuity on retirement.  However, we do not know much more than that, although  I am open to correction from the Minister.  
<P>
The Minister may say that the figure of £5,000  suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham  and Stamford is too high. I am not privy to my hon.  Friend's thinking and I do not know what the magic of  £5,000 is compared with £3,600. My own view I accept  that these are technical areas and I do not claim to be an  expert is that it is artificial for the Minister and my hon.  Friend to use figures in the Bill or in regulations. I may  be wrong, but I cannot understand why we cannot proceed  in the traditional way that I outlined and which the public  clearly understand, whereby a fixed percentage of  earnings can be put into stakeholder schemes. The  Minister may say, "If you are saying that, you are not  creating anything new and we want to create something  new. There is no point in bandying words about. The  stakeholder pension must be new and different."    
<P>
<B> Mr. Davies:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend will agree that a  blanket figure of £5,000 would provide an administrative  benefit as people would not have to calculate by way of  reference to eligible earnings. Secondly, an attraction  might exist in allowing people at the lower end of the  earnings scale to save more than 17.5 per cent. That would  be a special tax break for the lower paid, which my hon.  Friend might regard as attractive in principle. We have  extended those attractive aspects to the Government's  proposals.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is a very clear intervention. I cannot  believe that Committee Members who are paying close  attention to the debate I am sure that they are will find  anything with which to disagree in my hon. Friend's  intervention. The Inland Revenue has rules relating to the  figure of 15 per cent. for an occupational pension and  17.5 per cent. for a personal pension, and we all recognise  that there must be a limit, especially where senior  executives are concerned. The Inland Revenue does not  want individuals who earn in the order of £87,000 putting  vast sums of money into a tax relief scheme in their final  years of work, simply to avoid tax.  
<P>
My hon. Friend made a worthwhile point, which has  made the debate much clearer. If we are considering  salaries at such a level, why are the Government being  prescriptive and restricting the amount to £3,600? If  somebody wants to put more money in  £5,000, for  example, would be significantly less than the Inland  Revenue's present ceilings I cannot see why the  Government has to prescribe otherwise.     
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and  Stamford also made a further point if we are considering  such salary levels, perhaps it would be clearer for the  public to understand a general rule that up to £5,000 could  be invested.  
<P>
I hope that the Minister will agree that I have made a  reasonable point in a non-partisan fashion, and I hope that  he is able to answer that point.

<P>

<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): I welcome  you, Mr. McWilliam, as Chairman. You were the  Chairman of the first Committee on which I served, and  it is good to see that you are still as strict as I recall.  
<P>
No doubt the Minister will say in a few minutes that  the Government's proposals are out to consultation, and  that any problems will be worked out. Currently, there are  different maximum levels of contributions for  occupational and personal pension schemes, which are  laid down by tax legislation. Will the restrictions in  respect of stakeholder pensions be laid down under those  regulations, or will they be laid down under regulations  the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill when it becomes  law? In light of the Green Paper "Partnership in  Pensions"   which my hon. Friend referred to at great  length, and which has the relevant proposals on page 62  will those restrictions be different from those already laid  down in respect of occupational and personal pensions?  We will have to reach a decision on the first clause of the  Bill before we know the results of the consultation. It  would help the Committee and speed up its  deliberations, which we would all like if the Minister  were to give some indication of the Government's  thinking, even though the consultation period has not  been completed.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I begin by thanking you, Mr. McWilliam,  for your strict application of Standing Committee rules.  That is much to the Committees' advantage. The speeches  of Mr. Gladstone would have been much improved if they  had been delivered under your chairmanship.  
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford  commented extensively on the economy and it is worth  drawing his attention to the verdict on the Government's  management of the economy, which was published  yesterday by the International Monetary Fund. It paid  a glowing tribute, which provides a good backdrop to  the statement that the House will hear this afternoon.  The worst enemy for savers is inflation. The fact that  the Government have hit their inflation target so  consistently is greatly to the benefit of savers and will  lead to greater savings than would otherwise have been  the case.  
<P>
<H5>11.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment would place a maximum limit on  contributions to stakeholder pension schemes, but that is  not what we are discussing in clause 1(7). The effect of  the amendment would be different from that intended. It  would allow the minimum contribution level to be set at  a level up to £5,000 or the relevant proportion of earnings.  Technically, it would not do what the hon. Member for  Grantham and Stamford intends.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The Minister is making a key  point. He said that the amendment would not have the  intended effect, but he has not explained why. It would  establish maximum taxable deductions of £5,000 or the  proportion of earnings which may be relieved of income  tax according to the Inland Revenue's sliding scale. The  amendment may be technically defective, but the Minister  owes the Committee an explanation for that.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am glad to give that. As amended,  subsection (7) would state:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The sixth condition is that, subject to such minimum contribution  levels, up to a maximum of £5,000 a year"  .  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
The reference to £5,000 a year would apply to the  minimum contribution level. That is rather different from  what the hon. Gentleman intends. The amendment would  have an effect on setting the minimum contribution level.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I cannot share the Minister's  interpretation. The whole point of the amendment is that  the minimum contribution is not touched. That will  presumably be set in regulations. No one will be able to  put in 40p and everyone understands that there must be a  minimum. With the amendment, the minimum would be  whatever the regulations state and the maximum would  be £5,000 or whatever is produced by the application of  the relevant Inland Revenue rules.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I entirely accept that that is the hon.  Gentleman's intention. I am simply saying that that would  not be the effect of his amendment. The wording of the  amendment qualifies the minimum contribution level and  that is the technical difficulty.  
<P>
Like the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh),  I have some difficulty in understanding why setting a  level of £3,600 is an unreasonable constraint on saving  when people should be encouraged to save as much as  possible, but £5,000 is a permissive, generous and  completely different approach. It is clear that £5,000 is  more than £3,600, but the difference is not as qualitatively  great as the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford  implied.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I do not know if the Minister is  deliberately misunderstanding the text before him. What  is permissive and qualitatively different is the taxpayer's  ability to choose either the set limit or the Inland Revenue  limit, whichever is the higher. That is what is permissive  and is the essential aspect of the amendment. The reason  for going from £3,600 to £5,000 is that we endorse the  Government's view that it would be useful for reasons of  administration, marketing, cost and so on to have the  choice of a single limit, but we do not want that to become  a constraint. The difference is that under our proposals the  limit is not a constraint because it would be possible to  use the Revenue rules, but under the Government's  proposals the limit is the ceiling.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Here we come to the nub of the difference  between the hon. Gentleman and I. The target group for  stakeholder pension schemes is people earning between  about £9,000 and £18,000 a year. The £3,600 limit that  we are proposing is generous enough to allow all those in  that salary bracket to make significant contributions if  they wish to do so. At the top of the range, it is 20 per  cent. of salary, which, if I remember rightly, is about the  level of contribution currently allowed for people under  45 in a personal pension scheme.  
<P>
We must remember what stakeholder pensions are for.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister referred to the age-related  rates. Up to 36, it is 17.5 per cent., from 36 to 45 it is 20 per cent., from 46 to 50, it is 25 per cent. as he  mentioned, from 51 to 55 it is 30 per cent., from 56 to 60  it is 35 per cent. and for 61 and over it is 40 per cent.  Why can there not be a similar age-related scale here, so  that people can contribute more than 20 or 25 per cent. as  they get older?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am coming to that point, but I wanted to  establish that up to the age of 45 the limit is indeed 20 per cent. The £3,600 limit allows everyone in the salary  range that we are addressing to contribute up to 20 per cent.  of their salary to their stakeholder pension.     
<P>
Opposition Members are seeking to help those on  higher earnings and that is not what stakeholder pensions  are for. The personal pension scheme already provides for  people to save at that level. Therefore, nothing is gained  by changing the rules in respect of stakeholder pensions.  Anyone who wants to pay in more than £3,600 and is  allowed to do so under the relevant contribution limits  referred to by the hon. Member for Gainsborough, will  still have the option to take out a personal pension if he  or she does not have access to an occupational pension.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Leigh:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the Minister again,  but would a person who switched from a stakeholder  pension to a personal pension lose the advantages of the  stakeholder pension and, in particular, the employers'  contributions that already had?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> If I heard the hon. Gentleman correctly,  that is indeed the case. We want people to be in  occupational schemes, where they have the opportunity to  be in them. Our concern with the stakeholder pension,  however, is for those who cannot join an occupational  scheme, but I take the hon. Gentleman's point about the  position of those who can.  
<P>
The central point is that the regime that we are  proposing for stakeholder pensions is a simple one. The  simplicity of the limit of £3,600 a year is extremely  attractive: it reduces the costs of running the scheme, has  been widely welcomed in the consultation and is much  easier for employers who have to deliver the contributions  to manage than the age-related schedule advocated by  Opposition Members.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Minister is being most helpful, but  his reply to the amendment contains a theme that has run  through other replies. To summarise it, he is saying,  "Other forms of pension may be better for the person  taking out the stakeholder pension. It will be easy to  transfer across, although we cannot say yet how easy. It  may involve some cost, or it may not."   Opposition  Members have suggested a number of cases in which  people on the edge of stakeholder, occupational or  personal pensions will have to make all kinds of  decisions.  
<P>
The £5,000 gives a margin for error, so that people will  not have to worry continually whether they are in the right  scheme. Moreover, there is no possibility of receiving  advice: advice will be purchased separately. Therefore,  people in a stakeholder pension will not know whether a  personal pension or occupational pension might be better,  because they will not be able to afford to take advice. The  £5,000 is an extra margin for people who are starting to  earn slightly more than the original target.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions are supposed to  be brief. The hon. Gentleman's was a wee bit long. I am  sure that he will catch my eye if he wants to speak later.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am saying that those who wish to make  greater contributions than we envisage in the Bill have a  mechanism to do so by switching to a personal pension.  The choice before the Committee is to add extra  complexity and costs to the stakeholder framework or to  continue flexibility, which is what I propose, by  permitting people to switch to a different scheme. By  minimising costs in the stakeholder model, we maximise  the attractiveness of stakeholder pensions and the number  of people who have, for the first time, access to an  affordable, good-value funded pension scheme. That  explains what we have done.  
<P>
The criticism is that we are fragmenting the pensions  market, but it is already fragmented. Personal pensions do  not provide an effective option for a large number of  lower and middle earners. We have set ourselves the  central and important goal that those people should, for  the first time, have access to a funded pension provision  that makes sense for them. Our tight, well-defined aim for  stakeholder pensions has led us to the flat-rate limit of  £3,600 for contributions.     
<P>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) asked how the limit will be set given that  it is not mentioned in the Bill. Clause 1(7) does not  relate to that. We do not intend to set in the Bill  maximum tax limits for contributions. The Inland  Revenue usually publishes details of changes to the tax  regime. That is what happens with personal pensions  and we envisage the same system for stakeholder  pensions. Once consultation is completed, the Inland  Revenue will publish details of the tax regime for  stakeholder pensions in a forthcoming Finance Bill,  which will, of course, be debated.  
<P>
Let me say a little more about the intention of clause 1(7),  because that will answer some of the questions raised by  the hon. Member for Gainsborough. Its purpose is different  from that implied by the amendment. The aim is to allow  members of stakeholder pension schemes to make  contributions regularly or whenever they can. Many  personal pensions do not provide the flexibility to make  variable contributions. Clause 1(7) also provides a  regulation-making power to prescribe minimum  contribution levels, which will set a balance between  providing flexibility for scheme members and the cost of  handling small contributions. People who can only afford to  make modest contributions will not be ruled out of joining a  stakeholder pension scheme.  
<P>
The resolution depends on having a clear view of the  purpose of stakeholder pensions: who they are aimed at  and how we can maximise, for those who have not had  the chance to save for a pension, the opportunity to do so.  That is the guiding principle behind clause 1(7) and I hope  that the Committee agrees that it is the right one.

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> This has been a revealing sitting,  and it will be a memorable one. The Minister did not deny  that the Government's tax provisions will further fragment  the pension market. His only excuse was that it is already  fragmented, which is a pretty crazy excuse unless, of  course, he believes that there is some virtue in  fragmentation. However, fragmentation causes problems  of information for individuals it makes it harder for  people to decide where their best interests lie and which  pension product they should purchase. It may also involve  considerable costs, which we shall discuss when we come  to that part of the Bill dealing with advice. In that debate,  we shall remind the Minister of his comments in this  context. Fragmentation also implies that individuals may  have more than an optimum number of schemes: they may  have two, three or four schemes, depending on how badly  the market is fragmented, when one scheme would have  been perfectly adequate.  
<P>
<H5>12 noon  </H5>
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the Government's agenda is to fragment the  market. We learned this morning that the Minister  explicitly accepts that the Bill will further fragment the  pensions market. There is clearly a major divide between  the Government and the Opposition on this matter. There  is also a major divide between us about whether the object  of the exercise should be to make it easier or more  difficult and costly for individuals to have pensions. The  amendment would facilitate the provision of pensions to  the maximum extent. I am sorry that the Government will  not accept the amendment, which we shall press to a vote.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I do not know whether the hon.  Gentleman took sufficient note of the Minister's  comments about the form of the amendment. He was right  to say that the form of the amendment is such that it does  not make grammatical sense as it stands. Would not it be  wiser for the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it and to bring  forward another properly grammatical amendment at a  later stage?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I shall not accept that blandishment. If  the Government were minded to accept the amendment,  it would be perfectly easy to redraft it, although I remain  unconvinced of the need to do so. The Minister tried to  pretend that the amendment would establish a minimum  when it clearly proposes a maximum of £5,000 a year.  What we are trying to achieve is straightforward. I am  always open to the suggestion that we should redraft  amendments or new clauses to make them technically  more viable or to improve the Bill's effectiveness and  simplicity, but there is no point in doing so in this context  unless the Government support the amendment's purpose.  In this case, they are clearly not interested in doing so.  They want fragmentation, restriction, and a ceiling on  what people can save, and they want to force people who  can save more than £3,600 to start another scheme. There  is a fundamental divide of policy and principle between  the Opposition and the Government, who want to  fragment the pensions industry.  
<P>
This sitting is crucial to our consideration of  stakeholder pensions, and it will be memorable. The  Minister let the cat out of the bag by saying something of  enormous significance: he said that stakeholder pensions  were designed for people who earn up to £18,000 a year.  We are now in our third sitting but the Government have  only just told us what their real intentions are: that  stakeholder pensions are a product that is intended only  for people who earn up to £18,000 a year. If the tax  arrangements appear to make stakeholder pensions  unsuitable for people who earn more than £18,000 a year,  that is because that was the Government's intention. The  Minister is looking at the Green Paper, but I shall tell him  what it says. It says something that is so diametrically  opposed to what the Minister has just told us that, unless  the Government have performed a somersault since the  Green Paper's publication, they were being downright  dishonest with the British public. The Government's  election manifesto stated that stakeholder pensions were  intended for everyone. Paragraph 10 of chapter 7 of the  Green Paper states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Stakeholder pension schemes will be open to everyone... But  many people earning over £20,000 a year will be able, now and in  the future, to take advantage of the lower charges, greater flexibility,  and simpler tax regime which stakeholder pension schemes will  introduce"     
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
[Interruption.] I think that I had better repeat that.  Labour Members were so embarrassed by my quoting  back to them their own words, which self-evidently  contradict what the Minister of State just told the  Committee, that they attempted to drown out my words.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The attempt failed. I heard  every word that the hon. Gentleman said.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I doubt whether people at the other end  of the Room heard, such was the noise coming from the  Government Benches. The Green Paper states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"many people earning over £20,000 a year will be able, now and in  the future, to take advantage of the lower charges, greater flexibility,  and simpler tax regime which stakeholder pension schemes will  introduce."       
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
I have demonstrated that such schemes will not introduce  a simpler, better tax regime for people earning more than  £20,000 a year; instead, they will introduce a regime that  makes no sense to those people.  
<P>
However, the Government have now accepted our  analysis. If anyone quibbles about that, we should have an  emergency sitting on the matter, because, as tomorrow's  Hansard will show in black and white, the Minister told  the Committee that stakeholder pensions were intended  only for people earning up to £18,000 a year. His  interpretation is diametrically opposed to that contained  in the Green Paper, which states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"many people earning over £20,000 a year will be able, now and in  the future, to take advantage of the lower charges, greater flexibility,  and simpler tax regime which stakeholder pension schemes will  introduce."   
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The Government have therefore accepted that that  statement is a complete falsehood and that it is untrue that  people earning more than £20,000 a year will enjoy lower  charges, greater flexibility and a simpler tax regime. They  have accepted that the opposite is true: such people will  endure greater costs, less flexibility and a tax regime that  makes a nonsense of contemplating a stakeholder pension.  In accepting or analysis, the Government are now saying  that the scheme was intended only for people earning up  to £18,000 a year. That completely contradicts the pup  that they sold the British public during the last general  election. The Green Paper, which was issued as recently  as 15 December, makes it clear that  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Stakeholder pension schemes will be open to everyone"    
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
and explicitly invites those earning more than £20,000 a  year to subscribe.  
<P>
The Committee really has done its work this morning.  We now know the truth behind the Government's  proposals. They differ utterly from those that were being  sold to the British public until this morning. People who  earn between £9,000 and £18,000 a year will be  constrained by stakeholder pensions. That is not good  news for the British public as a whole; nor do stakeholder  pensions constitute a new pension option for everyone.  The Green Paper claims that they are an excellent formula  for employees who are not part of occupational schemes,  but that is not true.  
<P>
Many people who voted Labour at the last general  election probably thought, "That's wonderful. Sadly, my  employer doesn't have an occupational pension scheme,  but a Labour Government would introduce stakeholder  pensions and I would be protected and given a benefit  equivalent to an occupational pension."   Not only were  those earning more than £20,000 a year not told that  stakeholder pensions would be unsuitable for them, but  some provisions in the Bill would make it absolutely  barmy for such a person to enter such a scheme. Those  people voted for the scheme and they have been sold a  pup. It has taken until March nearly two years after the  general election and three months after the publication  of the Green Paper to establish that point clearly and  unambiguously. The Bill is an absolute fraud. It is not  what it was sold as being and we will vote against it. We  will put our amendment to the vote at the earliest  opportunity.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am reluctant to rise to the hon.  Gentleman's bait. However, I would agree, that the  Committee has served its purpose if it has compelled him  to read the Green Paper, which he has apparently not done  so far. Under the heading, "Stakeholder pension  schemes"  , in paragraph 27 of page 5, it states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"They are particularly designed to help those on middle incomes  (between roughly £9,000 and £18,500 a year)"  .  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies rose   </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, I will not give way.  
<P>
That has always been the intention of the stakeholder  pension. The sentence also states rightly that the  stakeholder pension  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"will benefit those on higher incomes too."       
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
Many people on incomes of more than £20,000 a year  will benefit from the simplicity and other features of the  stakeholder pension.  
<P>
The aim of stakeholder pensions is, and has always  been, to extend funded pension provision to people who  have not previously had access to it. Those are the people  with whom we are concerned.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Minister is in danger of running out  of credibility altogether. It was only when he saw me rise  in my place that he read from the end of that sentence,  which states that the stakeholder pension will also benefit  those on higher incomes. We have clearly established that  the Green Paper was sold as a set of proposals that would  be of interest to anyone who did not have an occupational  pension scheme. It is clear that that is not the case. The  Minister said that people on higher incomes would benefit  from the simplicity, but they will not. The so-called  simplicity is the single figure of £3,600 a year as a tax  deduction, which makes no sense for those earning more  than £20,000 a year as the Minister has accepted as  they would lose out on a tax break that would apply if  they invested in a personal pension or other form of  pension but not if they invested in a stakeholder pension  scheme. The simplicity is therefore bogus. To say  otherwise would be a great tragedy and an example of  mis-selling. I am sorry that the Minister probably has  sovereign immunity and therefore cannot be sued for  mis-selling if someone earning more than £20,000 enter a  stakeholder scheme.  
<P>
The debate has been most revealing. It has revealed that  the stakeholder pension could be a dangerous product for  those earning more than £20,000 a year. It will not be in  the interests of such people to join a stakeholder scheme  and the Minister has only admitted now that it is designed  for those earning less than £18,000 a year. It is absolutely  disgraceful that the Government should play ducks and  drakes with people's savings and give them a completely  false impression of this product. If we had not had this  debate, no one would have acknowledged on behalf of the  Government that the product is extremely dangerous for  anyone earning more than £20,000 a year. The  Government have behaved appallingly by concealing one  of the central realities of the scheme from Parliament and  the public until this sitting.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 2, line 15, leave out  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, or may be expected to qualify for,'.  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may also consider  Government amendment No. 17.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> These are minor, technical amendments,  which clarify the meaning of tax approval, as referred to  in clause 1(8) and 1(9).  
<P>
Amendment No. 16 removes the reference in clause 1(8)  to schemes that might be expected to qualify for tax  exemption or tax approval. That reference is unnecessary  because all schemes will be required to be tax exempt or tax  approved under clause 1(9) and the details of the tax  arrangements for stakeholder pension schemes will be set  out in Inland Revenue legislation.  
<P>
Amendment No. 17 ensures that tax approval, referred  to in clause 1(9), has the same meaning as in clause 1(8).  To ensure that all Committee members are clear about  this, let me set out what the effect of those amendments  will be. Under clause 1(8), as amended, as scheme must  accept transfers from other schemes, unless to do so  would prejudice their tax-proof status. Clause 1(9), as  amended, requires schemes to be tax approved. I  commend the amendments to the Committee.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I do not know why the Minister  does not want to explain to the Committee the real purpose  of the amendments. As you will recall, Mr. McWilliam, I  am something of an aficionado of the Committee that  considers Finance Bills, although I am no longer allowed to  serve on it no doubt, to your great disappointment when  you Chair that Committee.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Neither am I, having chaired  that Committee twice.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> As I recall, a year or two ago, the Revenue  was concerned that there was some abuse. Until now, the  system for approving pension schemes has been that the  Revenue would give interim approval when a new scheme  was set up, giving itself time to investigate the scheme  and examine its rules and conditions and then give  definitive approval later. However, there were abuses.  People were paying sums of money to make transfers into  a scheme that, with interim approval, was legal up to the  present time, but as the Revenue had not considered the  rules of the scheme, it had not noticed that it contained  carefully drafted provisions that allowed money to be paid  outside the pension shelter. Therefore, a person would  have had a tax deduction for making a contribution into a  scheme, which was transferred into a scheme with interim  Revenue approval and then paid out of that scheme  legally, because the scheme was simply applying the rules  to which the Revenue had, perhaps unduly hastily, given  interim approval into a non-approved scheme, which  was freely available to the beneficiaries of that money or  perhaps paid abroad. That was clearly a tax scam.  
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that my understanding of the  position is correct? If it is, I do not know why it has to  be stated from the Opposition Benches. The Committee  should know what the background is.  
<P>
I am surprised that the Government have introduced  this provision, because last year's Finance Act removed  the principle of interim approval, so the system no longer  exists. I am therefore not sure why we need the  amendment. We are not opposed to the amendment in  principle, but the Committee should be given a clearer  explanation of why it is now necessary.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The amendment removes the apparent  availability of provisional approval from stakeholder  pensions, which by definition will be approved. If it were  not approved, they would not be stakeholder pensions.  Therefore, we do not need the reference in subsection (8)  to the words  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may be expected to qualify for"  .  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
If pensions have not been approved, they will not be  stakeholder pensions. The reference is unnecessary and  incorrect. It suggests that something could be a  stakeholder pension if it is expected to qualify for tax  exemption. That is not the case: it will have been  approved if it is a stakeholder scheme.  
<P>
The amendment is a technical change to correct the  drafting. It does nothing more than that. No more is going  on than I have drawn the Committee's attention to.  
{**fc
<p5**}Mr. Davies: The 1993 Act gives a broad definition of  tax exemption and tax approval. It says:   <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`tax-exemption' and `tax-approval' mean respectively exemption  from tax and approval of the Inland Revenue, in either case under  any such provision of the Income Tax Acts as may be prescribed"  .  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
I therefore cannot see any danger in allowing the present  wording to remain.  
<P>
However, that is not a matter with which Opposition  Members wish to hold up the Committee unduly. It seems  to be a more a matter for the Finance Bill, unless the  matter was resolved properly in last year's Finance Act.  My understanding was that it had been, in which case we  would not have needed to have this debate. The  Government seem to be in a technical muddle about it.  However, we shall not oppose the Government's  amendments, as we seem to be at one on the objective,  which is to ensure that we do not use the interim approval  system to allow loss of tax and the development of an  expensive tax scam.  
<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(10) The ninth condition is that the scheme shall provide to  somebody who applies to join the scheme full and accurate advice  as to how a stakeholder pension would benefit the applicant  compared with other types of pension and shall tell the applicant  that they have up to 28 days to cancel the application without cost  or penalty; and an applicant to a stakeholder pension scheme shall  have up to 28 days from receiving the said advice to cancel the  application without cost or penalty.'.  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Although I shall not sit down between  speaking to the two amendments, I shall deal with them  separately as they relate to two distinct issues.  
{**fc
<p4**}Amendment No. 6 attempts, not for the first time during  our proceedings, to put into the Bill something that we  were promised. I refer the Committee to page 90 of the  Green Paper. Chapter 10, paragraph 20 states:      <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"all money purchase schemes should be required to provide annual  statements showing the projected value of the individual's fund at  retirement age and the amount of pension that it might buy at  today's prices"  . 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Clause 1 seeks to ensure that all stakeholder pension  schemes are money purchase schemes. We have said that  that is not a sensible or sound distinction and we shall  have another opportunity to argue the point when we  discuss new clause 2. It is another example of unnecessary  and undesirable fragmentation. Under the Government's  definition, stakeholder schemes are money purchase  schemes, so the provision requiring an annual report will  apply to those schemes.  
<P>
Let us clear our minds. We do not accept that  stakeholder pension schemes should be only money  purchase schemes, but we accept that all schemes,  whether money purchase or not, should provide an annual  report. Provisions exist for occupational pension schemes  to report to their beneficiaries, but there are not yet  provisions for LISAs to report to their beneficiaries. There  should be a blanket provision requiring all stakeholder  pension schemes, whether involving known vehicles or  those to be developed, to make an annual report to their  members. It is a fundamental principle that anyone who  manages money on behalf of a third party and, therefore,  has a fiduciary responsibility to the third party should be  formally accountable to that third party. That discipline is  important for both parties. It is important for people to  know where they stand with their pension provision so  that they can see what income they might expect in  retirement and what savings they should be making. They  can then make an inter-generational decision on how to  spread their consumption pattern over their lifetime in so  far as the essential elements in that calculation can be  known or estimated in advance.  
<P>
It is common ground between the Opposition and the  Government that it should be axiomatic for pension  schemes to report to their members. We were  disappointed to see that that important provision in the  Green Paper is not in the Bill, so we decided to try to  put it there. We also want to make some changes to the  Government's provisions. We want to relax the restriction  on money purchase schemes, which is completely wrong,  and to define differently the matters on which a report  should be made. The Green Paper says that schemes  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"should be required to provide annual statements showing the  projected value of the individual's fund at retirement age and the  amount of pension it might buy at today's prices"  .  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The projected value of a fund at retirement age could  be based on nominal or real terms. The amount of  pension that it might buy at today's prices is an  interesting idea because it implies that an estimate is  made of the real value of the sum available when the  pension matures and real annuity rates at that time. The  only way of doing that is to make an assumption about  the real investment return. Projections can be made  about that from historical indices. It could be assumed  that the real investment return is 3 per cent. over the  long haul or, if the investment is in equities, perhaps a  more conservative estimate of 2 per cent. or two point  something per cent. might be made. Such assumptions  may be acceptable, but when someone is starting his  working life and has just taken out a stakeholder  pension at the age of 20, it would be a dubious exercise  to make a stab at what annuity rates might be 60 year  in the future. In the past five years, nominal annuity  rates have more than halved from around 12 per cent.  to less than 5 per cent. I do not know whether anyone  predicted that serious fall. It is clear that insurance  companies and life offices did not predict it because  some were guaranteeing annuity rates 10 years ago.     
<P>
The Government have not thought through the  provisions. This is another example of their shoddy  homework, and I hope to provide more evidence of that.  They did not have the sense to wait for the consultation  period to expose their obvious errors. As a result, they  have had to face the humiliation of being told in  Committee in public where they have made elementary  errors or, in this case, unreasonable assumptions.  
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
We have tried to produce rules for the reports. It is not  enough to say that stakeholder pension managers, trustees  or employers shall report: we must state what the report  should cover. According to the amendment, the report  would contain  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the total sums paid into the scheme for the member's account"  .  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
It is important that the member should know how much  money has gone into his account. He can only evaluate  an investment return in relation to what he has put in  because an investment return is a return on the amount  invested.  
<P>
We deliberately use the words, "paid into"  . It is in the  passive voice, because although the member may have  been making the payments, we want to encourage  employers to contribute. However, given what was said  when we discussed bringing occupational pensions and  salary-related schemes into the ambit of a stakeholder  pension, I am not sure that that is what the Government  want. If employers are contributing to a scheme for  example, a group personal pension scheme we want to  be able to merge that scheme with a stakeholder pension  to ensure continuity, reduce costs and make matters clear  to all beneficiaries.  
<P>
The amendment would also take full account of the  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"sums deducted from the scheme for any purpose"  ,  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
which the Government do not mention in the Green Paper.  That means fees, commissions, expenses anything that  covers money paid in by the member or his employer on  his behalf, but which is not utilised for the member's  benefit. This is important. In reporting to the beneficiary  of the stakeholder pension, the employer would have a  legal obligation to distinguish we do not want to confuse  anyone with extraneous considerations between sums  that have been invested in the beneficiary's account and  all other moneys abstracted from that sum for whatever  purpose. It does not matter to the individual whether an  expense is called a commission, charge, cost, brokerage  or an administration fee. Those are clever marketing  gimmicks designed to make the removal of money from  a pensioner more palatable.  
<P>
Paragraph (a) of the amendment deals with the gross  amount that is paid into a scheme and paragraph (b) deals  with the net amount how much has been abstracted  that has been invested of a pensioner. Paragraph (c)  refers to  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the current value of the sums held for the member's account"  .        
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
Paragraphs (a) and (b) would give the net amount invested  and paragraph (c) would give the present value the  investment return. There would be negative investment  return if (a) minus (b) was greater than (c). If (a) minus  (b) was less than (c), there would be positive investment  return, at least nominally I shall deal with the concepts  of real and nominal in a moment. It is a very simple linear  equation, which anyone could put into a computer without  too much difficulty.  
<P>
Now we come to (d), and this is where we can improve  on the Government's proposals. They have not done their  homework, so perhaps we can help them. It is important  to make it absolutely clear whether the projected rates of  return are to be real or nominal. We have said that they  should be real rates of return. The reason for that is  simple.  
<P>
It has been a nasty feature of the selling of personal  pensions that people were sold pensions on the basis of  projections of value based on nominal rates of return.  Projections were made on the basis of a rate of return of  12 per cent. or 8 per cent. a year. In return for modest  contributions, tremendous sums were held out to  individuals as prospectively available in retirement. That  is fundamentally deceptive because we all know that real  rates of return are never in the order of 8 per cent. or  12 per cent. Those rates of return can only be achieved  nominally in conditions of high inflation. However, if  there is high inflation, that will erode the nominal value  of the accumulated pension fund when it becomes  available to purchase an annuity or otherwise to provide  an income for the beneficiary.  
<P>
The beneficiary needs to know the real rate of return.  In other words, what the relationship is between  consumption foregone and consumption prospectivley to  be enjoyed in future. Only if there is a positive  relationship will the individual be attracted to invest or to  make pension provision. Clearly, as was said earlier in  our discussions, tax can make an important difference to  that calculation, but the calculation must be based on real  rates of return.  
<P>
Therefore, we want projections to be based on reasonable  real rates of return. The word "reasonable"   is included so  that projections can be challenged subsequently if those  rates are unduly optimistic. They can be challenged in  court, if necessary, by the regulators, who may ask, "Why  do you say that 4 per cent. or 5 per cent. is a reasonable  long-term rate of return when it is far greater than the  historic rate of return over the long haul for equivalent  periods?"   Of course, it might be much less than rates of  return in the equity market over short periods, but it is  important that any rates of return included in projections  should be responsible, cautious and conservative, and  that,
{**fcif they are not, they can be challenged. That is why we  included the word "reasonable"   in amendment No. 6.  Amendment No. 6 continues:  
<p10**}"indicating the range of amounts likely to be available to the  member on retirement in the event either of the suspension of further  contributions on his behalf or of their continuance at the current  level."           <P>
  
<P>
That is a very important provision. Projections must be  based on two assumptions so that the member can be clear  where he or she stands in the event of either of those  assumptions being fulfilled. The first assumption is that  no more money is paid in, so the member receives the  report but is no longer able to make a contribution to a  stakeholder pension because he or she no longer has the  money to do so, because of family responsibilities or a  decline in earnings, or he or she has been forced out of  the stakeholder pension scheme because he or she now  earns more than the £18,000. We learned this morning,  sensationally, that the Government do not intend the  stakeholder pension to be a good deal for people in that  category.  
<P>
I hope that, as a result of this morning's discussion  receiving considerable publicity, people will be wise to  that and will not be fooled or cheated, as they otherwise  might be, if they had only read the Green Paper or the  Bill and were not aware of our discussion on the subject.  Such people will find that they cannot remain in the  stakeholder pension scheme but must start investing in  another personal pension or LISA. However, they will  still receive the annual report of the stakeholder pension,  to which they might have ceased to contribute some years  previously, because they will still want to know what the  investment returns is. They might not like the investment  return. For example, they might think that the way in  which the fund manager had invested the money was  wrong, or they might want a slightly more aggressive, or  even a less risk-averse, portfolio in their stakeholder fund.  They might want the fund to be more equity based with  less fixed interest, or they might want to invest in the  emerging markets. If they had a substantial and diversified  portfolio, that might be a perfectly responsible decision.  In those cases, the report would show them what return  they had and what the fund was currently worth. On that  basis, they would be able to make a projection of the rate  of investment return, which would give them some idea  of where they stood on retirement, When they will need  to draw on the investment.  
<P>
Other people will expect to continue to contribute to  the stakeholder pension or at least, one hopes that they  will. The category of people for whom the Government's  proposal will be a good deal is becoming narrower as  our consideration of the Bill proceeds. However, someone  might expect his earnings in real terms to continue at  roughly the same level for the rest of his career and the  family budget may make allowances for a certain pension  contribution each year. That person will want to know  what his fund will be worth if no further contributions are  made and what it is likely to be worth if contributions  continue at their present rate until a particular future date,  which will presumably be his date of retirement, when he  will start to draw on income from the fund or buy an  annuity with the proceeds.     
<P>
The matter is simple and we want the projections to be  presented on those two bases. Anyone who has been  listening to me [Laughter.] No such person could deny  for a moment that we are making a serious attempt to  push disclosure to what we believe to be prudent  limits [Interruption.]

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It may be the proximity to  lunch, but Committee members are getting a wee bit  restive. They may feel that they do not have to listen to  the hon. Gentleman, but Standing Orders require me to  do so and I have listened to his every word.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Frankly, the way in which we exposed the  true nature of the stakeholder proposal in an earlier debate  will have left Labour Members feeling a bit sore. I  understand their feelings they are probably anxious to  get out of the Committee Room as quickly as possible and  to drown their cares in one way or another. However, I  cannot help that. They will have to sit here until you  decide, Mr. McWilliam, that our sitting is at an end. No  Labour Member has said a word so far. I hope that they  will contribute to our debate because I genuinely hope  that they want to disclose information to beneficiaries of  pension funds about the way in which their money has  been managed.  
<P>
I was saying that anyone who listened to my remarks  would be persuaded that the Conservative party is making,  and will continue to make, an honest and thorough attempt  to ensure that the reports are produced and that they  contain the essential information, but not too much. Too  much information can muddle people, which is not a good  idea, and it is too often used to conceal the truth. The  reports should contain what people need to know about  their pension scheme.  
<P>
We should not place on employers or on trustees or  managers of the schemes a burden to provide information  that is based on hypothetical or speculative assumptions,  the value of which is extremely dubious. That, I fear, is  how I have to characterise the Government's requirements  in the Green Paper. There is a strange relationship  between the Green Paper and the Bill. Much that is  promised in the Green Paper is not in the Bill, and, as we  discovered earlier this morning, some proposals that are  promised in the Green Paper have a quite different form  in the Bill. Therefore, I do not know what the Minister  will say on this subject.  
<P>
I am worried about the ambiguity of the provisions on  page 90 of the Green Paper, which concern the reports'  content. It is not clear whether nominal or real projections  are required. I am particularly concerned about the  provision I assume that that is what it is as I cannot put  any other interpretation on it that the reports should  make an assumption about future real annuity rates. That  is utterly irresponsible. Anyone who is forced to do that  will not be able to do it responsibly. Some actuaries will  say, "I can't do that. I shall not put my name to that sort  of thing."   It is like predicting what the weather will be  like on 23 November 2005. It is an absurd thing to ask an  actuary to do and I suspect that many professional  actuaries or accountants would refuse to do it.  
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government may have imposed an unenforceable  obligation . I do not suppose that an employer or fund  manager would be happy to make an assumption of that  kind, which would be quite outside his own professional  competence if the actuaries or accountants were not  prepared to endorse it. Even if someone were forced to  say something, he would simply have to think of a number  and double it, treble it, or divide it by something. it is a  thoroughly unsound procedure. The Government are  including the provision in the Green Paper out of  complete and utter incompetence and a lack of  understanding of these matters, as has been demonstrated  over and over again.  
<P>
The combination of incompetence and unwillingness to  respect the consultation procedure is a frightening  phenomenon and one that the public will be increasingly  aware of because you cannot fool all the people all the  time. It will have a deleterious impact on the interests of  individuals and on our economy.     
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not even trying to fool  some of the people some of the time.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I know that you would not want to fool  anybody any of the time, Mr. McWilliam.  
<P>
As there is no consultation period, this is our only  opportunity to comment on the shortcomings and  inadequacies of some of the proposals in the Green Paper.  Unless the Government want to do another U-turn or  somersault, I take it that they continue to be committed to  the principle of annual reports, which we endorse. If so,  it will be totally unsatisfactory if they say, "We'll do that  in regulation when we get around to it"  , particularly as  there are some serious and dangerous weaknesses in their  proposals for the structure of the reports. Therefore, we  need to debate the matter thoroughly now.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman has again expressed  his astonishment at the sensational discovery, as he put it,  that the stakeholder pension is designed for those earning  between £9,000 and £18,500 a year. He must be the only  member of the Committee who had not realised that  before our proceedings commenced. One has only to read  to page 5 of the Green Paper, which is not asking too  much of the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman, to  discover that that is the case.  
<P>
Both amendments would introduce new conditions,  which are either unnecessary or inappropriate.  Amendment No. 10 deals with the advice given to  prospective members of stakeholder schemes and  amendment No. 6 with the information provided to  members.  
<P>
The Green Paper proposed minimum standards for  stakeholder pension schemes. Our aim is to give people  confidence that their arrangement for their retirement  savings is secure, suitable for them and will deliver good  value for money.  
<P>
It is vital that people can seek financial advice when  they consider joining a pension scheme and that they will  receive good and accurate advice.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Davies:</B> I was hoping that the Minister would  take this opportunity to respond to my arguments on  amendment No. 6 and I was hoping to catch your eye  again later, Mr. McWilliam, to present amendment No. 10 and hear the Government's proposals on that.  However, the Minister seems to be about to read his  brief on amendment No. 10. We need answers on the  important matter of the content of the annual report to  be made under amendment No. 6.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The amendments are grouped  for the good reason that they cover broadly the same  subject. Hon. Members may discuss them in any order  they wish.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> If I remember rightly, Mr. McWilliam,  the hon. Gentleman said that he did not intend to sit down  between speaking to the two amendments, so it is  appropriate that I respond to both of them now. Even  though the hon. Gentleman has not said anything about  amendment No. 10, he said that he would do so. It raises  the important question of financial advice. One of our  priorities when we took office in 1997 was to ensure that  pension companies and advisers cleared up the mis-selling  scandal that we inherited from the previous Government.  We must ensure that nothing similar happens in future.     
<P>
We are not, as some have said, suggesting that  everyone should join a stakeholder scheme without taking  advice, but one reason for seeking advice is the  complexity of many personal pensions and how they are  run. Stakeholder pension schemes will have additional  safeguards because the detailed standards that we shall set  out will help people to understand what they are buying  and provide vital reassurance.  
<P>
Amendment No. 10 would require people to take proper  financial advice, and that has a cost. That cost is often  worth paying, but not everyone who wants to join a  stakeholder scheme would need individual advice. Many  people are able to make a sensible choice, given the right  information, without taking specific financial advice. The  amendment would impose an excessive cost on schemes  if they had to provide full advice to everyone who  expressed an interest in joining.  
<P>
Combined with the second part of amendment No. 10,  which would allow people to cancel their application with  no cost to themselves, schemes could be forced to  subsidise free financial advice to anyone who chose to  approach them. That may be an unintended consequence  of the amendment, but it would be a consequence because  it would require stakeholder pension providers to give free  financial advice to everyone who might want to sign up  to a scheme and then allow them 28 days in which to  withdraw. The amendment is unwise and I suggest that  the 14-day period which applies to personal pension  schemes has proved adequate.  
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 6, to which the hon. Member  for Grantham and Stamford devoted his comments. Like  him, we want scheme members to have access to quality  information about their pensions. The Green Paper  proposed that stakeholder pension schemes should  provide members with at least annual information on the  value of their pensions, the contributions paid and the  charges deducted by the scheme. That will be achieved  under existing powers in the Pension Schemes Act 1993.  
<P>
Flexibility is important in the detailed rules of  stakeholder pension schemes. We should not be too  prescriptive at this stage and rule out issues that we might  subsequently wish to include. The Green Paper suggested  that the annual statement should provide information on  how much higher a pension would be if the level of saving  were increased by, say, 5 per cent. The amendment does  not cover that and we might want to introduce such a  requirement because it would help people to see how  much better off they would be in retirement if they were  able to increase their contributions by a specified amount.  It would also be helpful if the statement contained details  of when contributions were paid, but that also is not  covered by the amendment. I am not criticising the  amendment for that, but my general point is that such  topics should be covered in regulations and not in the Bill.     
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether we would refer to  the real or the nominal anticipated increase in the value of  people's savings. I know that he has seen the consultation  document, entitled "Strengthening the Pensions  Framework"  , which was published just after the Green  Paper, but perhaps he has not had time to read it.  Although the consultation period has finished, we  consulted on proposals to improve pension forecasts for  all money purchase schemes. Paragraph 29(5) of the  document states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We believe members of money purchase pension schemes must  have better information about the level of pension they might  achieve. We also believe it should be expressed in a way which  allows them to judge the relative spending power of the projected  pension at today's prices (and possibly expressed as a proportion of  current salary)."   
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman is now reassured that we  entirely accept that projections must be made at today's  prices, so that people can understand their position. 
<P>
We want to find the best way to provide members with  information on their likely retirement income from  stakeholder pensions. However, we need the flexibility to  amend the requirements in the light of experience of such  schemes. The concerns raised by both amendments are  important and we shall deal with them. I hope that the  hon. Gentleman will be satisfied with that assurance.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am satisfied with the Minister's  assurance that the projections for beneficiaries in the  annual stakeholder report will be made in real terms.  However, he avoided answering my point that it will be  impossible responsibly to provide people with an  indication of the purchasing power of their pensions in  retirement. Perhaps he did not understand the argument,  or perhaps he was so embarrassed that he did not want to  refer to it. I do not want to go into the matter again, but  I wonder whether the Minister grasped my explanation of  the impossibility and irresponsibility of making  projections on future annuity rates. Unless one can make  a realistic assumption about the annuity rate, it will be  impossible to estimate the purchasing power in retirement  of an individual who has to use a lump sum accumulated  through a pension scheme to purchase an annuity. If there  is a way of making such an estimate without making such  an assumption, perhaps the Minister would explain it to  me. 
<P>
The whole matter is extremely unsatisfactory. We are  told that the provisions cannot be included in the Bill and  that they must be included through amendments.  However, the Government are quite wrong-headed about  the matter. I referred to a quotation from the Green Paper  that implies a need to project future annuity rates. The  Minister quoted from another document, which also refers  to the purchasing power that will be available to  pensioners on receipt of their pensions. 
<P>
I note that you are fidgeting in your chair, Mr. McWilliam. I have finished discussing amendment  No. 6, but I want to consider amendment No. 10, which  gives rise to some extremely important matters.  Amendment No. 6 would give effect to a fundamental  principle that, I believe, we share with the Government.  However, the reverse is the case in respect of amendment  No. 10. The Government have told the public that one of  the benefits of the stakeholder pension scheme will be its  simplicity. People will not need expensive and detailed  professional advice, or, indeed, any advice. 
<P>
We contend that the reverse is true. The Government  have made the pension scheme so complicated and  fragmented that the need for advice has greatly increased.  Such advice must take account of the state second pension  that the Government are threatening to introduce and of  welfare reforms. Those reforms will affect the trade-off  between the sacrificing of current consumption by  individuals to provide for future pensions and the loss of  means-tested benefits that the accumulation of pension  rights or, indeed, of other savings, will entail. 
<P>
The matter is one of vital importance. I fear that one of  the Bill's most damaging provisions will be to require  people to obtain sophisticated professional advice, which  they will be unable to get, to make their way through the  convoluted thicket of differential tax regimes and pension  products. Therefore, the Bill is a formula for mis-selling  on a hitherto undreamt of scale.
