<H4><center>(Afternoon)</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. John Maxton in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199899/cmbills/042/1999042.htm">Immigration and Asylum Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. I want to clear up some confusion that arose on Tuesday and that may have been my fault for not asking precise questions.
<P>
The Minister will recall that on Tuesday we debated the immigration rules and that I asked him to place a copy of the them in the Library. He referred to new immigration rules and said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Rule 321 of the immigration rules already restricts the ability of immigration officers to refuse when a person has entry clearance. New rule 2(a) and (b) will enable them to do that on similar grounds. An immigration officer will be able to cancel extant leave as a result of paragraph 38 of schedule 12.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
At that point, I asked the Minister whether he would let members of the Committee have copies of that rule and he replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I have no problem with giving the hon. Gentleman a copy of all the immigration rules; they are public documents and we will ensure that they are made available to members of the Committee.''&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 13 April 1999; c. 525.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Later in the same sitting, I asked the Minister a similar question to confirm whether copies of the rules would be made available. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If the hon. Member for Hertsmere or any other hon. Member wants to see the immigration rules, they are in the Library, as they have been for a long time. They are public documents, obtainable from many places.``&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 13 April 1999; c. 533.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I went to the Library to look at the immigration rules and I found rule 321. It is broken down into paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, but there is no 2(a) or 2(b). It is probably my fault for not asking my question precisely, but will the Minister tell us whether new immigration rules are being prepared? If they are, when will they be available? As and when they are available, can they be made available to Members of the Committee?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not strictly a point of order for the Chair, but the Minister may want to clarify the matter.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. Mike O'Brien): Further to that point of order, Mr. Maxton. As the hon. Gentleman has found out, the immigration rules are available in the Library. I understood that his questions were about the immigration rules that are currently available and that he had not understood that they were public documents. However, I shall consider his points and will ensure that he has a written reply before Monday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Maxton. I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. I understand that he cannot clear everything up now, but I am sure that he understands that it is important that all the documents are available to us for our debates. If references are made to new rules, we should be able to see them.
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Removal of Certain Persons Unlawfullyin the United Kingdom</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 115, in page 4, line 30, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(1A) Directions may not be given under subsection (1) unless the Secretary of State is satisified that all relevant factors listed in the immigration rules have been considered'.''&#151;[Mr. Allan.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We need to speed up the system. The deportation system is manifestly slow and cumbersome and produces inequity. It needs reform. Those who have leave to remain that expires may apply to have it extended and can remain for the appeal provided that they make the initial application within the time limit.
<P>
The clause deals with those who have overstayed and who have not sought to apply to remain and are here unlawfully. Such people are not, in the main, much different from illegal immigrants in the sense that they have no right to be here.
<P>
Historically, once they have come to the notice of the authorities, many of them seek to use the deportation appeal process to delay removal.
<P>
Our aim is that persons who have no right to be here should be removed unless there are compassionate or other grounds for them to remain. We shall introduce immigration rules to allow such circumstances to be considered, but we believe that we should move quickly to remove people who should not be here.
<P>
Persons can avoid the provisions in the clause by making an in-time application for variation of their leave. They will then have an unrestricted right of appeal, in which they can rely on personal circumstances, no matter when they were last given leave. We are therefore dealing with a particular category of persons and we believe that the proposal is reasonable and fair.
<P>
If persons who have a decision made against them believe that some right of theirs has been infringed, they will be able to appeal under clause 47 and under the European convention; if they believe that there has been a breach of law, they will have the normal judicial review rights. We do not believe that we should produce a system that enables people to delay their removal from this country for ever by making a series of appeals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan (Sheffield, Hallam):</B> This has been a useful debate, eliciting a concrete commitment from the Minister that a similar rule will be placed in the immigration rules in respect of removals under clause 6. Therefore, we are at least clear about what we are discussing and understand from the Minister's one-word ``yes'' answer that that will be done, and that is helpful. We continue to have concerns about the removal of the appeals procedure, but we shall return to that in more detail on later clauses.
<P>
To resolve the problem by putting something into the immigration rules must cause concern that it will widen the scope for judicial review as perhaps the only way to challenge the Secretary of State's decision, if no other appeal mechanism is available to those removed under the clause. Experience from the visitor visa applications process is that people have found other ways to appeal where a formal right of appeal has been removed. We are all aware that people visit hon. Members in their surgeries to appeal their visitor applications and ask them to write to the Minister.
<P>
We remain concerned about these issues, but I am sure that we shall have plenty of time to debate them later in the Bill. Therefore, to expedite matters, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 81, in page 4, line 35, after `(b)', insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may bring an appeal or.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 7.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The clause changes the enforcement action from overstayers and others in breach of conditions from deportation to removal. So far, we have examined the issue from the point of view of the consequences for appeal rights. We must also consider whether it strengthens or weakens the apparatus of enforcement.
<P>
Amendment No. 81 clarifies the point at which such enforcement will kick in. Does it include a person who may bring an appeal, but has not yet done so? Will action be taken against somebody he or she can still bring an appeal? If so, that must be considered because we do not want to run the risk of triggering extra appeals so that a person can bring themselves within the protection of the Bill by having brought an appeal.
<P>
It is a straightforward point and I look to the Minister to deal with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. Indeed, at first sight amendment No. 81 appears to be a helpful attempt to clarify the matter. If I understand it correctly, the amendment attempts to close what appears to be a gap and prevent a person being removed under the clause in the interval between his or her application being refused and the end of the period for lodging an appeal against the decision.
<P>
I am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that we have no sharp practice in mind. My reason for resisting the amendment is that it is possible for an appeal to be brought out of time. If we were to use the definition in the amendment, it would place a prohibition on removal for a period during which an appeal may be brought. The amendment would put the removal on hold for an indefinite period, because, in theory, a person could appeal out of time at any time. I assure the hon. Gentleman that no attempt will be made to use the provisions to prevent someone who will be in time for an appeal from being removed from the country.
<P>
Amendment No. 7 is a drafting amendment. As currently worded, subsection (2)(b) implies that there will be a right of appeal against refusal of an application to vary the conditions attached to a period of limited leave. That is not the case. The provisions of part IV of the Bill will make it clear that in general a person will not have a right of appeal unless he is required to leave the United Kingdom. Amendment No. 7 simply reflects that by making it clear that the appeal in question can relate only to a refusal to vary the time limit and not to a refusal to vary the conditions.
<P>
Clause 6 does not confer any right of appeal of itself, but subsection (2) refers to the case where someone has brought an appeal in circumstances allowed under part IV of the Bill. On the basis of the undertakings and commitments that I have given to the hon. Members for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) and for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) I ask for the amendment to be withdrawn and for the Committee to support amendment No. 7.
<P>
<B>Mr. Neil Gerrard </B>(Walthamstow): My hon. Friend has clarified that we do not want people to be able to drag out the process indefinitely by saying that they may bring an appeal at some time in the future. I understand that perfectly. Could I be clear about what the process would be? If someone is entitled to an appeal, would there normally be a time limit for that appeal to be brought and would we expect the removal process to kick in when that time limit expired?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am certainly happy to clarify that. It is intended that people should not be removed during such time as they could, within the time limit, enter an appeal. However, once the time limit has expired and they have not attempted to appeal, obviously we would then consider the removal process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened to the Minister's response. It is one of those areas where it is important to look at every detail. In the light of the Minister's assurance, which seems fairly specific, I beg to ask to leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 7, in page 4, line 35, leave out `such an application' and insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`an application for a variation of the time limit'.&#151;[Mr. Mike O'Brien.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 8 in page 4, line 37, after `(1)(c)', insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`unless the Secretary of State has given the person concerned written notice, not'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 9.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Under the law as it stands, a deportation order cannot be made against the family member of someone who has been deported more than eight weeks after the first person has been left the country following the making of the deportation order. Once the deportation order has been made, it takes effect and can be enforced at any time. As drafted, clause 6 would require the directions for the removal of a family member to be given within that eight-week period.
<P>
Although we would normally aim to remove members of a family as a group, just as at present we would aim to deport all members of a family at the same time, under the clause as drafted it might be possible for the removal of one or more family members to be delayed by them beyond the eight-week period which would then mean that they could not be removed under these powers.
<P>
The amendments would allow family members to be removed provided that they have been given notice of what is intended within eight weeks of the first person's removal. The new subsection inserted by amendment No. 9 allows notice to be given by post to the person's last-known address which means that he cannot avoid being notified by going to ground. I ask the Committee to support the amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 9, in page 4, line 39, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, that he intends to remove the person concerned from the United Kingdom.
<P>
 ( ) If such a notice is sent by the Secretary of State by first class post, addressed to the person concerned's last known address, it is to be taken to have been received by that person on the second day after the day on which it was posted.'. [Mr. Mike O'Brien.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 80, in page 5, line 9, at end add&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(8A) Directions for the removal of a person under this section may include an order prohibiting the re-entry of the person to the United Kingdom.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Earlier, I mentioned the important issue of enforcement. We are always prepared to consider circumstances in which compassion should be used, but they should be balanced with enforcement. It is sometimes necessary to ascertain where the balance lies. There are several critical questions about the way in which the Government have set the balance in clause 6.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Let us consider the effect of deportation in the circumstances that the clause outlines. Two issues are relevant to enforcement. First, we must ensure that enforcement proceedings are brought against those who are liable to them. Secondly, we should consider what happens after enforcement proceedings have been brought.
<P>
There is a difference between deportation and removal.
<P>
As the Committee knows from our earlier discussion, clause 6 will shift into the category of being liable to removal many people who would hitherto have been liable to deportation proceedings because of overstaying or breach of conditions, for example, by working when they had entered the country on condition that they would not work.
<P>
The consequences of deportation are more long term than those of removal. For example, a person who has been deported is prevented from re-entering the United Kingdom. That is important in view of the range of people against whom deportation proceedings may be brought. Those proceedings are not brought only against people who have breached control by overstaying, or those who have breached a condition, but against a range of other people who will continue to be deported under the new dispensation. They include people who have been recommended for deportation by the courts. That shows that deportation constitutes a serious step. Some people are recommended for deportation on the ground that their presence in this country is not conducive to the public good.
<P>
Amendment No. 80 deals with the longer term consequences of deportation. People who leave the United Kingdom with a deportation order cannot return while the order remains current. If they gain entry while the deportation order is still valid, they will have entered the country illegally. Therefore they can be arrested and removed promptly. The order has to be revoked before they can return. Every year, several appeals seek the revocation of deportation orders. A person who has been deported, must apply for the deportation order to be revoked. That places a significant hurdle in the way of those who try to return.
<P>
The hurdle does not exist in the case of removal proceedings, and would not apply to those who will be shifted into the removals category under clause 6. There are no formal procedures to restrict applications for return from those who have been removed as illegal entrants. Such people would have to satisfy the requirements of immigration law and rules.
<P>
However, there is no order in place preventing them from returning, as there is the case of deportation orders.
<P>
I do not know whether the Minister has the facts at his finger tips, but it would be interesting to know the number of cases in which deportation orders are revoked as a result of an application. That would give us an idea of the size of the hurdle that has been put in place. I would appreciate it if the Minister would give us an estimate this afternoon, but I am happy to accept a letter with that information at a later date.
<P>
The Minister will be aware that, in many cases, people must wait abroad for some years before applying for a revocation. It would be helpful for Committee members to know the average length of time that people wait before a deportation order is revoked.
<P>
Certainly, a high hurdle is put in the way of people seeking to return to this country after deportation. That is right, but provision must be made for deportation orders to be re-examined and revoked.
<P>
The amendment would enable directions to be given to prohibit the re-entry of someone subjected to removal, and would introduce a provision similar to that currently obtaining in deportation cases. The Government propose to change the process from deportation to removal. However, amendment No. 80 proposes to put back in place the hurdle erected once a person has been deported. That hurdle would have to be surmounted before such a person were allowed back into the country.
<P>
If that is not the case, from at least one point of view, the Government are not strengthening enforcement&#151;as is their objective&#151;but weakening it. They are weakening provisions that may be needed to keep some people out of the country.
<P>
Will the Minister consider the amendment carefully? It is not, I hasten to add, intended to apply to every case. I accept that there should be a mechanism whereby the direction in it could, in time, be revoked, should the person concerned make a case for such revocation.
<P>
However, people who have been properly deported from this country, along with those who have been removed, should face such a hurdle because they have been through a legal process and their cases have received consideration. However, those who have been removed will have had many of their appeal rights curtailed. Even so, deportees and those who have been removed have been found to be overstaying. Given that appeal rights are curtailed in removal cases, there is a case to be made for putting in place such a hurdle.
<P>
Will the Minister clarify that the measure will not result in a weakening of our immigration controls? He knows from the debate on clause 1 that we take that subject seriously. We wish to debate compassionate circumstances, but through our amendments, especially amendment No. 80, we are ready to examine the case for retaining strong immigration controls. The order prohibiting a deportee from returning would be a valuable provision, which should not be cast aside lightly.
<P>
Will the Minister give a considered response to our questions? How tough are the provisions and what conception do the Government have about dealing with people who have been removed from this country? We seek assurances on such matters, and need to know that, in future, things will be as tough under the clause as they currently are under the deportation system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The enforcement is strengthened if it is certain and delivered speedily. At the moment, the deportation process involves delay, as people drag out their removal from the United Kingdom. That damages families and immigration control, and we should not allow an old-fashioned, cumbersome procedure to interfere with the proper administration of immigration control.
<P>
As I have already told the Committee, hon. Members often bring me cases involving a particular person who has long overstayed in this country&#151;for all sorts of improper reasons&#151;but has nevertheless married, had children and secured a decent job. It is argued that that person is now making a contribution to society, yet is threatened with removal. Many hon. Members who come to see me clearly believe that that is not right and cannot believe that the Government intend to be so unpleasant to individuals who may have done something wrong in the distant past, but are now trying to adopt a more constructive approach to their presence in the UK.
<P>
The procedure is cumbersome. Most revocations of a period of control after deportation are connected with such circumstances, when we are seeking to reunite a family&#151;

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Let me answer the question and then I will allow the hon. Gentleman to intervene. The circumstances are often those in which we are trying to administer in favour of family life without compromising immigration control. In most cases we are able to do that.
<P>
The normal procedure for deportation orders is that three years have to elapse before a person can return. When a breadwinner who is holding a family together is involved, separating that family for three years can be burdensome.
<P>
Sometimes the family leaves the country for that period before returning even though the other partner and the children have a legitimate right to remain here: only one family member does not. Every Member of the Committee wants to enable family life to continue providing that it is compliant with immigration law.
<P>
We want to create a framework by which people can be removed from the UK more quickly, when necessary. We do not want the process to be dragged out&#151;often with the encouragement of unscrupulous lawyers or immigration advisers or other qualified people&#151;for year after year. However, if people have a proper reason to return to the UK, we want them to be able to apply quickly to do so. We do not want to disrupt family life unnecessarily, but we do not want people here who should not be here. Dragging out the process also results in enormous costs to the taxpayer.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked whether our proposals amounted to a relaxation of controls. In fact, they amount to a firming up of controls as well as feeding into a strong human rights and pro-family policy. Where enforcement is necessary, it will be done quickly: we do not mess about with people and we do not drag out processes unnecessarily which, in any case, can create new victims&#151;particularly when children are involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Faber (Westbury)</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I must give way to the hon. Member for Hertsmere before I give way to the hon. Member for Westbury (Mr. Faber).
<P>
We intend to speed up the process and imbue it with more certainty, which amounts to a strengthening of the system. However, I am sure that everyone agrees, as I said, with our attempting to maintain family life. It is all about achieving the right balance. The deportation procedure is enormously cumbersome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. He moved on from the issue on which I wanted to tackle him, but he has now returned to it. My point relates not so much to what happens in this country while the deportation process is gone through, but to what happens afterwards. What hurdles are in place to stop someone who has properly been deported from coming back into the country?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point entirely. My point is that there may be circumstances in which we do not wish to put hurdles in place because that may interfere with what both he and I doubtless wish&#151;to ensure that someone who has formed a proper relationship with a person who has a right to be here and who may have children and a job is able to keep the family together, even though something wrong may have been done in the past. That person's family life should not be unnecessarily compromised, although it may be right and proper for us to ask him or her to leave the country and make an application in the proper way. In other countries people are queuing for their right to enter the United Kingdom lawfully for marriage purposes, and it is wrong and improper that others should jump the queue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Let me answer the hon. Gentleman's last point.
<P>
The deportation process puts unnecessary barriers in the way of many legitimate cases. We want to remove unnecessary barriers and at the same time strengthen controls by not allowing people to drag out their cases.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked me how many deportation orders had been revoked. I cannot give him the figure off-hand. In the three-year period it is not many. It has almost never happened in respect of people who have committed serious criminal offences. We do not revoke cases where people have committed serious criminal offences and the court has ordered that they be removed, or if their behaviour is not conducive to the public good.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Surely the Minister is wrong in his answer. All the matters that he is talking about are compassionate matters&#151;family matters&#151;which should be considered before the person is required to leave the United Kingdom. The combined effect is that he is taking away rights to appeal that would enable those matters to be considered. He is saying to them, ``Go abroad. Then we can look at it. We will do it from abroad.'' The Minister is getting it entirely the wrong way round. The position looks worse all the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not understood what the clause puts in place. As I have said, we are changing the immigration rules so that in future compassionate circumstances can be taken into account when removal is being considered. That is not the case under the immigration rules. We shall introduce new immigration rules so that those matters can be considered.
<P>
However, there is a way to breach immigration controls that we must address. Some people enter the country, marry, and then say that they want to stay. They should obtain consent to come to the UK as a spouse before they marry. That is what should happen. They will then be dealt with in the normal way under the immigration rules. However, if a person seeks to circumvent those rules by coming in without the permission that has been required for a long time and then seeking to marry, the proper thing to do is to say, ``Go and get permission as everyone else must do. Get in the queue like everyone else&#151;it only takes a few months&#151;and do things properly. Then you can come in and resume your family life in the normal way.'' If the hon. Gentleman is saying that in every case a person who has got married should be able to stay, he is in effect condoning a breach of the immigration rules. I am sure that he does not support that idea.
<P>
The problem with the system of deportation orders is that it is a cumbersome process that is valid for the case of a serious criminal&#151;someone whose presence in the UK is not conducive to good order. However, for ordinary people who have overstayed for all sorts of reasons, some of which we may dislike and for some of which there may be explanations, there should be a system that enabled us to consider their individual circumstances and make sure that when we take action, we do not put unreasonable barriers in place.
<P>
That does not undermine our controls. If a visa national wishes to re-enter the UK, he must visit the high commission or the embassy and apply for a visa. At that point the fact that a person had been removed administratively would clearly be taken into consideration. In all likelihood, if that person had no good reason for re-entering the UK, the visa would be refused and he or she would not be able to re-enter the UK. Therefore, the condition that the amendment seeks to insert in the Bill would be unnecessary. Non-visa nationals could be refused leave to enter, because they would be applying for it in the normal way.
<P>
The controls exist and the amendment is completely unnecessary. In the cases that the hon. Gentleman and I would want to treat with compassion, it would create artificial and unnecessary barriers that would not improve immigration control. In many ways, they would create unnecessary difficulties for families.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister's response and I am always prepared to concede that I might be confused. Therefore, to satisfy myself that I am not confused, I shall take him through my concerns that arise out of his reply.
<P>
First, however, I must take the Minister to task on the subject of immigration rules. We shall come back to them again and again. It is no use our debating the provisions in the Bill if the Minister then says that everything will be all right because the Government will make provision in immigration rules. We have not had the opportunity to see the new immigration rules. We have found out today that there will be new rules; they may already be drafted and be lying in a desk in the Home Office&#151;I do not know. However, we have not had the opportunity to see them and parliamentary debate is suppressed when the answer to every question is: ``Never mind, we are going to make provision in immigration rules.'' Why cannot we see the new rules in advance rather than being told to go to the Library to look at the old ones? We would then be able to consider them against what the Minister is telling us in Committee.
<P>
Even if I accepted what the Minister says about the immigration rules, that would not be the point. The rules determine the operation of the Home Office and we are debating the rights of appeal. Those rights are being taken away and that concerns many groups who have made submissions to the Committee. It is one thing to say, ``Never mind chaps. We are going to make provision for you in immigration rules'', but people want to know what grounds they will have for appeal.
<P>
On appeal rights, the Minister said that he hoped that people would be removed more quickly from this country. He said that he was streamlining the procedure, but we doubt that. He has not answered our earlier questions on the rechannelling of appeals into different avenues and the commencement of fresh legal proceedings. We shall return to them in the clause stand part debate. The Minister said that the procedure will be streamlined and that people will be removed quickly, but that their cases will be considered when they apply to return. That is what he said, and it is completely the wrong way round.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister shakes his head, but the clause will curtail a person's right of appeal. Someone who is subject to removal, as opposed to deportation procedure does not have a full right of appeal. Many of those subject to deportation orders do. For example, people who are subject to deportation orders, but who have been here for more than seven years can have all their family circumstances considered and can make an appeal while they are still in the country. They have full rights of appeal.
<P>
Under the provisions of the clause, those who overstay or who breach their conditions will not have their cases considered while they are in this country; they will be considered after they have been sent abroad.

<P>

<B>Mr. Neil Gerrard </B>(Walthamstow): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that some of the most difficult cases involve people who are subject to deportation orders, but who do not have the full right of appeal? They may have been in the country for five or six years, but they have only the limited rights of appeal that the previous Government gave them. Among the many cuts that they made to appeal rights, in 1998 they cut the rights of everyone to appeal. Is it not better for the immigration rules to contain something that will allow cases to be considered before people are removed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman takes an interest in immigration matters. He will know that people are concerned about rights of appeal. I am sure that he has considered the matter carefully and that he will find&#151;the Minister might be able to confirm this&#151;that there are no greater rights of appeal for any individual as a result of this change in clause 6.
<P>
In fact, rights of appeal are being restricted. No one will in future have a greater right of appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Did my hon. Friend hear the Minister say that he thought the clause was good for human rights and the family? Can my hon. Friend imagine anything more divisive among established families and established immigrant communities than when a person who might have been in the country for many years is summarily deported merely because he has breached a condition&#151;often in a small way&#151;and told to reapply from overseas?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend hits the nail on the head. The Minister says that the clause is good for human rights. It may be good for human rights lawyers, but that is another matter because a great number of people will make their way to the courts to bring appeals under human rights law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I will finish responding to the hon. Gentleman's original point because he may want to come back to me on it.
<P>
The other problem is that the grounds on which appeals can be brought under removals are much more restricted than for deportations and&#151;this will concern the hon. Member for Walthamstow and many of those interested in this matter&#151;those rights of appeal may in future be exercised only outside the United Kingdom. A person cannot stay here and bring an appeal; he has to go abroad. That makes a big difference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> If the hon. Gentleman can recall my speech this morning, he will remember the reservations that I expressed about the removal of appeal rights. My point was that it is futile to pretend that everyone is now in the position where compassionate grounds are considered before they are removed, because that is not so. People who are subject to deportation orders without the full appeal process do not get that consideration at present. It could certainly be argued that having a compassionate consideration of some kind for everyone would, at least for them, be an improvement. That is separate from the more general appeal point on which I voiced my reservations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's view and the general viewpoint. He says that the position is not ideal; he has criticised what the previous Government did with appeal rights, which he says they took away. The Minister nods his head. The present proposal makes matters worse: it takes away rights of appeal left in place by the previous Government. I have been moved by what the Minister said and in the debate on clause stand part I shall have to remind him and other Labour Members of what they said when in opposition. They rode a far higher horse than I have on these proceedings. It is fairer to look at where the balance lies and the extent to which compassionate grounds must be taken into account.
<P>
The Minister is getting it entirely the wrong way round. These matters should be looked at, as at present, and dealt with in this country. The full process should be followed to decide whether a person has the right to remain here on particular grounds and, if he is removed or deported, a high hurdle should be put in place which he should have to surmount before returning to the country. The Minister is doing it the other way round and it will not help family life. It will mean that those who have been here for longer than seven years&#151;those who have put down the deepest roots, have the most connections and the most to lose, including friends, family and jobs&#151;will not be able to plead their compassionate circumstances in this country. They will be removed and will have to appeal from overseas. This fact was mentioned by organisations such as the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants and the Immigration Advisory Service which have complained about the draconian nature of the proposal.
<P>
The Government have got it the wrong way round from both points of view. We want an assurance that enforcement hurdles will be high to keep out people who should not be in the country. The record of revoked deportation orders shows very few successful appeals against refusal to revoke. This indicates what a useful instrument a deportation order is for keeping the wrong people out of the country. We want to keep out people who have breached immigration controls and should be kept out. The Minister is going about this the wrong way. He is taking away rights of appeal and weakening our immigration controls. The more I hear about the clause, the more I think that it is the wrong way round.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Diane Abbott (Hackney, North and Stoke Newington):</B> I shall debate the clause in general on clause stand part, but there is something slightly Kafkaesque about the debate so far. Conservative Members, who spent 18 years imposing ever more incoherent, unfair and draconian immigration law on my constituents, are wringing their hands over draconian elements in the Government's Bill. On the other hand, the Minister says that the proposals are all in aid of human rights and family life. Those proposals will mean that many of my constituents, who may have lived in this country for many years and have families and lives here, can face removal without a right of appeal&#151;although we wait to see what is in the rules. I have never heard anything more paradoxical. I shall have more to say on clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Like my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott), my breath is fair taken away by the audacity and brass neck of the hon. Member for Hertsmere protesting that the removal of appeals is something that he and his party care about deeply and that his hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Mr. Faber) had hit the nail on the head by saying that it was important to keep people in Britain. The whole purpose of the amendment is to&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall reply first to that point and then I shall give way. As the whole purpose of the amendment is to stop people coming back to the country who may have family commitments and reasons for being here it is, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington said, an extraordinary paradox. One hon. Member wants to keep families here and the other appears to want them kept outside the country for long periods. The logic is quite bizarre.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> As the Minister well knows, I said that I did not want to see families, many of whom have put down roots in communities such as those mentioned by the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington, being summarily split up on what can in many cases be a technicality. Perhaps on clause stand part we can deal with some of the technicalities by which the deportation could now take place.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman should remember that we have said quite clearly that, whereas the current immigration rules do not provide that the circumstances of families must be taken into consideration before removal takes place, we will introduce immigration rules that do. That is why I am able to say, quite genuinely, that this enables the circumstances of persons who have entered into substantial commitments in this country to be taken into consideration and a proper decision to be taken about whether it is appropriate and in the interest of immigration control, to remove them. That may well not be appropriate, but in future that decision will have to be considered.
<P>
We are making sure that there is not the sort of summary removal that hon. Members fear. Instead we will create a situation where the circumstances of individuals are properly considered. No one, except I suspect the hon. Member for Hertsmere, seriously argues that we should retain deportation orders. The problem of deportation orders with the three-year restriction on re-entry is precisely why many of the interested groups do not object&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman let me finish the sentence? They do not object to the concept of removal but would like to see an appeal on the removal. That is a perfectly legitimate argument which we will have in due course. No one except the hon. Gentleman, is arguing that the cumbersome, time-consuming, damaging process involved in deportation orders, which were retained by the previous Government, should be kept for anyone other than criminals and&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have allowed the debate to stray wide of the amendment. We are now clearly straying into the stand part debate. Should the debate continue in this way, I will be in some difficulty when we come to the stand part debate. I should therefore be grateful if the Minister and the hon. Member for Hertsmere would limit themselves to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Thank you for that guidance, Mr. Maxton.
<P>
The amendment seeks to impose futher restrictions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to read the amendment, I will give way. Perhaps he will explain whether he seeks to introduce deportation order restriction into removal processes. Amendment No. 80 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Directions for the removal of a person under this section may include an order prohibiting the re-entry of the person to the United Kingdom.''<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The crucial word is ``may''. The amendment does not suggest that such prohibition should occur in every case. However, the Secretary of State should keep such power to use in appropriate cases. The Minister is arguing that there should be no such power, which would remove from the Secretary of State a valuable instrument of immigration control. I may be flattering the Secretary of State by suggesting that he should exercise his discretion properly and wisely in such matters. However, such discretion should be in place.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My point was that such a procedure is unnecessary because visa nationals would obviously have to obtain a visa to re-enter the country, and the circumstances of their removal would be taken into consideration and the visa could be refused.
<P>
The amendment is therefore completely unnecessary. It could, however, lead to circumstances of manifest injustice. Whether the word ``may'' should be in the Bill, and how it may be interpretated by the courts, is irrelevant. We must create a situation in which the restrictions proposed by the hon. Gentleman are unnecessary.
<P>
I therefore reject the amendment. We must have effective immigration controls and ensure that family circumstances are taken into consideration. That is why the Bill's removal provisions ensure that family life and human rights are respected, and that immigration control and enforcement are faster.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister and the Government have got everything the wrong way round. However, I do not want to trespass on the stand part debate, during which I shall return to a number of important issues.
<P>
The Minister is abandoning a potentially valuable instrument of immigration control. I am not satisfied with his response and I will divide the Committee.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 114, in schedule 12, page 112, leave out lines 24 to 33.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Amendment No. 114 would delete the part of schedule 12 that applies to the clause. The amendment shows our opposition to clause 6.
<P>
The debate has highlighted the key problems of the clause. It has underlined the extent to which the Bill is a hotch-potch of provisions that build on existing measures rather than a fundamental review of immigration law. The number of previous Acts that we have to consider when we read the Bill shows that there has been an incremental build-up of legislation. That is confusing for law makers, but far more confusing for practitioners and the public who are to use the legal code.
<P>
The debate also shows how far the Labour party has moved from its position in 1988. In discussions on the Immigration Act 1988, the Labour party was keen to promote rights of appeal and to fight attempts by the wicked Conservative Government to restrict those rights, especially in the crucial matter of deportation, which is fundamental to human rights and people's ability to carry out their normal business and conduct a family life. Yet the Labour Government propose a further restriction on rights of appeal. We shall consider more fundamental issues later in our proceedings. Our debate is a foretaste of a much wider discussion.
<P>
As I said earlier, we oppose clause 6 and the elements of schedule 12 that apply to it. The Government have failed to answer key questions. They have not established the need for further restrictions. We do not understand the reason for the change from a deportation system, which includes the right of appeal for overstayers, to a system of summary removal. It is damaging to cease to differentiate an illegal entrant from people who have breached conditions. Other hon. Members explained that breach of conditions can cover a multitude of sins. Some cases are technical while others constitute flagrant abuse. Therefore, summary removal should not apply to all cases.
<P>
The Government have not assured us that the provision will not create new problems. The expert testimony showed that although the Government's stated aim is simplification, the hotch-potch Bill is likely to complicate matters. According to many legal experts, there is likely to be more judicial review, and more cases under the Human Rights Act 1998. The provision substitutes the right to a proper appeals process with an immigration rule that can be challenged by judicial review; a system whereby representations to the Minister, presumably by Members of Parliament or through other direct routes, become the norm because there is no other means of establishing a case for compassionate leave to remain in the country.
<P>
 Therese
<P>
We have not established the need for the provision and we are not convinced that it will not make matters worse for the Government and work against their stated aims. Therefore, we oppose the clause. However, if we assume that the Government will carry the day and enact the clause, despite serious and worthy attempts to persuade them against doing that, it would be helpful if the Minister could clarify some points.
<P>
Subsections (4) and (6) grant the Government wide powers in respect of the Secretary of State's ability to enact the Bill. Subsection (4) says that the Secretary of State can exempt people more or less when he wishes to do so. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Subsection (1) does not apply in such other circumstances as may be prescribed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It may be a wide provision for the Secretary of State to exempt people. Perhaps in an ideal world he will exempt everyone. On the other hand, subsection (6) gives the Secretary of State power to make additional requirements on those given directions under the clause. Again, we have no detail of those requirements, although earlier we debated the kind of requirements that the Secretary of State can place on a person in an immigration context. It would be helpful to hear something from the Minister about the exemptions that he may wish to make in the context of subsection (4) and about the requirements that he may make in the context of subsection (6).
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Finally, I am interested in subsection (5), which refers to someone ceasing to belong to a person's family. Obvious circumstances spring to mind such as divorce or marital break-up, but there could be others. Is the Minister thinking simply of a marital break-up or does he have other circumstances in mind whereby someone could cease to be a member of a family? Can he point us to examples of a similar provision in immigration law or elsewhere, so that we may have an idea of the kind of conditions that would need to apply in order for subsection (5) to be invoked?
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I am grateful for this opportunity to speak on clause stand part.
<P>
The Bill contains some good elements. In particular it puts into law certain manifesto commitments in relation to appeal rights for visitors. However, overall it is a Bill that I am sad to see a Labour Government introduce, partly because I believe that it is a missed opportunity.
<P>
As someone who has been a Member of Parliament for 12 years, one of the longest-serving Labour Members on the Committee apart from you, Mr. Maxton, and someone who has done thousands of immigration and asylum cases and spent a great deal of time guiding people through the labyrinth of immigration and asylum legislation&#151;as well as through the rules, which are often the worst aspect&#151;I believe that the Government should have taken the opportunity to carry out a thorough review of our immigration and asylum law to construct, almost from a blank piece of paper, a system of immigration and asylum that would be effective but transparent, and not racist or unfair. To add yet another ill-drafted Bill to several decades of higgledy-piggledy, ill-drafted legislation seems to me regrettable and a lost opportunity.
<P>
Clause 6 is one of the clauses that give me the greatest cause for concern. Because I have spent so much time in the past 12 years dealing with individual immigration and asylum cases, when I look at the Bill I see, not the text, but the cases that will present themselves to me as a consequence of it.
<P>
Some of my hon. Friends represent constituencies where they can count the asylum seekers in hundreds. I live in a constituency where I count them in thousands, and many of them are well-established, settled members of the community. To my colleagues, an asylum seeker is a transient person; to me, it is the mother, or the family, of the children that my son goes to school with, people who live in the same street, members of my local Labour party. Therefore, I approach the Bill from a different direction.
<P>
The problem with the clause is that it may have serious consequences for settled members of communities in inner London, Manchester, Sheffield or Birmingham, and I do not believe that my hon. Friends have considered it properly. The clause will&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Is my hon. Friend seriously arguing for the retention of the deportation process, with the three-year restrictions and other impediments to family life and human rights which she has no doubt criticised for a long time? She appears to be coming perilously close to that. The clause introduces a procedure for removal; it is not about appeal rights.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I am aware of that but, if the Minister will allow me a few minutes, he will see where my argument is tending.
<P>
The effect of the provisions is to amend immigration control by the abolition of deportation appeal rights in all breaches of condition and overstaying cases. It affects not only people who entered the country illegally: it could apply to people in all sorts of circumstances, many of which I have encountered in the past 12 years. For example, the clause will apply to bona fide students who are lawfully here but who have taken a holiday job without obtaining permission, perhaps because they did not know they had to obtain it. Had they known, they might have obtained it. The liability removal in the clause will impact on them.
<P>
The clause will apply to applicants who submitted an application to the Home Office for further leave in time, only to have it returned for some small detail of documentation to be clarified. It might also apply to an applicant who has posted the application through the normal post a few days before expiry, only for the delivery of the letter to be delayed. It could apply to a wife whose documents have been handled by her husband and her in-laws, with the result that she has no real knowledge of what has happened.
<P>
It could apply to a student whose application goes through his or her college, and it could apply to persons who have passed their papers to legal or quasi-legal representatives who have, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes through sheer sloppiness, submitted them late.
<P>
Those are the sorts of circumstances in which people could find themselves in breach of the conditions and therefore subject to removal. What does that phrase ``subject to removal'' mean? To me it means somebody who I might have seen every day finding themselves torn away from their home and their community and sent to a country of which the partner or children might have no knowledge.
<P>
I am sympathetic to the Government's professed aim. I am sympathetic to their wish to do away with multiple appeals. I see people working the appeals system all the time. Many of them do so, however, not through conscious wickedness but because they have been advised to do so. Having people working the appeals system, as the Minister puts it, is bad for the appeals system because if causes delays and clogs up the system.
<P>
However, it is also bad for the people involved, who face uncertainty, not knowing what will happen. Many of them are paying advisers&#151;sometimes solicitors, sometimes so-called immigration advisers&#151;real money for the advice that leads them to make appeals. I find it painful when some of the poorest people in my community come before me, having submitted yet another appeal on the advice of some phoney immigration adviser. I do not know where those people get the money from, but I do know that their appeal has very little chance of success.
<P>
Submitting multiple appeals is thus bad for the system and for the people.
<P>
I sympathise with the Government's aim to provide one genuine appeal in which all the subjects are taken into account. The Minister assures us that he wants to introduce immigration rules to enable compassionate circumstances to be taken fully into account on removal. I would like to take him at his word on the efficacy of these rules and on whether they will cover all the circumstances to which I referred&#151;but I cannot. I have no sight of the rules. Let me tell the Minister that I have 12 years' experience of dealing with immigration cases, sometimes seven days a week because people often ring on a Friday or at weekends.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> As I have already told the Committee, the rules merely replicate the current rules. My hon. Friend can read them now if she wants to, in respect of deportation orders and the obligation to take into consideration a list of factors that are in current immigration rules. We will apply the same rules to removals.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Unlike my hon. Friend, I am not a lawyer, but, after years of experience of immigration cases, I have a developed a lifelong habit of insisting on seeing the text in front of me. I would be happier if I could see the specific text. The Minister can tell me that the rules will be similar to other rules and that they are in essence the same as those already in the Library, but I would prefer to see the actual rules which the clause will operate. My experience of immigration rules&#151;and, worse, the way in which Lunar house officers interpret them&#151;is not happy.
<P>
 todd
<P>
The clause will not support family life and human rights, as the Minister has a little disingenuously claimed. Unless the provisions in the rules are more satisfactory than I suspect that they will be, many settled members of my community&#151;not transient refugees who have been in port for a few weeks or months&#151;will find themselves facing removal with no real right of appeal.
<P>
A few weeks ago the Government told us that we were entering a new era in race relations, but they are now confronting members of the community&#151;and, very often, ethnic minorities&#151;with removal with no right of appeal and with all the misery, upheaval and fear that that often causes. That is very sad.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): I have never specialised in this subject. I was responsible for other matters when I was at the Home Office and I have not specialised in it in my constituency work, which has involved very few immigration appeals and very few asylum seekers. The dispersal proposals in the Bill may provide me with many more such constituency cases. Therefore, I may develop a new expertise, and I shall take lessons from the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington on how one deals with the Government and handles cases.
<P>
I have read the papers that other organisations have produced. They are infinitely more expert than I; some would claim to be infinitely more expert than the Government. I wish to express their concerns, because I believe that it is better for the Minister to respond to them than to any ill-informed views that I may have about the clause. Organisations such as Liberty, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, and Justice are highly respected. They have taken the trouble to inform the Committee of their concerns, so I shall present them to the Committee in the hope of persuading the Minister that the Government have got things completely wrong.
<P>
Liberty is deeply concerned about the clause, and primarily about the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``removal of rights of appeal from those who are considered to be overstayers or who have been considered to have broken the conditions of their leave to enter or to remain.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It says that, instead of ensuring that all applicants get a proper consideration of their application with effective rights of appeal, the Bill&#151;and this clause in particular&#151; removes certain rights to appeal. Liberty goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The only appeal provided under clause 48 will be as to whether or not there is a power in law to remove the individual. There will be no opportunities to raise compassionate circumstances.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Liberty says that that may raise issues under article 6 of the convention on human rights, which is on the right to a fair trial, and under article 14, which is about the prohibition of discrimination.
<P>
Liberty notes that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``United Kingdom has not ratified Protocol No. 7 to the Convention, although the Government has stated that it intends to do so. Article 1 of this protocol `Procedural safeguards relating to expulson of aliens', provides that people such as asylum seekers should have full safeguards against decisions to expel them, including having reviews of decisions and representation during such reviews.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Liberty urges the Government to accept the spirit of Protocol No. 7 to the convention. I hope that the Minister can assure us that the Government will ratify it and accept its spirit immediately or when the Bill comes into force, and will not wait until the formal ratification process is completed. I appreciate that, in a busy legislative timetable, it is difficult to slot in the ratification of various protocols if they have to be presented to Parliament.
<P>
The clause needs to be read in conjunction with paragraph 30(2) of schedule 12. Together the provisions significantly amend the structure of the immigration control system; the Minister has made that clear. Until now, a fundamental distinction has been drawn between those who have obtained lawful leave to enter and those who require such leave but have never obtained it, either because they have evaded control or because the leave that they obtain is treated as vitiated by deception.
<P>
The former people are liable to be deported and remain subject to a procedure with appeal rights and safeguards by which the Secretary of State may sign an order for deportation under cover of which they may be removed from the United Kingdom and barred from re-entry until the order is revoked. That will not normally happen with three years of deportation.
<P>
By contrast, those without leave are liable merely to summary removal without any right of appeal, because they have no lawful standing in the United Kingdom under our immigration laws.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendments introduced seven years ago by the Government of whom I was a member restricted deportees' rights of appeal. When Labour Members were in opposition, many of them strongly opposed the restriction, for which the previous Government were criticised by many organisations. However, the new provisions will equate the majority of deportees with people liable to summary removal as illegal immigrants. I share that understanding of the measure with organisations that have written reams and reams about the measure.
<P>
A distinction will no longer be drawn between those who have been unlawfully present all along and those who have held lawful status, but are in breach of one or more of their conditions of entry or stay. Since the passage of the Immigration Act 1971, the courts have extended the definition of illegal entry in response to Home Office initiatives. That definition now extends beyond what was envisaged in 1971 to include deception, advertent or otherwise and whether the deception is committed by the entrant or a third party. Whether the deception is material to the granting of leave has become somewhat flexible, allowing immigration officers far more discretion.
<P>
The new provision will affect anyone in breach of the conditions and may include bona fide students working in circumstances in which they may be unaware that they needed to obtain to permission to work; applicants submitting their papers to the Home Office in time, only to have them returned for some small detail to be clarified; applicants posting their application a few days before expiry, only to have that application delayed in the mail; wives who have their documents passed to their in-laws; students whose applications go through their college; and people whose papers are inadvertently submitted late by the legal representatives to whom they have been passed for attention. I will not give any more examples.
<P>
The provision will also affect dependants of such people, so that even young children born in the United Kingdom will be liable to summary removal if they are not British citizens.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not mind me pointing out that this morning I said that Committee members should not read at length from evidence submitted to the Committee. The hon. Gentleman has been doing so for a considerable time and I should be grateful if he would speak without reading directly from evidence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I take the point that it would be inappropriate to read evidence presented to the Committee. However, I have been sent other information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for giving way. Could he tell us of any organisation that supports the Government's proposals?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Not from the paperwork that I have read. The London Boroughs Association may support the measures. I am happy to accept your recommendation, Mr. Maxton. I can easily translate all the paperwork that has been sent to me into my own notes and come back with even more reams of paperwork for the Committee, which would take even longer to discuss.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien While the right hon. Gentleman is on his feet, will he tell us which provisions of the 1993 and 1996 Acts that remove appeal rights and infringe human rights in the way that he has outlined his regrets?</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> No. I have made it clear to the Committee that I have never pretended to be an expert on these matters. If organisations such as Justice, Liberty, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Save the Children, UNICEF, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees&#151;I have concentrated on some of the more important, and I do not mean to say respectable, organisations&#151;and others such as the Law Society and various lawyers have taken the trouble to give us detailed speaking notes about their concerns on the Bill, I find it difficult if they are all to be deprived of having their arguments heard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Does my right hon. Friend remember how, at the evidence session, the Home Secretary dismissed many of the remarks that we had heard in evidence from those organisations? Many of them are experts in this field and have taken a great deal of time and trouble to provide us with briefing. The Government laugh at them at their peril.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. These organisations have many years of experience in the field. I may disagree entirely with some of their arguments. I am happy to admit&#151;I have never pretended otherwise&#151;that I do not fully understand some of their arguments. I sat in the Minister's seat for many years. I heard the present Minister and other Labour Members make similar arguments. They asked whether I agreed with a policy advocated by a specific group or organisation.
<P>
The present Secretary of State for Wales and I faced each other across the divide for many years. On criminal justice Bills, the right hon. Gentleman would present many arguments. He began by saying that he did not necessarily believe or support those arguments or wish to put them to the vote, but that they had been made by legitimate organisations that have a right to have their arguments heard.
<P>
In fact, those organisations do not have that right, but there is no point in our being in Parliament if we do not present bona fide arguments for the Minister to demolish. I am happy for the Minister to destroy the arguments. I am happy for him to tell us that they are rubbish, that there would be no breach of article 3 or article 14 and that we are all silly to mention it. But if we cannot present the arguments as those organisations have set them out, we shall be in a tricky position. Parliament would be in a tricky position if we could not do so.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am obliged as Chairman to obey the rules as laid down by Parliament. ``Erskine May'' is quite clear about this. A Member is not permitted to read his speech, even if he has written it out himself. The reading of speeches is even less suited to a Committee then to the House. Where quotations are made, they should be brief and not extensive. Those are the rules that I work with, and so must the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Yes, of course, Mr. Maxton. I am happy to obey them.
<P>
I also wish to convey to the Minister the concern that Save the Children has about children and involuntary returns. That organisation is anxious that, when children are sent back to their country of origin, adequate care and reception arrangements should be in place. I understand from its advice to me that Foreign Office officials are involved at present in carrying out assessments, which Save the Children feels is neither right nor appropriate. It believes that there is an urgent need to develop child-centred guidance in that regard. Assessment of the care and reception arrangements must be carried out by child welfare agencies, or organisations such as International Social Service that have&#151;
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> It is a serious point. I often have to deal with the possible removal or deportation of children. Quite often, Home Office and Foreign Office officials either do not know or choose not to know that the West Indies, West Africa or parts of the middle east do not have the type of social services that we are accustomed to in this country. We must be very careful&#151;whatever the technical or legal rights, as has been said&#151;about removing children and returning them to countries where there are no social services as we know them, and where they could find themselves, after getting off the plane, sleeping on the pavement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Is the hon. Lady telling me that Save the Children has a valid point?
<P>
<B>Ms Abbot:</B> That is exactly what I am saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for that. I do not know, but I have read the briefing. Save the Children also says that it is disappointed that the Government have not incorporated into the Bill the arrangements for voluntary returns set out in the White Paper, and it urges us to press the Minister to ensure that the Bill contains some of those safeguards.
<P>
If I may quote once more, Mr. Maxton, Save the Children cites the example of the Swedish Save the Children, which recently organised a conference on the voluntary return of unaccompanied children to their country of origin and examined different models of return programmes. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``SCF believes that such programmes must be genuinely voluntary and that, in addition, clear, detailed guidelines regarding the return of children must be developed by Government, using UNHCR guidelines.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Its concern, like that of many other organisations, is that the Bill does not contain special arrangements for children. They are lumped in with adults and everyone else. It wants the Government to ensure that adequate reception arrangements exist in the country to which the children are sent back. Otherwise, we could all be guilty of perpetuating awful cruelty or, as the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington said, young children may end up sleeping on the streets because the countries to which they are deported may not have the social services back-up that we and other western countries have.
<P>
Of course there are people who overstay deliberately. They seem to be at the root of the Government's distinction between those who are here lawfully and will retain their right of appeal against deportation and those who are here unlawfully and will lose their right of appeal. However, the distinction may not be as clear-cut as the Government think; it may be flawed.
<P>
We all deplore people flouting our immigration laws, but the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington said that many asylum seekers in her constituency have lived in this country for many years and have committed no other offence. They have married and started families, they have jobs and houses and they have put down roots. The hon. Lady said that many of them had joined the Labour party. It could be argued that those people should be given the opportunity for an independent judicial officer to assess the merits of their case before they are removed. If an appeal mechanism does not exist, people who face removal will not simply say, ``Oh well, that's it, there's no appeal mechanism, so I must go now. I've been here five years, I'm married with children, but I'm off.''
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The organisations responsible for looking after immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers will not give up and accept matters. Those who face removal are bound to seek judicial review. That is inevitable. Judicial review has expanded exponentially. When the current Lord Chancellor anticipated his appointment, he put down excellent markers against over-zealous judges who were obsessed with developing judicial review to an absurd degree. Nevertheless, judicial review is constantly developing, even in Penrith, where a local councillor who was aggrieved with a decision might threaten judicial review. Some people come to my surgeries and ask whether they should go for judicial review if they are not happy. I advise them that it is not as easy or as cheap as they believe.
<P>
It is inevitable that people who face removal will seek judicial review and invoke the human rights appeal for which clause 47 provides, or claim asylum. The Government want speedy removals. That is the purpose of clause 6. However, without an appeals mechanism, the Government's aim will be completely thwarted. I do not know what my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere wants to do, but many organisations suggest that the clause should be removed from the Bill. I do not favour that, but it is a pity that it cannot be amended in the way proposed by the amendments that my hon. Friend tabled.
<P>
Others claim that the clause is wrong in principle; I believe that it will not work in practice. I do not believe that I could vote for the clause's removal because I am not opposed to it in principle. However, I stress that the Minister must convince me that the provision will work. A person may be removed if he does not fulfil a small technical condition of his leave. He will have no opportunity to make representations. Such an opportunity currently exists. I have no objection to such treatment of someone who sneaks into the country, evades immigration controls and is here unlawfully. However, under the clause, a student who tries to comply with the rules and get it right, but who technically exceeds his leave, or does not send his papers back in time, becomes an overstayer. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister for Worthing, West (Mr. Bottomley) would draw attention to that if he was present. That student will be busted out immediately without any right to appeal. Such people, with the encouragement of various organisations that are set up to look after their interests and are funded by the Government, are bound to seek judicial review. The Government will have to tackle such grievances again and again.
<P>
I shall not use the words of the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington, and claim that the Bill is a hotch-potch of measures. At least, I shall not use that phrase yet, because we have only reached clause 6. However, the more I read about the clause, the more the Minister rejects Opposition amendments, and the more I hear the observations of Government Members, the more convinced I am that the clause simply will not work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> It is a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) because I always welcome repenting sinners. I recall sitting for many hours in the Committee considering the Criminal Justice Bill in the previous Parliament: I quoted from Liberty and was told many times by the right hon. Gentleman that I was talking rubbish by quoting its brief. So I am glad to hear that the right hon. Gentleman is thinking again about that.
<P>
I shall not repeat the reservations I made earlier about the clause because we have already gone over that ground. However, it is important to view clause 6, which it can be argued is a mechanistic provision about removal, in relation to later clauses dealing with appeal. I expressed my concerns this morning and we may need to return to them later.
<P>
Opposition Members have suggested that there is no need to reform the present removal and deportation process, but that argument does not hold water. The division between those who have appeals and those who do not is not as simple and sensible as hon. Members suggested earlier. Many people now classified as illegal entrants have valid reasons for mounting appeals but are unable to make them. The distinction between those who secure a full appeal on deportation and those who do not is quite arbitrary with the line drawn at seven years.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Borders suggested that many appeals relate to late applications and technicalities. However, appeals are not made about late applications, though there may be mechanisms for making representations about such applications, which is not the same thing. It is futile to pretend that everything about the current system is right. We should be examining the mechanisms through which people can be removed. My concern is that the process provides a means for people to have their points considered through an appeal whenever possible.
<P>
Some people have only a limited right of appeal now. If they have not been in the country for seven years&#151;they may have lived here for six and a half years&#151;they will have only a limited right of appeal, which makes me worry about what will happen under the clause. Those people inevitably want compassionate grounds to be considered and they often end up in my advice surgery or the advice surgery of my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Abbott:</B> On Fridays.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Precisely. However, they may end up in the hands of lawyers who want to persuade them to make completely unrealistic applications with no hope of success. I suspect that that generates an enormous amount of work within the Home Office&#151;looking at the representations from lawyers, members of Parliament and others. We should try to make the rules of the system as clear as possible so that all the relevant factors can be considered.
<P>
In conclusion, I should like to raise three points. First, I want to ask the Minister about the changes to immigration rules in respect of compassionate grounds. I have examined paragraph 364 and note that medical evidence could be considered, especially where people have become ill in circumstances that might have been responsible for their not putting in an application in time to be granted an extension of leave. I remind the Committee of the point made by the hon. Member for Hallam which I raised earlier but which was not dealt with during the response to the debate on circumstances covered by subsection (4).
<P>
 paul
<P>
In conclusion, I should like clarification of what is perhaps a technical point on subsection (8), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Directions for the removal of a person given under this section invalidate any leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom given to him before the directions are given or while they are in force.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It seems to imply that someone who in the past has had perfectly valid leave and never broken any of its conditions will somehow have that leave retrospectively invalidated. That may not necessarily happen, but that would be the effect. If a person had broken the conditions of an existing leave we would expect something to happen to him, but is there the potential for a previously valid leave to be somehow respectively rendered invalid through this process? That could affect someone trying to re-enter the country or someone applying, maybe years on, for citizenship or something like that? There may be a technicality so that subsection (8) would not have that effect, but there is a reference to ``any leave to enter'' before directions are given.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> It may be more than a technicality because, looking at it from an individual constituent's point of view, a person who was here quite properly as a student for three years and had another leave to remain but breached it could find the three years that he was here as a student were invalidated and that may be hurtful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Absolutely. Perhaps more important than whether a person would find it hurtful is whether there would be some definite impact. I am unable to think of what might result without looking through immigration legislation which would give more detail than I could manage so I would need a lawyer. I am sure that the Government do not intend to disqualify retrospectively but I should like clarification from the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I had not intended to participate in the debate but, as often happens during a full debate, certain issues have been raised. Having listened to the powerful speech by the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington, and to my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border, I wish to say a few words following the Minister's remarks in response to my intervention.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington referred to her Labour colleagues who perhaps numbered asylum seekers and immigrants in their constituencies in hundreds whereas she was able to do so in thousands. She said that many were friends who had attended school with her and whose children attended school with hers and that many of them lived in her street.
<P>
As with my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border, I can probably number people who have contacted me directly in tens rather than hundreds&#151;and certainly no more than 100, but that does not make me any less keen to get the Bill right, for it to be well thought through and for it to ensure that the hon. Lady's constituents and mine, however many, are treated fairly and with justice. The simple fact is that I believe that the clause will bring into a net of possible removals from this country many of those whose so-called breach of conditions may be on a technicality, or for a reason not of such grave concern that it necessitates their removal from the country, so splitting them up from their family and community and forcing their children to leave their local school.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border mentioned at length some of the technicalities and the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington used the same source to refer to others. As they reminded us, many of the breaches are technical. Indeed, people could commit unwitting mistakes with no intent to defraud or to outstay their welcome. In fact, they may have been here for 10 years already. However, such an unwitting mistake may mean that someone is summarily removed from the country and split up from friends, family and community with no right to appeal.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The remark that prompted me most to contribute to this short debate was the Minister's statement that the clause was good for human rights and good for the family. I do not see any way in which the clause can be good for families who will be broken up as a result of it.
<P>
The clause falls into the classic trap into which we are always told we must not fall when discussing immigration. It assumes that speed and hurrying the process along is good for everyone involved. The Minister implied that the speed with which someone should be removed and his or her case dealt with, is at the core of the issues. However, how could a speedy removal be possibly good for people who may have put down roots in this country and lived here for many years? It would be disastrous for them and, indeed, for the family and community in which they live. One would have to say, ``Sorry, but you have to leave your family and community and your children may have to leave the school where they are very happy and receive a good education. You must go to a perhaps unknown country and reapply. If you are lucky, we will allow you to return.''
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere said, that is to approach the problem from the wrong direction. To tell someone that things will be all right because the matter will be dealt with quickly adds insult to injury. That person will not be able to appeal, but will have to reapply from overseas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Like me, my hon. Friend is being too kind to the Government. The Government claim that the regime is one of removal, but the Minister knows that reapplication is not to a court but to the Government. If the Government turn it down, the applicant has no recourse to the courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I always try to be generous, but I was about to make that point.
<P>
The evidence that struck me most was that the proposal is likely to divide established communities. If a family is removed, that is a tragedy for that family. However, if that family is part of a wider, established community, its removal is likely to spread distrust and a sense of grievance within the communitiy. The lack of provision for an appeal is a recipe for strong grievances. The subsequent distrust may remain for many years.
<P>
The Minister sought to reassure me earlier by saying that the circumstances of the individuals removed should be considered. That is right. Of course, their circumstances should be considered, and we welcome that. However, it is not enough. By whom will the circumstances be considered? They will be considered by immigration officers and endorsed by the Secretary of State with no appeal mechanism being in place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> There will be an appeal mechanism. The hon. Gentleman does not seem to understand the process. The issue is whether the mechanism should be suspensive or non-suspensive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Yes, but it is not a judicial appeal system. It is an appeal to Government and to the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> There is a proper appeal system. The issue is whether it is suspensive and whether a person is removed, or not removed, before he is entitled to appeal. The hon. Gentleman keeps saying that there is no appeal mechanism, but there is.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Is it a judicial appeal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> As the hon. Lady asks, is it a judicial appeal? As I understand it, an appeal will have to be made from overseas once someone has been removed from the country. So it is not an appeals system for people in their own community and country, with their own friends and supporters around them. They must make an appeal and reapply from overseas.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Under the current system which the hon. Gentleman seems to be advocating, persons who are removed by deportation order are removed for three years and cannot be reunited with their families. If such people are removed administratively, they probably will not take advantage of the appeal because they can reapply as spouses and can legitimately re-enter the country and be reunited with their families.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I understand that. However, the Minister is surely referring to people who may seek to abuse the system. Such people have not fallen foul of the system through a technicality or an unwitting error or omission in their application to stay.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> The Minister is losing sight of the fact that removal or deportation affects not only the person to be removed or deported, but the whole family. In practice, whole families are removed, even though only the head of the family is in breach of immigration law.
<P>
It is no consolation to children rooted in this country who are deported to the Caribbean, West Africa or Iraq, to be told that their fathers have a notional right or appeal in those places. Nowadays, the whole family is removed, including children who have spent their whole lives in this country and know nothing of the country to which the Secretary of State seeks to remove them.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Faber:</B> With her considerable experience of this matter, the hon. Lady makes my point far better than I could myself.
<P>
The provision will affect whole families and communities. It will divide communities and will spread distrust and a sense of grievance against the Government and the system of removal. The Government will find that hard to address.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to be contradicting the vote that he has just made in support of an amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hertsmere, which would have prevented people from returning, once they had been removed. I have already said that people who are administratively removed have the right to reapply. Should they have a British spouse and family in this country, they can reapply to re-enter the country as a spouse, and may do so properly if all other circumstances are right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I understand that entirely. We having a clause stand part debate. Amendment No. 80 was rejected. So we are discussing clause 6 as it stands, without amendment No. 80.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border, the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) and other hon. Members have pointed out, the provision will lead only to an increase in judicial review, more human rights claims under clause 47 and further asylum claims. That is confirmed by every briefing document and verbal briefing received by the Committee from interested groups and parties.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend said, people will not merely up sticks and remove their family at the first opportunity at which the Government tells them to go. They will do everything that they legally can to remain in this country, because they will feel that they have a better chance of bucking the system and ensuring their continuity of stay if they are here. They know that as soon as they are forced to go overseas, such a stay will be harder for them.
<P>
I do not wish to detain the Committee much longer. However, like my right hon. Friend, I make no excuse for quoting the organisations which provided us with material and took the trouble to give more than 10 hours of verbal evidence. The Government have made a virtue of this Special Standing Committee, which I very much welcome as the oral sessions were extremely helpful and informative. However, it ill behoves the Government to belittle some of the evidence that we heard.
<P>
I will briefly quote from the oral evidence given by the Home Secretary. At the beginning of the evidence session, the Minister told the Home Secretary that virtually all the witnesses from whom we had heard were critical of one part of the Bill or another. The Home Secretary said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I do not accept that. It is inevitable that witnesses who come before the Committee will criticise propositions because it takes much less time to support them.''&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 22 March 1999; c. 458.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The witnesses who have given evidence to the Committee have done so because they are the specialists&#151;the experts. They have not done so because it is quicker for them to draw up a document or to give evidence that is detrimental to the Bill, but because they know about the subject and are the experts. When I said to the Home Secretary that I felt that he was belittling the evidence, he replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If you want to mix it, Mr. Faber''.&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 22 March 1999; c. 484.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not seek to mix it, but I quote the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which describes the clause as the most draconian in the Bill. In this instance the Government have an opportunity to show that they have listened to the criticisms that have been made of the Bill. The Home Secretary admitted that amendments would be made to the Bill. When I asked whether they would be Government amendments only or other amendments, no reply there came. The Government have a good opportunity to show that they are serious about the Special Standing Committee system and have listened to the views of those outside and inside the House by seriously reconsidering the clause.
<P>
<B>Ms Oona King </B>(Bethnal Green and Bow): I want to continue on the theme of children, which has been mentioned by other members of the Committee. Listening to the stand part debate has been a surreal experience&#151;``Alice Through the Looking Glass''. I am delighted about the conversion that we have witnessed. Should Opposition Members be re-elected towards the end of the next millennium, I hope that they will revisit what they have said today.
<P>
I ask the Minister for an assurance that the provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998 will mean that the effect of the clause on children will be taken into account, for reasons that we have already heard. I hope that the Government's interpretation of the best interests of the child will be compatible with the principles of the Children Act 1989, where the welfare of children is considered to be paramount. Specifically, I hope that removal will not take place under subsection (1), paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) without independent consideration of care arrangements for children who are deported with their families. Does the clause recognise that children, whether they are asylum seekers or British citizens, have age-specific concerns that differ from those of adults? All the major organisations concerned with children&#151;UNICEF, Save the Children Fund, Barnados, Refugee Action and the Children's Society&#151;have expressed profound disquiet about what will happen if the child's best interests are not kept at the forefront.
<P>
I hope that we can have a ministerial assurance that the effect of the clause&#151;and indeed of the Bill, but we are discussing the clause&#151;on children will be taken into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been a good debate on both sides of the Committee, which has reflected the widespread concern about the clause outside the House. Before I turn to the matters that are outstanding in my mind, I want to address three of the points raised by other hon. Members.
<P>
First, the points that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam made about the clause are entirely fair. Will the Minister tell us as much as he can about subsection (4), which disapplies the clause? To see a subsection of that kind without knowing how it will be operated raises a number of questions. It may be another clause that the Government have included to give themselves room for manoeuvre and a free hand, while asking us to write a blank cheque. The Government may have some ideas in mind. If so, I ask the Minister to share them with us as I am sure he will wish to do.
<P>
I should also like a little more detail about subsection (6) which seems to be extremely sweeping. It reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Directions given under this section may impose any requirements of a prescribed kind.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What sort of requirements are they and how are they to be prescribed?
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington did the Committee a service by talking about the people who will be affected by these provisions. It always helps to be able to put a face to these cases and the hon. Lady probably has a lot more constituency experience than I have of dealing with them. I have a certain amount, but I suspect that she has a great deal more.
<P>
I take the hon. Lady and her hon. Friends to task just a little for suggesting that the Opposition were being brass-necked; the Minister gave in to the temptation and referred my right hon. Friend to the 1993 and 1996 Acts. Another expression, chutzpah, applies to what he said. The Minister introduced the subject and he needs to be careful. There are not many more clauses before we reach a provision that the Government promised to repeal but have not done so. The Bill includes a massive amount of that 1993 and 1996 legislation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington talked about the people who came within the ambit of the provisions. Hitherto, removal cases have applied to illegal entrants; deportation action applied to a much wider range of people. It could apply to people who had recommendations made in criminal cases and to people who were in breach of their conditions by only a small extent or people who had overstayed by only a short time.
<P>
The people who will be subject to the provisions&#151;and the hon. Lady echoed the words of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants&#151;may include applicants who post their applications a few days before expiry only to have the letter delayed in delivery; a wife whose documents have been passsed to her in-laws or someone who passes papers to legal representatives. Those are all human faces that we could put to the provisions. We need to consider how these people will be affected.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border made some important points too. A large number of cases come before the courts by way of judicial review. Judicial review is available at present. Claims for asylum can also be made. People could also, if so minded, bring an appeal under the provisions of clause 47, which is an entirely new right of appeal which I shall come to in a moment.
<P>
In the meantime, I must take the Minister to task on his comments about the appeals system. The Committee needs to have the extent of the appeals changes that are being made clearly in mind. I refer to the right of appeal to a court, not the way in which the Government take decisions and the Home Office determine applications. They are appeals to a court. That is what many people in these circumstances want to have. The Minister was wrong about removal cases. The right of appeal on removal is much more restrictive than that for deportation orders.
<P>
Someone who is subject to a deportation order has a right of appeal. If he has been in this country for less than seven years the appeal is against the grounds of the decision. Someone who has been here for more than seven years has what is known as a full right of appeal which goes extremely wide and enables the court to consider compassionate and family circumstances. Those are just the circumstances that such people want to have taken into account. In both cases&#151;an important point for people subject to this type of action&#151;people who are appealing against a deportation order can remain in this country.
<P>
That makes a massive difference in practice. It obviously makes a massive difference to their lives that they have not been deported first, but it also makes it easier for them to bring their actions. They can instruct their legal representatives. They can go to see them and bring all the documents to their attention. They can have interviews and give proper instructions. Doing that from another country is extremely difficult.
<P>
The hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) is looking at me knowingly. I know the remarks he has made about the previous Government and he is wondering how I could say things like this when they did all those wicked things. However, he has to face the facts that that wicked old Conservative Government, as he would have them&#151;I obviously take a different view&#151;never took away the rights of someone subject to a deportation order to bring an appeal in this country. Such people stayed in this country. It is a true and fair comment that the grounds of appeal were changed in 1998, but even in 1988 someone who had been here for more than seven years retained a full right of appeal on the grounds of compassionate circumstances.

<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman remember what happened in the 1996 Act for third country appeals?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do. But I have to give the hon. Gentleman the chutzpah warning here. He had best be careful and see what the Bill says about third country appeals. We shall have some entertainment later on as we search for the clause to repeal those provisions. I am not sure that it exists. I will not be tempted down that road.
<P>
I have quoted from a number of organisations so far on what happened in 1998. I shall quote from another organisation that gave its views then. It said that it had
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``no truck with the frivolous, cynical, wilful or unjustifiable overstayer, but each case must be examined on its merits. That was possible under section 3(5) of the 1971 Act, which allowed a proper appeal to a tribunal, which would consider all the circumstances. If the Bill is passed, that proper appeal will no longer be available.''&#151;[Official Report, 16 November 1987; Vol. 122, c. 793.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That organisation was the Labour Front Bench in 1987 and the speaker was Lord Hattersley, the then shadow Home Secretary. He is described in the document before me as being extremely critical of the provision to take away the right to a full appeal from someone who had been here for less than seven years.
<P>
I hate to think what Lord Hattersley would have said and the indignation that he would have summoned to his cause had the Government proposed to take away the full right of appeal from people who have been in this country for more than seven years&#151;perhaps many more&#151;removed their right of appeal on compassionate circumstances and, worst of all, made them conduct their appeal from outside the United Kingdom. I hate to think of the indignation that could have overflowed.

<P>
That is a valuable pointer on the clause. It shows just how restricted the rights of appeal will be. We have already established what the rights of appeal on deportation will be and just how strong the feelings were in 1988 when those were changed. We are now moving over to removal. There was something between the Minister and me on this earlier and I shall give way to him at any stage if he wants to challenge any of this. The right of appeal against removal is a very restricted right of appeal. I do not know whether the Minister is familiar with the JCWI's handbook. The Minister is indicating that he is. This is the latest edition&#151;the 1999 edition&#151;acquired very recently. The handbook tells us:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If people alleged to be illegal entrants do not contest either the allegation or their removal, they can be sent away very quickly, because there is no formal right of appeal before removal except on grounds of identity.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On the right of appeal after removal, the handbook says, under the heading ``Return to the UK'':
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``After a person has been removed as an illegal entrant, there is a right of appeal from abroad, but only on the grounds that the person was not an illegal entrant. As the appellant must be outside the country while the case is fought and it is difficult to contradict the explanatory statement prepared by the immigration service in the United Kingdom, such appeals are rare and it is even rarer for them to succeed.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One can imagine why, when it is so difficult to bring an appeal outside the United Kingdom.
<P>
If I am not mistaken&#151;I challenge the Minister to come back to me if I am wrong&#151;that is the right of appeal that those whom the clause affects will have in future&#151;the right of appeal after removal. I shall give way to the Minister if he wants to contradict me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman has just voted on an amendment that he tabled, which sought to impose further conditions on people returning to the UK. How does he square that with the position that he is now advocating? Either he seeks to defend the deportation order system, which restricts people from returning for three years, or he seeks to impose further conditions that prevent them from returning. Now he is complaining that we are too tough. It seems to me that he is going a long way overboard and has no justifiable cause for complaint.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall answer the Minister's point, but I shall treat it as a concession, because nowhere in it did he contradict my assertion about the right of appeal. Therefore, I shall take that as an admission by the Minister that that will be the right of appeal that people are left with after the clause comes into effect.
<P>
Those who are familiar with Committees know very well that points are made about who is being tough or soft. I think that I dealt with the point in the previous debate. I was seeking a power that the Secretary of State could exercise in particular cases. If someone in this country who had been subject to this procedure had breached immigration controls in a gross way and it was in the public interest for them to be kept out, I would not flinch from giving the Secretary of State such a power. That happens, as things are now, with deportation orders. As the Minister will know, that power will still be available for people subject to deportation orders who come into other categories. Therefore, that is no answer. It will not get the Minister off the hook, nor does it do so, because the Minister is giving people a right of appeal that in every respect is inferior to the right of appeal that they currently have.
<P>
Deportation orders are a subject of some interest to me. I asked the Minister a series of written questions on the subject before the Committee began this phase of its deliberations. A successful appeal against removal is rare, but appeals against deportation orders sometimes succeed. In 1997, the last year for which the Home Office has statistics, 6,400 notices of intention to deport were given. There were 890 appeals against decisions to make deportation orders, of which 50 were allowed. It would be interesting to know on what grounds those 50 appeals were allowed. We do not know&#151;and I do not think that the Minister will be able to say&#151;how many of the 50 appeals were made by people who had been in this country for more than seven years and who were appealing on compassionate grounds.
<P>
Information is arriving in the Minister's hand, but in a written question I asked:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``how many appeals against deportations have been allowed in the case of persons who had been in the United Kingdom for (a) more than seven years and (b) less than seven years''.&#151;[Official Report, 29 March 1999; Vol. 328, c. 539.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He told me that that information was not available. He may be receiving different information now and he may be able to answer my questions in due course. However, when I first asked it, the Government were not able to say how many of the 50 successful appeals against deportation orders had been made by people who had been in this country for more than seven years.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I suspect that many of the appeals were made by people who had been here for more than seven years. They are the type of cases that are likely to be successful on appeal. If such people are deprived of the right of appeal on those grounds, they will in future be taken out of the country and deprived of the right of appeal even though they are currently likely to succeed. The Minister must deal with that point.
<P>
I do not want to discuss at length the great deal of evidence that we received, but all of it was critical of clause 6. I do not whether this debate will be pressed to a vote, but the organisations giving evidence should know that we have taken account of what they told us. I shall not quote at length, but the well respected Immigration Advisory Service said that the clause was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``wrong in principle, and it will not work in practice.''&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 17 March 1999; c. 151.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It described its limitations, and other organisations took a similar view.
<P>
We were not able to take oral evidence from some organisations, but I should like to refer to them. Several of them commented on clause 6 from a different point of view. The highly respected Children's Society submitted written evidence and, in column 102 of the volume containing memoranda and letters submitted to the Committee, it stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``2.1 Families with children should have the right to appeal against administrative removal under the provisions of Clause 6 on the grounds of compassionate circumstances.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> 2.2 This right should be available to families with children out of consideration of that child's best interest. For example, the children of parents who entered into the country 6 years ago or so, will only have experience of living in the UK and will have successfully have built up their life in this country. Families in this situation should be given leave to appeal against a decision to expel them without consideration of their circumstances and family ties.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I look to the Minister for confirmation, but I assume that children up to seven years old who have been in this country for all their lives will not have the right to appeal to a court. Surely, as part of a parent's appeal against a deportation, their case could be considered on compassionate circumstances.
<P>
The Minister will correct me if I am wrong. However, if the parents of a child of seven or eight who has spent its whole life in this country have overstayed or breached their conditions, the child could be taken out of the country and would have no right of appeal on compassionate circumstances. The Minister looks blank and shrugs his shoulders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I thought that the hon. Gentleman has recently put out a press release drawing attention to the fact that children who were born in the UK and who had been here for more than seven years are allowed to stay. I think that he was critical of the Government's decision to introduce that concession, which we did some time ago.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Once again, with a sleight of hand, the Minister is moving from what the Governnment are doing to rights of appeals to courts. I am talking about the right of appeal. Will the Minister focus his mind on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> What would a child be appealing against if he or his family were not going to be removed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The right of appeal on compassionate circumstances is being removed, and the Minister cannot get round it. All the weight of evidence from different organisations confirms it.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that I cannot get round it. He drew attention to children born in the UK who have lived here for more than seven years and suggested that they should be able to remain. If I remember rightly, when the Government introduced a concession that allowed children in precisely those circumstances to be able to remain, the hon. Gentleman was not very happy about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Not for the first time, the Minister is getting the wrong end of the stick on compassionate circumstances. He cannot get round what has been detected by so many organisations&#151;that the right of appeal on compassionate circumstances is being taken away.
<P>
The Minister and his hon. Friends have been saying how strange it is for Conservative Members to be talking about compassionate circumstances, but I remind them that at no time was the provision changed by a Conservative Government. In fairness, I accept that there must be a balance between enforcement and compassion and that the public interest must be considered in dealing with overstayers and those in breach of their conditions.
<P>
The Government have formed a judgment on rights of appeal that goes much further than any previous Conservative Government. However, I am most concerned about what people will do once enforcement proceedings have been commenced against them. What will a person who has lived here for more than seven years do? They will be the most desperate people of all. What steps will they to take? They will want to find a way of bringing their compassionate circumstances before the courts.
<P>
If their case is subject to removal, they will no longer be able to do that while they remain in the United Kingdom. Their only recourse will be a challenge on the grounds of identity. Even after they have left the United Kingdom, only limited grounds will remain.
<P>
As I said, what would someone in such a desperate position do? My right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border rightly mentioned judicial review. That would be one option and we know that the Government have taken certain measures in judicial review recently, which might have certain effects. Judicial review would enable the courts to consider the reasonableness of the decision.
<P>
The desperate person might also put in a claim for asylum. The credibility of such a claim and its prospects of success would depend largely on what country the person came from. I suspect that people from a certain range of countries will have little prospect of a successful or credible application on asylum grounds. Once again, what will they do? The Government are dangling in front of their noses a different right of appeal under clause 47&#151;the human rights provision.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm, and correct me if I am wrong, that in every one of the cases in which people are being moved from the deportation category into the removal category, there will be a right of appeal under clause 47. The Minister is not springing to his feet to challenge me on that now, so I look forward to hearing him comment in his winding-up speech.
<P>
How likely is a person with a right of appeal under clause 47 to take up that right and say that their human rights have been breached, probably because of a breach in the European convention on grounds of a right to family life or on other grounds? How likely are they to bring such an appeal? It is very likely indeed, because they are desperate people living with their families in the United Kingdom. Desperate people will go down any avenue to appeal and prolong their stay in the United Kingdom. So we will end up with many appeals being brought under clause 47 which would otherwise have been properly tackled by the deportation order process.
<P>
The Minister mentioned streamlining. The clause does not streamline, it channels appeals from one process into another. Human rights lawyers will do well out of the Bill. Expert witnesses have testified to the fact that there will be a new cottage industry of human rights appeals, brought by people who have overstayed, breached conditions and want to remain in this country. I put the likelihood of that to witnesses from the Law Society during our evidence-taking proceedings. They agreed with me. That view is also shared by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, the Immigration Advisory Service and several other organisations. The clause will simply shuffle people out of one queue and into another. It is a draconian provision that will backfire. It has little to commend it.
<P>
I support enforcement, but, to me, enforcement entails a determination to carry matters through. What increases will the Minister make in the number of staff who deal with enforcement in the IND? What efforts will be made to trace people who have overstayed? Without considering the matter of rights of appeal, we must deal with the problem because large numbers of people cannot be allowed to overstay in this country. However, the clause will not achieve that. The provision is unworkable. We support streamlining and enforcement but we suspect that the clause risks simply channelling people out of one queue and into another.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall try to answer some of those questions in the next four minutes, but I suspect that we shall be here much later tonight, tackling the rest of the hon. Gentleman's points.
<P>
The human circumstances of individuals are the most important, and our constituents want us to consider them properly. They support firm immigration controls, which the Government will provide. However, they also want those controls to be applied fairly. We intend to do that. For many of the reasons that the hon. Member for Hertsmere gave, the fears about splitting families will not be realised. It is clear that immigration rules for removal cases will enable family circumstances, including medical factors, to be taken into account. Therefore, decisions will be made in view of all the implications for the family. Current rules do not provide for that, although the Immigration Service tries to apply such criteria.
<P>
When the Human Rights Act 1998 is fully operational, any decision to remove that breaches article 8, which applies to family life, will also breach section 6 of the Act. Rights under the ECHR are included in clause 47. The hon. Gentleman might describe that as channelling appeals, but the provision ensures that people who have proper human rights grounds for an appeal can present them. It will not allow completely illegitimate cases to be brought before the courts.
<P>
I have already dealt with the points about the children over seven years old. The Government's concession on those is well known, at least by most of my hon. Friends. The clause's objective is to move from the cumbersome and inequitable process of deportation orders, which is not only lengthy and burdensome but breaks up families for three-year periods, to a more effective system of immigration controls, which will be efficient and ensure that there are not so many victims.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington rightly drew attention to the families who have suffered through unscrupulous immigration advisers and those who try to persuade people to delay the proceedings. I and many of my hon. Friends know of such cases.
<P>
The hon. Member for Westbury criticised the view that speed was important. I believe that it is important because if we intend to remove someone from this country, we ought to get on with the process. We give people fair opportunities to make their case and we ensure that their circumstances&#151;especially their family circumstances and whether children are involved&#151;are taken into account. However, if we intend to remove people, there is no merit in dragging out the process, and allowing appeal after appeal for which appellants are advised by some unscrupulous lawyer or immigration adviser to string the whole matter out. That creates new problems.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>8.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming:&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I was highlighting the problems caused by unscrupulous immigration advisers, making the point that they often deliberately advise people to drag out procedures and stay in the country for long periods, when the eventual outcome of such procedures is almost inevitably deportation or removal. The deportation system in particular provided opportunities for substantial abuse.
<P>
As a result, people naturally developed roots in the community by establishing families and taking jobs, and made contributions to society. That made their removal all the more difficult and painful, because new victims were created. If we have to remove people, we must get on with it. There should be no unnecessary appeals, but there should be circumstances in which individuals' conditions are examined. The immigration measure will allow us to do that in cases of removal.
<P>
Once the Human Rights Act 1998 is fully in place, there will be an in-country right of appeal for those with human rights grounds for such an appeal. There will be a non-suspensive appeal if there are no good human rights or compassionate grounds for bringing the matter before an adjudicator.
<P>
Married people can obviously make applications in the normal way as spouses after their removal if they comply with the normal immigration rules. Ethnic minorities have regularly expressed dissatisfaction with the way in which some people have been allowed to break the rules by coming to the UK without consent to marry, then married and sought to stay. Others, however, enter the country lawfully as spouses, and go through the procedure properly, which takes longer.
<P>
We should not encourage people to abuse the rules. We should remove people who have abused the rules, but if they have family and other commitments, they should be able to exercise their right to apply in the normal way. So the deportation order is not an adequate way of dealing with matters, as it takes no account of family rights.

<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I am trying to understand people's residual right of appeal. Does that refer to a judicial appeal or an appeal to the adjudicator?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It is a right to have the matter considered by an ajudicator, should the person have an issue to bring before a judicial body. Therefore, such people may have grounds on which they wish to have a human rights issue considered.
<P>
There are circumstances in which there will be appeal rights, but we are not allowing unnecessary appeal rights for people with no proper human rights grounds for making an appeal, who do not have children who have been here for more than seven years&#151;such children will, in any event, be covered by the concessionary interviews&#151;and who, perhaps, can re-enter the country if they are married.
<P>
However, some people are playing the system, and are here unlawfully. They have overstayed and calculated on abusing the system. We should not have any truck with that. We should deport such people, who create the problems that I spoke about earlier.
<P>
We wish to speed up the system and make it workable. The amendment would retain a system that does not work. I therefore request the hon. Gentleman not to press amendment No. 114.
