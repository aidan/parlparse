<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 27, in page 2, line 31, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(4A) The regulations shall provide that, for the purposes of determining a person's hourly rate of remuneration--
<P>
(a) anything which is treated as remuneration for the purposes of income tax shall be treated as forming part of a person's remuneration;
<P>
(b) any benefits in kind shall be treated as forming part of a person's remuneration to the extent that they are treated as taxable emoluments for the purposes of income tax; and
<P>
(c) any deductions from earnings, charges or expenses which a person is required to bear shall not be treated as deductions from remuneration except and to the extent that they may be so treated for the purposes of income tax.'.<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): The wide discretion that the Secretary of State has under clause 2 could undermine the Bill's principles, which the Government have defended so vigorously in this debate. I said earlier that that might concern not only Opposition Members, but Labour Back Benchers.
<P>
The notes on clauses refers to the possibility of the exclusion of allowances for working in a particular region--regional premium payments. After all the Government's rhetoric about the importance of a single national rate, it is strange that they should propose that the Secretary of State have the power to exclude regional premium payments from the calculation of the national minimum wage. Such a measure would create regional variations in the minimum wage. For example, a company with UK-wide employment might pay its employees &#163;3 an hour, but pay a London weighting premium of &#163;1 an hour. The Secretary of State might then exercise her discretion in the way that the notes on clauses suggests and exclude that &#163;1 an hour regional weighting from the calculation of the national minimum wage. The company in question would then have to pay the minimum wage--at whatever rate it is ultimately set--plus the regional premium, which could not be taken into account when calculating whether the minimum wage had been paid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): If I understand my hon. Friend's interesting argument, I am sure that he would concede that a company faced with a particular wage payment structure in greater London, as opposed to the north of England, might, as a matter of strategy, decide to create a regional payment precisely to subvert the intention of the mimimum wage. That would make it common, but it would be at a lower level.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank my hon. Friend. I was about to say that the proposals will send all sorts of signals to employers and employees in the run-up to the implementation of the national minimum wage. I am slightly curious about the fact that the notes on clauses appears to suggest that regional premiums may be excluded. That would have precisely the opposite effect to creating a single national minimum wage, for which Labour Members have argued so robustly.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to eliminate an area of the Secretary of State's discretion which, in an innocent interpretation of the clause's purpose, she does not need and which, in a more sinister interpretation of the Government's intention, she should not have. Conservative Members want to set minds at rest on the issues that I raised in my speech this morning. The statement in the Bill that remuneration will mean remuneration as people understand it as defined for tax purposes will go a long way to setting minds at rest. We want to ensure that the clause is not used to create a national minimum net wage in the way that I have suggested would be possible. We want to ensure that it will not be used to create an asymmetry between the treatment of benefits in kind and other elements of remuneration in the calculation of minimum wage payments and tax liabilities. We want to ensure that it will not, as a result of arbitrary exclusions or inclusions by the Secretary of State, lead to different results from those reasonably anticipated on the basis of the Bill. The Opposition want to ensure that it will not threaten the incentive systems by its treatment of bonus and performance pay.
<P>
Above all, the Opposition want to ensure fair and predictable outcomes. That cuts both ways. I believe that it is essential that elements of benefits in kind paid by employers have fulfilled their obligations under the Bill. It is equally essential that employees' expenses that are allowable in the computation of their tax liability, and which are paid to them by their employers, should be excluded from that calculation.
<P>
If tax and national mimimum wage treatments of the same payment or benefit differ, unfairness and confusion will result. People will not accept that such a system is fair and equitable. Either employees or employers, or perhaps both, will feel aggrieved.
<P>
In replying to the debate, I hope that the Minister will address the key issues that have been raised, and that she will explain why she thinks that the Secretary of State needs the powers detailed in subsection (4). I hope that she will acknowledge the extremely wide scope of the powers and that their exercise could result in the harmful and, frankly, bizarre effects that I have suggested. That would occur in ways suggested not by me or by somebody who has sat on the Opposition Benches dreaming them up, but by the notes on clauses supplied to the Committee by the Minister's Department.
<P>
If the Minister will not accept the amendments, which are in no sense detrimental to the essential objectives of the Bill, will she explain why? If she will not explain, will she at least acknowledge the anxieties that have been expressed, and try to give the Opposition some comfort with regard to them, given the wide scope of powers with which the Secretary of State is being endowed?
<P>
Businesses and employees like to know where they stand and where they are going. They need certainties. It cannot be helpful for crucial matters such as the treatment of key elements of remuneration to be the subject of the Secretary of State's discretion. The amendment seeks to eliminate the uncertainty by importing into the Bill a clear set of definitions of reimbursement, which already exists in the British legal code and framework. That clear and unambiguous set of rules exists for determining what is regarded as remuneration. Unless the Government have a hidden agenda, I cannot see why those rules cannot be used. I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lepper </B>(Brighton, Pavilion): I am pleased to speak on the tipping amendment. Labour Members realised this morning that tipping is at the centre of an economic argument being put forward by the Opposition.
<P>
I said last week that I had listened entranced and enthralled to the Opposition. I was even more enthralled this morning, especially as I represent a constituency whose local economy relies on tourism and on the hotel and restaurant trade--not as much as some people believe, but to a certain extent. I listened to theories about tipping on which the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) concentrated. They were a central point of his argument. He even suggested that unless a certain attitude were adopted towards tipping, the structure of civilisation as we know it would be on the point of crumbling, besides the suggestion that certain inconsistencies would be built into national minimum wage legislation.
<P>
I commend to him a work by George Orwell, ``Down and Out in Paris and London'', which describes the practice of tipping and the way in which it is regarded by certain people who are involved in the restaurant trade.
<P>
I was interested in another aspect of the hon. Gentleman's argument. As he reminded us, accommodation is provided by employers in some occupations. The hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) was looking intent at that point. I wondered whether notions of &#163;7 an hour and a spare room in his house were going round in his head as he thought how he might juggle with those components and come up with a new formulation for that well-known character, his cleaner, who has been mentioned more than once in our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> Last week it was not my practice to give way, as I had such a short time to speak. However, as I have mentioned the hon. Gentleman I shall give way on this occasion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I intervene at this point not to preserve my own reputation but to bolster that of my cleaner. I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands that my cleaner is a happily married woman and mother. I certainly do not provide her with accommodation as part of the terms of her employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> Let me reassure the hon. Gentleman: I was referring to a spare room. Over the past two weeks, we have all developed a great admiration for that worthy lady. [Laughter.] We learn more at every sitting.
<P>
I listened carefully to the arguments of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge who moved the amendment. I listened in particular for three words, in the hope that I would hear them at some point in his argument. Those three words were ``Low Pay Commission''. Intently though I listened, I did not hear those words. If I missed them, I apologise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> I think not at this stage. I should like to develop my argument more fully first. I may give way at a later stage.
<P>
If the mover, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge had paid attention to the work that the House asked the Low Pay Commission to do on its behalf and to make recommendations on, he might have had second thoughts about some of his arguments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have been described as many things in my time, not all of them complimentary, but never as a mover.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> A shaker, perhaps.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> If the hon. Gentleman had ever seen me on a dance floor, he would understand why. He said quite rightly that I did not refer in my speech to the Low Pay Commission. Will he accept that the purpose of the amendment is to import into the Bill a functional working definition of remuneration from the tax codes that the Inland Revenue currently operates? I do not want the Low Pay Commission, the Secretary of State, or anyone else to review this issue. I simply want the Bill to include the definitions that we all know and work with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> I look forward to seeing the hon. Gentleman on the dance floor--if not a mover, perhaps a shaker. Despite his comments, he overlooks the point that was made in the letter of 23 September 1997 from the Secretary of State to Professor Bain of the Low Pay Commission. Among other matters, she pointed out to him that the Low Pay Commission should examine this whole range of issues which, in different forms of employment, are sometimes--and sometimes not--included in the remuneration that someone might feel is part of what they are entitled to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way now?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> I have adopted a practice of giving way when I have referred to a Conservative Member. The hon. Gentleman will have an opportunity to expound on what I have said in his own speech.
<P>
The Secretary of State asked the Low Pay Commission, on behalf of this House, to consider all those issues--tipping, bonuses, accommodation, provision of clothing and tools, premiums of one kind or another--and to report back with recommendations on them. Clause 2 gives the Secretary of State the power to consider those recommendations and to accept or reject them. Clause 5 makes it necessary for the reasons for rejection to be reported to the House so that they can be fully debated by hon. Members.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We know from the notes--
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> No, I will not.
<P>
<B>Mr Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> No.
<P>
From the notes that have been provided, we know that the Low Pay Commission heard a range of views on the issues presented to us this morning by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. For instance, the Engineering Employers Federation said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the components of the NMW should be kept as simple as possible so that is easy to understand and enforce. But many companies have some form of incentive or bonus payments scheme so that earnings are regularly considerably higher than the basic hourly rate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The federation asked for that to be considered. On the other hand, the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``tips from a customer . . . should not count as a payment by the employer''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One might not be surprised that different sides of a profession have adopted different views.
<P>
The Restaurateurs Association of Great Britain says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``benefits such as meals, uniform and accommodation would have to be taken into account, otherwise `there would not be a level playing field with other industry sectors and restaurateurs would be placed at a strategic economic disadvantage.' ''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government have asked the Low Pay Commission under Professor Bain to consider the representations and to make recommendations to the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> The hon. Gentleman will have the opportunity to comment on what I have said later.
<P>
I refer again to the Secretary of State's letter to Professor Bain of September last year. She told Professor Bain that, in considering the issues of the kind that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and I have listed,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the commission should have regard to the wider economic and social implications; the likely effect on the level of employment and inflation; the impact on the competitiveness of business, particularly the small firms sector; and the potential impact on the costs to industry and the Exchequer.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have great faith in Professor Bain and those who work with him and have no doubt that he will consider all submissions carefully and that recommendations will be made to the Secretary of State. It would be irresponsible of us at this late stage to restrict what the Commission might or might not consider in making its recommendations. We would be saying that it had wasted seven months working on our behalf because--
<P>
<UL><UL><UL>Several hon. Members rose--
<P>
</UL></UL></UL><B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has made it clear that he is not accepting interventions. I should be grateful if members of the Committee would accept that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> He is Frit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> We all know what happened to the last person who said that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> Indeed.
<P>
Having given the Low Pay Commission clear guidelines and criteria for consideration, it would be irresponsible at this late stage to hedge it all with restrictions on what it can and cannot consider. I therefore ask hon. Members to reject the amendments. It is not our job to do the work of the Low Pay Commission. We will have an opportunity to debate its recommendations at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I confess that I am astonished at the speech of the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Mr. Lepper), who in the course of his discursive comments on the amendment failed to address any of the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. I thought that my hon. Friend was exemplary in addressing himself precisely to the issues of amendments Nos. 26 and 27 and their relationship to the Bill.
<P>
It is a pity that the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion went all over the shop but did not answer my hon. Friend's questions--with respect, I hope that that will not count as a reason not to have a stand part debate on clause 2. This does not constitute a debate on the wider issues, certainly not for Conservative Members; we are addressing the amendments, solely and specifically.
<P>
I do not want to add much to what my hon. Friend said. As I said, the way he set out the arguments in favour of our amendments was exemplary. The question that the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion signally failed to address--indeed, he did not even give way to allow the question to be put to him--was under what circumstances the Government foresaw the Low Pay Commission recommending and the Government thence implementing a definition of remuneration which was different from that which applies for the purposes of taxation. Until we can see what those differences are, we are bound, as my hon. Friend said, to wonder either whether the Bill is drafted so as to be simply a catch-all provision for Ministers who are too lazy to think through their aim and to legislate accordingly--
<P>
<B>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> That is harsh.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Oh, Mr. Atkinson, I am accused by the Minister of being harsh. The thought of the Minister being lazy is, I freely confess, unfair. I must therefore conclude that she is seeking those powers in that form in order to use them. If so, she should tell us why. I am very interested to know how this provision will be used differently from the definition of remuneration for the purposes of taxation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> To some extent, my hon. Friend has already dealt with the point. However, I wonder whether, being a generous fellow, he would be willing to give way to any Labour Member who was prepared to give a reason why benefits in kind should be treated differently in the context of the national minimum wage from the way in which they would be treated when calculating taxation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The answer is yes, but I would be surprised if I was invited to give way for that purpose. The protestations from Labour Members that they have a limited amount of time in which to engage in debate seems to be far fetched. In fact, in the context of this debate, they have a limited amount so say, because Ministers will not let them speculate about the circumstances under which remuneration is to be counted as part of the minimum wage or otherwise.
<P>
Let Labour Members tell us--are gratuities and tipping to be included in the national minimum wage? Will regional premiums or employers' contributions to occupational pension schemes be included?
<P>
What about specific benefits, such as child care? Tax legislation contains a perfectly good definition of what constitutes remuneration, so we could follow that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend's example of child care provided by the employer is good and I confess that I had not thought of it. The Committee will know that considerable pressure is building for some form of tax concession for such provision. If the Bill were to contain some symmetry between the treatments of such provision for tax and for the national minimum wage, could we not ensure fair treatment across the range of legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend makes a typically astute point that I confess had not occurred to me. Other instances will arise in which tax treatment has been adjusted for perfectly good reasons. Employers require simplicity and certainty. The implementation of the national minimum wage will be facilitated if its structure is rooted in legislation with which employers are familiar and which will enable them to examine, Budget by Budget, changes in the definition of taxable income. There will then be no need to look at separate regulations to define whether such changes of definition will affect the national minimum wage.
<P>
I was grateful for the Minister of State's note touching on the components of remuneration. However, the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry reminded us this morning that the examples that it contained were illustrative rather than definitive or comprehensive. I shall not dwell on the note's contents as though Ministers were defining what is covered by remuneration. The note makes it clear that some payments may be in or out depending on the definition in subsequent regulations.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion began his contribution by speaking about tips and tax, but the note from the Minister of State makes the matter clear. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Although not paid by the employer, tips are taxable as emoluments because they derive from the employee's employment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not think that I shall stretch your patience too far, Mr. Atkinson, when I say that the Department seems to consider it reasonable for the definition of taxable emoluments to be used as the basis for determining whether a remuneration is payable by the employer and therefore whether that remuneration forms part of a contract with a bearing on the national minimum wage.
<P>
That disclosure of Ministers' intentions may be inadvertent, but it shows that they are looking for something capable of an interpretation that goes way beyond what has been considered previously. Clause 2(4) is a good illustration of the way in which this part of the Bill is structured. Paragraph 7 of the purpose and background section of the notes on clauses states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the regulation-making power is . . . flexible enough to be able to prescribe a regime in the nature of Part II of the former Wages Act''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It can also
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``prescribe an entirely different regime, or to prescribe a regime which has some elements in common with''
<P>
</UL></FONT>the wages council regime, and some that are not.
<P>
We could say that the Bill as drafted allows Ministers to take a power to make regulations that is flexible enough to allow them to prescribe a regime that is exactly in line with the treatment of income under tax legislation. It is, however, also flexible enough to allow them to have an entirely different regime or to have components that are consistent with it and ones that are not. At the end of that process, we are not guided by Ministers and least of all, have we set out Parliament's intention in relation to the treatment of remuneration.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Many dangers spring from that situation. The greatest danger is that which my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was kind enough to take from me in an intervention. If we allow a difference to emerge between the treatment of remuneration for tax and national minimum wage purposes, employers will subsequently manipulate pay. They will do that principally by consolidating into basic pay bonuses, piece-work rates, overtime premiums, shift hours premiums, anti-social hours payments and a series of other items. Why? For the perfectly obvious reason that they will be at pains to establish their headroom above the national minimum wage floor. Having done so, they may bring those payments, including benefits in kind, into the ambit of the national minimum wage and, in doing so, into the ambit of tax legislation as taxable payments. Previously, however, those payments may have been outside both because of the manner in which they were payable. They may have included accommodation in which employees were required to live or meals that employees took because they were required to be on the premises at particular times. Such items may be outside the tax net, but are brought within it. The net effect will be to leave some employees worse off.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. The situation is that if an employee earns below the P11D threshold of &#163;8,500 a year, benefits in kind might not be taken into account in calculating his tax liability. If his employer consolidated those benefits in kind into cash payments, he would be worse off because they would automatically come within the scope of taxation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend, entirely typically, has taken my point and added a better one to it. He illustrates his point with an example that has tremendous force. It is incumbent on the Minister to examine the question and to ask whether there are circumstances in which benefits in kind that are payable to low-paid employees might be replaced by basic payments within the national minimum wage, which might subsequently be subject to tax, even though they presently escape it. The net effect might be to increase the tax bill for such employees without benefiting them through the national minimum wage. By virtue of my hon. Friend's helpful intervention, we see that there is a powerful argument in favour of the amendment as opposed to the current drafting of the Bill. It falls to the Government to say under which circumstances the amendment would not represent Ministers' intentions.
<P>
My hon. Friend referred to one further significant area. I have been trying to wrestle in my mind with the question of why Ministers might wish to have the power to include or exclude variations in regional pay or pay according to location of work. If one excludes such variations, in the higher paying and higher cost parts of the country, in which the average applicable level of wages is higher, it would be possible for Ministers, by excluding regional pay premiums, to establish a more regionally equivalent level of basic minimum wage and so justify a lower level of minimum wage overall. It is not for me to judge whether that is the Minister's intention or whether it is a good or bad idea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that, if that were the Minister's intention, it would be defeated at a stroke if employers merely consolidated the regional premium into the basic wage paid to employees who happened to work in that particular place of work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, my hon. Friend is right. However, I suspect that Ministers are not looking at the matter in that way, but instead want a relatively low national minimum wage, if at all possible. They are aware, in the absence of regional variation in the national minimum wage, that a high starting level would have serious adverse consequences for certain regions. We established that in previous debates. Ministers may ask what relevance that has to the circumstances of other employers. They may then say, ``If we regard it as necessary, there is the power in the national minimum wage legislation to set a single national minimum wage rate but to determine what is remuneration for these purposes and what is not.'' Ministers could treat as remuneration an implied premium within the pay of the employee. So employees in London, for example, could be treated as having a regional variation on their pay. In effect, the pay of everyone in the south-east could be discounted by 25 per cent. to establish their national mimimum wage. It is an entirely different, but ingenious, way of arriving at regional variation in the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I agree that that would be an ingenious way of doing it, but it would be much more damaging than doing it openly--a course which the Government have already rejected. An obvious effect would be to introduce distortions into employers' actions, most notably regarding where they locate themselves geographically. If they can move their industries, they will hunt around for areas where they can get away with paying the mimimum that the Government decide is sensible for a minimum wage. That would result in much more distortion for the economy than an honest approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend is right about that. In a sense, this will all inevitably result in distortion. The more complex or ingenious the mechanism, the more ingenious the distortion. I would like to be sure that it is not Ministers' intention to go down that path. However, we are seeking to make progress without any guidance from Ministers about their intentions. Therefore, it is incumbent on us to examine the drafting of the Bill and construe whether it permits certain actions. It is certainly not the intention of Parliament that Ministers should behave in this way. They have said that they want to exclude regional variation, yet they have gone to the trouble of providing a power to apply a regional variation to the remuneration that is to be counted for the purposes of the national minimum wage.
<P>
That is perverse, and it does not seem likely that Ministers would act in a perverse way. I am a generous fellow, Mr. Atkinson, as you know. So if Ministers are not acting perversely, they are acting deliberately. If so, they should explain why they do one thing in one part of the Bill and provide themselves with a contrary power in another part.
<P>
For the third time in different debates, and notwithstanding the fact that the Low Pay Commission will offer its view in due course, I invite Ministers to say whether they wish the commission to treat pension payments by employers as remuneration for the purposes of the national minimum wage or otherwise. There are significant implications for low-paid employees and their ability to have what Labour Members would describe as second-tier pensions in the treatment of pensions for these purposes. With the greatest respect to the Low Pay Commission, I am not sure that the matter should be left entirely for that body to determine. It may make the right recommendation, but broader policy issues are at stake in connection with pensions and their treatment for these purposes. The future health of pensions paid to lower-paid workers will be damaged if the Bill contains a perverse incentive to consolidate pensions into basic wages rather than to pay them as separate employers' contributions. It is a shared view amoung hon. Members that those workers should not retire without an occupational pension.
<P>
I applaud the initiative of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge in tabling the amendment, whose purpose is to improve and make more workable a Bill to which we have expressed our opposition in principle. I hope that Ministers will adopt the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Not for the first time, the Committee owes a debt of gratitude to my hon. Friends the Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley). Their acuity in spotting problems in the small print of the Bill caused them to initiate a fascinating line of argument that has been developed across the Committee this afternoon.
<P>
The Committee will know that I nearly always think reasonably well of the Government and of their officials. I would not dream of calling into question their motives, but the more I listened to my hon. Friends the more worried I became about the agenda behind this clause.
<P>
We are keen to make progress so I shall not take long in going through my hon. Friend's arguments, but I wish to mention the contribution from the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion. He may not have intended to do so, but he set out eloquently the complexity of the range of provisions covering the different types of remuneration and the different ways in which people organise their affairs. That complexity has to be subjected to a single test to determine whether a particular set of circumstances complies with the national minimum wage.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman was right to refer to the many submissions, written and oral, that have been made by the Low Pay Commission. Those submissions have come from throughout the country, and the commission has done an immense amount of work on them. Opposition Members do not contend that it was in any sense wrong to undertake the exercise, but it reinforces the need for a Government submission to the commission. An upfront Government steer, which has been promised but not yet delivered, would have helped in the consideration of these matters.
<P>
I have my own views as to why no Government submission has been forthcoming and I may advert to them in a moment--as long as you, Mr. Atkinson, consider that I am in order. However, the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion was right, perhaps unintentionally, to say that the matter is very complicated and presents many pitfalls for the Government. Many people, regardless of whether they have interests in the matter, have legitimate reasons for drawing attention to that complexity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Did my hon. Friend notice that in his speech the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion said that it would not be appropriate ``at this stage'' for the Government or their Back Benchers to comment on the particular matters that the Low Pay Commission has the responsibility to judge? Does my hon. Friend think that it is reasonable for us to expect that, before the Bill is enacted, Ministers and Government Back Benchers will express a view about those matters?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall make two points in response to that. First, I am sure that the Minister will say that all hon. Members will be able to express their views about those matters when the regulations come to be made. Secondly, as the Low Pay Commission is able to read our deliberations before it makes its recommendations, no time could be better than the present for hon. Members to draw attention to the problems that we foresee.
<P>
There is no doubt that the Low Pay Commission can consider what is said in this Committee. The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge raises the question of whether the problems that have been identified should be dealt with in ways that are coincident with the long-standing practice of the Revenue. I shall return to that point in a moment.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should like to flag up two points before doing so. First, all members of the Committee should carefully consider the issue of child care. It was considered under the previous Government, and changes were made to ease the tax position of child care. Clearly, child care is a benefit in kind, and it may be made available by employers at their expense. It is important to achieve the right balance of public interest and equity between different kinds of remuneration. The issue of child care is a buzz at present, not least because of welfare to work, and because of the Government's attitude to lone parents.
<P>
I listened to a most eloquent speech made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer at a reception given by the Daycare Trust just outside the Palace last night. The right hon. Gentleman waxed eloquent about the importance of child care. He received a good deal of bipartisan support. Apart from the Opposition's other anxieties, the Minister should examine the issue carefully and sensibly.
<P>
Secondly, the potentially perverse consequences of the clause for remuneration structures have increasingly arisen as an issue in the debate. My hon. Friends have spoken about that, and I agree with them that, generally speaking, there may be an incentive to build into the basic rate other bits of the remuneration package. That seems likely a priori.
<P>
I am a little less certain about regional premiums. Although the notes on clauses state explicitly that one of the matters that may count will be allowances for working in a specific region, I am unclear about whether a legal distinction exists between a region and an area. Subsection (7) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``No provision shall be made under this section''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
--one assumes that the clause will become a section--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``which treats the same circumstances differently in relation to--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) different areas''--<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have considered that point. I have concluded, perhaps wrongly, that a provision that excludes all regional premiums from the calculation of the national minimum wage would not breach the requirements of subsection 7(a), because it would not treat different areas differently, but would exclude all regional premiums from calculations on a blanket basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That was a helpful intervention. If my hon. Friend is interested in moonlighting, he could obtain a part-time job as a Government lawyer advising about the matter. The Minister must examine it seriously, to achieve consistency in the Bill. My hon. Friend's interpretation may well be right, and it had crossed my mind too. The Committee should know whether it is right.
<P>
I should like to help the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion, if I can. I am glad to see his acknowledgement. If he is saying that the Low Pay Commission should examine the matter, I do not object in principle. If he is, as I hope, saying that the Government will depart from the long-standing practice of the Revenue at their peril, I have no qualm. A powerful case has been made for suggesting that if there is to an exception from that long-standing practice and from the experience of the Revenue, it must be clear and explicit. The Minister would help by saying why such circumstances may arise, and the Opposition would think about her response.
<P>
I do not quite have a personal interest in the matter, but I was succeeded in the job that I did as a member of a student body by a good friend who is now the new chairman of the board of the Inland Revenue. Even before his appointment, I should have said that all hon. Members, as mere legislators and even as--dare I say it--mere Ministers, should quail before the Revenue's might. It has a clear view of the matter, and it has a great deal of experience that is relevant to the arguments put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge.
<P>
Although I shall advise my hon. Friends to support the amendment, we have not ruled out for ever any possibility of divergence. But any case for divergence would have to be well conceived and argued.
<P>
There is a second point: any act of payment or remuneration, subject only to the Revenue's code, could attract charges to income taxation and national insurance contributions. We do not always succeed with amendments--I am extremely conscious of that with regard to amendment No. 60, which was not selected for debate--but I have it at the back of my mind that any act of payment requires tax and national insurance consideration. We have not yet considered the Bill's powers of enforcement, but if people are given retrospective awards--payments--in respect of the national minimum wage, however it is composed, they will attract an annual charge to tax and a retrospective charge to national insurance contributions.
<P>
A big problem with the national insurance and tax complex existing alongside the benefits system is that national insurance and benefits operate on a weekly basis while tax charges are made annually. I am putting down a friendly marker for the Minister so that she can consider the problems that lie ahead. She must think hard about how money will be clawed back from delinquent employers and who is responsible for how tax and national insurance charges are to be resolved.
<P>
That brings me to my final point, which my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has already made eloquently to the Committee: he asked whether we were discussing gross or net pay. In discussing the difficulties in getting hold of the Government's evidence to the Low Pay Commission, I may have detected a small rat--a whiff from beneath an undisclosed floorboard--which might explain their extraordinary coyness about submitting what would seem to be perfectly straightforward evidence about which they have been thinking for seven months.
<P>
It may be seven months since the Low Pay Commission started its work; it is seven weeks until the Chancellor presents his next Budget. It has been suggested--far be it from me; I am not privileged to have the information--that the Chancellor is taking an interest in earned income tax credits or related matters. They might have been factored in to the Bill, but Ministers have not levelled with the Committee or, indeed, the commission as to their intentions so we cannot consider the effects. The problem that my hon. Friends have identified--the potential perverse impacts on remuneration structures--would be gravely compounded and there would be a range of second-round and third-round consequences if tax were taken into account.
<P>
No doubt we shall return to the matter, but I regret that we have said little about the impact of the Bill on Government revenues that will arise in part from the clawback of means-tested benefits. Some of the arguments have been put on the record by Polimod in the evidence of the Low Pay Unit to the Low Pay Commission. It refers to a national minimum wage not exactly going out to what might be referred to as the low pay community. A rate of &#163;3.70 an hour would lead to &#163;1,790 million of total revenue a year; &#163;780 million of increased income tax; increased employer NICs of &#163;350 million; and increased employee NICs of &#163;360 million.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that put in those terms, the Bill amounts simply to a tax on employers? It is a straightforward transfer of a financial liability from the Treasury to employers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend puts it more crudely than I might, but that is so. I was going to add, as I have not quite composed my table, that there is also a decrease of &#163;300 million in means-tested benefits.
<P>
This is not the first piece of legislation where it is clearly the case that items that are seen and presented as being for social advancement and meeting the concerns, some of them legitimate, of those who are less well off and comparatively underprivileged in our society--we have seen this with pensions provisions and other matters on which I shall not expand now--turn out to be a tip-and-run raid by the Chancellor in the interests of public revenues. That may or may not be intended, but my hon. Friends' amendments have shown that the potential exists, and we shall listen with great interest to the Minister's response.
<P>
The Government should have a very good reason for departing from the long-standing practice of the Revenue and, more widely, should level with members of the Committee as to what they intend by their proposals, in terms both of revenue and the application of remuneration.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> We have had a wide-ranging debate but I shall seek to earn your favour, Mr. Atkinson--I am nothing if not ingratiating--by trying to stick to the amendments.
<P>
First, I want to take issue with the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire, who said that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge had put his case in an exemplary way. Hon. Members might remember that before we adjourned at 1 o'clock, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said that Whips were cold-hearted creatures. I want to spring to the defence of my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) and the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor), not only because I want to ingratiate myself with the Whips' Office--especially my own--but also because I spent a year in that office. The best thing I can say about Whips is that they are just like social workers.
<P>
There are several problems with the amendments. First, they are prescriptive and require the regulations under clause 2 to deal in a particular way with the calculation of remuneration for the purposes of the national minimum wage. Such a prescriptive approach goes against the purpose of clause 2, which is to enable the Secretary of State to act in the light of the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge talked in this opening remarks about the sinister outcomes of clause 2 and pointed to the notes on clauses, which refer to similar powers in the Wages Act 1986. I remind the hon. Gentleman that although he was not a Member of the House in 1986--neither was I--that measure was passed by an Administration whose colour the hon. Gentleman would support.
<P>
Secondly, the amendments would pre-empt any recommendations from the Low Pay Commission on this issue. As my hon. Friend the member for Brighton, Pavilion rightly said, we have asked the Low Pay Commission to advise particularly on the method or methods to be used to determine the hourly rate of remuneration for the national minimum wage. We are awaiting its report, which is due by the end of May. That is the purpose of consultation, and we do not intend to pre-empt it, as the amendments would have us do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I understand the thrust of the Minister's argument, but does she accept that inequitable outcomes will arise if employees and employers find that a certain element of remuneration is treated as remuneration for tax purposes and is taxed, but is discounted from the minimum wage calculation? Will not that lead to a sense of unfairness and perversity?
<P>
<H5>5.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> We are talking about tax matters, not about the national minimum wage. If Opposition Members will allow me, I want to develop my argument. Although I accept that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge seeks clarification, my objection to the amendments is that they would hinder the Bill's aim. They would also lead to the definition of remuneration being changed every time the income tax rules changed. That would create unnecessary uncertainty over the proper composition of remuneration for the purposes of the national minimum wage. It would certainly generate additional bureaucracy for employers and would not help in enforcing the legislation. The only people who would benefit from the amendments would be tax lawyers. Although I have never practised tax law, I must own up to a previous record as a lawyer, although I am not practising now. I have no desire for the provisions to assist tax lawyers.
<P>
The amendments could lead to other undesirable outcomes. The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) referred to some benefits in kind being subject to income tax for employees earning above &#163;8,500 per year, but not for employees earning less than that. Such a provision could interact with the national minimum wage regime to create unfair differences in treatment. That answers the point that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has just made.
<P>
Moreover, the amendments would require all sources of taxable income to count towards the national minimum wage. It is clearly absurd to count, for example, income from savings as equivalent to income from work--[Interruption.] That is not the purpose of the Bill or the policy behind it. I hear a denial from Conservative Members, but if they examine the amendments carefully, they will see that that is the case.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> We must not let the Minister get away scot-free. She said that if the national minimum wage calculation had to change every time the income tax basis changed, it would create bureaucracy. It is clear that employers have to deal with changes in the income tax regime as a matter of course. To have different treatments for the national minimum wage and for income tax would create bureaucracy in the workplace, but to have them in parallel would reduce costs and make matters much simpler for employers.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I do not accept that. The hon. Gentleman is trying to be helpful--I am giving him the benefit of the doubt--but he has not grasped the point. He is confusing a system of income tax with a system of providing a floor under which wage levels cannot go.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Can the Minister shed light on whether regional pay or premiums can in principle be subject to consideration under the clause, or are they ruled out by subsection (7)?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I refer the hon. Gentleman to the legislation itself, which makes it clear that one cannot differentiate on grounds of area.
<P>
To return to the broader issue, the amendment ignores the point that the purpose of the national minimum wage is to act as a general floor for all workers. The Bill, therefore, rightly focuses on remuneration payable by employers, not on income or benefits receivable from any sources. it is for those reasons that I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I did not intend to speak to the amendment, which was so ably and fully moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. However, I am impelled to do so by the extraordinary speech of the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion. He introduced a number of bizarre concepts and interpretations on the amendments in those parts of his speech that actually touched on them.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's first and most extraordinary point was that it was in some way improper for members of the Committee to discuss the amendment or any other details pertaining to the various benefits in kind and the problems introduced by them in devising a national minimum wage structure while submissions were being made to the Low Pay Commission. He said that we should reserve these rights to the Low Pay Commission while its members were discussing it. This is extraordinary for several reasons. There might be a slight hint of legitimacy in that proposition if the Government had the courage of their convictions and put forward their own evidence to the Low Pay Commission. The commission will clearly do its work conscientiously within the limits of those appointed to it. The commission does not represent, for instance, a small business practitioner. However, I am sure that the commission will do its work as well as it can. Equally clearly, it is vital for the commission to try to understand the details of what the Government believe should be the level of the minimum wage and, as is particularly relevant to the amendment, some of the problems caused by the difficulties of interpreting which benefits in kind should be allowed as part of the minimim wage.
<P>
It is extraordinary to say that the Government are allowed to remain silent. Every other body in the country is allowed to make submissions to the Low Pay Commission. But then we are told that the Low Pay Commission should be allowed to get on with it and that the Committee should not be allowed to discuss the details. That seems a negation of the purpose of the Committee--to probe the details of what the Government are doing.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion also ignores the fact that the Bill is not yet law. The Low Pay Commission has no statutory existence. It is simply an administrative body--a quango--set up by the Government, with no statutory backing from Parliament. It is, to all intents and purposes, a committee selected by the Government consisting of good men and women and true. But to rest all responsibility on its appointees and say that the Committee should not be discussing the amendments is absurd and undemocratic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> By the same token, although my hon. Friend has referred to the difficulties in which the Low Pay Commission might find itself, does he agree that Ministers will be in an invidious position if the President of the Board of Trade and other Ministers are to rule on these matters against the professional expertise of the Inland Revenue? They, too, may well have an interest, because some of their employees may be caught in the Bill's provisions. So it would be much better to give the job to the Inland Revenue, which in a sense is independent of those concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend raises the further question whether the Inland Revenue is more independent than the Low Pay Commission. Certainly, its statutory powers and duties mean that it can be regarded as having a much wider responsibility than the present non-statutory commission. Clearly, the establishment of the commission, to which the Government have tried to devolve all responsibility for the discussion of details such as those contained in the amendment, is simply an attempt to shuffle off a difficult decision that will land in Ministers' laps anyway.
<P>
I remind the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion that the Low Pay Commission has no power to decide anything. It can only make recommendations to Ministers. All decisions will land in the Secretary of State's lap, and it is the Committee's duty to discuss amendments that would improve the Bill. In that way, Parliament will have had some say in the all-important details. The hon. Gentleman may want Ministers to try to shuffle off their responsibilities, but Conservative Members do not want Parliament to do the same. That is why we have tabled our amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 26 is carefully crafted to remove problems that will hit Ministers further down the line. Any difficulties of definition in the Bill about the application of the minimum wage and the tax treatment of individuals will cause huge problems--for employees, and for the Ministers who have to take decisions. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, who is an expert in such matters, has drafted an amendment that in the long run would make life easier for Ministers.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion did not deal with many of the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. The hon. Gentleman's definition of the amendment was too narrow. It is not solely to do with tipping. There are many benefits in kind: they are not confined to one sector but appear in many industries. Workers in a wide variety of industries will be affected by the clause.
<P>
However, even on the narrow question of tips, I refer the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion to the submission to the Low Pay Commission from the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association. That body devoted a section of its evidence to the problems caused by benefits in kind. It states that the impact of the minimum wage on benefits in kind will depend on the level at which the minimum wage is set, but it also makes the specific point that too high a level will leave most employers in the sector, whose employees receive many benefits in kind, with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``no option but to reduce or remove benefits, so that they might continue to compete with companies not offering benefits.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The submission gives specific examples. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``companies currently operating pension schemes on a final salary basis may change over to money purchase in order to continue to offer a pension scheme. It could be argued that employers be allowed the flexibility to include benefits as part of the NMW calculation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an important consideration, and the Government should take account of it. Employers should be given the flexibility--no doubt to be approved by the Low Pay Commission in each case--to offer employees benefits in kind as part of a remuneration package. In such circumstance, those benefits in kind should be allowed as part of the minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I have been listening to my hon. Friend and it has occurred to me that we might cast just one eye on another category of people for a moment--professional sportsmen, although not those of the great, famous and wealthy rank. They base part of their career calculations on the fact that there will be a benefit towards the end of their career. That has always been part of the package. Does my hon. Friend have a comment to make about that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): The hon. Gentleman means a testimonial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Well, I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull is a long way from a testimonial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> While my hon. Friend is pursuing that thought, may I share with him a thought that I had about redundancy while he was speaking. Testimonial and redundancy are not being directly linked. The Bill is silent on redundancy pay, which is the kind of remuneration that most of us could do without. It kicks in with how the pay reference period might determine proper payment. The Government may wish to consider that, too.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friends and I am happy in this instance--if in no other--to agree with the Minister's wise advice that it is impossible to be too flattering to the occupants of one's Whips' Office. I take on board that message at this early stage in my parliamentary career.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Solihull makes a good point about sports benefits. Those who benefit from them most are clearly those who need them least. From my experience of sitting at cricket grounds, I know that boxes tend to be passed around for test players who earn more than most people in the crowd. Some county cricketers will be on low wages and, at the early stage of their career, when they are not sure whether they will break into the game and make a full-time career of it, they will work at levels at which a minimum wage would kick in.--[Laughter.] I acknowledge that that is a mixed metaphor, perhaps I should say played in. Precisely those sportsmen, however, who are on the margins of professional sport, regard the possibility of a benefit at the end of their career as a basic offering. There is a legitimate argument as to whether such a benefit should be regarded as part of their basic remuneration. That is a particularly vivid example of the problem to which the clause gives rise and which the amendment seeks to overcome.
<P>
People in careers in which they may be made unexpectedly redundant do not, in most cases, regard redundancy payments as part of their basic pay. In the modern world, they are, however, clearly regarded as part of the overall package. As the pay regime across a wide range of industries has become more complex, the idea that there is a clear dividing line between pay, which can be subject to the minimum wage, and benefits in kind, which fall outside it, is increasingly unrealistic. One of the lessons that we have learned elsewhere in the past few years is that what starts at the top of the wages spectrum will filter down. Those who are subject to the minimum wage may find that the increased provision of benefits in kind and the increased complexity of the way in which they are paid to do their work means that the simplistic division between payment for work and benefits in kind no longer applies.
<P>
The interpretation made by the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion of the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was too narrow. I hesitate to continue the motif started by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) about his cleaner. A large part of payments to other people who live in the home, such as live-in nannies, will be made up of a series of privileges that are fairly difficult to define. Obviously, the room is one such privilege because people are given board and lodging and, often, the use of a car. They are also given many ill-defined benefits in kind. From my family's experience of employing a series of nannies over the years, I know that one provides food for them. The amount of food that individual nannies consume is extremely different, I can tell you! Some of them eat a lot more than others.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): My hon. Friend touched on an important point. Does he agree that nannies vary greatly not only in the quantity of food that they consume, but in the quality. That depends on the wealth of their employer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> To an extent, that is true. It is certainly true that the food that nannies prepare for one's children varies from nanny to nanny and that one encourages them to use fresh food.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not want to spoil an enjoyable moment, but I am not sure that the diet of nannies is relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Atkinson. What is relevant is the point that the items that I mentioned are benefits in kind and that it is absurd to try to define individually the ways in which they are provided. Every employer and employee is different. An attempt to write down and place a value on all that would be absurd and ridiculously time-consuming and restrictive, not least for the employee concerned.
<P>
The Government should find an objective basis in the clause on which to devise benefits in kind, and the amendment helps them to do that. Finding such a basis would help them, not least because of the dangers of asymmetry between the tax regime and the minimum wage regime. The Minister has already said that it is impossible to consider those at the same moment because one is about taxing income and the other is about setting a floor. With all due respect, that misses the point. It is precisely the setting of that floor which will have an impact on tax liability. We already have an established regime through the Inland Revenue, which allows us to decide into which category certain types of payment fall. It is, therefore, bizarre and an offence against Occam's razor to try to create a new regime on the basis of the minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that, if the Minister insists on excluding a whole range of benefits in kind from consideration as part of the national minimum wage, her argument that she is concerned about ensuring that there is a floor to wages no longer applies? The overall remuneration of many of the employees concerned will be much higher and should not cause us to worry about a floor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend has elegantly highlighted the general point that what matters to the employee is the overall remuneration package. If a minimum wage intrudes into that, some employers may say, ``If I have to pay you a minimum wage now, which, allegedly, I was not doing before, I'm afraid that I won't be able to afford benefits in kind.'' That removes flexibility, which may be to the employer's advantage. The Government certainly believe that cowboy employers are forever seeking to claw back. It might, however, be to the employee's advantage. He might say, ``If this package is what you can afford, I would rather take it in this way than in a way that removes some of my benefits in kind.'' None of us on the Committee knows--and the Government and the Low Pay Commission cannot know--what the particular mix in the employee's desirable package would be in each individual case. It may be that, in many cases, the minimum wage will have no effect on the overall remuneration package that an employee enjoys, but that it will change the mix in a way that the employee finds damaging. I am not sure whether the Government have considered that aspect of the Bill.
<P>
I wanted to respond to some of the points made by the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion. His argument is Kafkaesque. He maintains that the Government are saying, ``We have no views yet'' or ``We will not tell you what our views are.'' He claims then that they are saying, ``We are waiting for the Low Pay Commission. We have not yet put our submission to it and the Committee cannot discuss the submission because the Low Pay Commission has not yet made a pronouncement.'' That is a circular argument which takes out of the loop of debates on the Bill the Committee and, therefore, Parliament. Thus, the hon. Gentlemen's interpretation of this amendment in particular was not just bizarre but anti-parliamentary.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 85, in page 2, line 22, at end insert `;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(e) excluding any component of remuneration or any period or piece of work as the case may be, in circumstances where their inclusion might distort the calculation of hourly remuneration for the pay reference period.<P>

<P>
This brief and modest amendment is intended to help the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clive Betts </B>(Sheffield, Attercliffe): What about a brief and modest speech?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As the representative of the Patronage Secretary suggests from a sedentary position, it will be a brief and modest speech.
<P>
I noted with interest the remarks of the Minister of State the other day. He said that he did not want the Bill to be discredited and went on to cite the considerations that might be in his mind. I am sure that he and his colleague, the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry, do not want the Bill to work badly, do not want some ridiculous case to subvert it, and do not want it to give them problems of legal compensation or of difficulty in defining the legislation in the future.
<P>
The hon. Lady will know, probably better than me, about the famous Scotch porridge case. It is unfortunate when well-intended legislation, which may carry some consensus, get subverted by something that we have not thought of. I have news for the Committee: I have not thought of cases to which the amendment might apply. If I had, I would have tabled a specific amendment and detailed those cases. However, there may well be times when the regulations could be used to exclude a particular situation that is not prescribed in the comprehensive list of tests in clause 2, and when it might therefore be sensible to leave something out.
<P>
I suspect that in reality, that will not be a matter for the Low Pay Commission's first report, which includes a duty to inform clause 2 as set out in clause 5. It may well apply to cases where the experience of the Bill will lead to some absurdity. The President of the Board of Trade of the day might want to make amending regulations, and might be constrained by the tests that clause 2 prescribes, but might want to put matters right. I do not know what those cases will be. I suppose that at the back of my mind there is the sort of provision that we find in the Army Act 1955, under which something may clearly be wrong or insubordinate, but it is only by referring to the relevant catch-all section of that Act that anything can be done. I say to the Minister merely that cases may occur in which something odd happens. Neither she nor I can anticipate such cases. It would be unfortunate if there was no means of taking them up, and it would discredit her intentions and legislation.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Committee should be clear about what may happen because of the drafting in question. The clause prescribes that regulations may exclude a specific component of remuneration, as the Committee has been discussing, or a period or piece of work in circumstances in which its inclusion may distort calculation of hourly remuneration in respect of the pay reference period.
<P>
I should imagine that it will normally be possible to define general terms that meet the case. Will the Minister consider the issue of individual cases, which involve a strange pattern of remuneration, payment, redundancy or something that we have not thought of? Rather than producing a general provision--which may not be possible--to establish, for example, an area allowance exception, the Minister may wish to propose regulations that contain provisions to leave something out, so that the legislation is not discredited.
<P>
I should say that the Opposition will rightly be jealous of individuals' rights. We are not suggesting in the amendment that a judge should be able to strike down a case--even if it is a small-print case that seems strong in law--just because it seems to distort or subvert. The individual concerned would then win his or her case at an industrial tribunal. The Goverment would have to return to the provisions and relegislate, or amend legislation, to put the matter right.
<P>
Although the Minister gives a comprehensive list in clause 2 with the best of intentions, there may be cases that are not included in those categories. She should, with all humility, concede that such cases may exist. She could make a lot of trouble for herself. The Opposition are trying to help her, and to give her a little more flexibility to avoid such trouble.
<P>
<B>Ann Keen </B>(Brentford and Isleworth): I should like to raise the complicated issue of piece-work rates. Labour Members recognise that those rates have complications. That is why the Government have asked the Low Pay Commission to examine them in depth.
<P>
We could take note of the former wages councils system, which recognised the importance of ensuring that piece workers were not disadvantaged or exploited by receiving piece work rates rather than an hourly rate.
<P>
A wages council examined, for example, clothing machining. Specific reference was made to the way in which piece-work rates should be determined. That involved the employer setting a piece-work rate, which at minimum, allowed an average worker to achieve the hourly rate.
<P>
While such a proviso still has problems, as an understanding of how to define the term ``average'' is necessary, it is none the less important that piece workers are able to compare the rates that they receive with the minimum hourly rate. It is also important to ensure that a worker is entitled to the basic hourly minimum wage rate if their piece-work earnings fail to achieve the equivalent of the minimum wage.
<P>
The wages council covering clothing manufacture also recognised the problem of workers being kept waiting for work when they were on piece work rates. There was therefore a specific regulation that ensured that the minimum hourly rate should be paid for any time spent by a worker waiting for work to be supplied. That is an important safeguard for piece workers.
<P>
It is arguable that paying piece work rates is becoming an increasingly outdated practice and that employers should, for their own benefit as much as for the benefit of workers, move towards paying a basic hourly rate with the possibility of bonuses for workers who exceed the target output.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): With reference to piece-work rates in the textile industry, has the hon. Lady considered taking that further to home workers in the textile industry? She must know how poorly paid some of those people are. Has she considered how piece work rates would be converted into a basic national minimum wage rate for those people?
<P>
<B>Ann Keen:</B> That is exactly what the Low Pay Commission has been asked to look at, and we shall wait to see what it says.
<P>
For as long as piece work remains a feature of payment in some industries, it is essential that minimum wage legislation makes adequate and effective provision for the basic minimum wage to be earned by piece workers. Piece rates should be set at a rate which would enable a worker of average competence to earn a sum equivalent to that obtained by a time worker employed on or above the minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Am I to understand that the hon. Lady is endorsing the view of the National Group on Homeworking? It suggests that the national minimum wage legislation should incorporate a standard piece and time relationship for home workers which would give those who are working at home and on a piece-work basis the national minimum wage for the hours that they work.
<P>
<B>Ann Keen:</B> It is not my role to endorse such a view; it is the role of the Low Paid Commission to report back to us, which is what we are waiting to hear.
<P>
If workers employed on a piece rate or commission fail to earn a sum compatible with the minimum wage, the legal minimum rate should be paid instead. If this scenario recurs, employers should be obliged to review their piece-rate system. If the system works adequately for all but a small minority of employees, employers may have to review the position of the workers in question.
<P>
What we and the trade union movement are saying is that it cannot be in the best interest of industry to plan its economy by paying crude piece rates. If, for example, the clothing industry is to have a positive future, it will have to raise standards and have a very high quality and high value-added production. Shorter production runs might need to be introduced. We will need a highly trained, very flexible work force with national vocational qualifications. Its skills and style should be completely flexible. In that way, we would have to move from crude and sometimes dangerous systems of payment.
<P>
In conclusion, I want to discuss dangerous systems of payment, and bring health and safety issues into the debate. The hon. Member for Daventry spoke this morning of injuries to piece workers' hands and the fact that they may not be able to continue working at the same rate as other workers. When I worked as a sister in the accident unit, I unfortunately witnessed the results of many serious industrial injuries. I recall a man being brought to the unit from his employment in a very suspect van--it was questionable whether it should have even been on the road. I received not only his injured hand, but I received his fingers, separately, from his colleague. Having secured the fingers in a safe position, I then had to discuss things with the patient. That was not an easy sight, nor was it easy to sit with that worker and ask how the accident happened. It was explained that the accident had happened because he could work faster if the guard was not on the machine. That was one of many instances of burns inflicted by an ironing press. Women have been scarred for life because they were working at speed. They cannot plan their budget or look after their families adequately. Piece work is outdated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Lady makes a powerful and sensitive case from her own experience about problems which arise over piece work. I do not disassociate myself from her concerns, but does she agree that taking adequate enforcement action is more important than considering the payment structure? Does she also agree that the matter should be taken up most vigorously by the Health and Safety Executive? I would have no quarrel with that whatever. Those who condone or permit such an unacceptable working practice should be punished.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Much as those remarks are interesting, I remind the Committee that amendment No. 85 is narrowly drawn. I ask hon. Members to keep to the substance of it.
<P>
<B>Ann Keen:</B> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. I am about to conclude. Safety in relation to piece work also involves public safety. For example, meat inspectors, who are topical thanks to the legacy of the previous Government, have to get in the way of workers in abattoirs to protect the British public. It was stated on Radio 4 and reported in daily newspapers that inspectors had said that they were resented because they slowed up workers on piece work.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I welcome the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Brentford and Isleworth (Ann Keen). Her remarks on piece work are relevant to this narrowly drawn amendment. She rightly referred to people's concerns and brought to the debate her considerable knowledge and experience as a senior nursing sister. May I rather belatedly congratulate her? She is, I think, the first nurse to be elected to the House of Commons. Both sides of the Committee will welcome that.
<P>
Having made a point on which I have the Committee's agreement, I move to something less palatable to Conservative Members. I understand the concerns raised by the hon. Member for Daventry, but I hope to persuade him that they are unnecessary. The clause is broadly drawn so that the Government can draft regulations determining the hourly rate to cover a great variety of pay arrangements and working practices. As a result, the Government will be able to include or exclude any components of remuneration--periods of work or pieces of work.
<P>
For example, clause 2(2)(c) provides that the regulations may specify how the hourly rate of remuneration may be calculated in cases where some or all of the wages are paid on a non-time basis--the example of piece work was well illustrated by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentford and Isleworth--or by commission. Further, clause 2(4) enables the regulations to determine what counts as a worker's remuneration to determine the single hourly rate for the purposes of the national minimum wage.
<P>
Similarly, clause 2(5) enables the regulations to determine the periods in respect of which payments are to be treated as being received. That would allow, for example, a single payment such as a bonus to be treated as being received in several periods.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry noted that the amendment does not explain what is meant by the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``might distort the calculation of hourly remuneration for the pay reference period.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is one of the reasons why this well-intentioned probing amendment is fatally flawed. The hon. Gentleman was honest enough to say that he could not specify the circumstances in which the amendment might apply, but I appreciate that he wants to make good law. I hope to persuade the Committee that the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment goes against the tone of the clause, which is drafted broadly to leave options open so that, if necessary, the regulations can cover all manner of remunerations and periods of working time, and how they interrelate. The clause is not prejudicial to either inclusion or exclusion of such components of remunerations or periods of time. In contrast, the amendment focuses solely on exclusion.
<P>
These are complex matters, which is why we have asked the Low Pay Commission to consult widely and to give us its views. The Government look forward to hearing those views. After that, we shall make decisions about the regulations and put them to Parliament for debate. In the meantime, an amendment such as this, which prejudges the component elements of remuneration to be taken into account, is both unnecessary and damaging. I urge the Committee to reject it if it is pressed to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> There has been an interesting series of exchanges, and the intervention from the hon. Member for Brentford and Isleworth was helpful. I confirm that the Opposition have a strong interest in safe working systems. I understand the unease about some aspects of piece work: although I do not think that they should be tackled in this Bill, I have a strong personal interest in ensuring that they are dealt with adequately elsewhere.
<P>
The amendment was tabled as a probing amendment. The hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas) smiles, but it represents a genuine attempt to render the Bill flexible and appropriate. The Opposition are not against giving the Government powers when we think that they are needed.
<P>
On the whole, I am minded to accept the Minister's elegant explanation and not to press the amendment to a Division. However, one issue harks back to the substantive matters raised by the hon. Member for Brentford and Isleworth. All hon. Members worry about employers who behave badly, and especially about those who contrive an artificial situation. In the back of my mind when I tabled the amendment was the way in which the Revenue implements anti-avoidance legislation. In the same way, the Minister's Department may need to look carefully at artificial structures created with the apparent intention of subverting the Bill. For example, it is possible that half a dozen companies could employ someone for different hours of the week and so make a monkey of the regulations to be introduced.
<P>
I suspect that the Minister is probably right. She will have the advice of the Low Pay Commission and, if she acts swiftly enough, she will be able to ensure that the regulations cover such artificial arrangements.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 65, in page 2, line 25, leave out `or work'.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> We are getting to the stage where Labour Members are wont to think that all our amendments are a peg on which to hang a debate, but that is not the case. The purpose of the amendments is to discover the Government's intentions and even if we cannot discover them, to improve the Bill in the process. Strange as it may seem to some Labour Members who have not experienced it, it is possible to improve Bills during their passage through the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is not only a matter of improving the Bill, but of improving prospective regulations which may be issued after the Bill has been enacted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is right, but in this context the purpose of the amendment is to improve the Bill.
<P>
Perhaps I may explain that purpose. It relates to clause 2(5), which provides for regulations to determine what remuneration is to be treated as falling within a given pay reference period. That seems reasonably straightforward. Indeed, in response to the debate on the previous amendment, the Minister clearly stated the aim of subsection (5) when she explained why there was no need for the previous amendment, No. 85, which would have given Ministers appropriate flexibility.
<P>
The provision is intended, for example, to allocate a worker's annual bonus to the pay reference period to which that bonus relates. For example, the relevant pay reference period may be a month, and the bonus may arive at the end of the year, so it can then be attributed back to those 12 pay reference periods. That is fine--the Committee understands that, and I understood it when I read it.
<P>
The notes on clauses under clause 2(5) were equally clear that it was intended to enable regulations to determine
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``how to treat payments received wholly or in part for work done in one period which are received outside the period''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are exactly the circumstances that I described. The other two purposes are, first, to prescribe how to total up pay, allowances and benefits received, in relation to different periods and presumably how to allocate them between given pay reference periods, and secondly--I imagine that this is particularly relevant where allowances or benefits accrue over time--how to treat bonuses received in relation to given pay reference periods. It is by no means the case that pay, benefits or allowances that are attributable to work done in a given month, week or day are necessarily received within the same day, week or month.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Might an example of what my hon. Friend has in mind be a commission payment received by an employee, which is calculated as a percentage of the annual fee received by the company from the client?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, because that is a perfectly good illustration of the purpose of the subsection as it stands.
<P>
When I read the clause and compared it with the notes on clauses, its intention was perfectly clear. One understands that in order to arrive at an hourly rate for the national minimum wage, it is necessary for Ministers to take the power to say that a certain remuneration arises in relation to a particular period and that it can therefore be divided among the hours worked within that period.
<P>
It then occurred to me that perhaps the further language in subsection (5) was designed to allow Ministers to determine how many hours are worked in a given period. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if the Minister responds to the whole debate, but if she wants to interrupt me, I shall be happy to give way because I am trying to understand the drafting of clause 2. I read the clause again and found that subsection (3) does the job, because it allows Ministers to determine what time is counted as working and when someone is and is not working. Thus, the hours worked in the pay reference period can be derived using regulations made under subsection (3).
<P>
We therefore have the components of the calculation of the national minimum wage. Clause 2(3) determines how many hours are worked and which hours should be treated as having been spent working. The pay reference period is separately defined in clause 1, and clause 2(5) is designed to state whether remuneration arises in relation to that period. The calculation is, therefore, perfectly straightforward. As I looked at subsection (5), however, a question began to arise. If that is all true, why is it necessary to say in lines 25 and 26 not only that remuneration is to be apportioned between two or more periods or attributed to a given period, but that work is to be apportioned or attributed?
<P>
At that point, I began to think, ``What is going on here?'' Surely, the calculation concerns remuneration in relation to a given pay reference period. If we have not one moving target, but two and not only remuneration but work is to be allocated, it is difficult to see what the calculation will look like. It was perfectly cosy, on reading the notes on clauses, to understand the purpose of allocating remuneration to a given pay reference period. No instance springs to mind, however, to explain why it is necessary for Ministers to have the power to allocate or apportion work to a period other than that in which it occurs. The Bill's present drafting seems to allow Ministers to say that work did not happen in the period in which it occurred, but at a different time.
<P>
I began to think, ``What is going on here?'' I began to wonder whether, just as annual bonuses might have to be apportioned, there was work that had to be apportioned. The work on the millennium dome, for example, might continue for two or three years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Or more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Or more--depending on which millennium one is aiming at. The work might, however, go on for some time. Do the Government intend to have a power to say that work on such a project can be attributed to given pay reference periods? To be perfectly honest, I am ready to give way to find out. It seemed to me, however, that there was no reason for them to have such a power. Work, even on a big project, which extends over a long period, arises when it arises--that remains fixed. The Bill's purpose is not to allocate work to periods other than that in which it occurs, but to ensure that there is a floor on remuneration for work done in any given period. There cannot be a set of circumstances in which Ministers need to apportion work between or attribute it to periods other than that in which it occurs.
<P>
I had a further thought. It might be necessary to have the reference in clause 2 to which I referred to enable Ministers to determine that work actually occurs in the pay reference period to which it relates. Then, however, I looked through the Bill, as one does, to make sure that I had not missed anything. I go to clause 52(2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Any reference to this Act to a person being remunerated for a pay reference period is a reference to the person being remunerated by his employer in respect of his work in that pay reference period.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So we have even covered that ground--the drafting later in the Bill makes it perfectly clear that work is to be treated as occurring in relation to a specific pay reference period. To cover everything, the following subsection says
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``work includes a reference to performing services''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have got it all covered--the drafting is admirable.
<P>
The notes on clauses that the Minister and the Department have offered the Committee are admirably comprehensive, but they do not explain why references to work occur in the subsections to which I have referred. In the absence of any explanation in the notes on clauses and in the absence of any interpretation as to why that should be necessary, it seemed better to table two amendments that are designed simply to exclude the possibility of Ministers having an excessive and otiose power to allocate work between pay reference periods other than that within which the work occurs.
<P>
The Government put on their belt in an earlier part of the clause; the Minister of State put on his braces. In this provision, the Government are doing perfectly well until we come to the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or the work is done''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
when they wear a piece of string. They do not need braces and string. We can take the string off, as it were. There is no need for the work reference to be there or for the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or the work is done''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to be included as a further qualification to the powers available to Ministers. I cannot envisage the circumstances in which the power would be used. It would therefore be to everyone's advantage if those references were to be deleted.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Gillian Merron </B>(Lincoln): As we heard from the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire, the amendments relate specifically to the ability to determine how to treat payments received wholly or in part for work done in one period which are received outside the period. It is worth repeating what this provision is about. It is crucial to keep the words in, because in my experience, people work and are in paid in a range of different ways. It would be presumptuous of us to think that they fit into neat compartments. That is not my experience. The wording of the clause allows us the capability to accommodate anybody.
<P>
The amendments serve to confuse and, most important, they would remove the link between remuneration and work. We come back to what I believe is the Opposition's preference for a minimum income rather than a minimum wage. That is what is truly behind the amendments. They are not an attempt to improve the effectiveness of the Bill. [Interruption.] It is difficult to decide who to allow to intervene when everyone jumps up at the same time. I will just finish my point and then I will allow an intervention.
<P>
We have seen evidence many times of the Opposition's preference for a minimum income. We discussed tips in previous debates, and the idea of a national minimum gratuities Bill was even mentioned. That, however, is not why we are here.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I think that the hon. Lady attributes to us motives that are far too Machiavellian in proposing the amendment. I am genuinely at a loss to think of a single example in which it would be necessary to attribute work to different periods. My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham has explained and conceded that it will be necessary to attribute remuneration. We accept and understand that, but it is necessary to have some fixed point. Could the hon. Lady given an example of how and where it would be necessary to attribute work to different periods?
<P>
<B>Gillian Merron:</B> Certainly. I thank you for your intervention. I think that perhaps you may have come across--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I did not intervene.
<P>
<B>Gillian Merron:</B> Of course, Mr. Atkinson. I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I have had much experience of the wide range of people's working patterns; some people work two weeks on and two weeks off. I am sure that as our proceedings continue, we shall see examples of such working patterns.
<P>
I believe that Opposition Members want to remove the link between remuneration and work. That is an argument that we have heard many times before. I am reminded of the earlier comments about the alleged skill and dexterity of women workers. It was suggested that women are especially good at tedious and repetitive tasks. That was when I realised why I and my female colleagues are so well suited to the task of being members of this Committee, where we have to listen to tedious, repetitive and painful attempts to extract the core of the Bill.
<P>
The Bill is not only about putting an end to the injustice of low pay. It is also a way of boosting the economy and of getting the best from the relationship between employees and employers.
<P>
In addition, the amendments would limit the capacity and flexibility of the Low Pay Commission to make recommendations. One of the Commission's great strengths is that it is charged with the responsibility of informing the Government about the application of the Bill. Labour Members greatly welcome the commission's independence and breadth of experience, and we commend it for the depth and range of its work.
<P>
I am sorry that Conservative Members find it so difficult to support the Low Pay Commission. It has talked to ordinary people--employers, employees and union representatives--up and down the country and let them have their say. It visited my Lincoln constituency on 16 December and heard evidence from a range of people. In particular, it was told that it was morally repugnant that a private residential care worker should earn only &#163;2.70 an hour. That skilled job helping vulnerable people requires sensitivity and commitment.
<P>
The amendments are really about immobilising the national minimum wage and neutralising the benefits of the independent and flexible Low Pay Commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Gillian Merron:</B> No, I will not. I am not surprised that Conservative Members want to immobilise the national minimum wage. They have little respect for people receiving low pay. They have constantly shown their opposition to the Government's intention of implementing their responsibility to end low pay. Nevertheless, I am disappointed that Conservative Members should want to undermine the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
I should have thought that Conservative Members would welcome flexibility and independence and the way in which the Low Pay Commission listens to business. The CBI has said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Low Pay Commission will need to consider all implications as the level at which the national minimum wage is set is critical.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill will help the commission to achieve that, but the amendments will not. The intention behind them--typical of Conservative Members to kill the spirit of the Bill, but we shall not allow that to happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I richly enjoyed the hon. Lady's contribution but, like all Conservative Members I am thoroughly baffled by it. First, it is not clear why it should have been prepared for the exclusive benefit of the local newspapers in Lincoln and make no attempt to deal with the amendments. Secondly, Conservative Members do not understand the need to canonise the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
The Opposition have made it clear that we do not want to undermine the Bill. The amendments have been tabled to remove an illogicality and to avoid the absurdity of allocating work to a period in which it was not performed or undertaken. The amendments have nothing to do with negating or insulting the work of the Low Pay Commission. We respect the role of the Low Pay Commission, as the debates have made clear. We argue that, to do its work properly, it needs policy guidance--not detailed instruction--from Ministers and, preferably, from the Committee. There is no question of abusing the Low Pay Commission. We were unable to remain silent, but burst out laughing when the hon. Member for Lincoln (Gillian Merron) referred to the desire of Conservative Members to immobilise the Low Pay Commission through the amendment. I do not know what she means by that.
<P>
I conjured up an image in my mind of the preference of Labour Members for a mobile Low Pay Commission considering the appropriateness or otherwise of the allocation of work to periods in which it was not undertaken. I cannot see what, exactly, is a mobile as opposed to an immobile commission. As far as I am aware, it is not an object; it is certainly not a vehicle and does not have the capacity to move or to choose to remain static.
<P>
The issue is the distinction between two clearly distinguishable things: remuneration and work. Remuneration can be attributed to a period in which work was not undertaken. My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshre explained what we mean by that and how it can be understood.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> For the avoidance of doubt, remuneration is most likely to be attributed under the provision in order to bring it into line with work done in a given pay reference period rather than to apportion remuneration to points at which work is not done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is entirely right. I was aided by a helpful sedentary contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, who may wish to come back on his point.
<P>
We are talking about the difference between allocating remuneration for different periods and allocating work. The example given by the hon. Lady did not enlighten us. She referred to people who work two weeks on, two weeks off to justify the retention of the clause's wording. Unfortunately, her example does not make her case.
<P>
Provision is already made in the Bill for a pay reference period and, indeed, for variable pay reference periods. In the case cited by the hon. Lady, it would seem reasonable to allocate payment to a pay reference period of one month. The number of hours worked in that period would qualify the worker for particular remuneration over the monthly period. If she has in mind a different pay reference period, let us hear what it is. We are objecting to the notion that work should be redistributed away from the period in which it is done to a period in which it is not done. Worse, we are objecting to the idea that work that is not being done at all should be attributed to a particular period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend has demolished that example. Can I tempt him to solicit a better example from Labour Members to clarify the genuine confusion over what on earth the provision means?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am most grateful for my hon. Friend's entreaty, because it affords me an opportunity to prove beyond doubt that our motives are pure. Sadly, the Under-Secretary is looking down into her notes. I am most grateful to her for raising her head, albeit only momentarily. I am happy to give way if she will explain--
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Patience, patience.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Minister entreats me to be patient. I was about to listen patiently to her explanation--it might have thrown light upon proceedings. Regrettably, the contribution of the hon. Member for Lincoln did nothing of the kind. I just do not know in what context--her example does not suffice--the wording would be relevant. Curiously, I could understand it if paragraph (a) had said at line 26 ``or any work is done''--that is to say, remuneration could be ascribed to a period regardless of whether any work was done--because it could apply when, for example, a commission payment was paid to an employee for attracting a client without undertaking any work.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
This would not apply to me or, I am sure, to any of my hon. Friends, but an individual could attract a client to a particular company not by undertaking any work but simply on account of nepotism--that is, purely as a result of a family connection that he or she happened to enjoy. The employee, having secured additional business for the company, might then be awarded a commission. No work would have been undertaken--a contact would have simply secured the extra business and, in recognition of that, the employee would receive a commission payment or something of that nature.
<P>
If the wording had been ``is received or any work is done'', it would at least be intelligible--it would still seem a little strange, because the circumstances to which the wording would apply are few and far between, but nevertheless, there would be an arguable case. However, the wording is specifically
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or the work is done''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister explain the context in which that wording will apply? The hon. Member for Lincoln tried, but I politely submit that she failed in the example that she gave. I am not saying that there is no such example, but I want to hear of one.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire provided what otherwise amounts to an extremely comprehensive survey of the issues with reference to various parts of the Bill. He explained that the matter of pay reference periods is already adequately provided for elsewhere, and he pointed out the significance of clause 52, so I cannot for the life of me see why it is necessary for these words to be included.
<P>
The notion that Conservative Members are somehow trying to distort the national minimum wage or prevent it from operating by tabling this modest and helpful amendment is patently absurd. I am in a state of eager anticipation of an explanation from the Minister. There are beads of sweat upon my brow as I await enlightenment from the hon. Lady. Thus, without any further ado and in accordance with what you, Mr. Atkinson, know to be my normal custom of exemplary succinctness, I shall resume my seat in the hope that the Minister will remove her posterior from hers.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> What an extraordinary speech. I grant that it was amusing, though perhaps not in the way that the hon. Member for Buckingham intended, and modest--not in approach, but perhaps in content.
<P>
First, I understand why the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire has tabled amendment No. 65--he wants to know, legitimately, why the Bill contains these words. He said, as was asserted in the previous debate, that the amendments were posed to probe the Government for information and I take them in that spirit.
<P>
As members of the Committee will know, current pay arrangements and working practices are extremely varied. It is therefore essential that clause 2 contains wide, flexible powers. In our recent sittings there has been much interesting debate on the complexities of the United Kingdom labour market. Clause 2 ensures that when we make regulations prescribing how remuneration is to be calculated when determining whether the minimum rate has been paid, the regulations can cater for our highly varied working arrangements and, if we so decide, enable us to implement any recommendations that the Low Pay Commission might make about the treatment of unusual working arrangements. As members of the Committee have said, and as the hon. Member for Buckingham admitted, to give him some credit, such unusual working arrangements may well occur. Clause 2(5)(a) is one of the flexible provisions that is necessary to allow for such arrangements.
<P>
I was interested to hear the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Lincoln, who has wide industrial experience. She has brought the benefit of that experience to the Committee, and her knowledge of some of the unusual arrangements that occur. She also prayed in aid of her own experience the remarks of the CBI, which wants to ensure that the process and the enabling legislation with which the Committee is dealing can provide for regulations to cover every eventuality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Minister's normal and admirable fluency has suddenly been replaced by waffle. She will forgive me for saying that it is not at all clear that she knows of an example that would apply. Instead of groping around inadequately, will she give an example of where the specific words used in the Bill would be necessary and applicable? As I have already explained, the example cited by the hon. Member for Lincoln is not applicable. Provision is quite clearly made for the pay reference period in other parts of the legislation. Work records might have been destroyed? There would then be no evidence of when the work took place, although it might be clear that it had taken place and that remuneration was payable. In such circumstances, would not the Minister in effect have to allocate work between different pay remuneration periods? I seek to help the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Before I deal with that point, I shall deal with the earlier intervention from the hon. Member for Buckingham. I am in an absolute quandary, and do not know how to respond. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was praising or criticising me, or which would be best. I have decided that criticism is better for my street credibility, so perhaps he could go on in the same vein. I will not say that I shall gladly take more interventions--that would get me into bad odour with my whips. If the hon. Gentleman could take the advice that I gave him earlier from a sedentary position, and be a little patient, I may be able to give him some of the examples that he seeks.
<P>
In response to point made by the hon. Member for Daventry, I should say that there are all sorts of possibilities. I did not have the one that he spoke of specifically in mind. By the nature of his question, he underlined the case for flexibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> With respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, I should say that even his example does not apply. It is perfectly possible and appropriate that such circumstances, in which records of when work is done are destroyed, are covered by clause 2(3)(a). Subsection (5) does not determine whether work was done or how it is to be treated, but allows regulations that will apportion or attribute it to a period other than that in which it was done. My hon. Friend, on the other hand, is talking about establishing that it was done in a given period. That is perfectly possible under subsection (3).
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I disagree. The example given by the hon. Member for Daventry, although not one that I have in mind, could be one that flexibility would enable the legislation to cater for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Would the hon. Lady care to suggest any that she has in mind?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am endeavouring to do so, but I want to make a little more progress.
<P>
Clause 2(5)(a) is one of the necessary flexible provisions. It enables the regulations to attribute in part or as a whole the remuneration received for work done in one period to another period or to other periods. That will allow the regulations to attribute annual or quarterly bonuses to weekly or monthly reference pay periods.
<P>
It will also allow some of the work done by certain workers who spend long times at their work stations--a matter of weeks in the case of oil rig workers, for example--to be treated as done during the similarly long periods that they spend away from their work stations. I could pray in aid other examples from seasonal activities such as the work that is done in industries based around the seaside.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, I have given way enough.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> On that point.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No. The amendments would reduce the flexibility of the regulation-making power, so that working time in one period could not be attributed, in part or as whole, to another period.
<P>
I can tell the Committee in all honesty that there may be no need to use that aspect of the regulation-making power, but we cannot assume that now. It would be both undesirable and unwise to remove from the Bill the flexibility that may be needed to deal properly with the wide variety of working arrangements that exist. The Committee has rightly spent a great deal of time discussing unusual working patterns, and Conservative Members have offered some ingenious examples. I do not criticise them for an approach that can be very constructive, but it seems odd that they should table an amendment that would lead to a loss of flexibility.
<P>
I ask the Committee to reject the amendment if it is pressed to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate. The Minister has responded in accordance with the spirit of the amendment, but the essential question concerns the circumstances under which the relevant words in the clause come into play.
<P>
The Minister used an example that resembled the one offered by the hon. Member for Lincoln. She said that some workers work for long hours over a period of, say, a week or two--or even, in the case of oil rig workers, of months at a time--and then go through periods when they do not work at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> If the Secretary of State has the power to apportion both remuneration and work to different periods, does that not mean that she can manipulate those variables to come up with whatever rate of pay she wants?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is right, and the point of principle that he makes is broader than the narrow one that I wanted to make through the amendment. The amendment would make the Bill clearer and remove an unnecessary provision.
<P>
The Minister gave the example of the oil rig worker, who may work three months on and three months off. The national minimum wage can deal with those circumstances in two ways. The first way is to create an artifical set of circumstances under which remuneration and work are both allocated over the two three-month periods. In that way, work comes into line with remuneration: in a notional sense, work is reallocated to create an hourly rate.
<P>
However, there is an alternative, which I confess is what I imagined that the Bill set out to achieve. Under that alternative, the Secretary of State, on the advice of the Low Pay Commission, is able to set whatever pay reference period is felt appropriate. The pay reference period for such a worker would be set at six months. Without any artificiality, notionality, attributions or apportionments, the Secretary of State, in determining the hourly rate, would be able to say, ``This worker has worked for six months--so many hours--within the pay reference period.'' An hourly rate could be derived from that without artificiality.
<P>
The same response applies to the example presented by the hon. Member for Lincoln--two weeks working, two weeks off. The pay reference period is a month. That works with the grain and is a natural calculation that people would understand. For their merit of simplicity, as well as for the spirit in which the amendment was moved, those remarks are in line with the way in which the Bill should be constructed. I still fail to see circumstances in which the Low Pay Commission might recommend that the provision be used in any other way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend may be being too gentle with the provision, particularly in the light of what the hon. Member for Lincoln has said. The hon. Lady was concerned to preserve the good name of the Low Pay Commission; in fact, the rather bizarre and arbitrary powers granted to the Secretary of State will allow her much more easily to ignore the detailed wishes of the commission. Indeed, given the power to change remuneration and hours, she will be able to come up with some bizarre figures. The balance that the clause seeks to strike between the recommendations of the commission and the subsequent powers of the Secretary of State will be affected seriously if she is given too many powers, especially unnecessary ones as in this instance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend makes his own point--I do not need to elaborate. Perhaps he is right that I am being gentle, but I am confining my remarks in such a way to convince the Minister and the hon. Member for Lincoln that the purpose of the amendment is not to immobilise the Low Pay Commission, disrupt the workings of the national minimum wage and put the proverbial spoke in the wheels. As a humble member of the Committee who has read the Bill and the notes on clauses, and tried to relate the two and understand the workings of the national minimum wage for the benefit of debate, I have failed to find an explanation for the provision.
<P>
Having failed to find an explanation, we asked a question. The answer made it clear that the provision is unnecessary. Therefore, the arguments for the amendment stand. Indeed, it would be of great merit if the Minister, notwithstanding her previous remarks, said, ``This is a perfectly good way of doing things throughout the pay reference period. We have no need of the provisions and may introduce a Government amendment to bring about the same effect.''

<P>

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 2, line 31, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(5A) The regulations shall provide for the national wage to be paid for the first 39 hours worked in any working week and for payment for any additional hours worked in any week to be made at a rate not less than one and one half times the national minimum wage.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not intend to speak at great length, but the amendment is important. It is a probing amendment and is designed to discover how the Government intend to treat people who will be entitled in the normal course of events to overtime payments because they work longer than a normal working week. To paraphrase some of the comments in the notes on clauses, and in particular those on clause 2(4)(a), what will count as remuneration for the purpose of the national minimum wage? Should we, for example, include or exclude elements of pay such as overtime pay? Those comments raise more questions than they answer. Is overtime to be considered? If so, when and where?
<P>
It is far from clear whether clause 2 provides scope for workers--particularly home workers--to receive fair and proper payments should they work excessive hours. That comes back to the central concern about measuring piece working in terms of hourly rates and recognising, in terms of payments, that people sometimes work excessive hours during the pay reference period to meet work contracts on piece work. It is by no means clear that the regulations provided for in the Bill will be able to tackle excessive hours. Whether one should use 39 hours or 40 hours as the benchmark is not the issue. The issue is that we should establish that extra hours worked over a normal working week should be treated differently.
<P>
The Bill provides no clarity about how the regulations will treat unsocial hours, night work or weekend work, all of which are invariably paid at flat rate--that is particularly true for home workers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Would not the hon. Gentleman's amendment necessarily entail the pay reference period being one week in every case? Would that not give rise to widespread injustice across the spectrum?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The hon. Gentleman is a little--how can I put this?--
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Correct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> No, one can never be a little correct. The hon. Member for Ashford, who made a comment from a sedentary position, should know that one is either correct or incorrect, but never a little correct. The point that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made is valid and I want to respond to it in a responsible, rather than a churlish manner.
<P>
I want to raise an issue that concerns me and which led me to choose a working week as a reference period. That is not meant to exclude other periods of work; it is merely meant to give us an opportunity to debate how additional hours worked over a reasonable working period can be allowed for in the Bill. That is the essence of the amendment.
<P>
It is important to recognise that at present, as far as I am aware, very few home workers receive additional remuneration or pay, for working excessive hours in any pay reference period but, for the purposes of this example, let us say a working week. It opens up many wider issues, such as the range of different working patterns that can be applied. There is a danger that the Bill could be deficient in addressing these concerns and the protection for home workers who may, as a matter of course, work what most people would consider to be excessive hours. I invite clarification from the Government on this point to set my mind at rest.
<P>
<B>Ms Candy Atherton </B>(Falmouth and Camborne): It seems to be my role in this Committee to point out the muddled thinking of Liberal Democrat Members. The amendment would increase the national minimum wage by 50 per cent. after the first 39 hours of the working week have been completed. That is from a party which argued just last week that regions throughout the country could not afford a basic national minimum wage, let alone one that was an extra 50 per cent. above the rate set.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) spoke last week of the effect of this on a single outlet in Bodmin. He asserted that a minimum wage would have a disproportionate effect on a small business in that town in comparison with, say, Slough. He argued that the effect in Bodmin might be significant, and yet he is arguing here that the minimum wage should be set higher for overtime payments--indeed, not just higher, but half as much again. If the hon. Gentleman was serious in his argument last week, I am at a loss as to how he can argue in favour of such an amendment today. He is the one who would be placing unacceptable burdens on small and medium-sized businesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I have listened to the hon. Lady's remarks with great interest. Can I take it that she does not believe that workers should be entitled to an enhanced rate for working overtime? Can I also take it that she does not believe that home workers, who are exploited in all parts of the country--not just in Bodmin or Slough--should be entitled to some protection? That is what the amendment seeks to explore.
<P>
<B>Ms Atherton:</B> If the hon. Gentleman had allowed me to continue my argument I would have reached the part where I clearly said that this was about the national minimum wage. In industry, whether on a small or large scale, workers, individually or collectively, negotiate an overtime rate which is different from the national minimum wage. We are talking about a basic national minimum rate below which workers' remuneration should not fall.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am following the hon. Lady's argument with interest, but her credulity is unjustified. She is extremely charitable in being so puzzled by the position of the hon. Member for Eastleigh. Surely, after long experience of fighting the Liberal Democrats in her area, she must well and truly realise by now that for them to say one thing one week and something quite different the next is entirely to be expected.
<P>
<B>Ms Atherton:</B> The hon. Gentleman takes the words out of my mouth.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not want to take the words out of the hon. Lady's mouth, but if she continues in this way, she will be out of order.
<P>
<B>Ms Atherton:</B> I accept that, Mr. Atkinson, and I apologise. As I continue with my speech, I will deal with many of the points raised by the hon. Member for Buckingham.
<P>
What of the small employer rushing to get out an order and finding himself or herself faced with half the cost again for a few hours' overtime? Is that not an impediment to business? What would the Low Pay Commission make of that? Would it be inclined to propose a lower rate, thereby negating the whole thrust of the Bill, which is to provide a floor below which employees do not fall and to lift many hundreds of thousands of workers out of poverty pay.
<P>
I have long discovered that the party of the hon. Member for Eastleigh wears several hats. I am sure that Conservative Members, as well as my hon. Friends, will agree that his party faces whichever way is most expedient at any given moment. How many doorsteps have we stood upon, only to hear a concerned voter repeating the policies as expressed by a Liberal Democrat candidate, in direct conflict with the views expressed by the voter next door, who has just met that same candidate?
<P>
The amendment seems to be a case in point. One week Liberal Democrat Members argue that there will be a big effect on the regions and in my area Cornwall and the south-west in particular, and the next week, they are trying to impose on business a fixed overtime rate. The Government's objective is to set a single rate for the national minimum wage. As I said, and as I sure all hon. Members are aware, overtime rates--
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Atherton:</B> No, I have given way two or three times. 
<P>
Overtime rates are negotiated in many industries depending on conditions and the problems that a particular industry faces. The amendment would change that, and the hon. Member for Eastleigh should withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am reminded increasingly of that wonderful scene at the end of ``Casablanca'' where they conclude, ``This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.'' The hon. Lady has entirely convinced me on this matter--I could not agree with her more. I am reminded of my student days.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend would make it clear for the convenience of the Committee that he was not referring to ``A Night in Casablanca'' with the Marx brothers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I was not, though when I reach the amendment of the hon. Member for Eastleigh, I may well want to draw on that analogy.
<P>
I was just about to say that I was reminded of my student days when I much enjoyed debating with the Labour party against the Liberals, as they were then called, because we had just such a mutual problem with them.
<P>
I felt that in tabling his amendment, particularly after his animadversions last week about regional pay, with which I agreed, the hon. Member for Eastleigh was all hat and no trousers, as the Texans would say. I did not find the amendment at all convincing, nor was it very probing. It is precise and prescriptive, in that it suggests a course of action--the Minister for Small Firms is agreeing with me, and I suspect that she will take the same dim view of it.
<P>
I am not inclined to encourage my hon. Friends to support the amendment. Anything that is key to an overtime rate payable after a certain number of hours not only makes the calculation and compliance with the national minimum wage increasingly difficult--a point that has already been well made--but can also give rise to inequity depending on the length of time that people normally work. Members of the Committee should remember--my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire has made this point--that plenty of people's overtime rates may be degressive rather than progressive. We need not debate that now, but junior doctors are an example, because they are effectively paid a salary plus a little bit when they work excessive hours.
<P>
The proposal would not be at all easy to administer. I argued in relation to the structure of the national minimum wage that changes at the margin are hugely important to the economic viability of the national minimum wage and to its likely incidence. If we take from the research paper that I quoted earlier the cells--to use the economists' phrase--of all persons employed at &#163;3 an hour, we see that 7 per cent. of people are currently in that category. If one uplifts that rate by 50 per cent. to &#163;4.50, 28 per cent. of persons are so involved. Whatever sums one does, any attempt to uplift overtime pay by anything like the scale that the hon. Gentleman suggests would have the most alarming economic consequences.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Unfortunately, I missed a small segment of the speech of the hon. Member for Eastleigh. Therefore, I may have missed the enlightenment in it. Does my hon. Friend think that Liberal Members should be obliged to say what the increase in the public sector pay bill would be as a result of their proposal? If they are unwilling to do so, would it be beyond the wit of the Conservative research department to do it for them?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I would invite the hon. Gentleman not to go down that course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sure that we could, Mr. Atkinson, but I am equally sure that we should not, though this is not a trivial or technical amendment. It goes to the essence of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The amendment focuses on hours in the working week. The assumption is that we are talking about hourly-paid or piece workers. Is not it a considerable danger that in dealing with minimum-wage-and-a-half payments and then considering those who are salaried but working long hours, the amendment could bring into the scope of the Bill a large number of salaried people who were never intended to be affected by it?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has anticipated what I was about to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Yes. That is another reason why it would not wash. I firmly advocate that the Committee reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alasdair Morgan </B>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale): It is not up to me to say whether the amendment is probing, but I am interested in the Government's views on the matter, which is clearly serious. I shall try to avoid party political strife in the west of England, but it is clear that there are problems with the amendment. It deals with only a one-week pay reference period, but does not cater for shift patterns used by workers in the health service or offshore workers, who can work one week on, one week off or two weeks on, two weeks off. They do not often use a three months on, three months off pattern, which was referred to earlier.
<P>
In my constituency, workers in the agriculture industry use varying patterns. The hon. Member for Daventry referred to the industry a while ago, but time passes so quickly when I am enjoying myself. There are seasonal problems with that industry. Long hours are worked in summer and autumn, but relatively short hours are worked in winter.
<P>
A principle is involved with the amendment. Some of us think that there should be a limit to the hours--I accept that there could be argument over whether it should be 39--worked in a week. If that week is averaged over whatever period is thought suitable, there should be some limit to the number of hours worked unless there is appropriate enhancement to remuneration once that limit is passed.
<P>
Security guards have been referred to in previous debates, as have home workers. Those jobs have two characteristics: the low basic rate of pay per hour--I accept that the Bill addresses that problem--and the excessively long working week, which is a problem common to all such jobs. In the case of a security guard, excessive hours are worked not on a shift pattern, but week in, week out. We should address that problem.
<P>
The minimum wage may increase the bargaining power of certain categories of people in industry. They will take home more basic pay for a basic working week, but that power is exaggerated, as the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton) noted. They may still be forced to take jobs with lengthy working weeks simply to get an adequate income or to get a job at all.
<P>
We often exaggerate the options to many people. Those who can only get jobs entailing excessive working hours need some protection. I hope that the Minister will suggest a way in which that problem can be tackled.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> This has been a fascinating debate. When I heard the contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne and the helpful intervention from the hon. Member for Buckingham I was tempted, given the waves of appreciation from the Committee, to say, ``Play it again, Sam.'' However, that would have been a bad joke.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> It is not that bad.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> It is not that bad for 7.25 pm, as the hon. Member for Solihull was kind enough to remark, but it is not that good either.
<P>
The amendment would require workers to be paid at least one and half times the rate set for the national minimum wage in respect of all hours worked in excess of 39 in any working week. I remind the hon. Member for Eastleigh--who tabled the amendment to probe the Government and to bring the issue to the fore--that the Bill's purpose is to set a single rate for a national minimum wage, below which a worker's pay must not fall. That will provide a floor for wages that will prevent employers abusing workers by paying poverty wages for the hours that they work.
<P>
The amendment would conflict with that purpose by establishing a second rate in the form of a higher overtime rate. Its stipulation of 39 hours as the point at which the overtime rate becomes payable is entirely arbitrary.
<P>
The Bill is not about setting a separate rate for overtime. If employers and workers agree that there should be overtime, they are free to decide its extent and the rate of pay for it, provided that that rate is at least that of the national minimum.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, I will not give way.
<P>
I understand the point that is being made, but I hope that my explanation has persuaded the hon. Member for Eastleigh to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's remarks. I take comfort from the fact that, after nearly three weeks of Committee debate, I alone have managed to unite Government and Opposition. I have also enjoyed the humour that has been bandied around the Room, but I wish to put on record that, although I rarely wear a hat, in Texas or anywhere else, I am nearly always wearing my trousers.
<P>
I am glad that the Minister took the amendment seriously, and appreciate her considered and sensible response. We need to decide how best to speak for those who work at home, outside a regular working environment. I take some comfort from the Minister's words and do not wish to press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
