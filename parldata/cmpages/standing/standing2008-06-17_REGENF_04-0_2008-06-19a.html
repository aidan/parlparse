Practice&#151;</i></div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;Where any
local authority has been granted powers under Part 3 of this Act, the
LBRO shall have the duty or reviewing and, if appropriate, certifying
every three years whether local authorities are compliant with the
provisions of any Code issued under Section 22 of the Legislative and
Regulatory Reform Act
2006.&#146;.</div><a name="08061984000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061984000278"></a><b class="B">Lorely
Burt</b> (Solihull) (LD): I was mid-sentence before we broke
for lunch, Mr. Chope. We were talking about new clause 3,
and I was asking whether it would be helpful, when you quite rightly
said, &#147;Order, order&#148;. I was going to ask whether it would
be helpful in ensuring that local authorities comply with the Hampton
principles and continue to comply with them where they have had a track
record of non-compliance.</div>
<a name="08061984000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000279"></a>The
Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs (Mr.
Pat McFadden):</b> The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford
said that I might, in responding to the debate, end up pointing him to
another part of the Bill that covered some of the issues before us, and
he is correct. I point him to clause 60(1)(c), which says that the
relevant authority&#151;as we have said, that will be a
Minister&#151;must consult</div>
<a name="08061984000236"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such other
persons as the relevant authority considers
appropriate.&#148;</div><a name="08061984000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also point him to the guide to the Bill, which we have published and
distributed. Page 28
says:</div><a name="08061984000237"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
local authority regulators the Government will look to LBRO for advice
on whether, in a particular regulatory field, local authorities in
general are Hampton compliant.&#148;</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div><a name="08061984000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
therefore drawn attention to the issue not only under the general duty
on consultation elsewhere in the Bill, but in the guide, and that
covers one part of what the amendment is intended to do. As the guide
makes clear, a Minister who intends to award the new sanctioning powers
will look to the Local Better Regulation Office for advice.</div>
<a name="08061984000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want,
however, to raise a point about the second part of the amendment.
Clause 66 says that a Minister can award the powers in the Bill to
regulators if he or she is satisfied that the regulator will exercise
them in accordance with the principles of good regulation, which we
have discussed several times. However, new subsection (3) in
amendment No. 45 could give local authorities a year&#146;s grace, in
that they could use the sanctions without complying with the principles
of good regulation until the end of that year.</div>
<a name="08061984000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government would have a problem with that because authorities that are
not Hampton-compliant could be given the powers in the Bill on the
basis of a projection that they might be compliant some time in the
next year. There is also the question of what would happen in a
year&#146;s time if that judgment proved not to be well-founded.
Authorities could have been exercising the powers for a year but might
still not be Hampton-compliant. That could create a difficulty. Would
the powers automatically lapse? The amendment is silent on that. That
could create some uncertainty for regulators and business.</div>
<a name="08061984000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am slightly
surprised by new clause 3 because it would vastly expand LBRO&#146;s
functions. As we have discussed, LBRO will have a relatively modest
budget and be relatively modest in size. The new clause would ask LBRO
to review all 450 or so local authorities every three years. That would
be a significant undertaking and would require a big increase in
resources, but there is another reason why it goes against the grain of
where we are trying to go with regulatory principles. We discussed
risk-based approaches to regulation the other day, and we also know
that within local authorities&#151;but not only local
authorities&#151;there are concerns about the amount of routine,
tick-box audit and inspection. A requirement that is not risk-based but
includes all local authorities, every three years, would be pulling in
a different direction from where we are going more generally with audit
and inspection policy.</div>
<a name="08061984000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 67
requires the Minister who makes the order that gives local authorities
and other regulators access to the new powers to undertake a one-off,
post-implementation review three years after it comes into effect. That
is sensible. A measure that made that happen to every local authority
every three years would be going too far. For those reasons, we do not
want to accept new clause 3.</div>
<a name="08061984000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the review
mechanism in the Bill, the Minister would have to consult such persons
as he considers appropriate. When local authorities have been given the
powers, the Minister would be expected to consult LBRO. There is also
an issue with a different requirement on the compliance code from
elsewhere in the Bill. Local authorities will have to &#147;have
regard to&#148; the compliance code when carrying out their
enforcement activity, including the use of part 3 powers. However, new
clause 3 would mean that</div>
<a name="08061984000238"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;local
authorities are compliant with the provisions of any
Code&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 107</div><a name="08061984000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">We spoke about
conflicting requirements on local authorities when we spoke to a
previous amendment. &#147;Have regard to&#148; is the amendment
that is set down on the compliance code. There are a few grounds on
which I hope new clause 3 and amendment No. 45 are not pressed to a
Division.</div>
<a name="08061984000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford is trying to keep those
things under review, but the proposals might be only a blunt instrument
in that regard and, as I said, they would pull us away from the more
risk-based approach that we are pursuing.</div>
<a name="08061984000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061984000280"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Prisk</b> (Hertford and Stortford) (Con): It has been a
useful debate. Amendment No. 45 was not entirely dealt with in the
Minister&#146;s response. He said that part of the guidance that
comes with the Bill talks about compliance in general. However, we are
not concerned with the general but specifically with the local
authority and whether it is truly compliant with the principles on
which the Bill is based. I am therefore not entirely convinced by what
the Minister said.</div>
<a name="08061984000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise
and accept that amendment No. 45 would be unduly burdensome as a
regulatory cost. I shall come back to that in a moment.</div>
<a name="08061984000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">On new clause
3, when we go back to the Macrory principles&#151;I was reading them
again yesterday to clarify them in my own mind&#151;we will see that
there is a good argument for saying that if we are going to have an
established set of principles on how regulators operate, it is
important to ensure that they operate on a consistent basis and not
just on a snapshot. There is an entirely legitimate argument that the
new clause would give the LBRO a significant and increased function to
perform, but that does not outweigh the importance of ensuring that the
local regulatory bodies are consistently compliant, and that they
therefore fit with what Macrory says. After all, we are talking about a
three-year period, and as we know, local authorities vary in their
performance over a year, let alone three. We are simply seeking to
ensure that the LBRO has the ability to investigate. How it seeks to do
so&#151;perhaps by a detailed inspection&#151;is not specified;
rather, it would give the LBRO the opportunity to ensure that
authorities are consistently compliant.</div>
<a name="08061984000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000281"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> May I clarify something that the hon. Gentleman
said? We are not talking about specific local authorities, but the
capacity of local authorities in general to exercise powers in a
regulatory field. We do not want some local authorities to be able to
exercise them, and others not. I hope that he takes the point about the
difference between local authorities exercising the powers in a
regulatory field&#151;for example, trading standards&#151;and
individual councils in different parts of the
country.</div><a name="08061984000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000282"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> That is entirely reasonable. I think that the
Minister has highlighted the Government&#146;s intentions. At the
beginning of the debate, I said that I wanted to deal with the
amendment and new clause 3 separately. If acceptable, I shall withdraw
the amendment and, at the appropriate moment, press the new clause to a
Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08061984000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000283"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I welcome the clause. The Minister referred to the
fact that after three years there will be a review, which my party, in
another place, was able to establish as a very important part of what
will be a new regulatory environment. It is important to put that on
the record. In particular, it is worth the Committee noting that there
is not only a three-year review period, but a requirement to publish
the outcome and lay it before the House. We welcome those important
aspects of the
Bill.</div><a name="08061984000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000284"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The clause provides that where a Minister has
made an order conferring sanctioning powers on a regulator, they may
direct it not to impose further sanctions. Subsection (2) provides that
the Minister may take such action only if there is evidence that the
regulator has failed</div>
<a name="08061984000239"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on more than
one
occasion&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08061984000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">an
important point&#151;to comply with a duty imposed on it. We are not
trying to set up a new regulatory regime, as the hon. Member for
Hertford and Stortford just said in relation to the previous clause,
that could simply be withdrawn if there is a failure on just one
occasion. There is a tone of persistence about the suspension clause
that I want to impress on the Committee.</div>
<a name="08061984000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
provides, therefore, that such a direction could be made only where
there is evidence that the regulator has failed more than once to
comply with a duty imposed on it under part 3 of the Bill, or to act in
accordance with its penalty guidance, enforcement policy or relevant
principles of regulatory best practice. Subsection (3) provides that a
Minister may revoke a direction suspending a regulator&#146;s
sanctioning powers</div>
<a name="08061984000240"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if satisfied
that the regulator has taken the appropriate steps to remedy the
failure&#148;.</div><a name="08061984000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
the clause ensures transparency, and subsection (4) requires the
Minister to consult before making a direction to suspend the powers or
revoke such a direction. As the hon. Gentleman said earlier, the Bill
allows regulators access to a range of important new powers. We talked
this morning about stop notices, which could be particularly
significant. Businesses and others subject to the powers in the Bill
need assurances that regulators will use the sanctioning powers
responsibly and consistently. The clause contains safeguards,
therefore, by providing for a power to suspend their use, if that is
not the
case.</div><a name="08061984000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000285"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The clause is about the payment of penalties.
Again, we touch on previous debates; we have often mentioned the
analogy of parking, imperfect though it is. The accusation is sometimes
made that parking fines are used as a revenue-raising mechanism. The
clause makes it clear that money received through the issue of a fixed
or variable penalty, including late payments or interest charges, must
be paid into the relevant Consolidated Fund. Subsection (2) defines
those funds.</div>
<a name="08061984000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Professor
Macrory recommended that there should be no perverse financial
incentive for regulators to favour a particular sanction. In our
discussions about the various new powers available to regulators under
the Bill, I have said several times that we are trying to avoid
perverse incentives to use one route rather than another. The payment
of penalties into the Consolidated Fund is important. The clause
ensures that and acts as a safeguard against the kind of incentives
that we want to avoid.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000286"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I wonder whether I might test the Minister. I
allude to a debate initiated by the hon. Member for Stafford. How
confident is the Minister that the clause is secure from legal
challenge? I think not only of the Data Protection Act 1998 or the
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 but of human rights
legislation. I know that Ministers always have to sign such things off,
and it would be helpful to know how confident he is about
that.</div>
<a name="08061984000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would he also
tell us how confident the public can be that the disclosure of
information by the criminal justice system to the regulators enabled
under the clause will at all times be appropriate, confidential and
secure? We are all aware of recent mishaps with various forms of
data&#151;I am sure that the Minister has his laptop firmly attached,
unlike a Cabinet Minister recently. The loss of 25 million benefit
records and the dreadful and unfortunate errors with other data concern
people, so it is important that the public can be confident that these
matters will be handled in an appropriate and confidential
way.</div>
<a name="08061984000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000287"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> This is a gateway clause that allows the passing
of information from the criminal justice system to regulators. It is
necessary because those who work in the criminal justice system may
come across breaches that are properly dealt with by the kind of civil
penalties provided for under the Bill. The clause allows 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>them to pass information about those breaches or potential breaches to
the relevant regulator. Such gateway clauses are not unprecedented. For
example, the Enterprise Act 2002 has a similar provision.
When making an order under part 3, the Minister concerned will assess
the situation to ensure, as far as is possible in the circumstances,
that it is compliant with the European convention on human
rights.</div>
<a name="08061984000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it helps
the Committee, I have some more facts about the clause. Information may
be disclosed only if the regulator has an enforcement function in
relation to a criminal offence, and for the purposes of the regulator
exercising one of the new powers. Subsection (2) provides that the
information that can be disclosed could include information collected
before this provision comes into force. Subsection (3) provides that
disclosure of information is</div>

subsection (4) does not authorise the sharing of information in

<a name="08061984000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally, it
is also in the public&#146;s interest for breaches of the law in the

to the wider purpose of the Bill and part 3 in particular, that purpose
is to give regulators a new suite of powers in order to regulate more
effectively than they can at present with the one-club option of
criminal prosecution. It seems correct to allow for the passing of
information from the people concerned with one route, the criminal
justice system, to those who, by virtue of the Bill, will be
responsible for enforcing the new civil penalties. Information powers
should always be treated with care, but clause 70 gives the regulatory
system an advantage in ensuring that where there are breaches, the
information goes to those who are responsible for enforcing the law and
gives them the information necessary to do so.</div>

not to impose or maintain unnecessary burdens</div>

Bill.</div><a name="08061984000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000288"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The clause brings us to part 4 of the Bill. To
use a lay term, I would summarise part 4 by saying that it is related
to an aspect of the job description of regulators. This part of the
Bill was significantly improved as a result of discussion and amendment
in the other place and it gives us two important clauses, beginning
with clause 72. I am sure that we would all agree that part of the job
description of regulators&#151;not the whole of it&#151;should be,
as the clause states, that they exercise their functions in a manner
that does not impose unnecessary burdens or maintain burdens that the
regulator considers to have become unnecessary. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>The point about the regulator making the judgment is one of the changes
that have been made as we have moved along the line in debating the
clause.</div>
<a name="08061984000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">In overview,
the clause is about helping to ensure that regulators do not impose or
maintain unnecessary burdens. Subsection (2) provides that where the
duty has been imposed, unnecessary burdens need not be removed where it
would be impracticable or disproportionate to do so. The sense of
proportion is important because it is something that has been added. We
could find a situation where a burden had been identified by a
regulator as being unnecessary but the act of removing it would be
completely disproportionate to the burden that it was placing on the
regulated bodies. Subsection (2) allows that question of proportion to
be taken into account.</div>
<a name="08061984000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">In following
this duty, the Government do not intend that regulators should divert
resources from their core functions in a way that compromises their
effectiveness. As I said, this is part of the job description of
regulators; it is not in any sense the whole job description. In
considering unnecessary burdens, we expect that regulators should be
able to target their resources more effectively, therefore enhancing
regulatory outcomes. Subsections (3) to (6) require a regulator to whom
the duty has been applied to publish a statement as soon as is
reasonably practicable, setting out what they propose to do in the
following 12 months. Statements must then be published annually, so the
clause asks regulators to keep a constant eye on the question of
unnecessary burdens. That is important because in the regulatory field
we often talk about the need for a culture change, and the provision
whereby the issue will be considered annually is intended to embed that
approach.</div><a name="08061984000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000289"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> In the light of the duty and the knowledge that the
Government intend to establish regulatory budgets, how does the
Minister see the two policies interweaving? I can see a connection, but
it would be helpful to understand how that will work. There is a new
duty not to have unnecessary burdens, and he has just spoken about
wanting to encourage regulators to use their resources appropriately.
How does that fit into a regulatory budget
environment?</div><a name="08061984000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000290"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to suggest that
regulatory budgets are much discussed and have significant potential in
this field. They will focus people&#146;s minds not only on what is
coming in, but on what could be taken out. I think that that would help
in a regulatory budget environment, because there would be a duty on
regulators constantly to have an eye on the stock, as it were, as well
as the flow. I do not see a contradiction between the two elements; in
fact, I think that they go well
together.</div><a name="08061984000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
power is an important addition to the suite of provisions that are
designed to embed this agenda within the group of regulators operating
in this country. I stress that it is not new or unheard of; it is
similar to the duty in the Communications Act 2003 that requires Ofcom
to keep its functions under review, with a view to ensuring that
unnecessary burdens are not imposed or
maintained.</div><a name="08061984000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause also provides an avenue for implementing the recommendation by
the House of Lords Select Committee on Regulators in its recent report,
&#147;UK Economic Regulators&#148;, that</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div><a name="08061984000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;economic
regulators be statutorily required to facilitate the competitiveness of
UK firms by...removing regulatory burdens from firms wherever
possible.&#148;</div><a name="08061984000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is in line with that
recommendation.</div><a name="08061984000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000291"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I welcome the Minister&#146;s remarks. Indeed, I
welcome what is in effect a new duty to keep the regulatory function
under review and for regulators of the various hues that we have been
considering under this legislation not to impose an unnecessary
regulatory burden. It is fair to say that the clause has changed quite
remarkably from the original drafts that I saw in early forms of the
Bill that were considered in the other place. I commend the other place
for the work that it
did.</div><a name="08061984000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also welcome the recognition of the need to remove such burdens, which
is noted in subsection (2). However, I note that the regulator, whoever
that may be in any circumstance, will still be left to decide, first,
what is or is not, in their view, burdensome, and secondly, whether its
removal would be impracticable or disproportionate. The requirement to
publish an explanatory statement is fine in itself, but I am
disappointed that notably lacking is a clear statement, a
requirement&#151;I did not hear this in the Minister&#146;s
remarks&#151;for direct consultation and/or involvement of business
in determining whether a regulatory burden is
unnecessary.</div><a name="08061984000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a missed opportunity, if I may say so. I hope that the Minister will
correct that in replying to the debate. I suspect that to rely on
regulators regulating themselves is not likely to deliver the
significant change that we would all like in this area. Understandably,
given the general circumstances politically, Ministers are talking a
great deal about wanting to listen to business and to reduce the
regulatory burden&#151;heaven knows, with the state of the economy,
that is long overdue&#151;yet they have missed this opportunity to do
so. Often it is the regulated, not the regulator, who is best able to
judge what is an unnecessary or disproportionate burden. The Minister
will probably retort that, by using the Hampton principles, here
embedded in the Bill, the regulators will be able to make that
assessment. However, to fail to enable business to affect the decisions
is a serious
omission.</div><a name="08061984000252"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="08061984000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am particularly concerned for small businesses. Both sides of the House
agree that regulations have a disproportionate impact on the smallest
businesses. The Federation of Small Businesses tells us that the
average small business spends seven hours a week complying with
Government red tape and regulation. Given that there are 4.4 million
small businesses in the UK, that is an extraordinary waste of what
could be highly productive
time.</div><a name="08061984000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061984000292"></a><b class="B">Judy
Mallaber</b> (Amber Valley) (Lab): Does the hon. Gentleman
agree that if we consult businesses, which is what I think he is
suggesting, we have to be careful that the business does not put
forward as unnecessary regulation something that is a regulation for a
good purpose? Something that may seem a burden on a business could have
a proper protective or administrative purpose. I have difficulty seeing
why we should just leave it to that business. We must also be careful
that we do not start to put too much burden of regulation on the
regulator, otherwise we will find ourselves with mirrors on
mirrors&#151;potentially more administrative
burdens.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div><a name="08061984000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000293"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I understand the hon. Lady&#146;s point. She is
right that it would not be appropriate for the regulated to decide what
regulations there should be. My concern is that the regulated, rather
than the regulator, should be able to be involved&#151;indeed,
expressly&#151;in looking at where the problems are. They should be
able to say, &#147;We are having a real problem with this particular
regulation.&#148; It should be expressly stated. That, I think, is
the omission.</div>
<a name="08061984000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
is right that the decision must inevitably rest with the regulator. My
concern is about the omission of an explicit mechanism or trigger to
ensure that business understands that it has a part to play in an
important duty being put forward by the Government. Perhaps such a
provision will be set out in response to the debate, in the statements
that the Minister may be writing as we speak. Can he tell us what
consideration he and his officials have given to the inclusion in the
clause of a provision that the regulators should respond to business
concerns about regulation? What considerations have they made? Has the
Minister held any meetings with the business community, to discuss the
clause and how business might aid the process of rooting out
unnecessary
burdens?</div><a name="08061984000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members
of the Committee will be familiar&#151;I know you are, Mr.
Chope&#151;with the British Chambers of Commerce burdens barometer.
We could debate the strengths and weaknesses of any methodology of
judging, but the British Chambers of Commerce is well placed to do
so.</div><a name="08061984000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000294"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that many people
think that the business barometer is absolute nonsense and makes no
sense whatever? That view was expressed to the Regulatory Reform
Committee, of which I am a member, by many organisations. The barometer
is not a tool that has a great deal of
respect.</div><a name="08061984000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000295"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I am sure that is the hon. Lady&#146;s view, but
I suspect that it is not the view of the British Chambers of Commerce.
It is not my view. It is important that we have a clear, itemised list
of what the burden of regulation is. The barometer has shown that the
burden of regulation has increased by &#163;65 billion over the past
11 years&#151; &#163;10 billion in the past 12
months&#151;so there is clearly a problem. We can argue over one item
or another, but the principle is the
same.</div><a name="08061984000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
conclude, why does the clause not reflect the clear interest and
concerns of business? Why is there no guidance from the Minister to
show that business can participate, and is welcome to do so, in trying
to identify unnecessary burdens of regulation? I hope that his response
will lift the cloud of uncertainty and demonstrate that business has a
part to play. I look forward with eager anticipation to his
remarks.</div><a name="08061984000097"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000296"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I find part 4 somewhat confusing. It was not
originally part of the Bill, and seems to have been tagged on at the
end without any consultation&#151;indeed, after the consultation
period. I wonder if that is reflected in some of the potential for
duplication we have seen. Although I accept that it is vital that not
one unnecessary burden is imposed on business, I am almost tempted to
wonder why this part is necessary. What is it saying that is not
implied or embedded elsewhere in the Bill? Is the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>duty not to impose unnecessary regulatory burdens so good and so
important that&#151;a bit like &#147;New York, New
York&#148;&#151;it has to be said
twice?</div><a name="08061984000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to the comments of the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford
about mechanisms and how the system would work, other than what exists,
what would this part of the Bill impose on LBROs or others to fulfil
the requirement not to impose unnecessary regulatory burdens? The
Government have set the target of a 25 per cent. reduction
in unnecessary burdens by 2012, but they have achieved only 6 per cent.
so far, so I am sure that additional help would be extremely welcome.
However, what do these provisions bring to the
Bill?</div>
<a name="08061984000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000297"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford asked
about a few matters on which I hope to give him some satisfaction. He
asked about business input into the level of burdens or whether burdens
can be removed. As the hon. Member for Solihull said, the Government
have a specific target to meet.</div>
<a name="08061984000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall come
to the burdens barometer of the British Chambers of Commerce in a
moment, but to rewind on the Government&#146;s position, several
years ago, we set about the task of measuring the administrative burden
on UK business and setting a target to reduce it. The job description
for regulators has become part of the job description for Whitehall
Departments. Each year, simplification plans are produced. The hon.
Lady referred to them and I confirm that so far we are on track to meet
them, although I cannot predict the future with certainty&#151;no one
can. However, the plans involve a serious exercise that has focused
minds in Whitehall. We talked a moment ago about regulatory budgets.
The duty is not a regulatory budget, but it is related in the sense
that it asks Departments to think about the overall impact of what they
do and the stock that is focused on, and to find ways of simplifying
and easing matters for
business.</div><a name="08061984000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford asked about business input. I
refer him and other hon. Members to the website,
www.betterregulation.gov.uk. If he or a business feel that a particular
regulation has become outdated or unnecessary, they can ask for it to
be looked at to see if it can be removed. That action would not be
giving the business a promise that the regulation would disappear like
a puff of smoke, but it would force the Department to consider the
matter. There is certainly capacity in the overall regulatory set-up
for business voices to be
heard.</div><a name="08061984000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000298"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> There may indeed be existing channels, but there is
no requirement related to the clause by which the regulators shall
specifically talk to or involve the business community. Can the
Minister confirm
that?</div><a name="08061984000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000299"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> At the end, the clause confirms that the
regulator will carry out that judgment. We have covered a couple of
times in our debates on the Bill the matter of whether it can be
entirely down to the regulated to make that judgment. I am sure that,
as part of the annual process that we are setting out in the clause,
any sensible regulator will discuss the regulatory burdens with those
on whom those burdens are imposed. If a business feels that a regulator
is interpreting policies in a way that imposes unnecessary burdens, it
is entitled to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div>raise the matter with the regulator. An annual review will help to
promote that kind of dialogue between regulators and business. However,
I do not see a need to write that into the legislation: I think the
review will result in
that.</div><a name="08061984000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I want to take the hon. Gentleman up on the British Chambers of
Commerce survey, which has been cited a lot in our debates. We have not
had too much party divide during our deliberations on the Bill, but the
Government would see some of the things that have been cited as burdens
in the BCC list not as burdens but as marks of a civilised society and
an economy with proper rules. Instances in the list refer to disabled
access to public transport, but I do not see that as a burden on
business.</div>
<a name="08061984000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000300"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that the problem with
the barometer is that it mixes up a burden with a legitimate policy
objective that can be discussed and argued about? It does not confine
itself to genuinely administrative areas, such as when one of the
objectives is not being implemented in the most sensible way to avoid a
burden on business. For example, an objective could require someone to
fill out three forms, when one or none would do. That is what the
barometer should be identifying, as is the case with a number of the
European countries that the Regulatory Reform Committee visited within
the last couple of
weeks.</div><a name="08061984000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000301"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. There is a
completely legitimate discussion to be had, and a legitimate case to be
made, about the administrative burdens of the total sum of regulation.
However, given the way that the Government have set up their review,
that would be a separate discussion from policy outcomes. My hon.
Friend&#146;s description of the BCC list is absolutely right,
because it mixes up the two things. We can probably all have an
argument about one person&#146;s burden being another person&#146;s
legitimate policy outcome, but in my view that is the weakness in the
BCC list.</div>
<a name="08061984000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">What do we
mean when we talk about unnecessary burdens? They are burdens that are
disproportionate to the regulator&#146;s policy objective; in other
words, they go further than is necessary to achieve the objective. They
are targeted at situations where action is not required to achieve that
objective, or are imposed in circumstances in which it would be
possible to achieve the outcome in a less burdensome
way.</div><a name="08061984000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not trying to set up a duty that interferes with the operational
independence of the regulators; we are talking about the way in which
they carry out those functions. That is why part 4 is a useful part of
the Bill.

way.</div><a name="08061984000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000304"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I shall intervene only briefly, and I will not
stretch your patience, Mr. Chope, with an in-depth
exposition of the British Chambers of Commerce barometer, except to
say&#151;in response to the Minister&#146;s comment&#151;that
where a cost is incurred on, for example, the pay roll of a business,
it is legitimate for that to be noted as a cost, however legitimate the
policy may be.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div><a name="08061984000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">My question to
the Minister goes to the heart of the debate. If it is not explicit in
the clause, will he join me in urging business that where they identify
unnecessary burdens, with this new duty in place, they should make
their concerns directly known to the regulators involved, so that there
can be a genuine partnership in the process? Does he share that view?
Will he join me in making that encouragement to the business
community?</div><a name="08061984000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000305"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Let me put it in my own way. First, there are
existing avenues, as I have discussed, as well as a serious Government
process to reduce administrative burdens, in which business has a
completely legitimate voice. Secondly, the duty in clause 72 for an
annual review of unnecessary burdens will entail regulators discussing
those burdens with business.</div>

description, clause 73 is about their functions and the particular
regulators to which the duty will apply. It has been said by some that
a ministerial order made under powers conferred in clause 73 could
interfere with regulators&#146; independence. As I just said, this is
not about regulators&#146; independence; it is about how their
functions are carried out. Some regulators requested that they be named
in the Bill. They are named in subsection (2), paragraphs (a) to (e):
the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority, the Office of Fair Trading,
the Office of Rail Regulation, the Postal Services Commission and the
Water Services Regulation Authority. Subsection (2) applies the duty to
those
regulators.</div><a name="08061984000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have included the power in the Bill rather than simply applying the
duty to all regulators to allow flexibility in both the extent and the
timing of the duty&#146;s applications. The power to apply the duty
in a territorial sense is set out in subsections (3), (4) and (5).
Subsection (6) requires the Minister to consult the regulator and other
appropriate bodies before seeking to apply the duty, subsection (7)
allows the order to make consequential amendments and subsections (8)
to (11) specify other procedural requirements. The Committee might want
to note that an order applying the duty is subject to the affirmative
procedure. The clause concerns the functions that we have discussed,
which are set out in subsection (1), and the regulators to

House to ensure that the House&#146;s financial privileges were not
infringed.</div>
<a name="08061984000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
technical amendment is therefore necessary to remove the privilege
amendment, which provided that nothing in the Bill should impose or
vary any charge on the people or public funds. It is as much about
parliamentary rules as it is about the Bill itself, but it is
nevertheless necessary.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000308"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> Let no one say that we do not learn something in
these Committees&#151;I confess to a possible moment of excitement
when we saw a Government amendment suddenly lurch forward at the last
minute. We were on clause 48 and on Tuesday my office went into full
excitement mode&#151;even more than usual&#151;but, lo and behold,
it is a technical amendment and does not afford us the opportunity to
scrutinise the Minister at great length. It is entirely sensible and
so, with a slight hint of disappointment, I will not oppose
it.</div>

Act and any order made under it shall by virtue of this section cease

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000309"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
<a name="08061984000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
concluded the clauses, we come to the new clauses. New clause 2 is very
important because, as you will have seen, Mr. Chope, it is a
sunset clause. As we have discussed, the scope of the Bill is quite
significant&#151;technical, yes, but significant none the less. It
creates an entirely new local regulatory system and an entirely new
non-departmental public body, albeit there is a company in shadow at
present. It provides extensive powers of sanction and enforcement,
involving not one single regulator but 27; and not one piece of
legislation but over 140 different laws. The Bill permits the Secretary
of State to make, by order, important changes to both the current and
the proposed system of local regulation. That means, I hope, that in
all local authority areas we, as Members of this House, will see the
potential for improvement in the regulatory environment. However, those
changes will affect all our constituents.</div>
<a name="08061984000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the other
place, my noble Friends were able to secure some important concessions,
not least that of a three-year review under clause 17 that covers only
the LBRO. Given that the LBRO is not, as we have debated, directly
accountable to this House, it was right to seek that review. However,
clause 17 and the review contained therein does not apply to the whole
Bill and that is why 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>it is important to insert the means to debate whether this legislation
should persist after a five-year period.</div>
<a name="08061984000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 2
offers a number of important advantages to us as a House. It enables us
to assess the whole Act and look at how it has worked in practice. The
Minister has understandably looked at the different parts of the Bill
in detailed consideration during our deliberations today. However, we
can all see that the sanctions regime, the operation of primary
authorities and the LBRO&#146;s new and interesting range of powers
will not only work in themselves, but will work together. It is
difficult to know what the end result will be&#151;it is untried and
untested and we cannot be certain about it. The LBRO is not a
long-established, familiar organisation that we can judge on its
performance, powers and role.</div>
<a name="08061984000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause would allow us to look in particular at the range of sanctions
and their impact, especially on small businesses. It would help to
focus&#151;this is an important benefit, which the Minister referred
to earlier&#151;all the regulators&#146; minds on their performance
not only in the coming year but over the next five years. They would
know that we reserve and have the power to scrutinise the legislation
in full. The insertion of a sunset clause is not a cheap excuse for
getting rid of a piece of legislation without due thought. It would
enable the House to ensure that the law of the land is working. The
legislation provides significant changes for our
constituents.</div>
<a name="08061984000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rightly, the
Government have said that they want to get serious about regulation and
reducing the regulatory burden, which I welcome. The new clause
provides an opportunity for them to turn that promise into
practice.</div><a name="08061984000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000310"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I welcome the prospect of a sunset clause. Earlier
in the proceedings, I got a bit excited when I interpreted the
three-year review of the LBRO as a sunset clause. On new clause 3, I
would suggest that six and a half years is too long a period, but I
would welcome a sunset clause proposal. Based on costs of &#163;4.5
million per annum, we would have spent &#163;29 million
before the clause would be invoked. That is too much and too long a
prospect. A three-year sunset clause would be extremely welcome, and I
would also welcome the Minister&#146;s views on how we might go about
imposing such a clause not only on this Bill, but on other Government
Bills.</div><a name="08061984000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000311"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Let me begin by saying that sunset clauses are
perfectly legitimate issues to raise. They are not always inappropriate
by any means, and they have been added to a number of Bills, so, on a
basic level, it is legitimate to consider them. However, in relation to
a Bill such as this, such a clause is unwise, and I shall set out my
reasons for so
thinking.</div><a name="08061984000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill intends to change the regulatory environment to deal with two
significant problems, as we have said. The first problem is an
inconsistency in the manner in which regulations are applied around the
country, which is essentially dealt with in parts 1 and 2. The second
problem is the inflexibility in the penalty regime, which is dealt with
in part
3.</div><a name="08061984000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Business
appreciates clarity and certainty, and the Bill intends to give those
things. I fear that the insertion of a sunset clause such as new clause
2 would do precisely the opposite. Businesses and other regulated 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>organisations need confidence and certainty when making decisions that
the regime that is being implemented will be there for some time. To
begin from the premise that the Bill will lapse in the period set out
in the clause would damage the Bill, not only at the end of the period,
but through its period of
operation.</div><a name="08061984000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, uncertainty about the continued existence of LBRO would make
it difficult for it to carry authority and trust. Businesses would
think twice about entering into primary authority relationships. We
have debated how important those are in ensuring consistency and
clarity for businesses a lot in the past few days. If businesses
thought that the legal basis for the relationship would be abolished
after five years, they would think twice about investing time, and
indeed money, in them&#151;there is a cost recovery provision. Would
they know that the advice that they had received would hold good in
future? That could be a problem. Local authorities would also have a
reduced incentive to comply with the guidance of a body that Parliament
has said has a time-limited life.</div>
<a name="08061984000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">On part 3,
for example, when we think about the penalties that we have discussed
in some depth, as we approached the sunset point regulators might stop
issuing sanctions because their capacity to do so was coming to an end,
and they would rely again on the one-club policy of criminal
prosecution that the Bill tries to get away from. Regulators would have
little incentive to take up these powers, in the knowledge that they
would be withdrawn after a period of time.</div>
<a name="08061984000254"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="08061984000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
review clause is different. It states that we will look at how the
system is operating, but it does not say that it will come to an end,
as a sunset clause does. Regulators adopting the powers in 2010 would
find themselves in the position of having to submit to a review clause
after three years, an exercise with doubtful effects in view of the
fact that if the new clause became part of the Bill, Parliament would
have legislated for the whole regime to go out of existence two years
later anyway. For a number of reasons, that is
unwise.</div><a name="08061984000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
similar clause was debated in the other place too. I am not against
review; it is a perfectly sensible thing to do and it is built into the
Bill, but that is different from the automatic ending entailed in a
sunset clause.</div>
<a name="08061984000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a
lot of representations on this issue. If I may detain the Committee
with a few of the quotes on the issue, it may give an idea of the
strength of feeling about consistency and clarity. The Federation of
Small Businesses
said:</div><a name="08061984000243"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
FSB...has invested a great deal of time and effort in pushing for
the establishment of the LBRO. It would be sad to see a sunset clause
applied to the LBRO as this would severely impact on its ability to
function in the interest of 4.5 million small
businesses.&#148;</div><a name="08061984000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Going
from small business to a larger national chain, Boots
said,</div><a name="08061984000244"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
LBRO benefits of the Bill will be lost with the result that industry
will be left still dealing with the inconsistencies that Government
promised would be addressed by this new approach to regulatory
coordination.&#148;</div><a name="08061984000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sainsbury&#146;s
said:</div><a name="08061984000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
introduction of the sunset clause will, we believe, make the role of
the LBRO more difficult and potentially prejudice its ability to bring
about the change which is required.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div><a name="08061984000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are other comments
here and I could go on, but I shall not quote all of them. Finally, the
CBI
said:</div><a name="08061984000246"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Sunset
clauses in principle are a good tool to ensure that regulations are fit
for purpose and deliver their objectives. But we feel that the specific
addition of a sunset clause would not materially add value in the case
of the RES Bill... such an amendment could reduce the
LBRO&#146;s ability to implement its goal of improving the quality of
local authority
enforcement.&#148;</div><a name="08061984000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
I think we can see a broad opposition to the new clause, both among
organisations representing small business and some well-known big
businesses. For those reasons, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not
press the new clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000312"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I am interested to hear some of the quotations.
There are other quotations from other similar organisations, not
specifically on the sunset clause, but on the measures that the Bill
represents. The CBI says that the Bill represents for business a
&#147;leap of faith&#148;. We need to be careful, therefore, about
how we selectively quote what different organisations
think.</div><a name="08061984000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000313"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Would the hon. Gentleman accept that the quotes
that I read out are specifically related to the sunset clause, and the
quote that he has read out is not?</div>
<a name="08061984000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000314"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> Absolutely. Equally, in the end we have to decide
whether what we do in this House is right. I am always happy to listen
to the business audience and ensure that their concerns are accurately
represented, as I have done in the past two days, but in the end we
must make sure that this House reserves its right to consider these
matters without due prejudice. I want to ensure that we do that
properly.</div>
<a name="08061984000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
about a sunset clause is not the presumption that we will remove the
Bill; it is to provide a point when it can be replaced, removed or
renewed. I suspect that the good elements, which businesses clearly
wish to see maintained, would be renewed. A sunset clause is not final:
it may be the end for the Bill, but it may not. It allows Parliament to
consider whether what is on the statute book is working.</div>
<a name="08061984000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
it is difficult to strike the right balance, and have said on a number
of occasions that parts of the Bill have considerable merit. I welcome
many of them, but I am sceptical whether others will achieve what the
Government hope. I suspect that we share the hope for a better
regulatory environment, but should the regime be permanent or, after
reviewing particular elements of the Bill&#151;but not all, because
we do not have that opportunity&#151;should we have the option of
annulling it on 1 January 2014, which after all is some distance
off?</div>
<a name="08061984000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">With respect
to the organisations that the Minister mentioned&#151;I know them
well&#151;I do not buy the argument that the fact that there might be
a review in Parliament of the Bill means that no one will make a deal
or memorandum of understanding with a primary authority for the next
six years. Neither do I buy the Minister&#146;s argument that the
LBRO will struggle to survive or fulfil its functions, if on 1 January
2014 Parliament has the opportunity to reconsider how the legislation
is operating. I fully accept that we will want to consider that
carefully, and it might well be that a future Government at that point
would wish to enhance, or even improve, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>this legislation. I suspect that that would be well within the reach of
future Governments upon consideration. At the moment, the House will
have no means of considering it after Third Reading. That will be the
end of the matter. There will be a review&#151;that is
fine&#151;but only on specific elements and orders. That is why this
new clause is so important. I am not convinced by his comments, so I
wish to press the new clause to a

Burt:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Chope. I seek
your guidance before we proceed. I was somewhat surprised to see new
clauses 4 and 5 on today&#146;s selection list. They were not
originally chosen, but were both intended to be included with my
amendments Nos. 58, 59 and 60, which would have replaced clauses 28, 29
and 30. I am ready, willing and able to go ahead with this discussion, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>but in view of the fact that we have already discussed clauses 28, 29
and 30, I ask your guidance. Do you consider this to be an appropriate
time to discuss the new clauses, or do you feel that we should leave it
to a subsequent stage of the
Bill?</div><a name="08061984000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000342"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am in the hon. Lady&#146;s hands. The new
clauses are hers, so she can decide not to move them if she wants. The
reason why they were not on the selection list for debate on the last
occasion was that they were effectively starred. They were ruled out
because sufficient notice of them had not been given before the
Committee met. Now they are in order and in time. If she wants to
discuss them, we can propose them and deal with them accordingly after
she moves them. If she does not want to move them, that is her
decision. I hope that that is helpful.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000346"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
<a name="08061984000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 4
would remove primary authorities&#146; blanket power to prevent local
authorities from taking enforcement action in their own area, while
ensuring that the courts have the evidence that they need to treat
business fairly and that primary authorities have intelligence on
regulatory issues affecting the businesses that they work
with.</div>
<a name="08061984000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 28,
which we have discussed, bestows on one local authority the power of
veto over another local authority&#146;s enforcement decisions. Not
only is that undemocratic, but it gives the primary authority de facto
powers of legal interpretation, which are the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div>proper function of the courts. New clause 4 proposes to remove that veto
and leave it to the courts, rather than the primary authority, to
decide whether enforcement action is unjustified in the light of advice
given to a company by the primary authority. It would protect the
Bill&#146;s intention to promote consistency and deter unjustified
enforcement action without the attendant objectionable transfers of
power involved in clause 28. Subsection (1) of the proposed new clause
would improve the primary authority&#146;s ability to focus its work
on the area of greatest need by ensuring that it has the fullest
possible picture of the company&#146;s health and safety
performance.</div><a name="08061984000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000347"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I ask colleagues to oppose the new clause if it
is pressed to a vote. The Bill is about tackling inconsistency in local
regulatory enforcement. I fear that passing the new clause would change
fundamentally the balance of authority between the enforcing authority
and the primary authority, therefore militating against the removal of
that inconsistency, which is a central premise of the Bill. As the hon.
Lady said, we are in the slightly odd position, technically, of
discussing a new clause that, if passed now, would leave us with two
parallel regimes. On Tuesday we discussed the primary authority scheme
fully. However, I will leave that aside and deal with the new clause on
its
merits.</div><a name="08061984000255"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="08061984000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause seeks to table an alternative approach to the primary
authority partnership, whereby the enforcing authority would simply
have to inform the primary authority if it was going to act, without
the primary authority being able to take a view on that, as set out in
the Bill. I understand that the original intention was to protect local
authorities&#146; discretion to pursue any enforcement action that
they choose by replacing the primary authority principle with an
information-sharing provision. As I said, that is a very different
relationship and, from the point of view of the regulated, would
introduce much more uncertainty into the system. It would pose a
serious question mark over why they should go to the trouble of
constructing a primary authority relationship if the primary authority
had no say over how the local enforcement authority was going about
matters.</div><a name="08061984000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Businesses
have asked us to provide access to a scheme that will provide them with
more dependable advice and much quicker resolution of disputes between
authorities, giving them the certainty and clarity that they seek. The
Government start from the principle, enshrined in the Bill, that where
a business and a local authority have gone to the trouble of
establishing that primary authority relationship, there should be a
presumption that the advice given by one professional should be
respected by other professionals across the country, unless there
are&#151;again as set down in the Bill&#151;emergency situations or
other good reasons for an exception, particularly for local situations
and so on. We do not want to undermine that relationship as a whole, as
the new clause would do by removing the primary authority&#146;s
ability to intervene. In our scheme the primary authority&#146;s
right to direct that a particular action should not take place is only
operative when the primary authority concludes that the enforcement
action conflicts with advice.</div>
<a name="08061984000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
may remember that we had a discussion about the consistency of advice
previously given to a business. The new clause would water down the
provisions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div>in the Bill by removing the primary authority&#146;s right to
intervene and the enforcing authority&#146;s right to take the matter
to arbitration through LBRO. That would give businesses less effective
protection.</div><a name="08061984000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady also talked about who interprets the law. I understand that
concerns remain among some in enforcement about the primary authority
or LBRO effectively having jurisdiction over enforcement actions that a
particular authority may wish to pursue. She also raised a concern on
Tuesday that the scheme gives the primary authority and LBRO&#151;I
think she used the phrase a moment or two ago&#151;de facto powers of
legal interpretation, which are the proper function of the
courts.</div>
<a name="08061984000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me make
it clear that the new provisions will not undermine the courts, nor
take over the legitimate role of legal interpretation. The idea behind
the scheme is that, where a local authority has given advice to a
business and a business has followed that advice in good faith,
businesses should, unless there are good reasons to the contrary, be
able to expect that they will not have serious action taken against
them by another local authority. Neither LBRO nor the primary authority
can give a once-and-for-all answer about the legality of a particular
approach. Rightly, that decision must lie with the courts.</div>
<a name="08061984000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
issues on which LBRO, in determining whether consistency can be upheld,
can take a view is on whether the advice or guidance from the primary
authority was correct. LBRO will not be giving the opinion that there
is only one correct piece of advice or guidance, but will be giving the
opinion that the advice or guidance is not inconsistent with its
understanding of the law as it stands at the time of arbitration. It
will not therefore be usurping the role of the courts over legal
interpretation. If it is not satisfied on those points, the enforcement
action may go ahead and that might, in turn, mean that the matter could
go to the courts. The main purpose of the primary authority scheme is
to provide the consistency of enforcement to which I have referred.
That is a change from existing practice, but it is important. The
proposed scheme would not deliver the same, and would maintain the
inconsistency that the Bill is attempting to
answer.</div><a name="08061984000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
have raised issues about the primary authority scheme, but I hope that
I have outlined how it is circumscribed. I also hope that I have
clarified what it will do, and what it will not do. In the light of
that, I hope that the hon. Lady does not press the new clause to a
Division.</div><a name="08061984000206"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000349"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="08061984000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would broaden the scope of the suggested inspection plans to
enable the primary authorities to publish a broad range of information
about businesses that would be of benefit to other local authorities
when exercising their functions. Furthermore, it would remove the
bureaucracy associated with such plans by removing the requirements for
written notifications and justifications if, for any reason, a local
authority needs to carry out an inspection in response to local
circumstances that fall outside the approach detailed in the published
plan.</div><a name="08061984000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
30 would have limited value in helping local authorities effectively
co-ordinate and target their enforcement activities. It focuses only on
planned inspections, which are only a small part of the regulatory work
of regulators. The new clause allows for the publication of information
that is far more useful to councils and enables regulated persons or
entities to get information to all councils about safeguard systems and
planned improvements. The clause would also fetter local
authorities&#146; ability to respond at a local level to local
issues, and it would add a level of bureaucracy that ultimately has no
impact.</div><a name="08061984000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would still require a local authority to have regard to any
published compliance plan, but it would remove the requirement for it
to notify and justify to a primary authority why it acted in a way that
did not fall within a published plan. It adds no value for a primary
authority to stop another local authority acting outside the plan. A
regulated person or entity has the right to complain via a local
authority&#146;s complaints procedure and, if necessary, via the
independent local government ombudsman or judicial review if it
considers that a local council has acted
inappropriately.</div><a name="08061984000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a primary authority can set out in the plan how often inspections
should take place, I am concerned that the plan will lack the
flexibility to deal with the very situation to which Lord Jones
referred in another place. I cite the example of inspectors at the
Tesco store at Olive avenue, Coventry, which is not a million miles
away from my constituency. They undertook five inspections 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>of the store, four of which were in response to customer complaints, and
alleged that food was on sale past its use-by date. In total, 142 items
of food were found available for sale past their use-by date. Despite
alerting both branch managers and Tesco head office on each and every
occasion, the failings within the store were not rectified. By the
fourth visit, the situation was getting worse and officers discovered
73 items on sale past their use-by date, including 11 that were 10 days
past it.</div>
<a name="08061984000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point of
the story is that Tesco began its submissions by apologising to the
court for its failings and attempting to argue that its due diligence
system was good, even though it accepted that it had not been correctly
implemented this time. It argued that the failings were due to human
error and placed the blame on the store manager. Clearly, the court
decided otherwise, and Tesco was eventually fined &#163;133,400 with
&#163;8,976 in costs. The point is that the local store failed to act
on what was an acceptable company policy. In such cases, the primary
authority could not be expected to know as well as the local authority
which local stores were failing to comply with company policy. It could
therefore set an inspection regime based on the assumption that a
nationally agreed process was being implemented everywhere. As a
result, a local authority might be prevented from undertaking
inspections at a store that was not living up to national standards,
and nothing would be done until an outbreak of food poisoning or, in a
different type of environment, an accident.</div>
<a name="08061984000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000350"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> To some extent, my difficulty with this new
clause is similar to my difficulty with the last one. The primary
authority principle tries to give the regulator some sense of clarity
and consistency about what to expect. The inspection plans set out in
clause 30, which this new clause would replace, are part of doing that.
Clause 30(3) gives examples of what could be in an inspection plan,
mentioning</div>
<a name="08061984000247"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the frequency
at which, or circumstances in which, inspections should be carried
out;&#148;</div><a name="08061984000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div>
<a name="08061984000248"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;what an
inspection should consist
of&#148;.</div><a name="08061984000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
list is not exhaustive and the Government expect inspection plans to
include other information such as recommendations, enforcement and
information on a wide range of issues relating to a business with which
a primary authority has a partnership. The guide to the Bill, which I
have referred to several times, includes some of those issues,
suggesting details of improvements that a business is undertaking to
improve its health and safety procedures, or details of ongoing
problems relating to compliance that other local authorities should pay
particular regard to. The issues in the new clause can be addressed in
the inspection plan in clause 30. LBRO will take the issues raised into
account when giving guidance to local authorities on implementing the
inspection plans.</div>
<a name="08061984000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
another point about the hon. Lady&#146;s new clause. I am not sure
that what she said was correct. She said that the new clause still
required the enforcing authority to have regard to the plan&#151;I am
not sure that it does. It removes the key requirement for local
authorities to have regard to a registered inspection plan when
undertaking inspections and to notify the primary authority before
departing from it. This is not only a replacement 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>for the inspection plan; it puts a far lower level of onus on the
enforcing authority to pay any heed to it. The Government expect that
inspection plans will help to reduce unnecessary business inspections
and facilitate knowledge sharing between primary and enforcing
authorities. The compliance plan, as set out in the new clause, would
not provide for that, because it would break the relationship whereby
the enforcing authority has to have regard to the plan. Achieving those
aims rests on ensuring that enforcing authorities have regard to an
inspection plan and that they inform the primary authority of the
reasons that they might depart from such a
plan.</div><a name="08061984000256"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="08061984000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady talked about the need for flexibility, which is absolutely
right. Of course we need flexibility in dealing with, for example, the
problem of selling out-of-date food. That was a fair point. Inspection
plans should always allow for the capacity to respond effectively to
emergencies or, in particular, local circumstances, and plans will need
LBRO sign-off to ensure that they are not unreasonable or totally
inflexible. Through the primary authority principle, and the inspection
plans in particular, we are trying to promote a relationship that
offers consistency to those regulated, and a dialogue between local
circumstances and the primary authority. I am afraid that, on those
counts, her new clause would take us away from the aims of the Bill, so
I hope that she will not press it to a
vote.</div><a name="08061984000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000351"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I thank the Minister for his enlightening comments.
I still feel that my proposal has many merits, particularly on
information sharing and the spreading of best practice among local
authorities. However, I take on board a number of his points, and I do
not wish to press the new clause. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000352"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I thank the Committee for the way in which our
business has been conducted over the past couple of days. In
particular, I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford for the
questions that he put to me on clause 65&#151;it was a welcome and
enlightening intervention. I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for
Amber Valley, who serves on the Regulatory Reform Committee, for
bringing her expertise to our deliberations. My hon. Friend the Member
for Glasgow, North kept us in line in regard to Scottish law and gave
us some legal advice, which I think in former life might have cost us a
great deal more. Her help was extremely valuable. I resisted the
attempts by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud to divert us into a
discussion on the merits or otherwise of two-tier and single-tier local
government. I would like to thank all my other hon. Friends for their
contributions.</div><a name="08061984000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the hon. Member for Solihull, who has been labouring under
extreme sickness&#151;from the sound of her coughing&#151;and I
hope that she gets well soon. She 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>moved a number of amendments, and raised a number of issues, that were
also raised in another place. They are important issues, and we take
them very seriously. Of course, I also thank the hon. Member for
Hertford and Stortford, who has probed and occasionally pressed with
great skill and courtesy, for the way in which he has conducted the
debate on the Bill and his amendments. I am conscious that there are a
couple of points on which I have said that I will write to him, and I
have not forgotten those.</div>
<a name="08061984000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, of
course, I wish to thank you, Mr. Chope, for your skilful,
impartial and enlightening guidance in getting us through the Bill over
the last couple of days. This is, as the hon. Member for Hertford and
Stortford said, an important Bill, if a technical one. In all the
discussion of the individual clauses and amendments, we should not lose
sight of the aims, which, as I have said, are to tackle the two
problems of inconsistency and inflexibility in the current regulatory
regime. If we manage to do that, we have done a significant service to
the general public, to those who are regulated, and we will also have
saved business in the country a significant sum of money&#151;an
estimated sum of up to &#163;200 million&#151;in regulatory costs.
That is important because we want business to concentrate on the
business of doing business, rather than the kind of costs that can
hopefully be reduced by legislation such as
this.</div><a name="08061984000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000353"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> At the beginning of our deliberations I said that I
would try to be precise in scrutiny and concise in my remarks, and
although I have not been entirely perfect in those terms, I hope that I
have not detained the Committee longer than was necessary. We have had
some useful debates. We have seen at least eight concessions, or
clarifications, from the Minister on the way that the law will work;
they are crucial to those whom it will affect. He has just alluded to
the fact that there will be two or three occasions when he needs to
write to us as a Committee to set out the Government&#146;s position.
We fully understand, and it is important that that is on public record.
When those concessions or clarifications are viewed in combination with
the dozen or more important concessions acceded to in the other place,
it can be seen that Parliament has undertaken its duty of proper,
effective and focused scrutiny.</div>
<a name="08061984000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">It falls to
me to extend a few thanks. I should like to thank the Minister for his
considered approach to my probing and pressing on various matters in
Committee. I know that very often people outside this place assume that
Prime Minister&#146;s questions is the sole way that we can do our
business, and although that is important&#151;indeed, very important,
but occasionally some Members get a little carried away, although
obviously not on my side&#151;what is important, nevertheless, is
deliberations of the type that we have had. They have been measured and
considered, and I thank the Minister for that.</div>
<a name="08061984000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also extend
my thanks to my hon. Friends, particularly my hon. Friend the Member
for Billericay, who has been a tremendous support, and other hon.
Members who have made individual and particular contributions. Could I
also, as the person who has been more than happy to table one or two
amendments, thank the Clerks and Officers of the House, who are
fantastic in the way in which they patiently take us through measures
that are self-evidently nonsensical and turn them into something that
has a semblance of order? I am very grateful to them for
that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div><a name="08061984000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last but by no
means least, indeed most importantly, I should like to thank you,
Mr. Chope, for the light-touch and speedy way in which you
have regulated our
proceedings.</div><a name="08061984000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000354"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> The Committee has been a shining example of how we
can work together as a Committee, composed of Government and Opposition
parties, in a concise and constructive way to examine clause by clause
a Bill that had already greatly benefited from examination and
amendment in another place. Our work was not unduly onerous, so I
should like to convey my thanks, particularly to the Clerks, who have
laboured with my strange and unusually phrased amendments, and have
turned them into something acceptable. I thank the Minister for the
helpful and constructive way in which he has dealt with the queries and
amendments that I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>have raised. Finally, I thank you, Mr. Chope, for your wise
guidance during the
proceedings.</div><a name="08061984000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061984000355"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I have always been in favour of self-regulation,
and what has happened during the proceedings of this Committee is an
exemplary example of self-regulation. I am grateful to the Minister for
his comments, and to the hon. Members for Hertford and Stortford and
for Solihull for what they have had to say. I should like to echo their
thanks to the Clerks of the House, to the police, to <i class="I">Hansard,

to move so smoothly. The person who will probably be most thankful for
all this is the hon. Member for Carlisle who will not be troubled as
