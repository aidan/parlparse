Clause 23 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 24</center></H4>
<H4><center>Functions of Commissioner in relation to making of notification regulations</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): I beg to move amendment No. 107, in page 15, line 42, at end add "and (c) consult Parliament".
<P>
The amendment raises a similar issue to one that we discussed before. We are trying to elicit from the Minister when the notification regulations are likely to be submitted to the Secretary of State and what the timetable for their adoption is. I am sure that he understands that business needs to have some idea about that. We are not saying that proposals must be submitted in three months; we simply want to know how long the process will take.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</B> We have already had some discussion of the notification scheme in the context of amendment No. 106.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I did not want to interrupt the hon. Member for Ryedale, but I should have. He addressed himself to amendment No. 106, but we are on amendment No. 107. Does he want to add some words about amendment No. 107 before the Minister responds?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> No, I think that I need to speak to amendment No. 107.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman like to do so?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Yes. I suspect that we have already discussed amendment No. 106 and that we have dealt with the point. Like amendment No. 106, amendment No. 107 is about creating certainty, so none of my comments is particularly irrelevant to it. We are suggesting that Parliament should have an opportunity to take part in the consultation procedure before the Secretary of State makes the notification regulations.
<P>
The regulations deal with a wide range of important matters in respect of the register. We made speedy progress this morning, and much of the meat in the clauses that we discussed will come in the notification regulations. Consultations with Parliament might be appropriate because clause 63, which we shall seek to amend later, proposes that the regulations be subject to a negative procedure. There would, therefore, be no guarantee of discussion. We simply want to ensure that Parliament, in some form, has a proper opportunity to consider the detail of the notification regulations before they are made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I shall try again. As I was saying, we had some discussion on the notification scheme in the context of amendment No. 106, which we considered under clause 8. I hope, therefore, that I can restate the general position briefly.
<P>
The Bill constructs a mechanism that gives each of the Secretary of State, Parliament and the commissioner a formal role when the regulations come to be considered. The first proposals will come from the commissioner to the Secretary of State; the Secretary of State must consider them and in turn consult the commissioner; only then can the Secretary of State make regulations. In turn, clause 63(5) makes the regulations subject to negative resolution by either House of Parliament.
<P>
I want to emphasise that the Government have no intention of circumventing Parliament. Clause 63(5)(d) provides that notification regulations, which are defined in clause 15(2), shall be laid before Parliament and subject to negative resolution. As we are dealing with good administration and a proper balance between the interests of data controllers

Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.

<H5>4.50 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Thank you, Mr. Welsh, for the opportunity at the third time of asking to complete my comments. I hope that I do not tempt fate by suggesting that I shall do so briefly.
<P>
Before we were so comprehensively interrupted, I was explaining that regulations that are subject to negative resolution by either House of Parliament will, in the Government's view, afford proper scrutiny to hon. Members. That is the right mechanism. Affirmative resolutions are reserved for issues that go more directly to the heart of individuals' rights under the Bill. In the circumstances, a negative resolution will be a sufficient safeguard and will ensure sufficient involvement for hon. Members. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Member for Ryedale will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We have listened to what the Minister said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Several times.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> As I told the Minister, and as he will see from the amendment paper should we be graced with your selection, Mr. Welsh we may want to return to the issue when we reach clause 63. For now, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 24 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 25</center></H4>
<H4><center>Fees regulations</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 108, in page 16, line 6, leave out from "Tribunal" to end of line 14.
<P>
There is a feature here that we do not like. Clause 25 deals with fees regulations. Leaving aside this morning's discussions about whether and to what extent the Data Protection Commission should be publicly funded in the future, we agree that the operation should be relatively self-financing.
<P>
Subsection (2)(b) provides that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to the extent that the Secretary of State considers appropriate"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
previous deficits and expenses incurred in respect of the superannuation of officers and staff of the commissioner may be defrayed by means of fees regulations. That struck me as potentially rather retrospective. A large body of people will be caught under the new provisions who were not previously caught by the 1984 Act. Natural justice requires that we ask whether they can or should be held responsible for any costs or deficits previously incurred. The amendment would remove paragraph (b).
<P>
In anticipation of the Minister's reply, I have several questions. Does he have any idea of how much money we may be talking about? What has prompted the need for this provision? What is the likelihood of those regulations being made in respect of deficits? What pension costs may be incurred? Finally, if a shortfall is likely to remain, how will that be reported to Parliament? These matters are important, and I am sure that it is clear why we thought it fit to raise them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I was just looking to see if anybody else wished to speak about this vital question.
<P>
Subsection (2)(a) requires the Secretary of State to have regard to the desirability of ensuring that the fees are sufficient to offset the expenses incurred by the commissioner and the tribunal in exercising their functions and his own expenses in respect of those bodies, when making fees regulations in relation to notification.
<P>
Subsection (2)(b) allows the Secretary of State to take two additional factors into account: past deficits in relation to the expenses specified in paragraph (a) and expenses incurred by the Secretary of State in respect of the inclusion of the commissioner's staff in a scheme under section 1 of the Superannuation Act 1972. Those matters cause the hon. Member for Ryedale concern.
<P>
I shall deal with the two limbs in turn. Section 40(7) of the 1984 Act made clear Parliament's intention that fees received in relation to registration should finance the registrar's office and the tribunal. A number of factors led to a deficit building up. It would not be right for me to apportion responsibility, but the deficit built up before May 1997. To be fair, I should say that the factors included set-up costs of some œ2 million for the registrar's office, which were incurred before registrations started to come on stream in substantial numbers, and lower than expected income in the early years of operation.
<P>
The Data Protection Registration Fee Order 1991, which was made under the Finance (No. 2) Act 1987, gave the Secretary of State the power to recover the deficit when setting fee levels. The subsequent Data Protection (Fees) Regulations 1991 set the registration fee at œ75, and it has since remained unchanged. The level of the fee was designed to recover the deficit as well as running costs during several years.
<P>
I am pleased to say that the deficit has since steadily reduced. Relevant figures regarding the past 12 years are set out in the registrar's annual report, which shows that from April 1992 to March 1997 the deficit reduced from œ9.2 million to œ4.5 million. We estimate that if the 1984 Act arrangements had continued, it would have been eliminated by the end of the financial year 2000-01.
<P>
The deficit has not yet been recovered, however, and it will be necessary to continue recovering it through the notification fees provided for in the Bill. The first part of subsection (2)(b) ensures that the effect of the 1991 order, which is revoked in schedule 14, is retained in practice.
<P>
I hope that that explanation is sufficient, and that there is no suggestion that because of the change of Government in May of last year, the new Labour Government will be responsible for deficits that built up under its predecessor.
<P>
On subsection (2)(b), the registrar currently operates a non-contributory pension scheme to provide retirement and related benefits for her staff. The scheme is similar to, but not part of, the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme. The arrangement means that the cost of pensions and of staff transferring to other employers has to be met from the registrar's grant in aid. That makes for a degree of uncertainty in the registrar's budget planning because, even with the most accurate estimates, unforeseen commitments, such as deaths in service, will inevitably arise.
<P>
Against that background, the Government are examining closely the possibility of admitting the registrar's staff to the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme. Such a transfer would incur cost, and the Government would wish to recoup it over time through the notification fees, as with the existing deficit. The second limb of subsection 2(b) would enable that to be done.
<P>
I hope that my explanation has clarified the background and persuaded the hon. Member for Ryedale that his concerns are not as well-founded as they may have appeared when he first looked at the Bill. If so, perhaps he will be willing to withdraw his amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> It is amazing what you can discover if you ask. We could have looked all that up in the Data Protection Registrar's annual report, although I doubt whether we would have obtained such a concise and graphic description of the considerable progress that the previous Government made in reducing the Data Protection Registrar's start-up costs deficit. We look forward to the millennium, when we hope that that deficit will be expunged.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. The admission of the Data Protection Commissioner's staff to the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme will be greatly appreciated.
<P>
On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 25 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 26</center></H4>
<H4><center>Preliminary</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 127, in page 16, line 25, leave out from "means" to first "to" in line 26 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the provisions specified in subsection (3A)".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 128, 129 and 139 to 141.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The purpose of the amendments to clause 26 is to narrow the scope of the non-disclosure provisions defined in clause 26(3) to make the exemptions from those provisions consistent with the directive. One of the effects of the data protection principles set out in schedule 1 is to impose restrictions on the circumstances in which personal data may be disclosed. The principles do not prohibit disclosure. They merely state that if disclosures are to be made, they must be made in conformity with the principles. That is clearly the right approach.
<P>
However, the directive and the Bill both recognise that it may be necessary to make disclosures in certain circumstances where it is not possible to comply with the data protection principles set out in the Bill. Those principles are concerned with the prevention or detection of crime, the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, or the assessment or collection of any tax or duty or of any imposition of a similar nature. The purpose of the non-disclosure exemptions in part IV is to ensure that such disclosures may be made.
<P>
Clause 26(3) currently defines the "non-disclosure provisions" as including all the data protection principles except the seventh principle, which relates to security to the extent to which they are inconsistent with the disclosure in question. We have realised that this goes rather too far, because it means that we might be providing exemptions where the directive does not permit us to do so. We have tabled the amendments for the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that we are entirely in line with the directive. Amendments Nos. 129, 139, 140 and 141 are intended for a different, though related, purpose.
<P>
Amendment No. 128, which I have just dealt with, refers in paragraph (c) to clause 12(1) to (3). That means that the non-disclosure exemptions are available in respect of clause 12(1) to (3), but not of clause 12(4). Clause 12(1) to (3) provides what amounts to a free-standing right to rectification, blocking, erasure or destruction of personal data on the ground of their inaccuracy. In that respect, it complements the fourth data protection principle. Where exemptions from the fourth principle are involved, it is necessary, for obvious reasons of consistency, to provide exemptions from clause 12(1) to (3) as well.
<P>
Clause 12(4), however, does something different. It does not relate to the inaccuracy of the data, but provides a general remedy of rectification, blocking, erasure or destruction where damage has been suffered and there is a substantial risk of further contravention. In that respect, it complements the general remedial provisions of clause 11.
<P>
The Bill provides a number of exemptions from the whole of clause 12. Where it does so, it is intended only to complement exemption from the fourth principle. We are satisfied that it is right to provide exemptions in such cases from clause 12(1) to (3) dealing with the rectification of inaccurate data. However, there is no basis for disapplying the remedial provisions of clause 12(4) in these cases. For example, clause 33, which provides an exemption from the fourth principle, and clause 12, where the data consist of information that the controller is statutorily required to make available to the public. That includes public registers, such as the register of births, marriages and deaths.
<P>
The statutes governing such registers will have their own rules about accuracy and, in cases of inaccuracy, will make provision for the rectification of the information that they contain. As it would be undesirable for the rectification right in the Bill to apply to those registers as well, they are exempted from the Bill's accuracy provisions.
<P>
However, no such considerations apply to clause 12(4). That provision needs to apply to the registers, just as clause 11 does, in respect of breaches of the Bill's requirements that apply to them. The effect of the amendments is to remove clause 12(4) from the scope of the exemption provided by clause 33, and in three other places in the Bill.
<P>
I hope that the Committee agrees that it is desirable to focus exemptions in that way and will support the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The best that we can do is study the Minister's response in Hansard. I am sure that it was helpful, but it is refreshing and encouraging that Government amendments should crop up, as they show that the Government accept that the Bill can be improved.
<P>
It would be wrong to do more than is required by the directive. However, on Thursday or after the recess we shall want to study what the Minister has said. Some problems remain to be resolved in respect of the need for exemptions for records dealing with fraud or criminal matters involving other than public bodies, but at present we do not object to the amendments.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 128, in page 16, line 27, at end insert

Clause 26, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 27</center></H4>
<H4><center>National security</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 109, in page 16, line 41, leave out "may" and insert "shall".
<P>
Clause 27 provides an exemption from the data protection principles and some of the Bill's provisions for processing personal data
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if the exemption ... is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause's subsections describe the mechanism by which such an exemption can be established. Subsection (10) provides that a certificate demonstrating that there is conclusive evidence that an exemption is necessary on grounds of national security may be produced only by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a Minister who is a member of the Cabinet or by the Attorney General or the Lord Advocate."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (3) describes how the certificate should give information about the reasoning behind its issuance. We support the Government's intentions, but the amendment would strengthen the hand of Ministers. The subsection as drafted allows the certificate to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"identify the personal data on which it applies by means of a general description",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and we ask whether circumstances exist in which a general description might be inappropriate. If a general description is not appropriate, even more information might be given. The fact that there is some discretion in the extent of the information that has to be given might encourage a demand for more information.
<P>
We suggest using the word "shall" in the interests of national security this will not happen every day. Opposition Members are content to trust Ministers' judgment and to provide that national security interests demand that exemptions should always be dealt with by a general description. The Bill should not encourage the thought that more detail than is strictly necessary might be given for the purposes of exemptions under the clause.
<P>
I hope that I have made our point clear. We think that a general description is probably essential in all cases, but if the Minister can tell us of circumstances where more information might be provided than would be available in a general description, we will listen to his thoughts with interest. Our amendment is an attempt to strengthen, not weaken, Ministers' hand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor </B>(Esher and Walton): I have a question to add to my hon. Friend's remarks. It is specifically about the certificate but also, more generally, about this part of the Bill. Are discussions on-going between those responsible for the Bill and the Department of Trade and Industry regarding the latter's proposals on trusted third parties and the procedures for holding public and private keys? It is unlikely that the Bill will refer to that, but given that the Minister was my shadow in the days when I was responsible for some of the proposals that lie behind the trusted third party scheme, he will be as familiar with those proposals as I used to be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful for the confidence of the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor). However, as I am a Minister in the Lord Chancellor's Department, I may not always be able to agree with him.
<P>
I am also grateful to the hon. Member for Ryedale for tabling the amendment. I recognise it from chapter 2 of his helpful handbook, "An Opposition Guide to Tabling Amendments". I recall that he was previously fortunate enough to attract the Government's interest and, indeed, enthusiasm for such an amendment, but on this occasion, he is unlikely to be equally lucky.
<P>
Clause 27 provides for personal data to be exempted from the main elements of the Bill when that is necessary to safeguard national security. The question of necessity is subject to ministerial certification. A person directly affected by such certification has a right of appeal to the Data Protection Tribunal.
<P>
Subsection (3) is a permissive provision. Its purpose is to allow a certificate to identify the personal data to which it refers by means of a general description and to be expressed to have prospective effect when appropriate. There may also be circumstances involving individual cases where it would be appropriate for a certificate to identify the personal data to which it applied in particular rather than general terms. The amendment would remove that important flexibility, so the Government will resist it.
<P>
I was asked to be more specific about circumstances in which particular and general descriptions of personal data would be appropriate. It would not be entirely helpful to speculate at this stage on what are clearly sensitive matters. The point is that we are giving Ministers the option of authorising a specific exemption when there is no need for a general one. That allows a certification to be made proportionate to the need.
<P>
There is a balance to be struck on the one hand, the needs of national security and, on the other, the rights of particular individuals. We want to ensure that the certification is proportionate to the extent that it is necessary.
<P>
The hon. Member for Esher and Walton mentioned trusted third parties. It is not a matter that crosses my desk every day as I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows, the Lord Chancellor's Department is not responsible for that aspect of Government policy. I can, however, tell him that the Home Office is in touch with colleagues at the DTI about matters of that kind. I am sure that the appropriate safeguards are being carefully considered.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I suppose that I should say a few words about why we will probably withdraw the amendment.
<P>
This is an important matter, and it might just be the moment to draw attention to the absence of other members of the Committee. Conservative Members have no difficulty with the need for this provision but other hon. Members, had they been here, might have taken a more liberal view, and might have thought that a general description was not acceptable in any case.
<P>
As I said, we want the Ministers who have to sign certificates to have the necessary discretion and powers to fulfil their responsibilities. These are very serious issues. If the Government are satisfied that the Bill meets their purpose, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day (Cheadle):</B> On a point of order. Mr. Welsh. My hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale drew attention to the fact that neither the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) nor the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Mr. Jones) have attended this afternoon's sitting. In fact, I think I am right in saying that the hon. Member for Cheltenham has not attended any sitting of this Committee.
<P>
It is essential that places on Committees dealing with Bills of this magnitude and detail are taken up. I hope that you, Mr. Welsh, might be able to relate my concerns to other quarters that have responsibility for allocating minority party places. Perhaps in future they will ensure that when hon. Members in minority parties are allocated places, they take their duties seriously.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman has been long enough in this establishment to know that that is not a point of order for the Chair. However, I am sure that his comments will be noted in the appropriate quarters.
