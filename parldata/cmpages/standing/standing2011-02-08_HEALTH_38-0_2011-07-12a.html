                     </span>
                  </strong> Thank you, Mr Hancock. I apologise to the
Committee that, sadly, they have the monkey rather than the organ
grinder. That is simply due to pressure of work, both in this Committee
and on the Floor of the House, where there is an urgent question on
Southern Cross. I apologise that the Committee is not being addressed
by my fellow Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam,
but I will seek to do my best to fill his shoes for the rest of the
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000042">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
you will remember, Mr Hancock, when the Committee broke for lunch my
hon. Friend was responding to a number of questions raised by
Opposition Members. Before I discuss the main theme of the clause, I
will continue to answer those questions. My hon. Friend had just
answered points raised by the hon. Member for Oldham East and
Saddleworth, regarding funding and conspiracy theories. I will respond
to three further assertions she made, before going on to answer points
raised by the hon. Member for Leicester West, the right hon. Member for
Rother Valley and the hon. Member for Middlesbrough South and East
Cleveland.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000043">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">First, the
hon. Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth asserted that the NHS is an
incredibly efficient service. Although I agree that the NHS is
incredible in a wide range of ways, I have to remind the Committee that
productivity in the NHS, as measured by the Office for National
Statistics, declined by an average 0.2% per year from
1997.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000044">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am grateful to the Minister, and we are glad to
see him take his rightful place. The most up-to-date comparison of
health services across the western developed world was conducted by the
Commonwealth Fund. It  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 440<a class="bkMark" name="Column440">&#160;</a>
                  </div>found that the NHS delivered one of the most effective and efficient
services, particularly due to the GP gatekeeper role. Has the Minister
read that report and does he
agree?<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000047">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">

                     <span class="hs_CLMember">Mr
Burns:<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000963">&#160;</a>
                     </span>
                  </strong> I am particularly pleased that the hon. Lady asked
me that. I have read the report, because I had the privilege of going
to Washington in November last year in the place of my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State to give a speech to the Commonwealth Fund
when it launched that report. I am very familiar with the report,
because the following day we had a conference that I chaired on the
subject.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000048">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I do not know
if that was a diversionary tactic, but it will not take me away from
the main point that I was making in response to the hon. Member for
Oldham East and Saddleworth, which was that, on the basis of figures
from the ONS and not from Conservative campaign headquarters, since
1997 productivity in the NHS has fallen each year by 0.2%. We are
working hard to support the NHS to reverse that worrying
trend.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000049">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady tried to assert that patient choice and any qualified
provider would inevitably lead to financial meltdown. Again, I have to
remind the Committee that it was the previous Labour Government who
introduced choice of any hospital for elective treatment. Patients have
been able to choose to be treated in any private hospital since 2007
and 200,000 patients a year do so; so far, that has resulted in neither
financial meltdown nor service closure. Let me tell her, in the nicest
possible way, that if that procedure and methodology for treating NHS
patients free at the point of use was acceptable under a Labour
Government, it is equally acceptable under a Conservative coalition
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000050">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If my memory
serves me correctly, the hon. Lady repeated her Front-Bench
colleagues’ claims that the Bill ushers in privatisation of the
NHS. My fellow Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton
and Cheam, made a series of excellent points about that this morning.
All that I can add is a quote from another supporter of private sector
involvement in the NHS, the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and
Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown), who told the Liaison Committee in
2007:<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000051">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
role of the private sector in the areas that you are suggesting is
expanding, will continue to expand and will be a lot bigger in the next
few years than it is
now.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000848">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>I
vividly remember the hon. Lady’s comments on the subject, not
least because I was, rather hurtfully, reprimanded during them by my
hon. Friend the Whip. To be frank, it saddens me that Opposition
Members seek to misrepresent these issues and scaremonger among members
of the public.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000052">&#160;</a>

hon. Lady that it saddens me that people seek, for party political
gain, to misrepresent the issues and scaremonger about
Conservatives’ intentions towards the health service. There is
no difference between the two of us in terms of our commitment to a
national health service that is based on the principle of its being
free at the point of use for those eligible to use it. I will bow to no
one in my support of Nye Bevan’s founding principles of the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000055">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If we look at
the years between 1945 and 1997, Conservative Governments were in
office for a longer time than Labour Governments, but at no time did we
seek, in any shape or form, to privatise the NHS. I do not want to be
controversial or to rev up the Opposition, but those who remember their
history will know that it was not a Conservative Government who
introduced dental charges or prescription charges in 1950. The
Opposition and the Government differ on how the NHS should be made more
responsive to patients and more effective in delivering patient care
and improving outcomes, but it is disingenuous to question the
sincerity of our belief in the core principles of the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000056">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Lady, in the nicest possible way, has
spoilt it. We were getting along so well until she tried to tempt me
down a path along which I am not prepared to go. The short answer to
her question is: because although we are totally committed to the same
core principles, there is a chasm of difference between us on how to
improve and enhance patient care and outcomes and put patients at the
centre of the patient experience. The Government are doing it as laid
out in the Bill, because we passionately believe that within the core
principles it will improve and enhance the delivery of health care. The
hon. Lady, from a perfectly respectable position, strongly disagrees.
To put it crudely, however, we got the votes.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000060">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland asked about quality
and why it was not mentioned in relation to the regulations that these
clauses introduce. The answer is that quality does not need to be
mentioned in this clause. The regulations and related guidance will be
clear, as the primary care trust procurement guide is clear now, that
quality is a key consideration in tendering clinical services. Speaking
about the Bill as a whole, the hon. Gentleman is well aware that it
gives a definition of quality in primary legislation for the first
time. Indeed, quality runs through the Bill in a way never previously
seen in a piece of health legislation. I hope that my hon. Friends and
the Opposition can agree with me on that point.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000061">&#160;</a>

not least, the hon. Member for Leicester West and the right hon. Member
for Rother Valley asked specific questions about competitive tendering,
and I am pleased to be able to provide further details on that point.
The intention is that regulations under clause 67 could
impose requirements governing the process of tendering for NHS
services. To avoid that, it is not the Government’s intention
under clause 67 for regulations to impose compulsory competitive
tendering requirements on commissioners, or for Monitor to have powers
to impose such
requirements.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000062">&#160;</a>

                  </span> One concern that has been raised
with me over the question of tendering is the frequency with which
people will be required to tender. Will the Minister comment on whether
services will be required to be tendered annually, biannually, or every
three or four years? Some people believe that frequent tendering might
lead to inefficiency and excessive work.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000063">&#160;</a>

opportunity to clarify the situation and, I hope, to reassure him. This
will also be relevant to the hon. Lady, given that she and her right
hon. Friend have raised the matter. I can tell my hon. Friend that no,
we do not intend to use the power comprehensively in that way. The
purpose of the regulations will be to ensure that the commissioning
board and the CCGs respect good practice and protect patient choice,
and that they do not restrict competition to the detriment of patients.
In some cases that would mean competitive tendering, but in others it
might be in the interests of patients for commissioners to restrict
competition, for example in specialised surgery or critical care
networks. Ultimately, it will be for commissioners to decide which
services to tender. We do not anticipate that time scales will be laid
down stating that it has to be done every six months or every 12
months, for example. The system will respond to the needs of local
commissioners in the areas. I hope that helps my hon.

began, before that intervention, to say that—to avoid any

Gentleman, so that we can make some progress. There are already rules
now, such as the PCT procurement guide, first published by the previous
Government. Procurement law already applies to the NHS funding clinical
services, and the Bill does not change that. The intention is that the
regulations made under clause 67 will reflect the current
rules.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000067">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I hope I have
answered the points raised by hon. Members. I would now like to make a
number of general points regarding the clause, before urging the

               <p class="tabbed">The clause
permits the Secretary of State to regulate the procurement practices of
the commissioning board and commissioning consortia to ensure that they
adhere to good practice in procurement, protect and promote patient
choice and do not engage in anti-competitive behaviour against
patients’ interests. Such regulations may include requirements
to manage conflicts between commissioners’ interests in
commissioning services and their interests in providing them. For
example, some GPs might be in a position to provide the services that
they commission through their clinical commissioning group. While they
might be the best provider for a particular patient, we want to ensure
that patients are given the choice of provider and that alternative
providers are given a fair chance in providing the
service.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000069">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
clause also states that regulations may include requirements relating
to good practice in competitive tendering. We want to ensure that poor
procurement practice, such as excluding bidders unfairly, can be
prevented. That will not impose additional burdens on commissioners,
nor is the requirement to comply with procurement law and best practice
new. The Secretary of State already issues guidance on that—the
PCT procurement guide, for example—with which PCTs are expected
to comply and which was introduced by the previous Government. I hope
that, with those explanations, hon. Friends will join me in ensuring
that the clause stand part of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000070">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Subsection
(3) provides that regulations made under clause 67 on procurement,
choice and competition that apply to commissioners could include a
power for Monitor to declare a contract or other arrangement for the
provision of services invalid. The power would be a back-stop provision
and there would be restrictions on its use. The regulations would
ensure that commissioners procured services effectively, in line with
best practice and in patients’ best interests. For example, they
might provide that commissioners should not restrict tenders for
services to existing providers unless they could demonstrate that doing
so would benefit patients. Limiting potential providers could deny
patients access to treatment at home or innovative treatments, for
example.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000109">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If a provider
breaches regulations on procurement, it is unlikely that Monitor would
declare the arrangements for a particular service invalid as a first
step. As subsection (4) makes clear, regulations would have
to set out the circumstances in which Monitor could do so, as well as
restrictions on its use of the power. Subsection (4) 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 445<a class="bkMark" name="Column445">&#160;</a>
                  </div>also makes it clear that Monitor could use the power only where it was
satisfied that a commissioner had failed to comply with requirements in
the regulations and that the failure was
significant.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000110">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For
example, if a commissioner tendered a service, failure to consider one
of the tenders would be significant. However, if a commissioner made an
error in procedure, Monitor might conclude that in that particular case
the failure had not had a significant effect on the outcome of the
exercise. In such circumstances, it would not set aside the
arrangement, but take other action, such as reminding the commissioner
of the relevant provision in the regulations or directing it to take
steps to prevent the failure in
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000111">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
would be further constraints on Monitor’s exercise of any power
conferred on it by regulations under subsection (3). The Committee has
discussed Monitor’s main duties at some length. Monitor can set
aside any arrangement that commissioners have made only in furtherance
of its main duty to protect and promote the interests of patients by
promoting the economic, efficient and effective provision of health
care services. If it were relevant to a specific case of a breach of
the clause 67 regulations, Monitor would also have to take account of
its duties to enable integration of services and any relevant matters
in clause
58.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000112">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Since we have amended the Bill such that the
general duties of Monitor in clause 56 are indeed to promote provision
that is economic, efficient and effective, I fully understand why
Monitor should have the ability to say whether a service is
ineffective. The second part of Monitor’s duty is to promote
provision

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
236 would remove Monitor’s power to declare that an arrangement
is ineffective. I understand the Opposition Members may need
reassurance about that power and, as I have set out, there would be
safeguards and restrictions on Monitor’s use of it. It is an
important provision. If a commissioner fails to comply with the
regulations and if that failure is sufficiently serious and has a
significant impact on patients, Monitor should be able to declare the
arrangements for a particular service ineffective. The commissioner
would then have to make alternative arrangements, in line with the
requirements in the regulations. I remind the committee that the
Secretary of State already has that power. In the event of a severe
failure to comply with the principles and rules of co-operation, the
Secretary of State could direct a commissioner to set aside a contract.
Following my assurances and explanation, I ask the hon. Lady to

Minister said. If I have got it wrong, he can correct me as I try to
replay what I think he said. As I understand it, Monitor works with a
constrained set of rules as an adjudicator or referee, which is the
expression I used the other day, and if clear breaches of those rules
occur that can be identified within the tight remit of Monitor, Monitor
has the power to declare a service to be ineffective. I imagine that
the Co-operation and Competition Panel previously had a power to throw
things back at the commissioners in a similar sort of way, but it
lacked any statutory effect. What I am—or think I
am—assured about is that Monitor will not be taking a strategic
view about which services within a local authority are effective and
which are not, but rather it is working within its tight
remit.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000118">&#160;</a>

thought I said. The answer is yes.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000122">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I hope that
the Committee will bear with me while I explain something to the hon.
Member for Easington; I would like to repeat what I said so that there
is no misunderstanding of the tail end of my speech. I think that it is
quite clear, and I assume that my hon. Friends do. I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will also think so once I have repeated
myself.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000123">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
said that if a commissioner fails to comply with the regulations, and
that failure is sufficiently serious and has a significant impact on
patients, Monitor should be able to declare the arrangements for a
particular service ineffective. The commissioner would then have to
make alternative arrangements in line with the requirements in the
regulations, and under these proposals—under this legislation,
if and when it receives Royal Assent—it will be up to Monitor,
not the Secretary of State, to take the decisions in the
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000124">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Just to cheer
up the hon. Member for Leicester West—I think that this is going
to be the end of my debut today—may I say that when
we last discussed this, in March, she seemed to think that I did not
answer her question about the meaning of “ineffective”? I
think she will now agree, having listened to me for the past
10 minutes or so, that I dealt with it during the course of
my comments this afternoon. In the vernacular, it would mean that the
contract was invalid. I urge Opposition Committee members to withdraw
the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000125">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I thank the Minister for his clarification that
Monitor will have an important role in ensuring that service quality is
maintained, because that is one of its main functions. May I ask about
the duty of the Care Quality Commission and Monitor to co-operate with
each other, which is clearly set out in clauses 281 and 282? It does
relate to clause 68, which we are discussing at the moment.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000126">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">How does the
Minister envisage the two bodies working very closely with each other,
particularly in matters of quality, in which they both have an
interest? I am concerned by the lack of communication that has come out
in the Francis inquiry into Mid Staffordshire. I am talking about the
lack of communication between Monitor as it exists now—I
appreciate that its role is changing, but it will still be a body
called “Monitor” with many of the same
functions—and the then Healthcare Commission, which will now be
the Care Quality Commission.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000127">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister reassure me that there will not be a great separation of the
two bodies’ roles, which might mean that they do not talk to
each other—something that would be against the spirit and letter
of the Bill? Will they co-operate in a way that is efficient
and
effective?<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000128">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> As always—for the record, I say this with
irony—the Minister’s great clarity in describing what the
Bill seeks to do has inspired me to stand up and make a couple of
closing points. First, as the hon. Member for Stafford and my right
hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley have said, the Bill does not
guarantee that Monitor will consider quality alongside issues of
efficiency when looking at the competitive tendering of
services.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000129">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
having listened to the Minister’s response, I should say that if
I was a commissioner I would have no idea about the process, whether my
services would come under scrutiny or whether Monitor would swoop in to
say that I had somehow broken the rules and that my services were now
ineffective. What the Minister has described is completely unclear and
so, for clarity of purpose, we should delete this part of the clause.
That is why I wish to push my amendment to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000130">&#160;</a>

regard to the CQC and Monitor working jointly. Let me give him some

There is already a memorandum of understanding that will need to be
updated, and the CQC will remain primarily responsible for quality
regulation. I hope that those examples answer his

                  </strong> I heard your comment during the Divisions, Mr
Hancock, about not having debates on the clauses that we have just
voted on. Earlier, you will have heard the Minister effectively tell us
that all these clauses about competition are not necessary anyway
because of what has been happening for the last few years in the NHS.
We have still not had an explanation about why the clauses are being
included in statutory legislation; perhaps we will never have
one.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000238">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I want to ask
further questions about clause 71. It applies to part 3 of the
Enterprise Act 2002, which sets out the general merger control regime
for enterprises in the UK, to certain foundation trusts. It provides
that that merger control regime would apply to foundation trusts, which
are not enterprises for the purposes of that regime, in relation to
mergers between foundation trusts or between NHS foundation trusts and
other organisations. What are the other organisations in this context?
It also means that the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition
Commission would be responsible for reviewing mergers involving all
foundation trusts, whether or not they were
enterprises.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000239">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
clause has remained in this Bill and there has been no explanation why
any mergers of NHS trusts—and potentially these other
businesses, whatever they are—should be referred to the OFT and
the Competition Commission. That is what the clause says. It is not the
first time that I have brought this matter up in Committee, although it
may be the last time; that depends on how things go from here on
in.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000240">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“Under

powerful point as usual. I would like to add two points: first, does he
fear, as I fear, that the Government want to do this because they are
dissatisfied with the situation that has operated to date? The
Co-operation and Competition Panel has looked at mergers, and that is
all that has been required. It has dealt with them effectively and
successfully, but the Government are not happy because they think that
there are collusive behaviours, which is why the OFT needs to be
involved.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000245">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly, does
my right hon. Friend agree that any legislation that starts referring

things?<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000246">&#160;</a>

My right hon. Friend makes an excellent case. Does he agree that the
potential for the clause to be abused through litigation is evident in
the very fact that exposing NHS foundation trusts to the terms of
enterprise and business will mean that they will be subject not only to
a change in merger control, but to acquisitions, and lawyers could use
enterprise and business, in terms of acquisition law, much more
dangerously?<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000248">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I think they could. The whole introduction of
competition law into health care is contrary to the health
service’s needs and contrary to what is happening in the rest of
Europe. I have a paper about competition law throughout the European
Union; it says that it is patchy, to say the least. Those countries do
not have the law interfering—my words, not theirs—with
health care systems. It does not fit. It does not
work.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000249">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">When
we were taking evidence, I think Professor Field mentioned what was
happening in Holland. If we look at the changes taking place in
Holland, we see arguments about people paying health insurance, the
different categories of payment and what is expected from the health
service. In my view, that is completely different from and alien to the
NHS as we know it now. It is a major step on the NHS to put legislation
around our health care in a Bill such as this. Inevitably, lawyers will
want to see what this means and what the implications are. Given that,
from what I have read, there is nothing of this scale anywhere else in
the EU, I do not see the need to have it in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000250">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Further to the point I made earlier, is it not
also the case that if foundation trusts have the wrong constitutions,
by changing the wording to enterprise and business there is potential
for litigation, which can externally change the constitution of a
trust, making it easier to acquire under acquisition law? What is more
thought-provoking and scary in this process is the civil service, in
this instance, gold-plating the copy and paste scenario of competition
regulation from Europe. We have asked questions about that, but
Ministers obviously have no clue about it. This is yet more
gold-plating of European regulation without any interpretation by
anybody.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000252">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> That is true, and I shall let my hon. Friend look
at the studies that I have been reading on competition law and health
care throughout the EU. From what I have read in recent months, the
Bill is alien to health care throughout the EU—for the life of
me, I cannot understand why we are putting all these clauses into the
Bill, unless we are enticing and encouraging lawyers to start crawling
over it.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000253">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let me go back
to clause 71. It has not changed; the OFT and the Competition
Commission will decide whether NHS trusts could or should merge with
other businesses. Hopefully, the Minister will tell us what those other
businesses are.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000254">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I do not want
to delay the Committee; I do not think that we had enough time to
debate the Bill the first time around, and we certainly do not the
second time around. My hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd brought up
the Co-operation and Competition Panel, which was a big issue in the
health service and in the Future Forum. As I said, the proposals for
introducing competition as laid out in the Bill still, in my
view—although some people may be happy with them
now—potentially destabilise the NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000255">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The Government
allegedly accepted that the Co-operation and Competition Panel should
remain within Monitor; that was confirmed in an earlier sitting of this
re-committed Bill Committee. If the Co-operation and Competition
Panel’s position inside Monitor has the statutory underpinning
contained in the Government document that was published on the same day
as the Future Forum report, what is the clause telling us or telling
the panel? In my reading of the situation, it is telling the panel that
that is a sop to the Future Forum, and that nothing will stop the OFT
or the Competition Commission from looking at mergers between NHS
trusts or with other businesses. I firmly believe that that is still
one of the biggest question marks hanging over the future of our NHS.
That is particularly true because this has not moved in any way, shape
or form, but Monitor will allegedly be taking these decisions in
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000256">&#160;</a>

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 452<a class="bkMark" name="Column452">&#160;</a>

Committee since the re-committal of the Bill about integration and a
more integrated service, I do not see how the OFT and the Competition
Commission will make that easier—I suspect that they will make
it much harder. My hon. Friend has every right to talk about trusts
that are not viable at the moment. They would need to seek, as the NHS
has done in the past, to work out an integrated service for them to
join with other local trusts, so that they—and, in particular,
the services that they provide for patients—could be protected
and looked after. These are not matters for lawyers. I want the
Minister to stand up and tell us why this clause—it has a
different number on it; it is now clause 71, not clause
65—remains unamended, when so many so-called concessions were
made to the NHS about the introduction of
competition.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000258">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I have a small point to make. I take on board what
the right hon. Gentleman has said about the mechanism through which we
should treat mergers, and I will not say anything about that. While he
was speaking, however, I was alerted to the use of the term
“businesses”. When I first read subsection (3), it seemed
to imply that an NHS foundation trust and a business are one and the
same thing. I do not think that the legislation intends to make that
easy equation, however. I assume that two such bodies are intended by
the Government to be distinct things, and I would like that to be
confirmed. Presumably, using the word “business” as a
synonym for the NHS foundation trust would have different consequences
from not doing so. Equally, the terms “enterprise” and
“activities” are used. Now, two different NHS foundation
trusts are two different “activities”; I understand that.
Are they in strict legal terms, however, two
“enterprises”? I do not know the answer to that, but I
assume that it is yes. And are they two “businesses”? I
suspect that the answer to that is no, and that the merger regime is a
merger system that applies to both NHS foundation trusts and
businesses.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000259">&#160;</a>

it, the intent of the legislation in front of us now is to maintain
that distinction and to use them as parallel but different terms, but
to treat them as a parallel regime when it comes to mergers, whether
mergers of businesses or mergers of foundation trusts. We can argue

talking about mergers involving NHS trusts. There are still many NHS
trusts around, and there will continue to be, particularly as, I
understand, the time limit in legislation for converting NHS trusts
into foundation trusts is being extended. I can envisage
circumstances—in fact, I can think of examples within my
region—in which there was a merger of an NHS trust with a
foundation trust. That would not be covered, as I see it, by this
clause. What does the Minister have to say about that? Clearly, the
effect of the merger of an NHS trust with an NHS foundation trust would
be almost exactly the same as that of two NHS foundation
trusts.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000267">&#160;</a>

Valley has raised an important point here. It was one that I would have
raised later, but now is the time for the Minister to clarify this
issue. My interpretation differs from that of the hon. Member for
Southport. I do not think that this element of the Bill adequately
distinguishes between what constitutes an NHS body—an NHS trust
or some other NHS provider—and a business or enterprise. It
merely co-opts the language of part 3 of the Enterprise Act, takes the
powers there and applies them to the NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000268">&#160;</a>

conjunction, make it clear that “businesses” does not
mean only private providers or non-NHS providers. It might well mean a
consortium or, as the Co-operation and Competition Panel is currently
looking at, a primary

read this debate, see the legislation and know that henceforth these

Given the point made by the hon. Member for Pontypridd about the

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
would like to start by addressing a question posed by the right hon.
Member for Rother Valley: why do we have 12 competition clauses if
there is no change? That seems to be a key theme of the
Committee’s deliberations on all these clauses. I say to
Opposition Members that the changes are necessary to get the right
institutional framework and independent scrutiny of competition. There
are three clauses that establish concurrency, enabling a dedicated
health regulator to apply the powers that the OFT currently has. There
are four clauses that ensure commissioning will be done well by
replacing the procurement guide and allowing the principles and rules
of co-operation to be applied in a new environment, where the Secretary
of State would not have powers to direct commissioners, as he can now.
Consistent scrutiny of mergers, which we will discuss in detail, is
provided for in clause 71, and I will set out the Government’s
response to Opposition Members’ concerns. There are 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 455<a class="bkMark" name="Column455">&#160;</a>
                  </div>three clauses that provide for independent, informed review of how
competition is developing and of how Monitor is performing. All those
are in the public interest, and there are provisions to ensure
co-operation between the OFT and Monitor.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000275">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It useful to
rehearse such points for those who follow the back and forth of the
Committee, and the clauses are in the Bill for those reasons. I will go
one stage further, however, because the right hon. Gentleman also
returned to his concern that surely, by the simple act of repeating
powers that are concurrently operated by Monitor and that are already
exercised by other bodies, there is an invitation, in some way, for
that to be interpreted as competition being extended. Let me be
absolutely clear: the existence of a sectoral regulator does not mean
that the courts are more likely to decide that competition law applies.
Competition authorities and courts consider the facts on the ground
when applying the law, regardless of the institutional arrangements for
its enforcement.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000276">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This is simply
about putting in place institutional arrangements, which, I should add,
have wide support outside the Committee. The NHS Confederation, in its
written evidence, said:<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000277">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Southport asked
about “other organisations”. I would like to address that
and go on to say something about the terms “business”,
“enterprise” and “activities”.
“Other organisations” simply refers to businesses for the
purposes of the Enterprise Act 2002, so it would only apply where a
foundation trust is acquiring the business or part of the business of
another body. To avoid doubt, I make it absolutely clear that the
legislation would not permit a foundation trust to merge with a private
entity or be acquired by one.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000281">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In terms of
“business”, “enterprise” or
“activities”, what do FTs count as? Foundation trusts are
principally public benefit corporations providing NHS services. That is
important, not least in terms of the misrepresentation of the impact of
lifting the cap. Of course, any resources that are secured by a
foundation trust must be delivered and used in a way that furthers that
principal purpose as organisations. That gives us pause for thought on
some misrepresentations that have been made about the intentions behind
that. Whether a foundation trust could be considered as an enterprise
in whole, in part or not at all, would depend on its activities. As
that would depend on the facts of each case, there is uncertainty about
whether the Enterprise Act would apply. Clause 71 means that the
uncertainty would be 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 456<a class="bkMark" name="Column456">&#160;</a>
                  </div>avoided by bringing mergers involving foundation trusts under one
regime. This is about removing uncertainty, which I understand that the
Opposition may wish to maintain for their
purposes.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000282">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Questions have
been asked about the role of the Co-operation and Competition Panel,
and there was an exchange on 7 July between the right hon. Gentleman
and the Minister of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for
Chelmsford, which was reported in that day’s <em>Hansard,
</em>column 336. That exchange dealt with this very point. I will not
read it out, but I commend it to the Committee. Let me try to
paraphrase it. It states that the Co-operation and Competition Panel
and the Principles and Rules of Co-operation and Competition remain.
The CCP will no longer look at foundation trust mergers. Instead, we
propose that that should be dealt with under the single regime set out
in this clause. That no longer disadvantages the NHS foundation trusts
vis-à-vis the private sector, as my right hon. Friend said in
his response to the right hon. Gentleman last
week.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000283">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Having
responded to all the questions, let me now set this clause in context.
The clause applies merger control regimes for enterprises in the UK to
mergers involving foundation trusts. That means that the OFT could make
a reference to the Competition Commission to review the merging of
activities involving foundation trusts to test whether they give rise
to a substantial lessening of competition. However, the OFT has a
discretion not to refer where patient benefits outweigh the adverse
effects on competition. Patient benefits would include consideration of
availability of patient choice and greater innovation and provision of
high quality services. A merger can include the merging of some or all
activities in an organisation—for example in partnerships and
joint ventures—and not just mergers of whole
organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000284">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The clause
means that we would have a single regime for merger control, which
would avoid duplication of resources between Monitor and the OFT, and
it would also address the current situation whereby the Co-operation
and Competition Panel formally assesses all mergers involving acute or
foundation trusts where the turnover of the combined entity is more
than £70 million. The OFT would only consider mergers—I
have already made this clear in response to the issue about private
acquisitions—where the body being acquired had a turnover of
more than £70 million or where the resulting share of supply
exceeded 25% of the market.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000285">&#160;</a>

                     </span>

was so keen to have the opportunity to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000287">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
practice, this would mean that the OFT would consider fewer mergers
between foundation trusts than the panel currently does. A single
regulator would present a significant improvement on the current
arrangement, whereby both the Co-operation and Competition Panel and
the OFT could end up considering the same merger as has happened for a
merger of foundation trusts that also have significant private
incomes.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000288">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
might be suggested that Monitor should therefore consider all
mergers—NHS and private. However, there are several
complications with this approach. First, mergers are a specialist area.
The OFT is the expert. It is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 457<a class="bkMark" name="Column457">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the regulator of mergers in all types of services including those which
have a separate sectoral regulator. With the lower number of mergers
that would be caught under the higher threshold, Monitor would struggle
to build up the expertise to consider these
appropriately.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000289">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Monitor
would only be the regulator of health care services in England.
Complicated arrangements involving the OFT would therefore be required
to address mergers between providers of health care services, social
care services or health care products. Private and voluntary providers
could undertake such mergers, whereas foundation trusts would not.
There would also need to be special arrangements for mergers involving
organisations in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland or
overseas.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000290">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
the OFT has an established reputation for effective, light-touch
regulation where mergers are concerned. This gives confidence to
providers that might be considering a merger and ensures that mergers
that are in the patients’ best interests go ahead. None of this
would enable a foundation trust to emerge with a private company or to
be acquired by a private company. A foundation trust would still be
able to enter into a joint venture with a private provider or acquire a
private company or part of one.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000291">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Therefore, it
seems a far better use of resources to maintain the responsibility and
expertise within the OFT. As part of its investigation, it would engage
with Monitor as the sectoral regulator in order better to understand
the services involved. It would obtain Monitor’s view on how a
merger would affect competition and whether it would bring benefits for
patients. These views are then considered in its analysis, along with
other evidence. That is what this clause does. It does not do the
things that some Opposition Members have suggested, and I am grateful
for the opportunity to clarify the matter. I recommend that this clause
should stand part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000292">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">First, the
Minister confirmed in respect of the use of terms such as
“business”, “enterprise” and so on that the
OFT might consider an enterprise—in this case, a foundation
trust—acquiring the business of another body. However, he did
not explain what he means by “business” in that context.
Does it mean, for example, part of the activity of another NHS
provider? Is that what is meant by “another body”, or
does that phrase relate solely to private companies? I assume that it
cannot, but I would be grateful if the Minister clarified that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000294">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
he said that foundation trusts may be considered to be enterprises.
That is another new piece of information to us, and it bears out what
we said in the earlier debate. The Bill is starting to describe and
interpret the NHS for the courts in a manner that it has not done in
the past. That is deeply worrying in terms of future challenge by
courts and lawyers.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000295">&#160;</a>

is deeply unclear. Will “businesses” apply to other NHS
providers? It must, judging from the comments made earlier by
Ministers. It must refer on occasion to the sort of merger that the
Co-operation and Competition Panel considers: for example, between
primary care providers in Birmingham and foundation trusts in
Birmingham. That is precisely the sort of thing that the panel has
considered.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000300">&#160;</a>

also learned that in future, the Co-operation and Competition Panel
will not consider mergers at all. They will now be the responsibility
solely of the OFT, or, I presume, partly of Monitor and partly of the

question: what on earth will the Co-operation and Competition Panel do
in future? We have been told that it will be maintained in
what it does and put on a statutory footing, and that Monitor will
“work through it”, in the words of
the Secretary of State. However, if the Minister reads what the panel
has done in the year or so since it was set up, he will see that it has

               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister’s previous point was genuinely astonishing, to use a
word of which my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester West is fond. I
apologise if I slightly misquote the Minister, but he spoke quickly and
I may not have taken his words down entirely accurately. Broadly
speaking, he said, “The OFT will only look at mergers where the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 459<a class="bkMark" name="Column459">&#160;</a>
                  </div>body involved in the merger had a turnover of more than £70
million or took up more than 25% of activity.” A financial
threshold to determine the OFT’s involvement is totally
new.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000304">&#160;</a>

research in preparation for the Committee. The clause applies the
OFT’s function to look at mergers, so I am surprised he is not
aware that that is the threshold set by the OFT when it looks at
mergers.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000305">&#160;</a>

If the Minister reads the Competition Act or the Enterprise Act, he
will fail to find a specific reference to a financial threshold of
£70 million. I would be surprised if old legislation, or any
legislation, had a specific number. I suspect that the figure might be
in regulations, which get updated, or in some other form of OFT
guidance. I am convinced that the threshold has previously been applied
only to mergers of public or private bodies that have absolutely
nothing to do with the NHS. That is the key
point.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000306">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The Minister disagrees, but the OFT, as far as I am
aware, has not investigated or ruled on any merger between NHS
foundation trusts or other NHS bodies, so it cannot be true that the
threshold has ever been applied in the NHS. I am prepared to believe
that the OFT might do so in future, but frankly, when the civil
servants helpfully handed a note to the Minister to give him the
numbers, I suspected the numbers were a straightforward read-across
from regulations or some other statute on the operation of the OFT in
the commercial world in which it normally operates. It is not something
that has ever been applied in the NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000308">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Crucially, in
that case, what is meant by “25% of activity”? I presume
that in other businesses it is meant to be used as a guideline to
determine whether a potentially monopolistic cartel or potential
monopoly is being created. I presume that such a threshold might be
used in the case of BSkyB, but I cannot imagine that 25% of activity in
the NHS has ever been defined in statute. If it has, I will be grateful
if the Minister explains it to
us.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000309">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> We can take two views on this matter: there is the
conspiracy view, which is popular with Opposition Members, and there is
the view that such complex legislation always has some rough edges that
need to be refined and perhaps explained. We have argued for the
overall benefit of a sectoral regulator that will keep the OFT at bay,
so I find it problematic that we seem to have indirectly unearthed an
area in which the OFT and the sectoral regulator will work side-by-side
on big mergers—or they might start working side-by-side, but the
sectoral regulator could be edged out and we would be left with
judgment by the Competition Commission. I need to be persuaded that
there is a good reason for doing
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000310">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will reread everything that the Minister said in the cold light of day
tomorrow, and no doubt he could try to convince me again, but there are
three reasons why that might be a problem. The Competition Commission
has absolutely no history of doing that sort of work— 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 460<a class="bkMark" name="Column460">&#160;</a>
                  </div>mergers between NHS trusts. I phoned the OFT and said, “Can you
put me through to the section that deals with health matters?”
They said, “We haven’t got a health section.” I
said, “Could you do health at all?” I did not get much
further than the switchboard because they could not think who to put me
through to, or of when the OFT had previously done anything to do with
health. I need to be persuaded that the OFT has any relevant
experience. Even if it did, I think the Minister said that it would
need to balance a range of factors—patient access, competition,
and so on. That is a different sort of expertise from knowing
competition law and raises the question whether the OFT has
the required expertise.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000311">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That matters
because I am thinking of real examples of mergers of trusts in, for
example, parts of London, where financial constraints have bitten and,
for better or for worse, trusts have already merged in a variety of
ways to sustain existing hospitals. Some of the trusts that have merged
have done so ill-advisedly and are still in financial trouble, but I
can think of other, smaller foundation trusts that might want to merge
with bigger trusts to become more financially viable. Clearly there
will be a process of consultation and that will have to be harkened to,
but what if it produces a result that the OFT does not like?
Is that a possible scenario? Those are legitimate concerns that I would
like the Minister to
answer.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000312">&#160;</a>

Co-operation and Competition Panel? It has about 15 or 20 people who
are genuine experts in health care from different disciplines, who
bring to the table a rounded view of the needs of patients and an
understanding of how hospitals and primary care work. Is he concerned
that those people will be frozen out of looking at mergers? Apparently
they will be kept doing something else—we do not know
what—but the OFT has no expertise to fill the
gap.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000313">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> There may genuinely be a reason why the Co-operation
and Competition Panel cannot deal with mergers involving NHS foundation
trusts. That is in the heading of the clause, which is about not
businesses or private firms, but NHS foundation trusts. There may be
some reason why the panel cannot do that, although I do not understand
what it could be. Perhaps it is because NHS foundation trusts will want
to run alongside, do business with, or in some way take other over
bodies that are not NHS foundation trusts. That is not, however, the
heading of the clause. There may be some reason unknown to me why
another body can do that work a lot better. It seems to me that the
case has not been very well expressed or teased out, although perhaps I
have not understood it. It does give sustenance to the, hopefully
deluded, conspiracy theory across the way that the provision is based
on the premise that NHS foundation trusts will ultimately become just
businesses.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000314">&#160;</a>

me start with the right hon. Member for Rother Valley and his question
about the BMA, what it has said and what I have said about its
position. At that point, I was talking about concurrency. I was
responding to his question about why there are 12 clauses in the Bill
that deal with competition matters. I specifically referred to the fact
that the BMA, the King’s Fund and the NHS Confederation, as well
as the NHS Future Forum, have made it clear that they see the virtue
and value of concurrency. I am not claiming more than that for the
BMA’s position, and the right hon. Gentleman has rehearsed some
of the other
points.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000325">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Let
me go through some of the issues. There is about an hour and half to
go, and I want to ensure we make progress as well. The Bill does not
change the status of foundation trusts and enterprises. That is not
true now and will not be once the Bill is enacted. Clause 71 removes
uncertainty by having one regime for mergers. The hon. Member for
Pontypridd asked about the meaning of businesses and other NHS bodies.
Let me restate that clause 71 covers mergers between two foundation
trusts. When other organisations are involved, I put on the record
again that it simply refers to businesses for the purposes of the
Enterprise Act 2002, so it would apply only where a foundation trust
was acquiring the business or part of the business of another body. To
avoid doubt, legislation would not permit a foundation trust to merge
with or be acquired by a private entity.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000326">&#160;</a>

the Member for Stafford asked about mergers involving NHS trusts. We
would not expect NHS trusts to be subject to the Enterprise Act. NHS
trusts remain under the Secretary of State’s powers of
direction, and such an arrangement is unlikely, so we have no plans for
mergers involving NHS trusts to be referred to the

announced new policy today, which people have not heard before. That is
that the OFT will decide on mergers over £70 million. He likes
to give out the figure from the Enterprise Act, but that legislation is
nothing to do with hospitals; it covers other sectors. Does he not
understand
that?<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000334">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> We are exploring how clause 71 applies to mergers
between foundation trusts, and we are explaining how we move from the
current arrangements to the arrangements that require concurrence. That
is what we are debating at the moment. I am clear that that provides
the basis on which we have a single regime for dealing with mergers. We
use the expertise accumulated by the OFT for that purpose. That goes
back to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Southport.
The point here is that, because the threshold is higher, fewer mergers
are likely to be referred in this process in the future than are
currently considered by the Co-operation and Competition
Panel.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000335">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Pontypridd asked about what the CCP will do in the future.
That is an important question, because it allows us to demonstrate that
the role of that body goes well beyond considering mergers. It does
much more than that—indeed, it is undertaking a major review of
PCT procurement and contracting practices in respect of patient choice
of independent sector hospitals for elective care. That report will be
published later this month. It deals with a number of other matters
that cover the 10 principles and rules set out and established by the
previous
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000336">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The Minister is in government. He says we are
exploring the impact of clause 71, but we are not. He is asking the
Committee to vote on the clause and to get it through. It is quite
clear from what has happened today that he does not know or understand
the impact of the clause. He has given a new figure, which has never
been given before; he has just picked it out of two other Acts that
have nothing to do with the NHS. He is giving to a body that has no
expertise, knowledge or influence on the NHS the responsibility to make
decisions on mergers of hospitals. That is the truth. He should not be
exploring the impact of the clause as he goes along. He should be
withdrawing it from the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000337">&#160;</a>

be exploring, but the Government are clear, and I have set out very
clearly the Government’s position on why the clause is
necessary, why it establishes certainty where there would otherwise be
uncertainty, and why, if the Opposition had been doing their job at an
earlier stage, they might have noticed that these figures were there.
We have spelt out clearly today how the OFT regime would apply. Having
set it out, responded and not satisfied the Opposition, I urge that the
clause stand part of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000338">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I have already
set out the importance of effective independent evaluation, and
amendment 237 would hinder that process. The power to impose financial
penalties on organisations is a backstop that can be used to ensure
that they have delivered what is required from them. Without that
provision, the Competition Commission could not guarantee that it had
access to the information that it required to produce an accurate and
effective review. The Competition Commission has never used those
powers in any of the market investigations that it has undertaken, but
the powers need to be provided as an incentive.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000411">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We expect that
the Competition Commission will be able to gather much of the
information that it requires from Monitor, so we have made provision in
clause 72 for Monitor to provide information and assistance that the
commission requests and other information that Monitor considers would
be useful in carrying out the review. In other words, sector-specific
knowledge and insight will be integral to this process.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000412">&#160;</a>

effective evaluation of changes to the NHS. I urge the hon. Member for

however. They were not designed to catch

Minister to be able to give a simple answer. Why should the Competition
Commission have any role in reviewing how competition is developing in
the NHS? What expertise, experience and knowledge does the Competition
Commission have? Throughout the course of this Bill, both Ministers
have failed to answer that simple question.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000418">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> This is the clause that puts into statute the
issue of Monitor’s duties to co-operate with the Office of Fair
Trading. Subsection (2) lays out the three areas in which it must
co-operate. Will the Minister explain why that is the case, given the
debates that we have just had on issues involving NHS mergers and so
on? Does the need to co-operate go wider than mergers? If he explained
briefly, it might help the Committee to scrutinise the Bill
further.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000563">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I am grateful for the question. The clause
requires the Office of Fair Trading and Monitor to co-operate with each
other in the exercise of their concurrent functions under the
Competition Act 1998 and the Enterprise Act 2002. Specifically, each
must give the other any information that it holds that the other might
require or that it considers might assist the other in the exercise of
its functions. That could include information about particular patients
if relevant to deciding a case. Both parties, however, would be bound
by requirements on confidentiality in their use of that information.
One organisation would also be required to provide the other with the
assistance that it may need to exercise its functions.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000564">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The clause
will help ensure that the OFT and Monitor work effectively together in
exercising their concurrent functions, and, with regard to our recent
debates, it will ensure that there would not be an overly burdensome
approach from these organisations. Much of the information needed to do
the relevant work could be acquired, and in terms of Monitor, there
would be insights to gain from a specific sector regulator,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000565">&#160;</a>

Competition Commission and the OFT fit with the Public Bodies
Bill—currently being debated in the Chamber—which
proposes to merge the OFT and the Competition Commission? There would
be a new body responsible for mergers of trusts, which would undertake
reviews on competition. We do not know what is happening with that; nor
do we know what that new body would look like. Will the Minister tell
us what the impact will be on this Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000566">&#160;</a>

information. Although her question warrants a more substantive
response, because there are two Bills going through Parliament that
deal with different aspects, we expect no change in the functions of
the regulator in relation to these mergers. In that regard, there is no
direct consequence for this legislation whatever, but I will respond in
further detail in writing.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000567">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Clause
100 and clause 101, which we will come to next, are the only two
clauses that we will look at in the re-committed Bill that deal with
licensing directly. However, in total, there are 28 clauses in part 3,
chapter 4 of the Bill, that address this issue—the licensing of
any body or institution that provides services to the NHS. It is an
important part of the Bill, which has become more important as we have
listened to today’s debate. Confusion is emerging on the part of
the Government about how mergers might be scrutinised between NHS
licence-holders and about whether they will be scrutinised by the
sector-specific regulator, Monitor, or by someone else. I am not in any
way shape or form confused. The confusion perhaps prompts the question
of how wrong it was of the Government to recommit the Bill so
partially. We are allowed to debate only two clauses here today. We are
not allowed to look at the clauses that establish what is meant by
licensed conditions, and we are not allowed to talk about the parts
where it refers to exemptions—where service providers to the NHS
might not be required to be
licensed.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000600">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
received from the Minister, the right hon. Member for Chelmsford, a bit
of an indication of the Government’s attitude to scrutiny and
the extent to which the Government need to worry about it when he said,
“We’ve got the votes.” I thought that that was
telling about the attitude of the Government.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000601">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We will not be
able to look at lots of the important clauses, but we can look at
clause 100. Clauses 100 and 101 are back in Committee because they are
part of the Government’s attempt to spin the fact that they have
put competition back in its box and it no longer applies. We heard last
week and again today that Monitor is no longer about promoting
competition but about preventing 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 474<a class="bkMark" name="Column474">&#160;</a>
                  </div>anti-competition. Last week, I expressed real scepticism as to whether
there was a real difference between those two things, especially when
this underpinning power of Monitor has not changed. The debate we have
heard today has increased my certainty that there is no fundamental
difference and that the core of the Bill remains entirely
unchanged.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000602">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
the clauses on licensing give the Minister a chance to get to the
bottom of this and to tell us in hard detail exactly what the change in
emphasis and in wording around Monitor’s duty will mean in
practice. It is in licensing where the practical impact of
Monitor’s decision either to promote competition or prevent
anti-competition will come to be seen. It is also in licensing an NHS
provider that we will start to see what is really meant when the
Secretary of State talks about Monitor acting “ex post”
as opposed to “ex ante” as it was originally conceived.
The nature of the conditions and the contractual obligations that are
placed on providers are one of the key means by which Monitor might
impose those conditions and seek to level the playing
field.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000603">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause
100 as amended would give Monitor the power to include a special
condition in a licence for a provider. It says that Monitor may only
exercise a function to which this section
applies<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000604">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“for

interests of people who use such services.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000876">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Having read that, one
has to ask what has changed. Monitor, in the pre-pause Bill, was still
able to set conditions for the purposes of promoting competition in the
provision of health services. What is the practical impact of that
change in emphasis? Is that the key piece of evidence that the
Government present to demonstrate that they have listened and thought
and made substantive changes? If it is the key change in emphasis on
the part of Monitor, the Minister has conceded—as David Bennett
has conceded—that the powers of Monitor have not changed one
jot. The emphasis may have changed. The Minister can help us to
understand how in licensing we will see that shift in emphasis carried
out. What are the special conditions that Monitor might have set
previously when it was going to promote competition that it will not
now
set?<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000605">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> That is precisely what I was asking for: not
necessarily the specifics—down to what hospital the Minister
might be talking about—but what sort of special condition
Monitor would have been able to set, to promote competition, that it
will not now be able to set. What special conditions will it now set to
prevent anti-competitive behaviour?<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000607">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">How does the
setting of such special conditions, up front in the licence to a
provider, square with what the Secretary of State said, which was that
Monitor would now only operate ex post—after the fact—to
tackle evident problems where integration or collusion, depending on
one’s point of view, was not in patients’ interests?
Surely the fact that such conditions are going to be written up front
into the contracts that the licensees have to sign to provide services
to the NHS is definitely ex ante—I am sure that that is how the
Secretary of State, with his penchant for Latin, might describe
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000608">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">How on earth is
that reconcilable with the notion that Monitor is only now, with its
new riding orders, going to come in after the fact where there is a
higher burden of proof, as David Bennett put it? I intend to come back
to those questions when we come to the specificities of clause 101. For
the moment, maybe the Minister could set the scene by clearing up that
particular
fog.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000609">&#160;</a>

trying to knit fog or smoke in his earlier presentations to try to

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I find it
extraordinary that, in his exposition of what clause 100 is all about,
the hon. Gentleman completely glosses over—completely ignores,
it seems—the changes that we have already made to earlier
clauses of the Bill that fundamentally change the purpose of Monitor.
That goes to the very heart of the point that he grudgingly
acknowledged in his closing remarks, which relate to the exchanges that
took place in the evidence sessions when we heard, very clearly, from
Dr Bennett. He
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000611">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Secondly,
it significantly raises the burden of proof on us. If we
feel—normally working alongside the commissioning
board—that the use of competition is a way of furthering the
interests of patients, the burden of proof that that, rather than other
ways of furthering such interests, is the right way to go is
significantly higher. That is the other key thing that has
changed.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Health and

                  </strong> I will happily give way to the hon. Gentleman in
a moment. The clause has to be understood as a power, but a power that
can be exercised by Monitor only in the context of a higher burden of
proof and the changed purpose of the organisation. It is no longer an
organisation with the mission of promoting competition; first and
foremost, its purpose is to protect and promote the interests of
patients, and to enable integration. It is a significantly different
organisation in terms of how it exercises its licensing responsibility.
Does the hon. Gentleman want to clarify his
position?<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000614">&#160;</a>

spend an appropriate amount of time on these clauses. It worth noting
that licensing is an important part of the Bill. While we agree with
that, it is slightly at odds with the fact that Opposition Members
spent only 75 minutes scrutinising 28 clauses on licensing when we
considered them at the previous Committee stage. Given that Opposition
Front Benchers, at the conclusion of the previous Committee stage, said
that every inch of the Bill had been scrutinised, they clearly thought
that 75 minutes was sufficient to cover 28
clauses.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000616">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">The
clause sets out the purposes for which Monitor can set or modify
licensing conditions. It gives Monitor powers to do the job of
regulating NHS services effectively and appropriately limits the areas
in which Monitor can act via the licence.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000617">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That means
that the licence can only make requirements relating to certain
functions—regulating price by, for example, requiring providers
to adhere to the national tariff or to comply with NHS standard
contracts, which was an example that may have been missed; preventing
anti-competitive behaviour that acts against patient interest;
protecting and promoting patient choice; ensuring continuity of
essential services; overseeing governance by, for example, ensuring
that all providers have broadly the same level of regulation regarding
their organisational form and structure; maintaining the register of
foundation trusts; operating the licensing regime by, for example,
compelling providers to pay licence fees to Monitor; and for the
purposes of discharging Monitor’s general duties of protecting
and promoting the interests of patients for the purposes stipulated in
regulation.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000618">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The clause
also prevents Monitor from setting and modifying licence conditions
that place particular groups of providers at an unfair advantage or
disadvantage compared with other groups. For example, it must not, in
exercising its functions under the clause, place private providers at
an unfair advantage over public providers in relation to providing NHS
services. We have already discussed some of the powers in detail and we
will discuss others as we consider later parts of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000619">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Overall,
in broad terms, the clause balances the desire to ensure that
regulatory action is appropriate, targeted and does not exceed the
boundaries of the role prescribed by the regulator with the need for
efficient regulatory action in relation to Monitor’s core
duties, which I have just described and which the hon. Member for
Pontypridd did not seem to think were at all relevant to interpreting

need to put a few points of clarification on the record. First, the
Opposition may have scrutinised the clauses for only 75 minutes in the
previous iteration of the Committee, but we now appreciate how much
more significant they are in the light of the confusion that we have
heard today and previously. Secondly, the Minister again drums out the
line about the higher burden of proof for making a
determination.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000624">&#160;</a>

300-clause Bill was put in front of us with new clauses and hundreds of

scrutinise it as a Committee should, and

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A moment ago,
the Minister took umbrage at my suggestion that he was using the
phrase, “burden of proof” a lot, but we have heard that
phrase a lot. I come back to it because we had never heard the phrase
before David Bennett used it when he gave evidence to us the week
before last. Subsequently, the Ministers’ mantra seems to have
become that captured somewhere in the Bill is a higher burden of proof
that Monitor has to adhere to in order to demonstrate whether it can
intervene.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000630">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">All it says in
the Bill is that Monitor needs to be mindful of whether acting in order
to promote competition, or rather to prevent anti-competitive
practices, will be in the interests of patients. There is no further
explanation of what is meant by “burden of
proof”.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000631">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">More
importantly, we return to the question of competence. Exactly what
expertise and competence does Monitor, which consists essentially of
economists, have to judge whether the decision that it is making to
promote competition or prevent anti-competition will impinge negatively
on the patient experience, the quality of the clinical service being
offered or outcomes? That is what the Minister suggests Monitor will
do.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000632">&#160;</a>

will make my point to the hon. Gentleman, and he can respond if he sees
fit. He knows, because he was in the Committee last week, that we moved
amendments requiring Monitor not just to take patients’ views
into account but to involve clinicians. Those are 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 478<a class="bkMark" name="Column478">&#160;</a>
                  </div>significant improvements to the Bill that address that very concern,
which he does not seem to realise has been
addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000637">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I remember that, because I recall that I asked the
Minister whether he could tell us how much extra money it would cost
Monitor to build in all those extra levels of bureaucracy and clinical
consultation. Notably, he did not respond to my question whether the
OFT, which we learned this afternoon will have a crucial role in
deciding whether mergers will affect the clinical services offered to
patients in a given area, will have to take clinical advice. I would be
grateful if he answered it at some point
today.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000638">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
other critical question is this. The Government have given us the
impression—the Secretary of State said it explicitly—that
Monitor is moving from an ex ante position of reviewing competition and
its impact to an ex post position. The Minister did not answer my
earlier question, so will he tell us how that can be squared with the
setting of conditions in the licence for a provider of NHS services up
front—or definitely ex ante?<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000639">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I am happy to deal with a couple of the points
made by the hon. Gentleman. I reiterate that the Bill’s initial
Committee met for 28 sittings; it was the longest Committee since the
Criminal Justice Bill of 2002-03, which met for 32 sittings. It is not
the case that, as the right hon. Member for Rother Valley suggested,
ample time was not given to scrutinise the Bill; ample time was used by
Opposition Members to scrutinise the Bill, as acknowledged.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000640">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman had an exchange with the Minister, my right hon. Friend the
Member for Chelmsford, about the question whether Monitor will be
involved before or after. My right hon. Friend said that the ex ante
regulations would help prevent restrictions on competition from
arising. Monitor will be able to set licence conditions to enable
integration in a way that benefits patients and does not improperly
restrict competition. As a result, the need for a competition regulator
to intervene and apply competition law is less likely, reducing the
risk that competition law will be applied in a way that fragments
services, is not integrated or restricts competition to the detriment
of patients.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000641">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman also asked what no duty to promote competition will mean for
licensing. As a result of our proposed amendments, Monitor would not
have a duty to promote competition. In other words, it would not be
Monitor’s role to maximise opportunities for competition or to
increase competition in the NHS. For example, in licensing providers
Monitor would have no power to require an incumbent provider to make
its facilities open to a third party for the purpose of increasing
competition.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000642">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Monitor would
retain a role in addressing anti-competitive conduct that acted against
patients’ interests, however. It would still be able, for
example, to set licence conditions preventing providers from
restricting patient choice, and to facilitate patient switching. Those
are the answers to the hon. Gentleman’s questions.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000643">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To underscore
that, the OFT has to take clinical advice; in considering matters it
must consider all the relevant issues. It will seek views from others
where it is appropriate to do so and where it needs those views to 
<div class="columnNumber">

               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 46,
which I would like to address now, was proposed as part of a package of
amendments aimed at altering the scope and duties of Monitor, to
address concerns about its competition functions and accusations that
the Bill would pave the way for privatisation. That concern was
reflected in the previous Committee, in the listening exercise and duly
in the NHS Future Forum report. It was not the intention of the Bill,
as previously drafted, to pave the way for privatisation, but because
the Government are committed to responding to such concerns we are
proposing a raft of changes to the Bill to make that absolutely clear.
I will deal with them shortly, but first I want to outline my reasons
for resisting amendment 46.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000655">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 46
has been tabled to address concerns about Monitor’s power to
require that a provider grant access to its facilities to another
provider. The amendment was proposed to answer the concern that if that
power had remained, it might have resulted in NHS providers being
forced to hand over access to their facilities and equipment to private
providers. Although we remain clear that Monitor would have used that
power only where there was spare capacity and where other conditions
were met—concerning, for example, supporting patient
choice—we accepted in our response to the NHS Future Forum
report that this provision should be removed.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000656">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">As I said, the
Government accept the NHS Future Forum’s advice that we need to
provide additional reassurances to address concerns about potential
privatisation. Not only do the Government amendments propose to remove
Monitor’s power to require that one provider open up access to
its facilities to another, but they do so in a way that is more
comprehensive than that set out in amendment 46. As a consequence of
our amendments, Monitor will not now have power to regulate access to
facilities as a mechanism for increasing competition, even where that
would help to increase patient choice.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000657">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">With our
amendments, we aim to achieve greater clarity by going one step
further. I will deal with each one in turn. Government amendment 162
specifies that<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000658">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Monitor

               </p>
               <p>to
require that an existing provider give access to its facilities to
another provider. Government amendment 163 removes the
detail about how that power would have been exercised, and in deleting
both subsections (3) and (4) it does so more comprehensively
than amendment 46, which would delete only subsection (3).
These amendments will help to ensure that NHS facilities are utilised
for the maximum benefit of NHS patients and that facilities that are
funded through charitable donations are used as

also propose to amend clause 147. Amendment 190 will confirm
that the definition of “facilities” is the same as that
set out in the 2006 Act, so that amendments 162 and 163 do
not contradict existing principles and rules for co-operation and
competition, principle 7 of which prohibits unreasonable refusal to
supply services where such a refusal would restrict choice or
competition against the patient

               <p class="tabbed">New
clause 6 will give further reassurance on cherry-picking. It forms part
of a package of amendments that introduce new provisions to better
enable Monitor to prevent cherry-picking. The NHS Future Forum set out
significant concerns about the risk associated with not having
sufficient safeguards to prevent
cherry-picking.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000661">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s position is unequivocal: competition should be on
quality, not price. Providers should be paid a rate for their service
that accurately reflects the cost of treating the case mix of patients
using that service. That is an area in which we have listened to
concerns and looked to strengthen the Bill, and our response is
supported by Professor Steve Field’s evidence to the Committee.
He
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000662">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“I
am extremely pleased at the way Government have responded. Particularly

cherry-picking”.<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report,

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
I said, new clause 6 forms part of a package of anti-cherry-picking
amendments, the majority of which amend chapter 5, which we are yet to
debate, in addition to a number of non-legislative interventions. I
will, therefore, set out the context by briefly describing the
anti-cherry-picking amendments that we have tabled to chapter 5. I will
outline our additional non-legislative interventions,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000663">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">First,
the prevention of cherry-picking is supported by wider changes to
Monitor’s duties. For example, the amendments will, if accepted,
place a specific duty on 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 481<a class="bkMark" name="Column481">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Monitor to ensure, when setting the national tariff, that providers
receive fair reimbursement for their work, taking into account the
clinical complexity of the cases that they treat and the range of
services that they offer. That will be complemented by the duty our
amendments will place on the NHS commissioning board to standardise
service specifications across the country with the aim of increasing
the number of services subject to national
tariffs.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000664">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
prevent cherry-picking, we also propose to strengthen contractual terms
to require providers to accept patients referred to them unless there
is a genuine overriding clinical concern. Additionally, we will also
ask the royal colleges and other professional clinical bodies to
undertake work to identify the procedures most at risk of
cherry-picking and to prioritise work on payment by results to ensure
that fair prices are set for such procedures from
2013-14.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000665">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Taken
together, the proposals will give Monitor the power to act to prevent
and combat cherry-picking by adjusting tariffs. To prevent
cherry-picking, however, Monitor first needs to identify it—that
is, Monitor needs access to the relevant information from providers.
That is where new clause 6 comes in. This new clause in chapter 4,
which sets out Monitor’s licensing regime, will require Monitor
to include an anti-cherry-picking condition in all licences. The
condition will work by requiring licence holders to act transparently
when using criteria to determine patient eligibility for particular
services, for accepting or rejecting referrals and for determining the
manner in which a patient is to be treated. That transparency
requirement will apply wherever services are subject to patient choice
of
provider.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000666">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
provision will work on a number of levels. First, it will be a breach
of their licence for a provider not to set out any referral or patient
eligibility criteria in advance. Secondly, the requirement for
providers to disclose their eligibility and selection criteria to
Monitor, and to apply them in a transparent manner, should help to
ensure that patients are not rejected by the provider of their
choice.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000667">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Thirdly, as I
have noted, such transparency will provide Monitor with the information
it needs to work with the NHS commissioning board to assess the impact
of patient selection on the variation between providers in the cost of
delivering services. It will, therefore, enable such bodies to work
together to adjust the tariff according to the case mix any one
provider chooses to treat, which will ensure fair reimbursement for
efficient services. The net result will be to minimise the scope for
private providers to profit from cherry-picking the simplest, cheapest
cases at the expense of NHS hospitals and patient
choice.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000668">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Together
with the amendments on pricing, the provision will help to ensure that
taxpayers get what they pay for and patients get fair access to the
services that they wish to use. I ask Opposition Members not to press
amendment 46, which is deficient where our amendments are
sufficient. I urge hon. Members to support our
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000669">&#160;</a>

together, in a similar fashion to the Minister. If I may, I will also
set them within the context of the clause. I will of course leave it

debate.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000670">&#160;</a>

important in terms of the distinction between promoting competition and
preventing anti-competition. When pressed last week to give a practical
example of what such a change might mean, the Minister turned to the
area of licensing, specifically the changes to clause 101. In
<em>Hansard</em>, at column 381, the Minister said that Monitor could
not<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000671">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“disapply
a particular set of licence conditions to a certain group of providers
in order to make it easier for them to enter the
market.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Health and

381.]<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000880">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>When I
asked him where to look for that in the Bill, he said that it was in
clause 101(1)(c), which
reads:<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000672">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
standard or special conditions of a licence under this Chapter may in
particular include

               <p class="hs_brev">(c)
requiring the licence holder to do, or not to do, specified things or

services for the purposes of the
NHS”.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000882">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
was very grateful to the Minister for pointing me to that paragraph. I
confess that I had not previously interpreted what I thought was a
fairly innocuous part of the Bill as being the part that, unless
amended, would allow Monitor to rig the market in favour of a
particular sort of private provider—a new entrant, I presume. I
was not aware that that was what that paragraph meant, but clearly it
did. The Minister went on to say that even if Monitor had previously
been able to do that, as he suggested, it would not be able to do so
any more, by virtue of his amendment 161, which changes “promote
competition” to “prevent anti-competitive
behaviour”. How exactly will that take effect? How does it
change Monitor’s powers simply to remove the words
“promote competition” and replace them with
“prevent anti-competitive behaviour”? How does that stop
Monitor, as the Minister said, disapplying a particular set of licence
conditions to a certain group of
providers?<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000673">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Other
parts of the Bill imply that Monitor cannot vary conditions in order to
facilitate the entry to a market of a specific set of providers, as
designated by whether they are in the public or private sector. I
concede that, but this clause does not do that. It seems that in
reality, whatever the change in the words and their implied emphasis,
Monitor will still enjoy the power to intervene in the market where it
perceives there is collusive behaviour between providers and act
through licensing to try to level the playing field. As far as I can
see that is entirely unchanged.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000674">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Monitor cannot
now allow competitors access to facilities solely in the ownership of
existing NHS public providers. The Minister is right to say that that
has been ruled out by Government amendments 162 and 163. In light of
that we will not press amendment 46 because what we sought to achieve
with it is accomplished by the two Government amendments. That is not
to say that Monitor cannot still modify the licence of an NHS
provider—a commissioner, for example—to compel them to
contract with more than one provider. That seems to be absolutely
allowed.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000675">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Where
Monitor might perceive that there is a traditional contractual
relationship, or commissioning relationship, between one NHS
provider—a hospital offering a diabetes service—and
another, such as a GP practice, there is nothing to say that Monitor
cannot consider that collusive 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 483<a class="bkMark" name="Column483">&#160;</a>
                  </div>behaviour, or anti-competitive or not in the interests of patients. That
would especially be the case if Monitor perceived that as
disadvantaging other potential providers in the marketplace; the
marketplace being that particular corner of England, whether Sutton and
Cheam or Chelmsford.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000676">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Point 5.15 of
the Government’s response to the Future Forum report says that
Monitor will be charged
with<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000677">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“tackling
specific abuses and restrictions…to ensure a level playing field
between providers. For example, Monitor could take action against a
provider seeking to frustrate patient choice, or colluding with another
provider not to offer patients home-based
treatments.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000883">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>I
did not insert the word “colluding”; that is the
Government’s
word.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000678">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
takes me again to the example we offered. I know the Minister is wary
of taking specific examples about particular clinical services. He is
certainly loth to take up our example of diabetes. We have already
offered the example of renal services. I know from my experience in
industry that there has been a traditional, fairly long-running dispute
between NHS providers of haemodialysis in hospitals and other private
home-care providers of haemodialysis, and a suggestion that private
providers ought to be allowed to operate because it would save money
and be better for patients. It may well be that it is in the interests
of patients to have home haemodialysis provided for them. I think most
patients would rather have the dialysis machine come to them in the
comfort of their own home. It is perfectly imaginable that Monitor
might think that sort of behaviour—that is, the hospital
refusing to put out its renal dialysis to a home-care
service—might be objected to by patients. It would be perfectly
understandable under the Bill that the OFT or Monitor or somebody else
might consider that to be collusive behaviour, because it is colluding
with another provider not to offer patients home-based
treatments.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000679">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It cannot be
right that the decision that it may be collusive behaviour can be taken
in the interests of patients without thinking about the impact on the
hospital’s haemodialysis provision, nor the impact on other
patients who need to go to hospital to have that provision. That is a
concrete example of where we can see the Bill running the NHS into all
sorts of
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000680">&#160;</a>

I am struggling to follow this argument. The hon. Gentleman is going
round in circles. We have this argument raised every time. There is
actually a clear duty for Monitor to look for value for the patient, as
said in the evidence sessions. When we have a service that is
clinically run, the value for the patient will mean that what is best
for the patient is an overriding consideration. We know that that means
that doctors, nurses and health care professionals will be running the
services and delivering what is best for the patient. A lot of what the
hon. Gentleman is saying is completely
irrelevant.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000681">&#160;</a>

let me give an example. If we are looking for a service where a
challenge to Monitor could be mounted on the basis that a private
provider, or private laboratories offering analytical tests, were
accessing the NHS, this would be a route for it. It could
mount an argument based on value and price. It could match or better
the in-house service without going into all the complications of the

                  </strong> But I thoroughly enjoyed it. I will move on now.
The Minister can dispute it, but the point has been made that there is
a flaw in the Bill in respect of this particular
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000691">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One of the
other changes that the Government have made to this clause is to amend
the language from stating that Monitor “must” include
provisions in setting licensing in respect of (a), (b), (c), (d), (e),
(f) and (g) to stating that it “may” include provisions.
In particular, I would like to highlight the problem that I see that
that poses in respect of paragraph (j), which talks
about<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000692">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the
use or disposal…of assets used in the provision of designated
services.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000884">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Under
this chapter, Monitor may include an obligation on licence holders,
trusts or other consortia to tell it when they are going to dispose of
assets used in the provision of designated or important services. It is
extraordinary that that obligation is merely to be that they
“may” have to tell Monitor when they have decided to flog
off a particular asset that is crucial to a designated service. Surely,
they should be obligated to do so. That takes us to the example that we
used earlier; St George’s healthcare trust has decided to sell
off £509,000 worth of its beds to a Dutch agri-business and then
rent them back. Under the clause Monitor would not necessarily have to
be told about that—it just might have to a set an obligation on
the trust to do so. Does the Minister think that is sufficiently
robust?<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000693">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
contention is very simple. When there is the possibility of licence
holders selling off assets, be they buildings or
beds—<em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>
                  <em>]</em> From a sedentary
position the Government Whip says, “Under Labour’s
provisions.” I agree. These things were permissible under
Labour, but I do not think we saw any hospitals flogging off half their
beds under Labour. That probably speaks to the change of culture. More
importantly, it is only really the Southern Cross debacle that has
alerted those on both sides of the Committee to the real risks posed by
modern forms of financing, such as releasing equity through assets or
securitising debt against buildings. It is a serious point. We have
said very straightforwardly that the Bill does nothing to prevent that.
Therefore should not the Government think about putting clauses into
the Bill to prevent the things that have happened with Southern Cross
from happening in the NHS? That is not a party political point. It is
just an observation that those on both sides of the Committee should
think
about.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000697">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">New
clause 6 is an interesting addition to the Bill. It places a duty on
the licence holders to set transparent eligibility and selection
criteria to be applied to licence holders when determining<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000698">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“whether a person

               </p>
               <p>and
if so,<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000699">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the manner in
which the services are
provided”.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000886">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>When
I first looked at this I thought that it was positive change to the
Bill. The Minister described it as an attempt to prevent
cherry-picking, which is what I think 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 486<a class="bkMark" name="Column486">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the Government genuinely intend it to do. But the nature of the clause
raises several questions and may also, inadvertently perhaps, give
licence to what I would consider to be undesirable and localised
rationing of health services by the NHS and other providers. What might
be the rationale for denying a patient access to cost-effective
treatments other than NICE having determined through its guidance that
such patients would not benefit from the treatments and therefore
should not have them provided to them? Otherwise surely the NHS assumes
that all patients are equal and ought to have cost-effective care
extended to them free at the point of
need?<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000700">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
the new clause is not about adhering to mandatory NICE guidance, which
is already enabled in legislation, what is it about? What is it there
to do? Perhaps there is some thought to allow providers in this
respect, as in other aspects of the Bill, a greater degree of autonomy
in terms of who they afford care to and which patients they treat. Is
there a reason for shifting from what we have always understood to be
the arrangement: if it is cost-effective and NICE says that patients
X,Y and Z should get it, why should other patients not get
it?<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000701">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
it does not state anywhere in the Bill that the licence providers will
have to publish such criteria. It says they must have them and it says
they must be transparent, but it does not say that they need to publish
them. Can the Minister clear that up and let us know that they will
have to publish the criteria so that we can see precisely why a
treatment is afforded to patients or not? If it is transparent and
uniform across the country, it would be a welcome change because the
current procedure whereby local decisions are taken at the margins of
NICE guidance around exceptional cases, for example, is unhelpful.
Effectively a postcode lottery applies at the margins of NICE guidance.
If this is an attempt to clear that up, it would be
good.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000702">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Lastly,
will the specific transparent eligibility criteria be uniform? Will all
NHS providers and all licence holders have the same criteria? That is
unclear in the Bill and prompts the question whether one licence holder
might set a different set of eligibility criteria from another. That
would be worse than the current situation, because there would
effectively be a licensed postcode lottery as opposed to the unlicensed
one operates through exceptional case
reviews.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000703">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
me go through the various questions of the hon. Member for Pontypridd.
He asked whether there was a difference between promoting competition
and acting to deal with anti-competitive behaviours, and there most
certainly is. The changes that we have proposed to Monitor’s
overarching duty will impact on the exercise of all its functions and
will particularly impact on how Monitor prioritises the use of its
limited resources. It will also profoundly impact on Monitor’s
tariff-setting functions, because Monitor would not be able, for
example, to set tariffs for the purpose of stimulating new entry 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 487<a class="bkMark" name="Column487">&#160;</a>
                  </div>from private providers. In licensing, the change will impact on the
nature of the licence conditions that Monitor could impose. As I have
already said, Monitor could not impose licence conditions for the
purpose of increasing competition, and it is worth repeating the
example that Monitor could not force an incumbent provider to divest
itself of a particular service or require a provider to grant
third-party access to its
facilities.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000707">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked whether Monitor could arbitrarily intervene in
markets, and he wanted to see that tested. Monitor can only intervene
where it can demonstrate that patient interests are being harmed. Its
decisions could be challenged by patients, commissioners or others with
sufficient interest. Things are very different in the way the Bill is
now drafted, because Monitor no longer has a duty to promote
competition actively, but rather it has a simple duty to deal with
anti-competitive behaviours and to enable integration, all of which is
seen through the lens of promoting and protecting the interests of
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000708">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked about St George’s healthcare trust, and the
first thing to say is that the matter is one for the trust, not for the
Department. It takes place under current arrangements. The trust took
the decision under its own authority. It did not require approval from
the Department of Health or the strategic health authority. Leasing
arrangements are common in the NHS, but any contracts must meet the
twin criteria of delivering value for money and transferring a
significant amount of risk to the private sector supplier. Sale and
leaseback arrangements are acceptable under the current arrangements if
they meet those criteria. It is not some imposition or new invention;
it currently exists within the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000709">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked whether new clause 6 promotes rationing. That is,
to be honest, absolute nonsense, but I understand that the hon.
Gentleman wants to ensure that there are no unintended consequences.
Let me reassure him that the new clause 6 is concerned with
transparency only and would confer no power whatsoever on Monitor to
determine a patient’s eligibility for particular treatments.
NICE guidelines will of course be a fundamental part of
providers’ decisions. However, they do not cover all
specialities or
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000710">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
the hon. Gentleman asked whether eligibility criteria will be
published. Given that they are not intended to be such criteria in the
way that he has described, they will not, but we would expect Monitor
to require providers to publish selection information of the sort that
I described
earlier.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000711">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
hope that that has answered the hon. Gentleman’s various
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000712">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It is important to set the record straight on a
couple of things. An earlier intervention raised a spurious example
about blood gas and how that may be affected. Blood gas machines are
actually fully automated in all hospitals, and they have nothing to do
with mainline pathology services. It is worth setting the record
straight about what actually happens on the front line by using
front-line experience, because if there were more of that feeding into
what happens in the Committee, we would make better progress and get

reality. I suspect that if the policy were not applied in this manner,

very straightforwardly, seeks to omit subsection (12) of clause 113.
That in turn omits section 52 of the National Health Service
Act 2006, which makes provision for failure of NHS foundation trusts.
We suggest that reverting to the situation that pertained under the
2006 Act is a good idea, because the Government have failed to bring
forward any proposals in respect of the failure regime. We do not know
what the Government propose to do in the event of failure and, as we
have heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Islington South and
Finsbury, there are at least 20 trusts teetering on the brink, as we
speak. This provision allows for directors to be removed and for
interim directors to be appointed. The lack of a failure regime is a
big hole in the middle of the Bill, which is why we suggest, as belt
and braces, that the Government return to 2006 and the Act that we put

reforms were to succeed. That is directly relevant to what we are
discussing in the clause. The documents obtained by <em>The Guardian
</em>revealed that civil servants have warned Ministers that<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000727">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“markets are

               </p>
               <p>That
seems, on the face of it, to contradict directly the assurances that we
have received in this Committee from Members and Ministers.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000728">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“The

               <p>The Opposition oppose
the measures set out in the insolvency arrangements, but I would be
interested to hear from the Minister an explanation of how the
insolvency regime that he has described fits in with the Prime
Minister’s public service reform agenda as set out in a
statement to the House of Commons yesterday.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000730">&#160;</a>

for regulations concerning much of the Bill. We have heard that not all
the Future Forum recommendations are reflected in the Bill; some will
be introduced in another place, and some will be implemented through
secondary legislation. However, it is important, if we are effectively
to scrutinise the Bill, that we have information about the failure
regime. We need to know how it will apply to the NHS and whether it
will conflict with the statement given to the House of Commons

Committee members, not just Opposition Members, must consider the
proposals in the Bill, many of which are unclear. We are being asked to
make a judgment without all the information. It seems bizarre to me
that failure is a sign of success if we follow Tory principles. I have
heard of the concept in fashion—not that I am much of a fashion
victim—that brown is the new black, but when failure is a sign
of success, it is difficult. It is said that failure is a sign that the
free market is working. That might be all right if we are dealing with
white goods or lesser issues, but an issue of such critical importance
to everybody in this country cannot be left to free market disciplines.
Labour Members reading the Prime Minister’s comments yesterday
and the clauses on insolvency today can only assume that the
introduction of insolvency provisions is intended to make it easier,
not harder, to close hospitals. Is that the new Tory ethos for our
public services?<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000732">&#160;</a>

we know that that is not the direction of travel of this

yesterday that for nurseries and schools and so on a failure regime was
essential in order to encourage new entrants into the market. Well, if
it applies in those sectors, is it not reasonable to assume or suspect
that there is an intent that it should apply in the NHS?<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000734">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Has the
Minister discussed with No. 10 the fact that a reformed health market
will look to prevent service closures, if what he is telling us it
true, and will therefore not represent the free market with real
competition at all? The insolvency clauses are about putting
competition above the interests of patients, directly against what all
the evidence suggests. It is an attack on in-house NHS provision of
service, which has been described by Government as monolithic, and it
is about opening up the structure of the NHS to private providers,
creating a fluid market. The clause is about making the NHS work for
profit and commercial interests and has nothing to do with improving
the quality of
care.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000735">&#160;</a>

right.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000736">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 47,
which is at the heart of the debate that we are having now, seeks to
maintain Monitor’s statutory power to intervene formally in an
NHS foundation trust by retaining section 52 of the 2006 Act. We agree
that it is essential that, in the event of a provider failing, Monitor
can intervene. In such circumstances, the overriding priority will be
to protect patient interest by ensuring continued access to essential
services for patients. It needs to be able to intervene in this way
whenever a commissioner asks for its help to protect continuity of
services. Under the provisions currently in the Bill, Monitor would
operate a distress regime and will be able to require specific actions
to address the situation before an organisation actually
fails.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000745">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our goal
remains clear. It is to avoid failure. Failure is the last resort, not
as the hon. Member for Easington suggested, some sort of desired
outcome. When Opposition Members lecture this side of the Committee
about failure regimes, it is worth remembering that the idea of a
failure regime was first floated in 2003 by the then Labour Government
when they introduced foundation trusts in the first place. It took six
years for the Labour Government to come up with any details of what
that failure regime looked like.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000746">&#160;</a>

original proposals, and we have heard worries about the practicality of
our current proposal for an up-front system of designating services for
additional regulation. We propose to table amendments to the Bill,
taking those concerns into account and are therefore developing a
regime in which providers who experience difficulties receive early
intervention to help them to
improve.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000747">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> No. If, despite that, a provider should fail, we
will ensure patients’ access to essential services. The
intention of the Labour Government in introducing foundation trusts,
which is supported by the present Government, was to make NHS providers
accountable to their local community, instead of looking to Whitehall.
Foundation trusts’ unique governance structure was designed to
do exactly that. They recruit members from their local community, which
in turn elect governors to represent their views and hold the
trust’s board to account. Governors who are elected by the
public and staff already have powers to hold foundation trust boards to
account, and we are taking steps to clarify and strengthen their
role.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000749">&#160;</a>

will be tabling amendments to extend the transitional powers of
intervention over FTs, which are provided for under the Bill. Our
proposals are to support the NHS to be stronger and more accountable,
and to help improve care and outcomes for patients. It is for those
reasons that I urge members of the Committee to reject the amendment

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point about
how we have to ensure as we implement the Bill that we avoid such
unintended consequences. We are committed to making sure that the
failure regime that we introduce is robust. It is about improving
services and improving organisations’ chances of succeeding in
the future. With that, I urge hon. Members to reject the amendment and

                  </strong> Pricing is vital to the Bill, which is why it is a
shame that we do not have more time to discuss it. It is vital in terms
of basic economics, because of the relationship between price and
competition, and vital because David Bennett, the man in charge of
Monitor, has repeatedly said that he thinks price and price competition
are very important. He has previously
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000795">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“I

               <p>His
saying those things started our grave concern that the Government are
seeking to use price as a means of increasing competition in the NHS.
The Government have subsequently sought to address that concern by
amending the Bill, and the spin on that has evolved over the past
couple of months.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000798">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Crucially, the
word “maximum” has been struck out of the Bill, so there
will now not be maximum prices. We have also heard rhetoric that
suggests that price competition has been ruled out—that is the
phrase that Ministers are keen to use. I contend, although I
will not do so at any great length because we do not have time, that
that is unfortunately not an entirely accurate picture of the
Bill’s contents, even in its amended form. Although it is true
that the reference to a maximum price has been cut from the Bill,
different providers and commissioners in the NHS retain the ability to
vary prices, both on-tariff and particularly off-tariff. The only
change is that providers, commissioners and Monitor are at different
junctures in the pricing pathway and are forced to publish where they
vary price. Monitor and commissioners who accept that they will pay a
different price are forced under the Bill to say expressly why they
decided on a varied price and what changes allowed them to shift away
from the tariff price. That is not outlawing or ruling out price
variation. It is simply making it transparent and open that there are
variations in pricing.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000799">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That prompts
very real questions, the most important of which is whether the
Government have got their economics wrong. As a result of transparency,
there will be more information about differing prices pertaining to the
same service or variations in that service in different parts of the
NHS, but will not that new transparency lead to a greater degree of
price competition? There will potentially be a race to the bottom, as
procurers and commissioners choose to pick and demand the lowest price
in health care, just as happens in every other walk of economics and
life.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000800">&#160;</a>

are getting to the section on pricing when we have just
seven minutes left. That is ludicrous in my view. The national tariff
has been an issue in the health care system for years, and it would be
true to say that the previous Government did not get it perfect when it
was first introduced in children’s services. It has been very
difficult. That we have, with just a few minutes to go, moved on into
the whole area of pricing is ludicrous. I hope that people in another
place who have an interest in the matter will take the subject on and
give it the proper scrutiny it
deserves.<a class="bkMark" name="1107135000801">&#160;</a>

deliberation on the Bill today. In that time, we had 22 clauses and a
schedule to consider. It surprises me that Opposition Members did not
have the opportunity adequately to scrutinise all the clauses. It is
down to them to decide how they use their time, and they have chosen to
use it in a way that has meant that some important parts of the Bill
are not being scrutinised. However, Mr Hancock, I will ensure that I
write to hon. Members on the provisions we have not reached, so that

competition. It most certainly does, ensuring that services covered by
national tariffs have a fixed price attached to them that cannot be
altered for the same service delivery. That is an important
element, and I look forward to further discussion on the
matter on Report. In six and a half hours, we have had ample
time to cover 22 clauses and a schedule, and it is a great shame that
some hon. Members have chosen not to use
