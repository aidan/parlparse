<P>
Amendment proposed, [this day]: No. 48, in page 4, line 5, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The Secretary of State may by order provide for a further definition of the words-``a substantial section of, the public in any one or more parts of the United Kingdom.''.'.-[Mr. Heald.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.

<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Heald </B>(North-East Hertfordshire): I welcome you to the Chair, Mrs Michie. We have been on Committees on which you have served as a member and more recently that you have chaired. I know that you will keep us in excellent order.

<P>
I was making the point that the Minister may well have a policy that the obligations and notices that are required under clause 12 should relate to the larger public systems and services, but there are no real safeguards to ensure that in clause 12. An order would be made under the negative procedure and few such orders are ever debated. Although the Minister may feel at this stage that it is right to impose the obligations only on the larger systems, over time criminals may begin to understand that and will use the loopholes in smaller systems to avoid their communications being intercepted.

<P>
It may be trite to say this, but crime fighting, detection and prevention are part of a moving tableau. We must be careful not to argue that we are not going to provide any protections now because we have good, sensible intentions. Later, the imperative of crime fighting, detection and prevention may require rather different approaches and the balance will have to be struck again. In an area like this, which involves fundamental human liberties, important issues relating to freedom of trade and regulation and the legitimate rights of crime fighters, striking that balance should be a matter for Parliament and not for the Minister by his own Executive action.

<P>
We are entitled to know how that balance is struck now, which is not very clear from the clause, and whether it may have to be struck again in future. The amendment would at least give the Minister the opportunity to do that. If the doubts and concerns expressed by the Internet Services Providers Association have any merit, the position may have to be redefined. The Minister must take the power suggested in the amendment or perhaps deal with the matter in some other way in the Bill. We are not satisfied with the answers.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Charles Clarke):</B> May I, Mrs Michie, echo the welcome that the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) gave you?

<P>
I said most of what I had to say immediately before we adjourned. I should like to re-emphasise two points. First, I accept that there is some force in the hon. Gentleman's argument. The situation will change over time. Therefore, we shall discuss the matter further with the internet service providers. I am prepared to consider whether this would be better dealt with under clause 12 and the order process that allows full discussion, or by the device suggested by the hon. Gentleman. On the basis of that assurance, I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> That is a generous and sensible approach by the Minister. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 4, line 39, after ``is'', insert ``reasonably''.

<P>
The amendment relates to clause 2(5), which restricts the definition of an interception by excluding interceptions that relate only to address or logging data.

<P>
The Committee has already decided that reckless interceptions without lawful authority will not come within the ambit of the offences in clause 1. That raises the importance of the amendment. Subsection (5), as drafted, allows interceptions of the content of communications not to be treated as interceptions. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any conduct that takes place in relation only to so much of the communication as consists in any address or other data comprised in or attached to a communication (whether by the sender or otherwise) for the purposes of any postal service or telecommunication system by means of which it is being or may be transmitted;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is not to be considered an interception, nor is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any such conduct, in connection with conduct falling within paragraph (a).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, attempting to find addresses and data
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as gives a person who is neither the sender nor the intended recipient only so much<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
[
Interruption.] Yes. It is saying that such interceptions are not to be considered as true interceptions. The wording is very broad. It means that whenever the authorities want to uncover ``communications data'' and addresses, they can do it by serving a notice under clause 21 in such a way as to require the interception of communications, including their content, so that they can be sieved through in order by serving a notice under clause 21 in such a way as to require interceptions of communications, including their content, so that they can be sieved through in order to find addresses and logging data. Quite large amounts of communications could be read and it would not be an interception because it was necessary to find the addresses and the data within it. This means that quite disproportionate requests to view content in order to find data, although they would offend the structure of clauses 20 and 21, would not be covered by any offence. There would not be any criminal penalty if the content of these communications was read.

<P>
Interceptions of content in order to view ``data'' should be considered as interceptions if they are ``unreasonable'' and ``disproportionate''. They should be subject to the sort of victim protection that is in clause 1. There is also concern about the situation of users and internet services providers with the internet and the use of e-mail generally. If it is not to be treated as an interception of a communication-to intercept it and to read it and to find the data within it-quite substantial quantities of these sorts of interceptions could occur with no real way of tackling it from the criminal aspect.

<P>
This does leave open the possibility that, with advancing software and technology, quite large amounts of content could be sieved through in this way. The concern, as far as the user is concerned, is that he might well lose confidence in the system because he knows that so much sieving occurs. In addition, service providers may lose some of their credibility in terms of the nature and freedom of the internet as a result of that activity. In using their interception capability to find data, they could become overloaded and heavy costs might be involved. This is another sphere in which the drafting is quite broad. We should like to hear what the Minister has to say about the type of interception that he imagines is occurring in the search for data. Does he too envisage some of the risks that we think we have identified?

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, the amendment seeks to add the word ``reasonably'' to the requirement that where a person is exempted from the offence of interception because he intercepts a communication only for the purpose of obtaining communications data, the exemption should apply only to such access to the contents of the communication as are necessary to obtain the data. The hon. Gentleman explained that, and it is clear.

<P>
We assessed the amendment and considered the hon. Gentleman's overall proposal. He seeks to add the test that any access that a person is given to the content of the communication should be limited not only to what is necessary, but to what is resonable. I assume that the intention is to ensure that a person's access to the content of a communication is properly limited-that is what the hon. Gentleman told the Committee-and is only for the purpose of acquiring data about the communication: the addressee is the example that he gave. Although I sympathise with the intention of the amendment, I do not think that the word ``reasonably'' adds anything to the word ``necessary''. ``Necessary'' is a high test, as the hon. Gentleman, with his legal experience, knows. In a slightly different context, the court in Strasbourg described it as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>not synonymous with indispensable, but not as flexible as such expressions admissible, ordinary, reasonable or desirable.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Adding the word ``reasonably'' to the definition that is already there would only create confusion. I accept that that is not the amendment's motive, but I am not convinced that it would clarify the meaning in the way that the hon. Gentleman hopes.

<P>
The other factor that ought to be addressed is one that the hon. Gentleman mentioned in an aside. He said that, in the past, telecommunication systems have tended to pass the content of a communication, and signalling data relating to it, down separate channels. However, in a growing number of modern systems such as those which use packet switching, to which the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor) referred this morning, there is no clear-cut distinction, as was conventionally the case, between the two forms of passage of data. Certain parts of a communications packet may contain either addressing data, or message content. Short of examining that part of the packet, there is no clear way of telling which type of data it contains. That presents a difficulty.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor </B>(Esher and Walton): This is a very complex subject because, in a sense, each packet that is part of a message has its own address on it; it states where it is to go, giving the internet protocol number of the addressee. In that sense, there is an address on the outside of each packet. I am not clear about how one would distinguish between whether one was looking for that address-the ultimate destination of a series of packets which might be taking different routes through different parts of the network-or seeking the information within. An envelope is not a good analogy, but it is sufficient. Would I be looking at the address on the envelope or the contents within? In this instance there would be a multiplicity of envelopes.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heald rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will allow me to give way to the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire and I will deal with both points.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Let us try to characterise the concern a little further. Could a request be made to an internet service provider to intercept vast quantities of communications and their content using modern software to try to pluck out addresses and identities, allowing friendship trees and other invasions of privacy to develop in a fairly indiscriminate way. Can he point to a proper focus that might satisfy us?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The short answer is no. The hon. Members for Esher and Walton and for North-East Hertfordshire asked whether the process provided the back-door route to the interception of content. We believe not. Access to content is limited to what is necessary, and therefore reasonable for the purpose of identifying addresses and other data. That is the legal requirement. Any software of the type that the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire described would need to take account of that legal requirement in the way in which it was operated.

<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Moreover, clause 14(3) requires that any intercepted material or related communications data be destroyed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as soon as there are no longer any grounds for retaining it as necessary for any of the authorised purposes.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the by-product point that was raised in the discussion early this morning and to which I suggested we should return when we reached clauses 14 and 15. Members of the Committee may have comments on it at this stage. Up to a point, the by-product covered in those clauses provides real protection.

<P>
In conclusion, I understand the very reasonable fears raised by members of the Committee, but we are again caught by the fact that unless we can have confidence-as I think we can-that the legislation rules out the back-door way to get information other than what is properly authorised, it will be difficult to find a process, because the technology moves on so quickly that it is difficult to be clear about it.

<P>
We have considered these matters carefully. It is not easy for any Bill to be entirely technology-neutral, but we have tried to draft this Bill in a way that understands how technology is moving and moves forward effectively.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Given that one takes that as a reasonable approach, let us suppose that there were instances where our fears were confirmed. Is there any sanction in the Bill? Clearly, clause 1 is the great protection against unlawful interception. Clause 2 suggests that if one sieves through content in order to find data, one is not covered by clause 1, because it is not considered to be an interception. The provisions in chapter II, dealing with communications data, do not seem to have any obvious penalties for the person requesting the communications data. What is the sanction if someone acts outside the reasonable approach outlined by the Minister? Is there any way to stop overweening or over-mighty power being exercised?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I take the point on sanctions. It is a fair point, but the way to address it is for the Committee to look at clauses 14 and 15 and decide whether the sanctions that they include are sufficient. I think that the hon. Gentleman will concede that action of the kind he described is outside the law of the land and sanctions therefore arise. Two specific instances are raised here: first, action under the Human Rights Act 1998 and issues associated with it, where there are clear sanctions and, secondly, oversight by the commissioner and his assessment of what is taking place. People may be sceptical about that-wrongly so. For what it is worth, my view is that oversight by the commissioner will be an important process by which to evaluate the Bill and see how it matches the various tests that the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire and others will put into practice. They are serious sanctions, but at the end of the day, if the hon. Gentleman thinks that they are not strong enough, he will table an amendment to that effect when we reach the appropriate point in the Bill.

<P>
Leaving aside sanctions, what we have to wrestle with here is the nutty and difficult definitional questions of what is within or outside, the law. The clause as drafted meets the concerns expressed about sanctions, although the hon. Gentleman may feel that the matter should be tackled more directly.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured by my explanation, and that he will therefore withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Obviously, I am reassured by the Minister's gentle words. It is right that his intentions on the matter are limited. I still have reservations about passing a law that gives a wider ambit of power than the Government intend to use. Part of our job of scrutiny is to try to provide powers which match what the Government want to do, rather than giving powers that go beyond that and which in the future we may regret having given.

<P>
Having listened to the Minister, and because we
will have another opportunity to consider the communications data regime in chapter II, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): My first point is about the private telecommunications system, which is defined in clause 2(1). I should like the definition to be clarified; earlier, we discussed whether the proposal includes a family member on an extension in a private home. The explanatory notes state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Private telecommunication system'' is defined as any telecommunication system which is not a public telecommunication system; but is attached to such a system. This means that an office network, linked to a public telecommunication system by a private exchange, is to be treated as a private system. Interception of such a system by other than the system controller or with his consent is a criminal offence. An entirely self-standing system, on the other hand, such as a secure office intranet, does not fall within the definition.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The domestic scenario-two standard telephone handsets attached via extension lines to a British Telecom system-is not mentioned. Is the domestic situation covered as a public telecommunication system rather than a private one? I hope that the Minister will clarify the matter as it is logical and sensible that a private exchange, such as that in the House of Commons and in many businesses, should fall within the measure.

<P>
I am anxious that people living in the same house could bring criminal actions against each other. Is the proposal analogous to the Data Protection Acts? If those principles were applied domestically, someone asking a child for a telephone number from his father's address book could be asked by the child to identify himself with a password, his mother's maiden name and his date of birth and be asked to wait while the child asked for explicit consent to release the information. There is much legislation which, if it were applied to domestic situations, would be nonsensical. I wonder whether the clause is drifting into such a position when we talk about people on extensions being subject to the rules in the proposal.

<P>
It is possible that the European convention on human rights requires us to be generous in giving powers to family members to take action against each other for picking up telephone extensions. I should like to explore that further, as I am not yet persuaded, looking at the explantory notes, that this need necessarily be the case.

<P>
My second point is about the breadth of the definition of what can be retrieved under the terms of the Bill. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``telecommunication system'' means any system (including the apparatus comprised in it) which exists (whether wholly or partly in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) for the purpose of facilitating the transmission of communications by any means involving the use of electrical or electro-magnetic energy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a broad definition about machines that exist to move around data that is held in electrical form. Subsection (7) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For the purposes of this section the times while a communication is being transmitted by means of a telecommunication system shall be taken to include any time when the system by means of which the communication is being, or has been, transmitted is used for storing it in a manner that enables the intended recipient to collect it or otherwise to have access to it.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understand the point of that subsection, which is that e-mail messages sit on a server and they can be collected. However, the proposal also seems to encompass something much larger; increasingly, rather than having their data held locally, people are holding their valuable personal data on servers. In one such model, called thin client because individuals want to be completely free to roam around the globe, they simply access bundles of data via websites or other means. Those data are held on what could be called a telecommunications system within the ambit of subsection (1) because it facilitates communication and the material is stored in such a way that it would fall within the proposed definition. That means that rather than the model of a communication as we would normally understand it-a message passing backwards and forwards-we are enabling the powers to be used against data stores.

<P>
A different model is being developed from the model that would be used, for example, if the police or security services wanted to go to someone's home and gain access to his personal computer. They have procedures for that, but the data that historically would have been stored on the personal computer is now being stored within the telecoms system, and that has wide-ranging implications. Does the Minister also see the matter in that way? Is the scope of the powers restricted to what would normally be called communications, such as e-mails and so on, or does it include data stores? For example, my bank details sit on the bank's server; there is a range of personal data which will grow in time as people turn to models with a service and a server farm that holds all their personal data. They carry around only the small devices that read the data and access the relevant parts.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The view of EURIM-the European Informatics Market-is that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>intermediate storage, such as mail boxes and message transfer agenst would seem to be part of the communications network.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is that the hon. Gentleman's view?

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> It is the view that I am expressing; mail boxes and so on are part of it. The definitions in subsection (7) are deliberately trying to catch mail boxes. That is a relevant part of intercepting communications, in the same way as it may make sense to go to the postal sorting office to fetch messages, rather than waiting until they are delivered to one's address. However, I am anxious that the Bill goes way beyond that to include items that are not usually considered to be messages. For example, I use an internet banking service, which has within it a component of messaging, which the Government may want to access if they suspect me of criminal behaviour. They may want to use the powers in the Bill to read my secure messages saying, ``Transfer £70,000 to Bogota, the shipment is on its way.'' That would be a legitimate use of the powers. However, my banking data, which is not within the normal definition of a communication, may also be stored. Yet if it is stored with something that is defined in the proposal as an instrument that is primarily for facilitating the transmission of communications-the banking authorities' server is such a device-it goes into realms beyond the message store, into the data base, which is covered by other legislation. It would not be relevant if it were held on my personal computer at home, rather than on the banking communications device.

<P>
The breadth of the issue goes beyond the fears expressed by EURIM. There is some justification for including a device that is designed to pick up messages, but there is no such justification in respect of long-term data bases which increasingly will be held on exactly the same communications devices as the message stores.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I think I can give the hon. Gentleman some reassurance. First, on the matter of public-private systems and domestic systems, I am advised, and we believe, that domestic systems are unequivocally private systems. The end of the public system is the network termination point, which is usually the white BT box just inside the front door of a house. Any extensions after that, whether to the PC or anything else, are part of the householder's private system. I do not know whether that is the reassurance that the hon. Gentleman was looking for, but it is the clarification I can offer.

<P>
On the hon. Gentleman's second point we are definitely focused on communications in the sense that he described. Where a communication already exists, clause 1(5)(c) would allow the police to obtain a production order for access, but future communications must be accessed through an interception warrant not through clauses 20 and 21 which relate to communications data. That is how we see it at the moment.

<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised an important point about how technology will progress so that it will be possible to see where data lies within the system. The Bill updates significantly the Interception of Communications Act 1985 which included no such definitions. It is designed to reflect both current and future technology. These are not easy matters to set down in legislation, nor is it easy to predict how technology will move and I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's example on that. The interlocking definitions in the Bill take us forward from the 1985 Act. I hope that reassures the hon. Gentleman to some extent.

<P>
I shall think about his final point about other forms of data to see whether, on consideration, I can give him further reassurance. That said, I hope that the Committee will agree that clause 2 should stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Lawful interception without an interception warrant</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 5, line 19, leave out ``, or which that person has reasonable grounds for believing''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 6, in page 5, line 26, after ``interception'', insert ``, or the communication is one which that person has reasonable grounds for believing is one sent by, or intended for, a person who has consented to the interception;'.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are probing amendments. Subsection (1) of clause 3 designates
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Conduct by any person consisting in the interception of a communication is authorised by this section if the communication is one which, or which that person has reasonable grounds for believing, is both-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) a communication sent by a person who has consented to the interception; and

<P>
(b) a communication the intended recipient of which has so consented.
<P>
It covers situations where both parties consent to the interception, so that the use of, for example, a telephone answering machine would be covered because although the call is intercepted electronically and recorded, the sendor knows that he is leaving a message and the recipient has offered that service to him.

<P>
However, I notice the words
<P>
or which that person has reasonable grounds for believing is included.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not understand what the position would be if someone had not consented, but a person would reasonably believe that he had, unless the Minister can give examples that go beyond those in the explanatory notes.

<P>
In subsection (2) where one party consents to the communication being intercepted and there is an authorised surveillance under way, there seems to be no need for a provision as to reasonable belief in consent because it is not included. The amendments probe the issue by deleting from subsection (1) the need for a reasonable belief and adding it to subsection (2). We want to understand what the Minister and the Home Office are getting at.

<P>
The situation in subsection (2) is likely to involve kidnappers-the example that we were given in the explanatory notes-or blackmail or a stalker using the telephone to leave worrying messages. The victim would agree to interception because he or she would want the person to be caught. I can also envisage circumstances in which people might question whether consent had been given, just as I can under subsection (1). For example, if an interception continued, it might become unclear whether consent had been given. If two parents had different views about the way in which a kidnapping, blackmail or problems with a stalker should be approached, the person undertaking the investigation might have reasonable grounds to believe that consent had been given, but there might be doubt about the matter.

<P>
Equally, if an interception had been suggested by someone conducting an investigation, but the person involved had not given express consent-he did not say, ``Yes, go ahead''-his silence might be taken as consent. If two parents are desperately distressed about the kidnapping of their child, or someone is distressed because of blackmail, or a woman is in a frighteningly distressed condition because of a stalking incident, he or she might not say anything when an interception is suggested, but the officers might think that consent has been implied and go ahead with it.

<P>
The officer, or person dealing with the case, might think that he has reasonable grounds to believe that consent had been given because of the silent acquiescence of the person involved when the question was asked. However, the person involved might not agree when his or her views crystallise, because he or she is frightened that the kidnapper might exact vengeance, or that the secret about which he or she is being blackmailed might be revealed if interceptions occur and the police are involved.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): I wonder whether my hon. Friend, drawing on his knowledge of criminal law, could tell us-if not, perhaps the Minister could do so-whether it is standard police procedure in such circumstances for the officer to ask whether consent is being given. Is that part of normal police practice?

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Yes. Permission would always be asked and, in most cases, there would be no question about it. I am trying to examine the boundaries. Why is it necessary to have a defence of reasonable belief in subsection (1), but not in subsection (2)? Perhaps the Minister and Home Office officials have given that matter much thought and there is a clear reason for that inconsistency, but I should be grateful to hear the Minister's views on it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> May I first deal with the intervention of the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley)? I understand that it is standard police procedure to ask for consent in such cases.

<P>
As the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire said, under the amendment, a person who intercepted a communication with the consent of both parties would be required to establish as a fact that both parties had consented, so removing the defence that he or she had reasonable grounds to believe that such consent had been given. The clause will provide that additional defence for those who intercept a communication with the consent of one party and have an authorisation to carry out directed surveillance. The hon. Gentleman moved his probing amendment clearly.

<P>
In the first case, interception with the consent of both parties occurs every day whenever an answering machine is used to make a recorded message available to a third party. It is impossible for a person using an answering machine to know for certain that every person has consented to his or her voice being recorded on it. People might not realise that the machine had cut in. Therefore, it is important that the defence of reasonable belief exists in such circumstances and that absolute certainty is not required as suggested in the amendment.

<P>
In contrast, to provide such a defence to a police officer who carried out a directed surveillance operation would be equally strange. As the hon. Gentleman said, kidnap is the classic example of a one-party consent scenario under subsection (2). A relative of the victim may consent to the police recording his conversations with the kidnapper on his home telephone. In those circumstances, the police will not reasonably believe that they have the family's consent but can establish that consent with certainty. That takes us to the exchange that the hon. Gentleman had with the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds about the procedures. That is why the two scenarios are different. My officials have thought hard about this to try to get it right. We think that we have got it right. I hope that we have offered some clarity to his questions about the different wordings.

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> If a police officer gets it wrong because he misunderstands what the parents say to him or because they do not make themselves clear, would his defence be that he may not have had lawful authority under clause 3, but that he genuinely believed that he did and so it was not an intentional interception without lawful authority?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> As I understand it, that is right. We are requiring different standards in the different circumstances. The defence would be as the hon. Gentleman suggested.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> My only other question, if the Minister is going to be generous, is whether the answering machine is the only example that he and his officials have come across of a joint consent or are there others? If so, what are they?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> It is the only example that I have in front of me, but I shall try to find out whether there are others, and I shall let the hon. Gentleman know.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> On that basis, I am satisfied. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 6, line 24, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`under the affirmative resolution procedure'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is one of a series of amendments that my right hon. Friend and I have tabled that are designed to ensure that important matters relating to interceptions are debated in the House under the affirmative resolution procedures. As I have mentioned on a number of occasions, these important matters are at the nexus of three key principles: human rights, freedom of trade and the right of crime fighters to the weapons they need. That balance should be struck by the House of Commons and not by others.

<P>
Subsection (1) deals with situations involving telecommunications service providers and others in this country who are required by Governments elsewhere to intercept in accordance with international agreements and regulations that are to be set out under 4(1)(d) by the Secretary of State. The explanatory notes make the point that these regulations would specify
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the conditions under which communication service providers may be authorised to use telecommunications systems located in the United Kingdom to intercept the communications of subjects on the territory of another country in accordance with the law of that country. This subsection applies only where the subject of the interception is in the country whose competent authorities issued the interception warrant. The inclusion of the phrase ``or who the interceptor has reasonable grounds for believing is in a country or territory outside the United Kingdom'' reflects the fact that it will not always be possible to be certain about the precise location of the interception subject.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continues
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The ``interceptor'' is likely to be a communication service provider located in the UK which is either providing a public telecommunications service to another country or is in a business relationship with another communication service provider providing such a service.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It further explains:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This subsection will allow the United Kingdom to comply with Article 17 of the draft Convention-which we were discussing earlier-on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union. This Article, as currently drafted, is intended to allow operators of satellite communications systems to use a ground station in one Member State to facilitate interception using a ``service provider'' (in practice, a communications service provider which is in a business relationship with the satellite operator) located in another Member State.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
It is not clear what conditions the Secretary of State may wish to set. The matter comes under the negative resolution procedure, so it is most unlikely to be debated. First, will the Minister tell us what the generic conditions are, or are likely to be? Secondly, why could we not deal with this under the affirmative resolution procedure? Why should we not debate these important matters? I should also like to know what countries could become involved in these international agreements. If we are referring to countries that are in the European Council area that are required to follow the European convention on human rights, many of us would probably agree that it is perfectly acceptable for us to have reciprocal arrangements.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): Oh.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Not all, necessarily. However, what about other countries? Some countries are not great respecters of human rights, and we would not want our communicaton service providers to be required under this legislation to assist in countries where there are human rights problems. At least the affirmative resolution procedure would give the House of Commons a veto over this particular provision.

<P>
Thirdly, what countries has he in mind? Fourthly, what about the judicial aspect? In Britain, many of us have a great deal of confidence in the Secretary of State because-as my right hon. Friend the Member for Bridgwater (Mr. King) said on Second Reading-we are used to Home Secretaries taking a serious attitude to this issue and doing a proper job. That is true of all Home Secretaries from all parties over many years. People in other countries have so little confidence in their Executives that they have to have judicial oversight, which may be the least bad option. Is the Minister prepared to say that the countries which would be involved in these agreements would have to be countries which either had arrangements at least as good as own own, or independent, high-quality, judicial oversight. In some countries, the judges are as bad as the politicians-although one would not say that of this country.

<P>
We would be interested to know what protections are available. I would not want this country to sign up to an agreement that turns out later to be unsatisfactory. That could force all our communication service providers to take actions that they would find exteremely unpalatable.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I am in a slight procedural difficulty because the third point that the hon. Gentleman made, about the countries with which we are dealing, is also the subject of amendment No. 59.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand your difficulty and, if you are agreeable I think it may be sensible to call Mr Allan first, to speak to amendment No. 59.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That makes sense, and it will facilitate the business of the Committee. I am always keen for that to happen because it enables us to have a sensible comprehensive debate.

<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire raised some of the concerns that caused us to table amendment No. 59. We have agreements with our European neighbours about the exchange of telecommunications data: the explanatory notes set that out clearly in terms of the convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters. No one could fail to wish us to advance on a common European front in the fight against criminality. Interception may be an essential tool in that fight. If all the countries involved sign up to the European convention on human rights, we can be confident that the citizens of every country in the EU have recourse to the same human rights provisions. Our debates have revealed the extent to which privacy has become a human rights issue.

<P>
Clause 4 does not specifically mention limiting agreements to other European countries, so our assumption is that they could be drawn up in any country in the world. We are aware of specific incidences of individuals who are resident in the United Kingdom-I can think of a number of prominent individuals who are opposition politicians in their countries of origin-whose country deems them to have committed a crime and wishes to pursue them, and would seek to involve the UK authorities in interceptions as those people travel the world and use communication systems that are under the control of UK companies.

<P>
We are anxious for a clear statement from the Minister that if that type of interception is requested, or if the UK telecommunications system providers are likely to participate in the interception of individuals' communications, it will not be done in a way that compromises anyone's essential human rights. I hope that the Minister would give us that assurance anyway, but amendment No. 59, or a similar proposal, would make it much firmer because it would put an explicit commitment in the Bill and send a message of reassurance to the telecommunications systems providers, and to countries that may ask us for this type of assistance, that this country insists on the essential bottom line of ECHR security safeguards being in place before we consider co-operating in the interception of communications. Essentially that is the motivation behind the amendment. I hope that the Minister will give the Committee a clear statement of the Government's commitment to not using interception in such a way as to compromise people's human rights, wherever they come from.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Luff </B>(Mid-Worcestershire): May I press the Minister on one point, and underline another made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire? I have read and reread paragraph clause 4(1)(d) part of which reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the situation is one satisfying such conditions as may be prescribed<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The more I think about it, the more important I think it is that regulations be made under the affirmative procedure, unless the Minister can give a clear indication of what, in general terms, the conditions would be. This part of the Bill confers a very wide power on the Secretary of State and the Committee needs to know exactly what the Minister has in mind, and what the draftsman had in mind when those conditions were written into the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I appreciate the procedural change that you made, Mrs Michie, because the issues are related and the points well made.

<P>
I will respond first to amendment No. 59 because I am able to give the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) the assurance that he sought. At present, we intend to use the regulation under clause 4(1) only for the purpose of implementing article 17 of the draft EU convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. All EU member states have ratified the ECHR, yet we intended to leave the clause open to accommodate future international agreements. I mentioned the G8 conference in Moscow last September as an example of the type of international agreement that might arise.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way on that point?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I will finish what I was about to say, after which I will give way to the hon. Gentleman, although I think that I might be about to meet some of the points that he is about to make.

<P>
I appreciate that leaving the clause open means that it lacks the reassurances that are being sought. I can give my own guarantee that the Government's intention will always be to allow the clause to be used only by countries which operate ECHR-compatible regimes. However, I accept that this may not be enough for the law of the land. I therefore undertake to take this away and consider it further. I do not promise to be able to offer the extra reassurances simply because we are trying to ensure that provision is flexible for the future, but I undertake to report back on my deliberations. I accept the power of the point made by the hon. Members for North-East Hertfordshire and for Sheffield, Hallam. It is certainly our intention that the issue should be dealt with by respecting human rights, as suggested. I accept that the wording in the Bill does not meet the point. We will reconsider it and report back to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> On the G8, it is often said that some countries in the G8, such as Russia, might eventually make it G9 and involve another world super-power or most of China. Is the Minister satisfied that G8 should be a basis for this agreement?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am not. The only matter that we are currently considering, as I said this morning, is the EU mutual assistance convention. The reason that nothing else is under consideration at present is the reason implied in the hon. Gentleman's question. I gave that example this morning because I was trying to show why we might imagine agreements emerging in future other than that which we have specified. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that, in any of the agreements that one might enter into, human rights issues are critical. United Kingdom Governments, of whatever party, have always wanted to be associated with other countries. Our historic alliances-NATO, the EU and so on-have been in principle with countries that share our human rights agenda.

<P>
On the third point raised by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire on amendment No. 59, Mrs Michie, I can reassure him that we shall reconsider the matter and return to the Committee to address it more effectively.

<P>
I was also asked what the generic conditions were. The purpose of the clause is to comply with the EU mutual legal assistance committee, which we have discussed. This applies to judicially authorised interception in all member states except the Republic of Ireland, which has a similar regime to the United Kingdom. We believe that clause 4(1) is unlikely to be controversial. It places no burden on industry and is intended to help communications service providers operating in an international environment to meet their obligations to provide lawful interception capability in their countries. It is explicitly limited to situations in which the target of interception is believed to be in the country carrying out the interception; therefore controversy is unlikely to play a substantial part.

<P>
Affirmative resolution, raised by the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff), is an entertaining point that makes for a great debate in the House. No one would argue that a great issue of principle is involved in affirmative or negative resolution. If the hon. Gentleman's conversation with this principal Whip is anything like my conversations with our Whips, usual channels always have something to say about affirmative and negative resolutions, according to the business of the House at a given time under any Government-and entirely reasonably. It is a natural part of the parliamentary process.

<P>
There is no great issue of principle, but there is an issue of judgment about whether the specific issues are more or less likely to excite controversy. therefore it is more or less likely that the affirmative rather than the negative procedure would be used.

<P>
Because of the relative lack of controversy that we believe there will be under the clause and with the assurances that I have given about seeking ECHR compatibility at its core, our belief is that it is on the lower level of controversy in the range of matters that arise from pieces of legislation coming before the House. That is why we have suggested the negative resolution procedure and resisted the affirmative resolution procedure.

<P>
I hope that some of what I have said in response to the third point made by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire and to amendment No. 59 tabled by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam will reassure them that what might otherwise have been controversial issues deserving of the affirmative resolution procedure will not be controversial. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press amendments Nos. 10 and 59.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The Minister has shown good will by saying that he is prepared to reconsider the matter. We will see what he comes up with and reconsider if it is not what we want, but for now, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall allow Mr. Allan to move his amendment formally if he wants to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I shall not press it.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I must inform the Committee that amendments Nos. 8 and 7 have been transposed on the amendment paper.

<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 6, leave out lines 25 to 33.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 8, in page 6, line 25, leave out from ``(3)'' to ``a'' in line 27 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`conduct by any person consisting in the interception of a communication in the course of its transmission by means of a telecommunications system is authorised by this section in so far as it constitutes'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 9, in page 6, line 34, leave out ``any regulations under''.

<P>
No. 11, in page 6, line 25, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`made under the affirmative resolution procedure'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The amendments deal with one of the most important parts of the Bill to the business community. Clause 4(2) allows the Secretary of State to make regulations to authorise legitimate business practice in respect of the monitoring and recording of communications and other matters. Amendment No. 7 deletes that subsection, amendment No. 8 deletes the regulation-making power and adds a substantive provision, amendment No. 11 requires the affirmative resolution procedure to be adopted, and amendment No. 9 is consequential.

<P>
Subsection (2) is designed to enable businesses to intercept and record transactions in the course of legitimate business practice. Article 5 of the 1997 European Union telecommunications data protection directive provides for the exemption, and there is no doubt that it is needed. However, are regulations needed, or can the matter be dealt with by the broad principle being enshrined in legislation? If not, what generic headings would the Minister give to the regulations? If, by the adoption of a broad definition, the interception is not to be left to the courts, should the House of Commons debate the details or must we simply trust the Minister?

<P>
Various industry bodies have had something to say on the subject. EURIM has made it clear that businesses should be able to monitor customer exchanges and internal employee actions. The Alliance for Electronic Business has said that, to check on the quality of services, it is important that the monitoring of calls is allowed. A Mr. Baker of the London Investment Banking Association makes several relevant points. He says that it is important to accommodate certain practices, including
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>firms' in-house taping, storing, and monitoring of telephone calls with clients, counterparties, and others;  in-house monitoring for training purposes;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>exchanges' and clearing houses' taping, storing, and monitoring of communications made via their facilities.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The purpose of such taping, storing, and monitoring is essentially to provide evidence of the transaction or communication in case of commercial disputes or for purposes of confirmation, or for the prevention of fraud or other crime. The London Code of Conduct for principals and broking firms in the wholesale money markets states<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that the Financial Services Authority
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>expects by principals and brokers of all conversations by dealers and brokers together with back office telephone lines used by those responsible for confirming deals or passing payment and other instructions<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The code goes on to say that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>When initially installing tape equipment, or taking on new clients or counterparties, firms should take the necessary steps to inform them that conversations will be recorded and to comply with the other relevant provisions of any telecommunications privacy legislation in force.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The financial services regulators regard taping as a means of complying with their record-keeping requirements. The rules of investment exchanges, such as the London stock exchange may also require their members to tape telephone calls, or the exchanges may tape calls themselves in accordance with their rules.

<P>
Mr. Baker goes on to explain the background to this by saying that, generally, when recording and monitoring are used for such purposes, the firm has the explicit or implicit consent of the users. He makes the point that that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>reflects the Privacy of Messages telephone licensing conditions, which require ``every reasonable effort''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to be made. He also says that customers are generally informed about taping in their written terms of transactions, so it is well known.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Employees are informed, often in their terms of employment  that calls are recorded. However, it may not always be possible or practical to obtain the consent of all parties to a communication that it is recorded or monitored.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Mr. Baker explains that the consultation paper published last year summarised the proposed changes as:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Provision to be made allowing employers to continue recording communications in the course of lawful business practice to provide evidence of commercial transactions or any other business communication, in both the public and private sectors.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He says that that implies a restriction on employer-employee relationships and on recording. He thinks that the industry should be able to rely on the Government to make certain important provisions. First, the exemption should apply not only to recording, but to monitoring, storing and assessing records of communications. Secondly, the legislation should make it clear that the consent of users to recording or monitoring is not required for well-known practices, such as those already described. Thirdly, it must be made clear that the exemption applies to other means of electronic communication as well as to telephone calls. The exemption must be broad enough to cover recording and monitoring of communications in relation to activities that a firm has outsourced or subcontracted, as well as those that are performed by its direct employees.

<P>
Those points have been summarised best by Mr. Baker and LIBA, but they were raised by a number of other industries. Our difficulty is that we do not know the details of the regulation-making power, but we do not have the details. One way around that, as I said at the outset, is to enshrine the principle of the directive in law, by saying ``This is the general principle.'' and leaving it to the courts to establish the detail, or setting out the details in regulations. If I understand the Minister, he has not been in a position to tell us the likely detail of the regulations-I think he said that it would be dealt with by the Department of Trade and Industry.

<P>
Members are entitled to know-as is industry-the broad points that will be covered. The issues that have been raised by so many industries must be covered so that existing legitimate business practices will not be interfered with, fraud can be properly attacked, businesses can monitor and be monitored so that transactions can be proved later and essential statistical information can be obtained. If the Minister will address the points made by Mr. Baker and others, he will deal with the main thrust of the group of amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> It might be useful if I again declare my interest as listed in the Register of Members' Interests: I advise several technology companies and I am a director of others. I make no secret of that-indeed, it is of benefit to me because every time I attend a meeting of these companies, I am educated. One specific company, which does not come under the Bill, but might be thought to, is speedtrap.com, an internet performance measurement company.

<P>
I draw attention to that because, as it grows, the industry looks for automatic tools to monitor performance, say, to discover the number of hits on a particular web page and the type of communications going on, or the reason why particular users are failing to complete transactions once they have gone on to a website. There is obviously a big commercial side to the internet. I am not enough of an expert to explain the many techniques that can be used to track performance on the net, but I am sure that the Minister, after some time with a cold towel round his head, will understand the significance of cookies and other things about which real internet nerds can wax lyrical for hours. The need for the internet industry to increase its commercial aspects juxtaposes the need to build trust and confidence between companies and people who use the net, and companies' need to monitor performance on the net.

<P>
I support my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire in his amendment-I do not know whether he said that it was a probing amendment. We want to find out exactly how the Minister interprets this part of the Bill, and it would be useful if he could make that clear.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> My hon. Friend mentions cookies. My recollection is that cookies are software devices that are programmed into computers to provide marketing information to the company that sold that computer. If I am right, it might be worth hearing from the Minister whether such processes are covered by this subsection.

<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. As usual, he is quick to spot my core point, which is that monitoring will play an increasing role in this industry. How does one capture a remote customer? What is that remote customer's objective? Why did a transaction fail to take place when a person had already got to the web page? What are the attributes of a particular net user and the net system? Is the net system functioning properly, or is it impossible to complete a transaction because it has been badly prepared? All those questions are part of the analytical backdrop to what otherwise might appear to be a series of web pages or communications. To date, carrying out such analysis required the use of a series of super-computers, but increasingly it is being done by systems built into the network-monitoring systems that will eventually be built into the servers themselves.

<P>
I should be grateful for some clarification of a classic issue. The Minister rightly says that technology is moving apace and the Bill needs to be technologically neutral, but it would help if the Minister would clarify the Government's intentions.

<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> This is an important debate. Amendments Nos. 7 to 9 deal with the monitoring of corporate and Government networks for reasons of business practice. The amendments would remove the requirement for such monitoring to be regulated in any way beyond that which was stated in the Bill. The intention behind the amendments is obviously to prevent excessive regulation of business-a reasonable aim, which I wholeheartedly support. However, interception is an intrusive tool that can never be used lightly.

<P>
Article 8 of the European convention on human rights lays down clear requirements that any interference with privacy must be in accordance with law, and necessary in a democratic society. In other words, the law must set out the circumstances in which interception may take place with a reasonable degree of specificity. The telecommunications data protection directive, which has to be implemented by October 2000, requires member states to prohibit listening, tapping, storage or other kinds of interceptional surveillance of communications by other than users without the consent of the users concerned, except when legally authorised.

<P>
This Bill is designed to achieve those objectives. The regulations that the Bill permits the Secretary of State to make will achieve that. Perhaps I should make it clear that I understand that the regulations will cover all the very reasonable points raised by the correspondence with the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire. The regulations will cover all communications, including e-mail, that are resourced, intercepted, listened to, stored and so on in the course of lawful business practice.

<P>
However, the key point is that it is necessary to consult industry properly to ensure that all likely situations are addressed and to protect the privacy of employees. The Halford case-which, as the hon. Gentleman knows, refers to a lawyer with rapier-like intelligence-stated that employers have a right to privacy in the workplace. Therefore there is a wide range of different interests. Later this year, we shall consult widely with all parties likely to be affected, with a view to making regulations that establish the circumstances in which interception may legitimately take place for business practice reasons, but that are not so detailed that they tie up businesses with red tape. We have already received positive reactions to this initiative from the industry, Oftel and the DTI.

<P>
An important consequence of the direction in which the Bill is moving will be to establish a much better dialogue between industry and the Home Office. The DTI is conducting consultation about this whole complicated range of issues. We at the Home Office have found that many of the organisations that have made detailed submissions of the type that the hon. Gentleman read out are happy to discuss these matters with us to ensure that everything is done correctly. That is why the regulations are not in front of us now, and why there is the time scale to which we have referred. It would be ridiculous to consult on the regulations without knowing what the Bill would contain. Equally, it would be ridiculous not to consult on the regulations but just to set them out without consultation. That is why the time scale is as I indicated.

<P>
Unfortunately, the amendments would put businesses in a difficult position because they would tend to remove certainty from the law. It would not be clear whether it was permissible to intercept employees' telephone calls in any circumstances, or to record a customer's incoming call for the purpose of market research or advertising. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is bad regulation that leaves business not knowing what the legal position is?

<P>
Where I think that the hon. Gentleman has justice on his side is in stating that the Committee is reasonable in wanting to look at what the regulations will be and how comprehensively the assurances that I have just given about our intention are needed. Our time scale is justifiably difficult. Sometimes Governments are slow in producing documents and can legitimately be criticised, but this is not one of those occasions. The timetable that we have established for the regulations is reasonable given the need to establish the law before we finally proceed, and the need to consult.

<P>
Later this year, the DTI will be consulting widely with all those who are likely to be affected by the regulations, with the intention of ensuring that all those people are satisfied that the regulations meet their needs. It is a specific goal of the policy to ensure that the points mentioned in the leter will be met. We also intend to limit any such interception to that which is carried out responsibly and with due regard to the privacy of those whose communications are monitored or recorded.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, as I sense that he is reaching his peroration. Article 5 of the directive says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any legally authorised recording of communications in the course of lawful business practice for the purpose of providing evidence of a commercial transaction or of any other business communication.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is he satisfied that the sort of issues that we have been discussing are covered by that? The wording that now appears in subsection (2) is different from that used in the directive because it talks about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Communications by means of which transactions are entered into in the course of that business<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and then goes on
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>or other communications relating to that business or taking place in the course of its being carried on.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why should the wording be slightly different? Secondly, is the Minister satisfied that all the things that Mr. Baker was talking about can be covered within that general description which is in the data protection directive?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I do feel satisfied about this because it is the intention of the consultation to ensure that the regulations meet the needs of the businesses concerned. A key need of the businesses concerned is to have legal certainty about where they stand, in all the fields that were addressed in that communication. We have no motive not to offer that certainty because, were we not to offer that certainty and were we to say that any particular type of communication was not to be included or whatever, that would simply perpetuate problems and difficulty. Therefore I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that, on that front, the various concerns will be met in the proper way.

<P>
With regard to the affirmative resolution procedure, I do not want to repeat what I said earlier about striking a balance on these matters. It is an issue that can entertain us for a good deal of time. The approach that we are taking is precisely to seek consensus with the industry. That is the interest that the hon. Gentleman was seeking to express in his intervention. We are seeking consensus with the industry and we are seeking to meet its points. The negative resolution procedure is a perfectly reasonable way of going about it. On that basis, Mrs Michie, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing the amendment.

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I am reasonably reassured by what the Minister has said, except on the question of procedure. The industry wants to be consulted and it should be. The regulations should meet the requirements of the industry. However, members of the industry are desperate for the Minister to get it right. I hope that it would be in order for me to seek the leave of the Committee to withdraw amendment No. 7; not to press amendments Nos. 8 and 9; and to press amendment No. 11 to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> Not being a lawyer, I am always anxious that legislation is as accessible as possible to the non-lawyers among us. I should like to ask the Minister about the definitions in subsections (6) and (7). Under subsection (6), references to a ``business'' are said to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>include references to any activities of a government department, of any public authority or of any person or office holder on whom functions are conferred by or under any enactment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am concerned. Our debates have focused on commercial activities-and rightly so. The Minister has shown that he is aware of the need to avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens on businesses, which is a recurring theme of our debates. Under the Bill, however, the entire machinery of government seems to be brought in and is called ``business''. That makes me suspicious. Is there no neater way of defining it?

<P>
Is the Minister content with the references to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales in subsection(7)? Why are they specified separately? Does the definition of Northern Ireland properly allow for the ebb and flow of devolution to Ulster in the current state of the peace process? Why are local authorities not specified? Are they covered by ``any public authority''?

<P>
I have read the explanatory notes that the Government have helpfully provided for the Bill, and I understand that references to ``prisons'', ``high security psychiatric services'' and ``hospital premises'' stem from European Court of Human Rights decisions-or considerations related to them. It seems rather odd to deal with them as separate items to be defined in the clause. I hope that the Minister will reassure me that it is just a convention issue. As I said, it seems a little odd to see these highlighted when all other Government Departments are swept up in the omnibus definition in subsection (6).

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> I just want to ensure that the Minister has taken my comments into account, because he did not have time to deal with them in his previous response.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I may as well raise one issue now. The term ``the Secretary of State'' is used throughout the Bill. We have always understood that that means the Secretary of State for the Home Department, or the Home Secretary. However, the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary could be applying for a warrant, as could the Scottish police or Customs and Excise. Will the Minister reassure us that ``the Secretary of State'' intended by the Bill is indeed the Home Secretary? Was it simply not thought necessary to make that clear because everyone understands that the Home Secretary is always intended? Will ``the Secretary of State'' always be the Home Secretary and not the Chancellor of the Exchequer if Customs and Excise goes to Treasury Ministers instead? Could it ever be the Secretary of State for Scotland if the Scottish police are involved? Will the Home Secretary be solely and uniquely responsible for warrants, interceptions and so forth?

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I feel that I neglected my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton in my closing remarks on the previous group of amendments. I did not press the Minister hard enough to respond to my hon. Friend's concerns. I endorse what my hon. Friend said and ask the Minister to deal with the important points that he raised.

<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
In examining the clause, it had not occurred to me that the Secretary of State could be someone other than the Home Secretary in respect of the Bill's provisions on Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. I should be grateful if the Minister would deal with that. It would be worrying for business if the Secretary of State who is making regulations under clause 4(2) were different in different parts of the United Kingdom. It is important for businesses to be certain that the regulations will be the same in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. I would particularly welcome the Minister's response regarding government and public authorities, as well as businesses. It could be a cause for concern if Scottish councils had to deal with different rules from the English ones.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Many points have been raised, so let me run through them quickly. First-I sense a carefully timed ambush.
<P>

<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.

<P>
<H5>4.16 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
On resuming-

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> If I may draw the Committee back to the important and powerful points made shortly before the Division, I shall deal with each of them with the complexity and thoroughness that they deserve. First, the term ``public authority'' encompasses local authorities. Secondly, one set of regulations will cover the United Kingdom.

<P>
On the point made about the Secretary of State-a more serious point-I must tell the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) and the rest of the Committee that several Secretaries of State have performed the functions outlined in the Bill, limited usually to the Secretaries of State for the Home Department, for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, for Northern Ireland and, previously, for Scotland. That is why the term ``Secretary of State'' is used, but one set of regulations will cover the whole country.

<P>
References to the devolved Administrations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are necessary, because the phrase ``Government Department'' would otherwise be unclear. During direct rule, the Northern Ireland Departments continue to operate, but under the supervision of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and, therefore, are covered.

<P>
Article 5.2 of the telecommunications data protection directive allows recording only for ``business purposes'', but Departments sometimes need to record data, so they need to be regulated in the way in which everyone else is for all the reasons that have been given. No real difference exists between investigations into corruption and those into insider dealing in those circumstances. Therefore, we have defined the word ``business'' to include a wide range of organisations.

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> Will the quasi-commercial parts of Government operations be covered?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Yes, they are the operations most likely to be involved.

<P>
The only other issue that I need to address is that raised by the hon. Member for Esher and Walton. I took note of what he said. I have taken advice about cookies. We currently think that cookies involve no interception and, therefore, will not be covered under the Bill. The issue of whether something is an interception, as defined in the Bill, will arise on all new developments. I am cognisant of the points that he made. I hope that the Committee will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I listened carefully to what the Minister said and I am grateful to him for that explanation, but I am still concerned. I am ready
to be corrected if I have got things horribly
wrong. I appreciate that the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will have obligations under the Bill, but I had always assumed-I may be wrong-that if, for example, the Secret Intelligence Service wanted an interception relating to its overseas responsibilities involving people or telecommunications in this country, the Home Secretary would deal with that request and perhaps issue a warrant, not the Foreign Secretary.

<P>
I thought that the Foreign Secretary's responsibilities were highly limited in matters such as warrants and interceptions. Therefore, if the Bill will allow the Foreign Secretary to have equal responsibilities to those of the Home Secretary in the issuing of interception warrants that relate to people or businesses in this country, the Government will drastically widen the Foreign Secretary's responsibilities. As I say, I might be completely wrong about that, but if there is an element of truth in it, I might wish to return to the matter later. I am content with the Home Secretary's responsibilities, but serious constitutional issues will arise if the Foreign Secretary becomes involved in the issuing of interceptions or work under the Interception of Communications Act 1985 relating to activities in this country for which the Home Secretary usually has responsibility.

<P>
I accept that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will be responsible primarily for issuing interceptions that relate to purely internal matters that are requested by the Chief Constable of the RUC. What would happen if a terrorist problem originated in Northern Ireland, but telephone calls were made to people in this country and the RUC required an interception? I assume that the Home Secretary would be involved-to say the very least. I should be grateful if the Minister would comment on that and explain the Foreign Officer's responsibility in such matters.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am fantastically glad that the right hon. Gentleman did not raise such points at 9 o'clock this morning, when I would have had real difficulty in dealing with them. He has much experience of such matters and has made an important point. I shall write to him in detail. I believe that the Foreign Secretary signs the warrant, but concurrence is sought from the Home Secretary on such matters. I am advised that such a process is followed. As the right hon. Gentleman knows, I do not have specific responsibility for such issues. It is a matter for the Secretary of State, so I am not aware of the detail of what happens.

<P>
<B>Mr. A. J. Beith </B>(Berwick-upon-Tweed): Surely the Secret Intelligence Service would not usually apply for a warrant for interception within the United Kingdom. The Security Service would apply to the Home Secretary for it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I believe that the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) is correct about that. However, I shall write to him, too, as well as to other members of the Committee because I want to be sure that what I say is correct in all respects instead of relying on being briefed as we proceed in Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his customary polite and courteous way of dealing with the matter. I accept that he does not have direct responsibility for such matters. I hope that he agrees that an important constitutional point is involved. I accept that it is appropriate for the Foreign Secretary to officially sign off the warrant, but I consider it important in matters relating to the interception of communications in the United Kingdom that the office with the knowledge of such matters and which appreciates the sensitivity of Parliament and human rights is the Home Office. It may get matters slightly wrong on occasions, but it has the primary responsibility for ensuring that everything is done properly. I should be concerned if any provisions of the Bill gave the SIS a new avenue of approach only to the Foreign Secretary, without having to account for its activities to the Home Secretary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I can immediately give the right hon. Gentleman the assurance that that is not our intention. I want to write to him to ensure that what I say is correct in every respect.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I hope that I am not pressing too much on his kindness, but will he consider whether this or other parts of the Bill may give rise inadvertently to the powers of the SIS to operate internally in the United Kingdom? I know that it is my job as an Opposition Back Bencher to find out such matters for myself, but the situation is not clear from the explanatory notes. I appreciate that the Government's intention is not to change the modus operandi of the SIS and the Security Service. They have their respective responsibiities and should co-operate and liaise. One should not be treading on the other's patch or trying to pinch any responsibilities-not that I am suggesting that the parties would wish to do that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> We now have joined-up government.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Nevertheless, I should be grateful if the Miniter would highlight such matters in a note. Naturally, I do not want to receive confidential material: I want material that we can all study. Will he point out any areas of the Bill where theoretically the legal powers of the SIS could, if it wished to be stroppy, be extended if the joined-up government broke down and both parties were not talking to each other? I appreciate how the hon. Gentleman wants the system to operate, but let us ensure that the law does not inadvertently give one agency greater power to operate in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is right to try and make the issue a little clearer. I have sympathy with his perspective, but I do not think that the Bill will lead to the danger than he suggests or even that it creates a change in that respect. However, his question brings out a significant point of which he might want to take account: only Secretaries of State can sign warrants. He enquires about the procedures doubtless because he was not drawn into them when he was a Minister of State at the Home Office. If the Secretary of State for the Home Department were absent for some reason, his function would be fulfilled not by the Minister of State at the Home Office, but by another Secretary of State-possibly the Foreign Secretary. It would not be because a change in agency was involved, but because it is a matter purely for a Secretary of State. Perhaps the Committee should bear that in mind.

<P>
We must also remember that police applications for interception in Scotland would go to the First Minister or the Deputy First Minister, who would devolve administration; they would previously have gone to the Secretary of State for Scotland. It would be helpful if the Minister pursued his offer, as soon as possible, to set out a more detailed explanation for the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I want to be absolutely clear on the point that I raised. Will the Minister confirm that under subsection (2) the regulations will be made by the Home Secretary in respect of the whole of the United Kingdom?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> They will certainly be made for the whole of the United Kingdom. I believe that they will, as the hon. Gentleman said, be made by the Home Secretary, but as I said earlier, I want to clarify that to the Committee in writing.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. It seems odd that the DTI should undertake the consultation if the Home Secretary is to make the regulation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> There is a whole process of interface between industry and Departments. The DTI has expertise in conducting such consultations, which is why we have given it that function. The Home Office and the DTI are working together extremely well on those issues.

<P>

<P>
(b) in Scotland, a sheriff; or

<P>
(c) in Northern Ireland, a county court judge.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The amendments are important for the Liberal Democrats. It is a key element of our philosophy that powers in respect of such issues should, as far as possible, be exercised not by the Secretary of State or the Executive, but by the judiciary. The amendments would give the relevant power, that currently rests with the Secretary of State, to a judge and describe the types of judge who could authorise a warrant.

<P>
The Government recognised the problem when they issued their consultation paper on the interception of communications, chapter 7 of which described their attempts to look at other authorisation frameworks, including the system based on the model of the Police Act 1997-which is the last time we had a serious discussion about whether warrants should be issued by the Executive or the judiciary. On that occasion it was decided that the judiciary should have oversight of police bugging through a system of commissioners. The only argument advanced by the Government in their consultation document is that it would be more appropriate, in terms of national security, for the Executive rather than the judiciary to deal with both functions.

<P>
However, we believe that the judiciary rather than the Executive should issue warrants, particularly in respect of the investigation of crime. Why do the Government consider a system of dual warranting as such a block? Canada, New Zealand, the United States and some European Union member states operate dual-warranting systems in which national security is separate from criminal justice. Although European convention on human rights case law does not mandate the need for judicial authorisation, the court clearly considered in the 1978 case of Klass v. Germany that it is desirable to entrust supervisory control to a judge, given that abuse could be easy in individual cases and harm democratic society as a whole.

<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
We agree that, from a clear philosophical point of view, the judiciary is best in this context. We felt that the Government as a political force might have inclined in our direction, rather than allowing the matter to remain the preserve of the Executive. I have yet to hear any strong argument as to why that should be the case. Why should the investigation of crime not follow the model of part III of the Police Act 1997, which establishes some form of oversight through commissioners?

<P>
The desire for such a system is backed up by many organisations that consider the matters closely, such as Liberty and Justice. The data protection commissioner has taken an interest in the subject. Her clear view is that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>intercepting any communication justifies strict controls  If information were obtained under a judicial warrant where the interception was related to the prevention and detection of crime the intercept product would be admissible in evidence in legal proceedings. This would also allow for judicial scrutiny of the procedure at a later date and would provide an alternative to the Tribunal as a forum for dispute resolution.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
With the best will in the world, individuals may have a grievance against the interception process. Having the matter within the judicial oversight procedure would be more satisfactory for the individual seeking redress than having it in the hands of the Secretary of State. Political cases such as Matrix Churchill may be good political fun-

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am listening to the hon. Gentleman's argument with genuine interest, as he raises an important point. In the circumstances that he describes, could an individual who believed that he had a grievance challenge a ministerial decision by judicial review?

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The individual would find it difficult to obtain information as to whether the warrant had been issued. From that individual's point of view, I think it would be more satisfactory to challenge a judicial decision than a Secretary of State's decision. Avenues may be found to challenge a Secretary of State, but they would most likely be political challenges when something such as the Matrix Churchill affair nessily unravels. When there are errors in procedure, we will end up with a political argument about the competence of the Secretary of State rather than a citizen seeking redress through a straightforward process.

<P>
By moving towards judicial authorisation, we would give the citizen a stronger platform to make challenges than if matters were left in the hands of a Secretary of State. I am not an expert on judicial review, but its legal procedures are complex and cumbersome, and would be more so than in the system that we propose.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> Surely the main problem is that, when the system works properly, the vast majority of people who conceivably could have a grievance would not know that the interception was taking place. The benefit of the judicial issuing of warrants is not the opportunity for redress, which would arise only if the person discovered that he had been intercepted, but that individuals would know that it was not the Executive that issued the warrants.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> My right hon. Friend makes an important point. A basic principle behind our amendments is that the judicial route would provide better redress. The Secretary of State's system of providing authorisations or issuing warrants is opaque. Individuals may never find out about it if the system works correctly. Even if they suspected something, there are difficulties. I know that individuals have attended some of our surgeries and made allegations about what the Secretary of State has or has not been up to. Part of their grievance, whether or not it is well-founded, is that it is an arbitrary exercise of power by the Executive. All those who believe in a liberal and democratic society should seek to make sure that our criminal justice system has proper judicial oversight, into which there is no interference.

<P>
Our view is that there is at least scope for that. Genuine concerns have been expressed as to whether or not it has occured. In some cases, one suspects that there has been a problem in the way in which warrants have been issued. Those cases have been brought back to the door of the Secretary of State, rather than remaining outside the political arena, as they properly should be.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The hon. Gentleman gave the impression that individuals would be aware that a judge had issued a warrant. Why would that be, or is he suggesting that the evidence should always be admitted and that the full circumstances of the fact of interception should be known in every case?

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am not suggesting that, but there is a procedure through the tribunals for individuals to allege that they believe interception has taken place. If the original warrant were issued in a judicial context, it would make the exercise of seeking redress more effective. It is not that on every occasion the individual concerned should be told whether a warrant has been issued; rather, he or she has a right to try to seek redress, but that is opaque because it goes back to warrants issued by the Secretary of State. Under a judicially issued warrant that would be more straightforward, but we would have to look at a later stage at the whole mechanism of providing redress for individuals who claim to have a grievance about interceptions which they allege have taken place against them. That is an area to which my hon. Friends and I intend to return because the way in which an individual feels inappropriate interception has taken place is important.

<P>
Where harm has been suffered as a result, the citizen concerned must have some way of registering a complaint and having it investigated. That should be seen to be fair and, again, our concern is that while it is within the Secretary of State procedure, the individual who is already aggrieved will not believe that any attempt to investigate the circumstances of the warrant being issued is free from political interference. We are interested in the exercise of that grievance procedure, rather than a change in the way in which people are notified.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Can we adduce from the hon. Gentleman's argument that he believes that the average member of the public has more faith in a judge to get it right than in the Secretary of State and one of Her Majesty's Ministers?

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Yes; that is precisely my point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> That is why it is wrong.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> But the average member of the public does believe that there is less likelihood of there being an ulterior motive or any other consideration being brought into play. That is the essential principle of the separation of powers. We do not expect Secretaries of State to judge criminal cases in the normal course of events. We expect matters to be separated out and it is a point of principle that as far as possible one should leave these matters within the domain of the judiciary, rather than allowing them to slip into the domain of the Executive, unless that is absolutely necessary, as in the case of national security.

<P>
I shall be interested to hear whether the Minister has further arguments to offer, other than the one about the dual warranting procedure, as to why the Government are not prepared to accept that judges are the appropriate people to deal with these issues.

<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed raised earlier the points about the administrative headaches that are potentially caused by requiring a Secretary of State's signature on every single warrant. We question why the Government have not chosen a system that is administratively easier to set up and run. In particular, will the Minister tell us whether the Government will reconsider how warrants are issued and whether they are appropriately located within the Executive's domain when we are talking about criminal investigations as opposed to national security?

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am afraid that I do not have the rapier-sharp mind of my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire, so let me try in my own inadequate way to explain why the amendment is misguided and wrong and why the substitution of the Secretary of State and the Executive by a judge would be a mistake. I am sorry if as a result I lose the support and sympathy of my newly acquired friends in Liberty, Justice and other organisations.

<P>
Over the years that I have been in the House much similar legislation has been enacted. There has always been a demand from many quarters, including from some members of my own party, that we try to find the cleanest pair of hands-a person who can take decisions and be more acceptable to the public, credible and believed by them to be neutral, impartial, absolutely scrupulously honest, packed full of integrity-not a grubby politician. The public want to know that everything is fair and above board.

<P>
In some of our own affairs we have been afraid to trust ourselves as politicians and have called in judges to regulate them. We have seen the same thing with security services legislation-the Interception of Communications Act 1985 and so on. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam gave the game away in response to the intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds. He said that the public would expect a judge to be fairer and more trustworthy than a politician. That is the driving motivation behind the amendment. The previous Government also had to deal with calls for judges to take the place of the Executive.

<P>
A judge would not be acting in a judicial capacity when he made such decisions. By giving a judge the task of making executive, administrative, civil service decisions, he or she would simply be a substitute for the Home Secretary. A judge is no better qualified to make such decisions than the current or any other Home Secretary.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that we do not expect the Home Secretary to intervene in court cases and make judgments-we leave that to the judges. That is right. We can see that a judge is fair and chock-full of integrity in his or her judicial role in open court. After hearing the arguments for and against the accused, either with a jury present or in the Appeal Court, he or she makes an impartial judgment. On those occasions of course the judge is regarded as absolutely impartial and neutral in coming to the best possible decision.

<P>
The proposal is that we take the judge from the open court and put him in a room somewhere in the Home Office or in another Department attached to it, where files will be sent to him that my have originated with any of the security services or the police. The files will have covering minutes attached, and the civil servants who prepare the cases will meticulously check that all the necessary arguments for and against are included. Then, in conditions of the utmost secrecy, the file will be passed to the judge, who will be asked, in exactly the same circumstances as the Home Secretary would have been, to make an executive, secret administrative decision. In those circumstances, the judge is no better than a politician. A politician these days is under all the obligations of judicial review, and subject to the dangers of getting it wrong and of being challenged.

<P>
The present Government, when they were in opposition, had a bit of fun. In the last year of the previous Government, there were about 900 applications for judicial review. Five or six of them were big ones that hit the fan and about which everyone knew. I should be interested to know what the current figure is. I suspect that it is slightly more, but not less. The number of judicial reviews against Home Secretaries has been growing on a steady, exponential curve ever since the concept was expanded in the early 1980s.

<P>
In making these decisions, the Home Secretary has to act in a quasi-judicial capacity. The hands of any Home Secretary are as clean as those of any judge. What the Home Secretary lacks, and what is behind the hon. Gentleman's amendment and all the other calls over the years, is the public perception that he is fair and neutral. People will say about both Labour and Tory politicians that they are bound to be biased. That is why we are engaged in the futile task of finding some other person who is better than the Home Secretary. He must be whitere than white, and such a person does not exist. The judge is good when in his judicial role in court, but he is no better than the Home Secretary when sitting in a private room in an annexe to the Home Office going through the files and making an administrative judgment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Under the proposed scheme a circuit judge might be approached, and it could be any one of a vast number of judges. Circuit judges would not be dealing with these cases on the same regular basis as the Home Secretary. Might many of the weaknesses in applications just not be within their relevant experience?

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> My hon. Friend is right. There is a host of other arguments to make here. There is considerable merit in all these cases being processed through one Department, whether they come from the Foreign Office, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the First Minister or whoever, and coming to the Home Secretary for a final judgement so that he can carry the can on them. That would ensure that all the available expertise was brought to bear on each case. When our service is trying it on slightly, the Home Office officials would recognise that and say, ``Home Secretary, this is not good enough and it is not warranted on this occasion. You should turn this down or demand more information on the file.''

<P>
It will not take our new Home Secretary long to get up to speed on these things and to build up considerable trust with his Department and officials on the paperwork. One could put this out to our judge, who will sit there all the time and be accused of being as biased as the Home Secretary, or one could send it to whichever judge happens to be available that night or that weekend, but God help us, the speed of decision making would not be that great or that consistent.

<P>
I do not want to be too critical of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam and his amendment. I accept that it is well meaning, but it is generally misguided. We are all searching for that person who will be perceived by all members of the public as totally unbiased-an accolade that can never be given to Home Secretaries. Some people will always consider them to be biased, but in the circumstances of the interception of communications it is still best for the Executive, with all their potential faults, and the Home Secretary to do it. I accept that a system of judicial scrutiny post-event, looking through the cases and using the Security Service Act commissioner, has some merit. However, in my submission applications are best made to the Home Secretary, who should take the decision.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I rise briefly to support my right hon. and hon. Friends in opposing the amendment. The amendment is well meaning and it puts forward a civilised and intellectually respectable point of view that is founded upon the separation of powers and the theory underlying that. We do not have much of a quarrel with that. However, there are two reasons why the Committee should not be seduced by the amendment. I do not wish to be too disloyal to members of the profession that I was formerly proud to serve in, and this may get me blacklisted, but I know one or two circuit judges. I concur with my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border, who did not put it as bluntly as I am about to. Circuit judges would be utterly bemused-nay, they would be out of their depth-if they were asked to look at the papers that may arrive in a pantechnicon truck at the Home Office if they had previously judged predominantly common law or criminal cases at circuit judge level. It is not credible that circuit judges will be up to the specialist and detailed job of the Secretary of State who, after all, deals with such matters at the highest level day-in, day-out, week-in, week-out.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> What is wrong with the current procedure in the Police Act 1997, which provides for a specialised group of judges and a single unit to service them, and reference is not made to the use of a random selection of judges from anywhere in the judicial system?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The right hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. Perhaps if the amendment were clearer, there would be less opportunity for us to criticise it. I do not believe that his argument is met by the amendment, as drafted.

<P>
My second point follows on logically from the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border. Everyone has an interest in the protection of civil rights and civil liberties in this country. We want decisions made in relation to such rights to be correct rather than dubious. If we want to ensure that the best decisions are made by the best people, we should acknowledge that it is more likely that the Secretary of State will go that extra mile to get the very best decision that he can in the certian knowledge that if he or his Department drops a clanger, his career could be on the line. As a member of the Executive, any bad decisions will be punished severely in an open, political way. The newspapers may become involved; there may be witch hunts or ministerial resignations. That would not apply in the case of a mere-I use the word carefully-circuit judge. It is not sensible to entrust dual mandate procedure to a judge as a means of defending the interests of citizens. The Secretary of State should be entrusted with such an important task.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> My right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border has great experience in Home Office matters. He has a realistic approach to the issue, and his comments echo the argument made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bridgwater on Second Reading. He is the Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee and has had experience of issuing such warrants. When he was issuing them, he felt that it was important to deal with them in a particular way. He said that the present Home Secretary would discharge such responsibilities in exactly the same spirit, and I agree with that.

<P>
I am not sure that it is right to include circuit judges, sheriffs and county court judges as set out in amendment No. 63. Even the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed must now agree with that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Let me clarify a point. We have always envisaged a system similar to that under the Police Act 1977, which provides for a panel. Amendment No. 63 states ``a judge shall include''. It would enable judges
to have powers. As and when theGovernment accept the amendment, we accept that they would wish to
have detailed specifications-perhaps outlined in regulations-about how the panel should be set up and how it should work. I ask the hon. Gentleman not to imagine that that is the complete picture. We envisaged a measure similar to that under the Police Act 1997.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> That is a helpful clarification. The provision does not read well at the moment, but there may be more to it than meets the eye. Even with the caveat that the hon. Gentleman has entered, it would be a less satisfactory system. That is not because I have anything against judges. I am sure that the judges in this country are among the best in the world-and I almost went on to say that some of my best friends are ciruit judges.

<P>
Judges are used to an adversarial system. A lawyer on each side argues the case, and all the points come out because of the cut-and-thrust. The judge sits in the middle and makes the decision based on the argument. That process is better here than anywhere else in the world. However, this provision does not involve that type of procedure. As my right hon. Friend theMember for Penrith and The Border said, it is an administrative procedure. An analogy would be a judge dealing with an ex parte application: that is an urgent application made by one party without the other party being present. The law is very clear that it should be rare to grant an ex parte injunction. Both parties are heard at the first available opportunity, so the risk of injustice is reduced to a minimum.

<P>
That would not be possible with a system in which the secrecy of the investigation is often paramount. If we want the best person to do the job, we should have someone such as the Home Secretary, who no doubt worries all the time that he may be pilloried in the media or in court.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Not this Home Secretary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> He has certainly been pilloried in the media on a number of occasions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> But he is not worried about it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> That is what I was going to come on to. The Home Secretary has certainly been pilloried a fair bit, and the fact that he is not worried about it is rather troubling. Politicians are concerned to do a good job, and are accountable to the public at elections so they are the best people to deal with these warrants. We should also bear in mind the protections that the Bill provides. It is interesting that my right hon. Friend the Member for Bridgwater specifically mentioned the scrupulous attention that he paid to such matters, knowing that the decisions would be examined by, in his case, the predecessor to Lord Nolan, whose name he had forgotten, and now by Lord Nolan. That is the right solution.

<P>
Although I understand fully the points made by the hon. Member for Hallam and why he is making them, our approach to the Bill is to try to ensure that the powers match the need and do not go broader than that. The Commission will have real teeth, and that will be a better protection than relying on judges, who may not be experienced in this area. The procedure does not meet their particular talents and skills.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am familiar with the discussions surrounding this issue, having been on the Committee considering the Terrorism Bill and then on the Floor of the House with the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes), who has rehearsed these arguments at some length, although somewhat less articulately than the hon. Member for Hallam. I rest the Government's case on the fundamental point that this process is the responsibility of the Executive.

<P>
I do not intend to repeat the argument made by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border because he put the case powerfully, well and correctly. If there is separation of powers, the Executive must take responsibility for these matters: the judiciary must take responsibility for those matters for which it is responsible. To confuse the two would be quite wrong. I emphasise the high level of scrutiny involved in considering such applications, not just by the Secretary of State concerned but by the system that supports him or her. That is an important strength of our system, which I would not wish to be eroded in any way.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I should make a couple of points in addition to those made by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border. The first is to emphasise that there is in these processes a place for judicial involvement. That comes in the independent judicial oversight provided by the commissioners and the tribunal. It is not simply a question of judicial review; the specific oversight in the Bill is there to provide a remedy if the Executive has acted outside their statutory power. It is important to emphasise that; judges do have a role, although not the executive decision role that is advocated by the amendments.
 
<P>
Secondly, I emphasise that the European Commission of Human Rights has endorsed the present practice of Executive authorisation, for example in Christie v. UK. In addition, the current system was recently endorsed by the latest report of the IOCA commissioner who is an independent and senior member of the judiciary.

<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam referred to the 1978 case of Klass v. Germany. That case required
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>adequate and effective guarantees against abuse.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the decision. It is absolutely sustainable that the guarantees in the Bill meet that test and are second to none. Indeed, it is significant that hon. Members throughout the Committee, in examining how other jurisdictions deal with these matters, are really looking for other countries to come up to the same standards as ours, rather than suggesting that they have far better regimes.

<P>
In that context, I should also point out that the commission in Strasbourg, in three cases since the Klass v. Germany case, has held that the UK arrangements are both sufficient and effective.

<P>
Those are the reasons why the Government oppose the amendments. In no sense do I demean the reason for their being proposed. It is a familiar debate that is perfectly reasonable and respectable. We for our part, however, believe that it is right that the Executive should take the decisions and be held to account for them, whether judicially through the commission process or politically in the way described by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds. So I hope that the Committee will vote against these amendments if the hon. Gentleman decides to press the matter to a division.

<P>

<B>Mr. Beith:</B> I shall not attempt to emulate my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. The amendment gives rise to a familiar debate about an issue of principle on which all the parties present have well-established views. It should be pointed out that judicial approval of interception is common in many other countries. It is the foundation of the system of scrutiny in the United States, with which our system will interestingly overlap in cases, for example, of telephone calls between citizens in both countries. It is present in our system.

<P>
When an application is made to a magistrate for a search warrant, the considerations to which the right hon. member for Penrith and The Border referred at such length are deterrents from retaining that system. It appears that somebody who will subsequently hear a case may be asked to approve a search warrant because it is thought not appropriate for the law enforcement body to do that by itself. There are compelling arguments why it ought not to be an Exective decision, but one that is entrusted to someone from a judicial background who looks at it on a very objective basis. It is not that Secretaries of State habitually do this in a casual or careless way. I have reason to know that they pay particular attention to their duties. It is not that there is not a judicial review of the whole process. There is a process of review by the commission, although the published reports of the commissioners would lead one to believe that their inquiries are primarily concerned with the legal conformity of the intercepts with the terms of the warrant.

<P>
Indeed, in a recent case the Secretary of State for Scotland was caught out, in good faith, simply because of an error in signing an appropriate warrant in the appropriate way. The procedures mainly-and rightly-protect the procedural conformity of the warrant-issuing procedure, rather than examining questions of proportionality or appropriateness from the general civil rights point of view.

<P>
The reasons why the Executive is an unwelcome operator of that conforming power ought to be fairly obvious. They range from the possibility that a Minister might be influenced by political considerations to approve an intercept because of his strong political disapproval of an organisation or a group of protestors and might be too ready to sign that warrant. There have been allegations for many years of precisely this sort of willingness to approve an intercept. Alternatively, one might have a quite different fear, that a Minister seeking to deal with public concern and perhaps media attention-there was earlier reference to the Home Secretary being pilloried in the media-might be over-zealous or might respond to a certain over-zealousness by the agency or the police in allowing powers to be used because he was so desperate to get results in the battle against crime or terrorism. Those are very demanding situations for the Home Secretary. He is under constant pressure to deliver results and to protect the public from terrorism and crime.

<P>
There are times when other considerations have to be brought to bear and it seems to us that a judicial figure appropriately provided with the relevant information is better placed to do that. That is a view taken in many other countries, but it is a rule of principle. We are happy to rest our case and vote accordingly.
