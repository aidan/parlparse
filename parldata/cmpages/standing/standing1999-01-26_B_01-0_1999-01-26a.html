<H4><center>[Mr. Roger Gale in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H4><center><A href="/pa/cm199899/cmbills/005/1998005.htm">Local Government Bill</a>

</center></H4>

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 
Welcome to what I am sure will be orderly efficient 
proceedings. Hon. Members who wish to remove their 
jackets may find it convenient to do so now.
<P>
I will make two points before calling the Minister to 
speak. First, the Committee will not sit this afternoon. 
Secondly, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for 
the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the hon. 
Member for Mansfield (Mr. Meale) has courteously 
written to me, seeking permission to be absent this 
morning because he is due to give evidence to the Select 
Committee on Environment, Transport and Regional 
Affairs. Of course, I have granted that permission. I shall 
therefore deprecate questions asking where he is.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Local Government Bill, the 
Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and 
half-past Four o'clock, and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and 
half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
While moving the sittings motion, Mr. Gale, I wish to 
express my pleasure that you are in the Chair. I have not 
served under your chairmanship before, but I know of 
your concern for the animal brigade and for ensuring that 
cruelty does not occur. I am sure that you will treat the 
Committee in the same manner.
<P>
The Government have introduced the Local 
Government Bill to deal with some of our manifesto 
commitments. It is important that we should deliberate 
in a constructive and civilised manner, because we are 
discussing another tier of government and services that 
affect everyone in this country. These people have the 
right to expect that we recognise the value and importance 
of local government in our deliberations.
<P>
The Committee will normally meet twice on Tuesdays 
and Thursdays, but it will not meet this afternoon.
<P>
The Bill will benefit local people by improving public 
services, which are important to the quality of their 
everyday lives. Local people have the right to be involved 
in the shape and quality of public services. They also have 
the right to expect that those services are delivered as 
efficiently and as economically as possible.
<P>
The Bill has widespread support; it has been welcomed 
by the social partners the Confederation of British 
Industry, the Local Government Association and the trade 
unions. The time is right for this legislation. For well over a 
year, there has been considerable debate on best value and 
council tax regulation. The sittings motions is intended to 
enable good progress, with plenty of time for discussion of 
detail and scrutiny of the Government's proposals. We 
would not want it any other way, and I look forward to our 
exchanges. It is quite unusual to see two former Ministers 
who once had responsibility for local government on the 
Opposition Benches, so we are in for a lively debate. I hope 
that the public will judge our approach as appropriate. The 
Bill will affect the quality of their lives. The relationship of 
local government to the public and to central government is 
at the heart of the measure, and we must therefore ensure 
that the constituency outside this place knows we are giving 
the issues due attention in a manner befitting the topic. I 
hope that we shall enjoy the Committee's sittings, but that 
we shall also make progress.



<P>
<B>Several Hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Question is that the 
Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 
half-past Ten o'clock and half-past four o'clock.
<P>
The Minister has chosen to inject an element of Second 
Reading into the debate on the sittings motion. I have no 
quarrel with that, and propose to allow the same latitude 
to any hon. Members who want to speak on the subject.
<P>
The Minister suggested that I have a certain fondness 
for animals. It does not necessarily extend to humans; I 
should not be pushed too far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin (North Essex):</B> Thank you for 
extending the latitude in the debate as you mentioned, 
Mr. Gale. I shall not abuse that. I reiterate the welcome 
given to you by the Minister and I too look forward 
to working under your chairmanship and that of your 
colleague, Mr. O'Brien. I also look forward to the 
debates.
<P>
The Minister said that the Bill had been much discussed 
and was well supported, but it is a strange Bill because of 
its lack of specificity about how powers are to be 
exercised. I want to draw attention to that, not because I 
am a cruel person, but because the humane thing to do to 
a horse with a broken leg is shoot it and we are dealing 
with a lame horse of a Bill.
<P>
On Second Reading, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary 
of State for Wales, the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central 
(Mr Jones) drew the (House's) attention to the fact that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Some hon. Members have expressed concern about the 
apparently excessive powers that the Bill gives the Secretary of State 
and the Assembly to make orders and issue statutory guidance."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He added:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The alternative would be to put more detail in the Bill."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We believe that that alternative is right, although the 
Under-Secretary gave various excuses to show why it 
would not happen. He then gave an assurance. he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Let me make it clear that the powers will be used with 
considerable care. They will be used after consultation and we will 
seek consensus in the way we use them."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
None of that is in the Bill. There is no consultation 
requirement on the Secretary of State with respect to the 
exercise of powers.
<P>
The Under-Secretary told the House:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We are developing a protocol with the Local Government 
Association setting out the general principles that will underpin the 
exercise of the intervention powers and the broad procedures to be 
followed."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I then asked if that protocol would be available before the 
Bill was considered in Committee and he answered:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The protocol will be made available as soon as it is agreed with 
the Local Government Association."	 [Official Report, 12 January 
1999; Vol. 323, c. 200-201.]<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
Last night I telephoned the Minister of State's office to 
ask about the protocol. I thank the staff concerned, who 
were very helpful. However, this morning they were 
unable to suggest when the protocol would be available. 
One can only assume that it is still a matter of 
discussion and perhaps disagreement between the 
Local Government Association and the Minister. If there 
is no disagreement, perhaps the Committee stage should 
be delayed until we can see the protocol, enabling us to 
discuss the Bill in the context in which the Government 
intend to exercise the relevant powers. Otherwise we shall 
be legislating blind.
<P>
The fundamental flaw in the Bill is that it gives 
extensive discretionary powers to the Secretary of State 
more extensive than ever taken by any Government over 
the functions and finances of local authorities. We have 
only the personal assurances of Ministers who may be 
here today but gone tomorrow as to how those powers 
will be exercised. In fact, the only assurances that count 
will be those that we can write into the Bill, but the 
context of the powers has not yet been clarified.
<P>
I shall not waste time dividing the Committee on the 
sittings motion, but I want to point out to Government 
Members that they are in the process of doing precisely 
the opposite of what they were elected to do to 
decentralise powers from central to local government. I 
am not sure exactly how many Government Members 
have served as councillors [Hon Members: "All of them"	.] 
Well, they will have spent much of the 1980s and 1990s 
railing against the vicissitudes of successive Conservative 
Governments because of the powers that they exercised 
over them.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If I may finish the point. The Government 
are now legislating to extend the powers of central 
government beyond any previous level. Yes, some powers 
are being disestablished, but the Bill provides less 
guidance than ever before as to how powers will be 
exercised. That is precisely the opposite, as I said 
before 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I said that I was prepared to 
allow a degree of latitude: I have done so and it has now 
come to an end. This is a sittings motion, not a Second 
Reading debate. All relevant matters will be debated in 
due course. I am sure that Opposition Members will be 
creative in their tabling of amendments and they will have 
the opportunity to debate the issues then.



<P>
The hon. Gentleman's point about papers was relevant. 
It is up to the Government to make papers available, but 
the Chair expects that relevant papers they must be 
relevant and I am not adjudicating on the issue now are 
made available as early as possible. I am sure that the 
Government will want to accommodate that. Will the hon. 
Gentleman now return to the sittings motion debate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> As you rightly say, Mr. Gale, the key 
point is the issue of papers. When can we see the protocol, 
which is so relevant to the conduct of our entire 
Committee procedure? We hope that every power 
conferred on the Secretary of State by the Bill will be 
circumscribed by the protocol. When will the protocol be 
made available, or are we to work in the dark because the 
Government want to play their cards so close to their 
chest? So much for open government.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry (Skipton and Ripon):</B> I am also 
pleased to serve under your chairmanship again, Mr. Gale. 
You chaired the Committee considering the Regional 
Development Agency Bill, on which I sat, and all of us 
who went with you to Mongolia know that you were 
restrained with difficulty from bringing back large 
quantities of vulnerable animals from that landlocked 
country. I am also glad to see that the former leader of 
Manchester city council is present in Committee, where 
no doubt he will restrain his lack of enthusiasm for the 
Bill. Three members of the Select Committee on 
Agriculture are also here, though I am unsure what 
conclusions to draw from the bringing together of two 
widely disparate disciplines: perhaps that has some 
lessons for us.
<P>
I have three points about the sittings motion. First, there 
is a rate support grant debate in the House a week on 
Thursday, which will deal with pre-settlement. I assume 
that this Committee will not be sitting then because the 
Minister and probably others has engagements 
elsewhere. I should be grateful if the Minister would 
confirm that. It is a mechanical question: if business 
managers have chosen a Thursday, they must be aware of 
the clash, so I would like the matter clarified.
<P>
Secondly, I am unsure why, under the new rules, we meet 
at 9 am on a Thursday only to meet again at 4.30 pm on the 
same day. Why cannot we meet earlier in the afternoon? 
The new rules are supposed to allow us to get away earlier 
but there is a danger that they will keep us much later. If the 
morning session is an hour and a half earlier than under the 
old rules, why cannot we advance the afternoon sessions as 
well, to everyone's convenience?
<P>
Thirdly, the Government intend to issue guidance on 
best value and on the more draconian capping powers, 
however sparingly used but which are central to the Bill. 
If we cannot see that guidance, we have only a framework 
with none of the flesh. I hope that you will use your 
influence, Mr. Gale, to tell the Government that if the 
Committee is to do a good job of scrutinising the Bill, we 
must be able to see how the provisions will work in 
practice. The "in practice"	 is not in the Bill. The 
Government have alluded to guidance and so much will 
depend on it that it is entirely reasonable for the 
Committee to see it to evaluate the practical import of 
the Bill.

<P>

<B>Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I, too, should like to 
welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Gale, and I hope that 
Liberal Democrat Members will not strain your patience 
or latitude, particularly on the sittings motion.
<P>
I agree with the Minister that there is widespread 
support for the repeal of compulsory competitive 
tendering legislation, but there is also considerable 
criticism of the Government's proposals on best value, 
particularly on the greater powers of the Secretary of State 
to control local government. As on Second Reading, the 
Liberal Democrats will focus on that issue but our 
criticism will be constructive and civilised. In common 
with Government Members, both the Liberal Democrat 
Members are ex-councillors and have the cause of local 
government at heart.
<P>
On the sittings motion, I agree with the right hon. 
Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) and hope that 
we will not be sitting while the local government 
settlement is being debated in the House. Hon. Members 
as well as the Minister, will want to be present in the 
House for that debate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I invite the Minister to respond 
I should like to make two comments. First, the right hon. 
Member for Skipton and Ripon suggested that the Chair 
should impress on the Government the importance of 
making available to the Committee information on 
guidance. However, that is a matter for the Government 
not the Chair. It is for the Opposition to press the point.
<P>
Secondly, on the afternoon of Thursday 4 February 
there is indeed a debate in the House on the rate support 
grant. The Chair fully appreciates that hon. Members may 
wish to be present, but that is again a matter for 
negotiation between the usual channels. The Chair is here 
to facilitate sittings, and will do so. The Committee may 
decide by mutual agreement that it does not wish to sit on 
a particular afternoon and that information will be made 
available to members.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman (Meriden):</B> May I make a 
more general point? The date of 4 February has been 
negotiated and I am surprised that that was not made clear 
in the Minister's initial statement. I am also delighted to 
work under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. The 
Government Whip and I took part in an historic occasion 
when we established arrangements for the first Committee 
to sit at 9 am on a Thursday.
<P>
I want to put on record some points for the benefit of 
members of the Committee who are having to adjust to 
the new rules. There was a ground swell of view among 
members of the Committee to have the second sitting 
brought forward, but I understand that the Clerks of the 
House were unwilling to change the time of the afternoon 
sitting. As Chairman, you may become involved in this 
matter, Mr. Gale.
<P>
I shall provide some background to the change. This is 
one of a series of Bills introduced by the same 
Department, so a team of the same people has had to work 
sequentially. The Opposition have tried to be constructive, 
and, where it is reasonable, to facilitate the passage of 
Bills while giving them proper scrutiny.
<P>
However, we are sometimes worried when instructions 
from the Government are unclear. As to this morning's 
sitting, it was initially agreed to take the format that we 
are about to enter into today, but the sittings motion has 
brought us back to a debate. Through you, Mr. Gale, I 
would ask for greater clarity for the sake of both Back 
Bench and Front Bench Members and because of the 
loading of this Department with a sequential series of 
Bills. I also ask for co-operation from the Clerks of the 
House in dealing with the newly scheduled Thursday.



<P>
Our proposal that the Committee should sit at 9 am was 
made in good faith because we thought that amendments 
tabled by the Liberal Democrats should be properly 
debated. Those amendments were then withdrawn. The 
frustration that Ministers experienced on that occasion 
was not the result of an attempt to make people's lives 
more difficult. When an early Thursday sitting became a 
possibility for a second time, we exercised great restraint 
by debating matters fully in our Tuesday sitting. That 
meant that people were not brought back for a debate 
lasting only a short period. We have striven hard to be 
considerate in our use of the new timings. However, they 
have practical consequences for Members for Parliament, 
which I urge the Government to consider.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are all on a learning curve, 
including me. I was not sufficiently awake, a few 
moments ago, when I referred to a sittings motion for 
10.30 am and 4.30 pm on Thursday. That error will be 
corrected when the motion is formally moved.
<P>
I am advised that the Clerks are not unwilling or unable 
to work at an earlier time on Thursday afternoons. They 
will do so if required. The motion that was agreed on 
the Floor of the House changing Committee sittings on 
Thursdays left flexibility for the afternoon sitting to be 
negotiated through the usual channels.
<P>
Committee members debating the Greater London 
Authority Bill have already agreed to sit at 2.30 pm on 
Thursdays. If members of this Committee wish to do the 
same, they may do so with an appropriate sittings motion. 
However, that is not a matter for the Chairman: it must 
be negotiated through the usual channels and must be the 
subject of a formal sittings motion. As the Committee is 
not required to make a decision on those matters this 
morning, I suggest that it does not. [Interruption.] 
However, the Committee can vote on the existing sittings 
motion and commence formal proceedings on the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen (Nottingham, North):</B> I hope that I 
will be able to catch your eye before 4 February, Mr. Gale. 
That is the date set for the motion on the English revenue 
support grant to be moved on the Floor of the House. I will 
seek to catch your eye on 2 February to see if it the 
Committee may adjourn until 9 February. That is so that we 
do not sit on 4 February, for the convenience of 
Government and Opposition Members.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is a helpful clarification, and I 
will make sure that my co-Chairman, Mr. O'Brien, is 
informed of it.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I did not realise I was opening a 
hornet's nest. We will have to work our way through the 
process of modernising the House of Commons. I 
appreciate the support that the Clerks and other servants 
of the House give to all Committee members: we would 
be unable to carry out our business without their 
commitment.
<P>
Our changing practices affect other people, so we must 
act in a way that enables everyone to re-organise their 
work appropriately. My hon. Friend the Member for 
Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) acted in that spirit. I make 
it clear from the beginning that I was prepared to do 
whatever the Opposition wanted with regard to the sittings 
motion. We are now prepared to debate the Bill itself.



<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) 
tempted fate by pressing us on the need for so much 
secondary legislation. I am not ashamed of it. When, in 
moving the sittings motion, I spoke of our responsibility 
to recognise that the Bill concerned the relationship 
between central and local government, I was in some 
ways alluding to that matter. The Government have set up 
a central and local partnership, which has been meeting 
since the Government took office. It has been working 
towards new ways of developing consensus about ways 
to proceed. That does not mean that we agree about 
everything. However, we aim for as much agreement as 
possible.
<P>
The protocol particularly relates to intervention by the 
Secretary of State with respect to failing services. That 
will be considered under clause 13. Proper negotiations 
are not a matter of slapping something down on the table 
and saying, "There; agree it or not."	 We are negotiating 
properly with reference to what a protocol should involve; 
whether different inspectorates or intervention in certain 
services should be dealt with specifically, or whether a 
general protocol would be better. We are proceeding as 
quickly as possible with the negotiations, but it is 
important that local government should not feel as if it is 
being railroaded. I am hopeful that we shall be able to 
table the relevant item before we debate the issues in 
Committee. We want to provide Committee members 
with information as soon as it is available, so that they 
know as much as possible.
<P>
Having sat on the Opposition Benches, I find what is 
now happening a little strange. My right hon. and hon. 
Friends and I were then always asking for information 
and guidance, and were frequently told that we were 
unrealistic and did not understand government, and that 
the details we required would have to wait to come before 
the House later.
<P>
Secondary legislation will play an important role in 
implementing best value. That is deliberate. There are 
good reasons for the approach and I make no apologies 
for it. Best value is a matter of securing the provision of 
high quality, cost-effective local authority services. The 
best way to achieve that will change over time. It will not 
remain the same each year, because, as with any important 
service, those providing them will learn from experience 
and try to make improvements in subsequent years. Built 
into best value is an assumption of year on year 
improvement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am sure that the Minister would agree 
that there is a distinction between secondary legislation, 
which, by definition, must come to the House for scrutiny, 
and such things as guidance, which may not be subject to 
such scrutiny and which is issued by the Government. A 
few moments ago the hon. Lady came quite close to 
saying that agreement with local government would 
almost amount to sufficient scrutiny, or would replace 
scrutiny. Would she reaffirm, in her role as a 
parliamentarian, first of all, that whatever commendable 
discussions take place with local government she is right 
to undertake them the role of scrutiny belongs with this 
House and is not abrogated to any external organisation, 
even one as distinguished as the Audit Commission.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The question has been asked 
and I shall allow the Minister to reply if she wishes, but 
I remind the Committee that we are still debating the 
sittings motion.



<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I will finish on this point, Mr. Gale. 
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon is slightly 
misinterpreting what I said. I also said that I was 
determined that information would be brought before the 
Committee as soon as it became available. I want the 
Committee to see what I am working with, with regard to 
expanding, and making people familiar with, the 
framework of best value. We are also determined to build 
in flexibilities, because we want to permit changes such 
as improvements in technology to be reflected in service 
delivery. We do not want the primary legislation to place 
restrictions on the continued movement and change that 
private sector operators would expect to happen if they 
were to provide a good service.
<P>
Given the sittings motion, the Committee will be able 
to scrutinise the Government's intention, the work that we 
have been doing and the work being done in the best value 
pilots. That will show that, far from wanting more 
centralisation, or anything else that is mentioned in the 
rhetoric, we are trying to ensure that the public will 
receive the best possible services, and will know that they 
have a role in shaping them. That should enhance their 
quality of life.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Committee will scrutinise the Bill and, I hope, 
improve it. However good something is, there is always 
room for improvement. I was always a demanding 
teacher. No one ever got top marks from me because I 
always believed that there was room for improvement. I 
hope that we shall work in that spirit, to make the Bill as 
good as we can. I assure hon. Members that the 
Government will give them all available information as 
soon as we have it for their scrutiny.
<P>
As to the secondary legislation, we have, wherever 
possible, framed it so as to require affirmative resolution. 
We see the importance of continued scrutiny.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The question is 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am putting the Question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I did seek to catch your eye, Mr. Gale.
<P>
On the question of the sittings motion, I draw the 
Minister's attention to the fact that the less information is 
available on a thin Bill that sets out broad powers, the 
more discussion is likely to be necessary. We intend to 
try to complete the scrutiny of the Bill in Committee 
without the need for Government recourse to any kind of 
guillotine. We want to discuss all the Bill in detail. I 
accept in good faith that the Minister will produce any 
information that she has at the earliest opportunity. If she 
could produce a draft of the protocol it would be helpful. 
Otherwise it would seem that we are entering a phrase in 
which the Government take on not only more and more 
order-making powers, but also assume the role of 
legislating, outside the normal scrutiny processes of a 
democratically elected national Parliament. That is a new 
constitutional development, akin to the concordats 
negotiated with respect to the Welsh and Scottish 
Parliaments. They are an innovation.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Decentralisation.



<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> No, it is not decentralisation. It is the 
Executive accruing more and more power to themselves, 
so that they can determine the relationships between 
central and local government, outside the scrutiny or 
control of Parliament. It is extraordinary that the 
Government seem to make no distinction between 
Government and Parliament in managing affairs of state. 
They see Parliament as an instrument with which to 
confer power on themselves, so that they can govern the 
country as they see fit.
<P>
If the Minister produces the necessary information we 
shall make speedier progress with the Bill. If she cannot, 
we shall spend more time discussing how the relevant 
powers might be abused, because that is the tendency of 
politicians of all parties unless kept under close scrutiny 
and control by democratically elected legislatures.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That during proceedings on the Local Government Bill the 
Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and 
half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and 
half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the Minister to move the 
order of consideration motion, I have two announcements. 
First, I remind the Committee that there is a financial 
resolution, copies of which are available in the Room. 
Secondly, I remind the Committee that adequate notice 
should be given of amendments. As a general rule, neither 
I nor Mr. O'Brien intend to call starred amendments at 
either morning or afternoon sittings.
<P>
Motion made and Question proposed,

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Bill be considered in the following order: Clauses 1 to 
22, new Clauses and new Schedules relating to Part I, Clause 23, 
Schedule 1, Clause 24, new Clauses and new Schedules relating to 
Part II, Clauses 25 to 27, Schedule 2, Clauses 28 and 29, remaining

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford (Mole Valley):</B> I, too, welcome 
you, Mr. Gale? I have not served on a Committee under 
your chairmanship before, but I understand that 
benevolence is the operative word. I will not test your 
benevolence too much by going into a long diatribe about 
Second Reading except to mention that on Second 
Reading I, too, expressed concern about the lack of 
information, which went beyond the protocol to include 
performance indicators. Discussions are currently taking 
place about competition how local authorities will deal 
with it, partnerships and local companies. Those concerns 
relate to the first part of the Bill.
<P>
The first part of the Bill should be considered after the 
second part because that would provide the Minister with 
the time that she says she requires to deliver the requisite 
information to us. She said the right words from the 
outset that the Bill should be discussed in an appropriate 
manner with due care and attention and moved on to 
talk about secondary legislation.
<P>
I have had some experience of local government and 
know how often central Government is unaware of the 
importance of the details which should be discussed with 
local government before moving ahead with primary 
legislation. All three parties in Committee must have 
those details to do our job properly. If we reversed the 
order, we would have a better chance of receiving the 
requisite details. I therefore ask the Minister seriously to 
consider reversing rather than promoting the motion 
before us today.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman places the 
Chair in some difficulty because Her Majesty's 
Opposition have not tabled any amendments to the order 
of consideration motion. I am prepared to allow the 
Minister to reply, but if either Government or Opposition 
wish to vary the motion, appropriate amendments must be 
tabled to allow a debate. Does the Minister wish to 
respond?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I wish to proceed with the motion as 
set out on the Amendment Paper.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>

are Nos. 111, 103, 105 to 108, 109, 110, 112, 104 and 
113 standing in my name. They relate to clauses 1 and 2, 
which are primarily concerned with what constitutes a 
best value authority. The ultimate choice as to what it 
constitutes rests with the Secretary of State. Lists of what 
can be regarded as a best value authority are provided 
and clause 2 is about the power to extend or disapply the 
designation. We are thus giving a power to the Secretary 
of State to decide what authorities shall be treated as best 
value authorities. The burden of our amendments and 
those of the Liberal Democrats with whom we share some 
concerns in a spirit of constructive opposition, perhaps the 
third way is to provide some restrictions on the exercise 
of the Secretary of State's power. These are probing 
amendments and, in the cause of debate rather than 
pointless division, we shall not divide the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> We might wish to divide the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Obviously, I cannot speak for my right 
hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon.
<P>
The key amendment refers to subsection (4A), which 
deals with police functions. Other amendments deal with 
the treatment as regards best value of waste disposal 
authorities, the Welsh Assembly, regional authorities and 
the London regional authority. I wish to speak mainly to 
the issue of police powers.
<P>
Currently, competitive tendering applies only in a 
limited way to police authorities and the Bill confirms 
that. By including police authorities particularly the 
Metropolitan police authority, the City of London and 
other authorities in the matter of best value, we are 
setting no limits to what police functions shall be included 
in the Bill. We have tabled amendments to make certain 
police functions exempt. I should be grateful if the 
Minister would clarify the position and give an assurance 
that the Secretary of State will not be able to intervene in 
those particular functions.
<P>
Amendment No. 112 refers to issues of national 
security, public disclosure and compromising operations, 
statutory police duties including arrest, charging and 
assembling evidence and support services specified by 
the Home Secretary. It would be inappropriate for best 
value to be applied in those respects. It is sometimes 
necessary for the Home Secretary to be protected from 
interference by any other member of the Government. 
Those exemptions would also apply to Wales as I 
understand that the Welsh Assembly will not be 
responsible for the police in Wales.
<P>
The purpose of the amendments is clarification. In the 
interest of probity I shall leave it at that. Some of my 
colleagues may wish to debate other issues.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call hon. Members, I want to 
tell the Committee that, where there is a complex set of 
amendments I customarily allow a wide-ranging debate 
because experience has shown that that often facilitates 
the Committee's work. However, I also want it make it 
clear that where a debate is wide ranging on a selection 
of amendments, it is open to the Chair to put the question 
on clause stand part without debate. It is effectively up to 
the Committee to determine whether to have a thorough 
debate at the start of a clause or at the end of it: it cannot 
have both.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> While supporting my hon. 
Friends, I am speaking specifically to amendment
No. 103 a probing amendment because the 
Government appear to be rushing in without thinking any 
further. This rather complex issue looks quite simple on 
the surface the clause refers to waste disposal 
authorities but a little history is needed to help the 
Committee understand its complexity. I will explain why 
I tabled this probing amendment.



<P>
Prior to the Environment Act 1990, waste disposal 
collection and regulation came under local authority 
control. As waste management activities are subject to a 
licensing regime, effectively, we had poacher and 
gamekeeper in the same camp. The 1990 Act introduced 
changes to the organisation of waste disposal and 
regulatory functions in local authorities, to separate 
regulatory and disposal functions. Three types of authority 
were constituted: the waste regulation authorities, which 
in England were mostly county councils; the waste 
disposal authorities which, because of the nature of things, 
were also county councils; and the waste collection 
authorities, which were district councils. The problem 
there is that with the unitary authorities in London and 
metropolitan areas, the three types of authority were still 
one and the same. Furthermore, as I have said, the county 
councils remained both regulatory and disposal 
authorities.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
To offset that, local authorities in that position in 
England and Wales were required to take further steps to 
bring about the separation of the regulation and disposal 
functions. They had three choices. First, they could 
privatise disposal operations a choice taken by a number 
of them. Secondly, they could set up a joint operation 
with the private sector. A number of authorities, including 
Surrey county council, with which I am linked, are 
undertaking that option. It is currently in the process of 
setting up a joint operation, utilising the private sector 
through the private finance initiate, having been given 
Government approval and the go-ahead by the 
Departments that have responsibility. The third choice 
was to set up a local authority waste disposal company 
here, the usual ghastly local government phrase, LAWDC, 
comes into being. These are arm's length companies that 
are frequently the major choice of most local authorities 
in this position, but have to be run as commercial 
undertakings. They have a maximum of 20 per cent. local 
authority membership on the board; therefore local 
authorities are definitely a minority in LAWDCs. A large 
number of authorities, especially in London and the 
metropolitan areas, undertook this choice. In London, 
most formed partnerships of four or five authorities that 
then went into LAWDCs.
<P>
The intention was then and is now, given the law 
that the LAWDCs and private sector waste disposal 
companies compete for business on equal terms. 
Schedule2, part II of the Environment Act 1998 
contained provisions relating to contracts and to putting 
them out to tender. All except one of the London 
LAWDCs' functions are privatised, on 21 to 25-year-type 
contracts. The Environment Act 1995 transferred the 
waste regulatory functions of local authorities to the 
Environment Agency in England and Wales, and that 
brought about the separation. That means that all waste 
disposal authorities have either privatised waste disposal 
operations, which were generated at considerable financial 
benefit and have long-term contract arrangements, or have 
set up partnerships with the private sector, again, at 
enormous financial benefit, especially in capital, or they 
are LAWDCs. In other words, they are effectively arm's 
length companies, almost all having put their contracts 
out, so that they are being undertaken by the private sector 
under long-term fixed tight contracts.
<P>
It is perhaps worth adding that, like other private sector 
companies, all LAWDCs have to remain profitable, and 
are doing so. Some LAWDCs have been bought up by 
private waste companies: others are trading profitably and 
cannot any longer be influenced by legislation unless 
there is change of legislation other than today's through 
the original parent local authority or parent group of 
authorities.



<P>
I accept that, through circumstances or incompetence 
especially the latter a few have not completed 
partnership, privatisation or contracting-out arrangements. 
This handful are, in the main, in the process of 
considering one of the choices and, as I mentioned earlier, 
Surry is undergoing a PFI arrangement. Again, huge sums 
have been saved. The huge capital requirements of PFI 
mean that even those who drag their heels over 
transferring and do not seek a PFI arrangement are 
considering other alternatives such as build-own-operate 
or BOO, or build-own-operate-transfer, which refers to a 
transfer to the private sector. I suspect that a few of the 
remaining LAWDCs that have not chosen that route may 
believe that the Government are a soft touch, and perhaps 
consider acting in-house. In those cases, the Bill may 
apply. However, when the Treasury appreciates the 
figures that would be involved, and the DETR reflects on 
other local government services that would benefit from 
those huge sums, sweet words of affirmation will die in 
the Government's throat.
<P>
The private sector firms, for example, SITA, Cory 
Environmental, Biffa and Onyx, which are involved in the 
arrangements are highly respectable, competent and well 
known. They are tied to tight 21 or 25-year contracts. 
Some contracts are for even longer. All the firms have 
strict specification in their contracts, and they have been 
competitively tendered on the specifications to ensure 
value for money. All have break clauses, which operate 
mainly after five years. Those clauses enable variations; 
for example, to accommodate unforeseen changes in the 
waste that is to be disposed of, but not to shut down or 
remove the contract from the private sector. Therefore, it 
is viable for private sector companies to invest enormous 
sums frequently more than £100 million at a time 
which the public sector would otherwise have to find. To 
coin a topical phrase, the contracts have been set up in 
accordance with best value principles, which are also 
competitive tendering principles.
<P>
Neither the Queen's Speech nor the Bill suggested that 
measures to change the requirements under environment 
legislation were in the offing. Perhaps the Minister will 
enlighten me. A London mayor creates the prospect of 
further changes to waste recycling in London. However, 
that applies more to collection than to disposal.



<P>
The waste companies, at least on the client's side of the 
arrangement, face contending with best value 
paraphernalia. A version of the Bill could be applicable 
to the statutory waste disposal authorities there are 
approximately six of them. However, it is inappropriate 
for most waste disposal authorities because their functions 
have been privatised. Therefore, the functional side of 
waste disposal is out of local government hands and the 
Bill is not relevant to it. That is especially true in London, 
of which I have specific and more accurate knowledge.
<P>
The client side of most LAWDCs in London is small. 
They usually have fewer than 10 staff of white-collar and 
blue-collar workers. If the Bill's onerous duties were 
dogmatically applied to them, their task would be huge. 
A small group of staff would have to go through the 
paraphernalia of consulting on their duties with huge 
populations across four or five councils. They would have 
to assemble and assess the results, establish 
authority-wide objectives and performance measures, and 
agree a programme of fundamental performance reviews, 
to be set out in a local performance plan. They would 
have to undertake fundamental performance reviews of 
selected areas of expenditure. They have only one, which 
is massive but limited. They would have topublish 
performance efficiency targets and a local plan, and 
arrange and accept independent audit inspection and 
certification. They would also have to stand by and 
anticipate, albeit unrealistically, that the Secretary of State 
might take over. That brings a smile the combination of 
our current Secretary of State and waste disposal would 
create delightful opportunities for cartoonists.
<P>
Long-term contracts have already been set up with the 
private sector. We are considering a tiny element, a lack 
of forethought, and an enormous hammer to hit a 
non-existent nut. The current system of contract 
monitoring, with its regular reviews, contains the 
necessary requirements for producing excellent value, 
quality for money, even best value by any normal 
definition. It would be extremely difficult and excessively 
expensive to make any dramatic change in specifications. 
Variations and changes in recycling could be 
accommodated by other means.
<P>
In other words, applying best value, as set out in the 
Bill, to the waste disposal authorities is a waste of public 
money and time. it is a small business in revenue terms 
but it involves enormous capital expenditure. It is already 
producing good value for money and a quality service. 
Many of the private sector companies have taken the 
opportunity to go beyond that and, rather than just dispose 
of the waste, use it for energy production either from 
methane gas or straight incineration driving turbines. All 
of that needs massive finance, hence the reason for 
moving it out and not interfering with best value.
<P>
I suspect that the Minister needs to think about this. 
I hope that she does and that she decides not to move 
ahead and bulldoze this down upon those very small 
companies, in effect damaging a system that is working 
and is producing results. A few minor areas have not gone 
down this trail but the legislation is there to force them to 
do so and effectively produce best value.

<P>

<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> With my inexperience of Committee 
matters, may I just clarify whether, when the amendment 
was moved, the Liberal Democrat amendments were 
among those grouped with it, or must they be moved 
separately?



<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Unless Local Government otherwise 
stated, only the first amendment in a group will be moved, 
but hon. Members are entitled to debate any of the 
amendments in the group.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I thought that 
that was the position but that I had better check in case I 
got to the end of an impassioned speech on a group of 
amendments only to find that they were not being 
considered.
<P>
Our amendments Nos. 17, 18, 72 and 19 have a similar 
purpose to the Conservative amendments in that they are 
designed to probe and clarify the Government's thinking, 
particularly their criteria for determining which types of 
authorities should be best value authorities. Amendment 
No. 17 relates to the regional development agencies: only 
the London development agency is listed in the clause and 
we would like the Government to explain why that is so.
<P>
The next three amendments deal with the Greater 
London authority specifically. It is mentioned in the 
clause only so far as its powers are exercised through the 
mayor. Does that mean that the Government envisage that 
executive powers will be exercised only by the mayor, or 
will the authority members as a grouping have executive 
powers, in which case, are they not going to be subject to 
best value? Is that because the Government see the 
Greater London authority as having the same status as the 
Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament and 
therefore to be treated differently from local authorities? 
We would not disagree if that is how they see the GLA. 
The amendments are designed to tease out from the 
Government precisely what their view is of the status and 
functions of the GLA and whether they intend that 
authority as a whole to be subject to the best value regime.
<P>
I turn briefly to two of the Conservative amendments, 
one of which, amendment No. 108, we strongly support. It 
relates to the de minimis level that should apply to parish 
councils. Under the CCT regime there was a de minimis 
level. There was recognition that if an authority was 
precepting below a certain level, to have to go into the 
whole business of tendering for contracts and 
specifications, and all the rest of it, was not a good use of 
public money. The Government do not appear to see that 
there should be a de minimis level. One of the reasons 
why we particularly support amendment No. 108 is 
because the wording is almost exactly the same as an 
amendment that we have tabled later to clause 2.
<P>
I should like to question the Government on their 
attitude towards parish meetings, which I notice are 
included in best value authorities. I should be interested 
to know how the Government think that they will work. 
Parish meetings do not have precepting powers and, as far 
as I am aware, do not normally give out contracts. In 
which case, who is the responsible person at a parish 
meeting? Was the parish meeting thrown in for the future 
and is there any sensible thinking behind it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White (Milton Keynes, North-East):</B> Is the 
hon. Lady saying that parishes do not have contracts? 
A parish in my constituency with a budget of £80,000 a 
year regularly hands out contracts. Is the hon. Lady saying 
that they should not be subject to best value?
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I am not saying that parish councils 
should not be subject to best value. However, amendment 
No. 108 deals with budgets below a certain level and 
whether they should be subject to best value regime.
<P>
Generally, those who vote authorities into power make 
judgments about whether such authorities use best value 
techniques in awarding contracts. Parish meetings are not 
elected bodies and take place once a year to discuss 
matters of interest to the parish.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am most interested in the matters raised 
by the hon. Lady. A long time ago, I served as a chairman 
of a parish council. The parish meetings has a statutory 
position, as parishes are required to have an annual 
meeting. However, I was not aware that parish meetings 
could award contracts. I thought that the legal personality 
of the parish was the parish council, not the parish 
meeting. Does a parish meeting have a legal personality?



<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Let me clarify the two kinds of parish 
meeting. Parish councils must hold an annual meeting, 
which most electors attend and which produces a report. 
However, parishes that have not chosen to have elected 
councils may hold an annual parish meeting, at which a 
chairman is appointed. That body is not democratically 
constituted, so does not have powers to award contracts. 
I am therefore surprised that it is mentioned in the Bill as 
a best value authority. The Minister may be able to 
provide further clarification.
<P>
Amendment No. 109 will create astonishment, if not 
anger, in Wales, as it proposes that the National Assembly 
for Wales be treated not as government, but as a local 
authority. The Conservative party has traditionally treated 
that nation in such a manner, which may explain why 
there are no Conservative Members of Parliament there at 
present, nor are there likely to be any in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Hayes (South Holland and The Deepings):</B> 
I am mindful of your wide-ranging indulgence, Mr. Gale, 
but I have no desire to test it to its limits. I will therefore 
deal with amendment No. 110, which concerns the 
addition of regional authorities to the best value 
authorities listed in the Bill.
<P>
The omission of such authorities from the Bill is 
significant, and contradicts the Government's stated 
intentions on regional development agencies. The White 
Paper published at the end of 1997 discusses the 
wide-ranging role of regional development agencies, and 
specifies that power should not be centralised in 
Whitehall. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"all local, regional and national structures are needed for 
decision-making and for action to put those decisions into effect."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The White Paper brackets those organisations together, 
making them responsible for putting an agenda into effect. 
The White Paper goes on to define that agenda, as you 
will know, Mr. Gale, having served on the Committee that 
debated the Regional Development Agencies Bill. That 
agenda encompasses economic development, social and 
physical regeneration, business support, investment, 
competitiveness, enhancing skills, promoting 
employment, sustainable development: are none of these 
to be required to provide best value? Would people 
welcome regional authorities not being obliged to provide 
best value in such fields when local authorities must do 
so under the Local Government Bill? There is an 
inconsistency in treatment between local government and 
the regional authorities despite the fact that they have 
overlapping responsibilities.



<P>
Greater clarity is provided by the Greater London 
Authority Bill. During the debate on that we learned by 
way of comparison that the regional authorities were to 
be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General with 
the accounts being laid before Parliament. The White 
Paper that proceeded this Bill talks about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a modern council or authority which puts people first will seek to 
provide services which bare comparison with the best."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is repeated by the Bill.
<P>
By listing a number of authorities which are not local 
councils the Bill implicitly links those authorities together 
with that common agenda; the view that all bodies that 
are exercising significant power in this regard should be 
subject to the same best value criteria and tests and the 
same degree of accountability to the people for whom 
they are providing services.
<P>
That omission will put these authorities at an 
advantage. (It could be argued that to be a disadvantage) 
but let us assume for the moment that it is an advantage in 
that they would not be subject to the same sort of scrutiny. 
However, a the same time, implicitly, it will put local 
councils at a disadvantage. The Bill's demands upon them 
will be altogether more onerous. They will be required by 
the Secretary of State to prove that they are providing best 
value. Indeed, as we were told earlier, the Secretary of 
State takes new powers to make the ultimate decision in 
this regard. I reject that entirely and see it as an attack on 
local government, but I said that I would not test you too 
far Mr. Gale so we will not get back into that Second 
Reading debate.
<P>
Local authorities will be under all sorts of pressures 
and constraints which will not apply to RDAs, regional 
authorities or whatever they eventually become, unless we 
amend the Bill accordingly. My anxiety does not involve 
in any way supporting regional authorities or regional 
government. In fact, I regard them as an anathema and an 
attack on all our traditional local democratic institutions. 
Local government is founded on an ancient tradition and 
has a good history and, i n many cases, good practice. 
I am anxious to make sure that the Bill is consistent, 
practical and equitable. Unamended it is none of those 
things and I therefore lend full support, along with my 
right hon. and hon. Friends, to amendment No. 110.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I rise to support my hon. Friend the 
Member for South Holland and The Deepings
(Mr. Hayes) on his points about the regional development 
agencies. You will know, Mr. Gale, as you chaired the 
Committee which examined them, that they have now 
been put together in practice and will take legal effect in 
a couple of months' time.
<P>
The first point is that they are made up of people 
appointed by the Government. They may have gone 
through the Nolan procedures, but they are appointed. 
Even the people who have been elected the local 
authority people who we are at pains to be told are not 
delegated or representative in any way have themselves 
been appointed by the Secretary of State. They have not 
been voted into their position even by an electoral college 
of local authorities.
<P>
The second point is that the regional development 
agencies have a lot of money. I should have thought that 
they had more money than any single local authority in 
the areas that they serve. I would be surprised if that were 
not the case, certainly in Yorkshire and Humberside, for 
example. I do not know which local authority has the 
largest of the budgets, it may be Leeds, Bradford or 
Sheffield, but I would have thought that the regional 
development agency was significantly larger than that in 
terms of the total resources at its disposal.
<P>
The functions of two bodies, each of which were 
subject to periodic reviews, have been brought together. 
One was English Partnerships, the other was a rural 
development agency. Significant staff will be taken from 
the Government's offices because the people dealing with 
these regeneration issues will be servants of the regional 
development agencies. The agencies will also have the 
task of attracting investment and of being economic and 
investment agencies. This makes it especially important 
that they be subject to scrutiny. You, Mr. Gale, will recall 
that during the Committee stage of the Regional 
Development Agencies Bill, and in debates on the Bill in 
the House, I repeatedly asked the Government to tell us 
what they proposed to do to regulate competition between 
the agencies.



<P>
The Government acknowledge the existence of a 
problem. I recently tabled a question to the Prime 
Minister, who said that the Treasury was busy working it 
out, but that the findings were not ready for publication. 
We know that concordats are being drafted and that they 
will govern relations between the agencies and especially 
between the agencies and the devolved authorities in 
Scotland and Wales. I understand that one problem is that 
the Scots are being particularly difficult about agreeing 
some framework of self restraint or discipline, or of some 
way of going about the matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Perhaps I can help my hon. Friend by 
supporting his point that a framework should not be too 
difficult to achieve, given that in July 1997 the 
Government's statistical service published a consultation 
document on the regions which dealt with regional 
competitiveness indicators over a range of aspects such as 
output, employment, skills, infrastructure, transport and 
commercial property. The framework for developing 
measurements of performance and best value is already 
there, so the task is not difficult.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Moreover, 
the Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning 
has set out a series of criteria. He incessantly compares 
per capita performances in the United Kingdom with 
those of continental countries, and has suggested that it is 
the job of regional development agencies to ensure that 
that gap is closed. They are unelected bodies with a large 
budget. The Government acknowledge that there is a risk 
of a sort of competitive bidding that would bring problems 
in the use of public resources. They clearly accept that 
relationships between these agencies and the devolved 
authorities in Scotland and Wales may be difficult. We do 
not know what the agencies will do. They may start 
setting up offices in Brussels, for example. The Minister's 
ministerial colleague has said that some of them are 
getting together to make representations in the United 
States.
<P>
We need some means of knowing whether the money 
is being well spent. It will be of particular urgency to 
know this early on in the career of the development 
agencies so that we know whether they are setting off on 
the right foot, whether resources are being duplicated and 
whether the main beneficiaries are companies that are able 
to persuade the agencies to bid against each other. We 
have already seen the problems of poaching. For example, 
the Welsh Development Agency is notorious for its 
attempts to poach businesses from other parts of England, 
to Wales. It is crucial that agencies be subject to scrutiny.
<P>
As I stressed on Second Reading, the development 
agencies should be given a chance. I do not say that 
because I disapprove of them. I am willing to give them 
a chance to decide whether they work. But it is 
particularly important that they be subject to the same 
form of scrutiny that we would expect to be imposed on 
a democratically elected body. I hope that, when the 
Minister comments on bodies that the Secretary of State 
might decide to require to be subject to best value criteria, 
she will state categorically that the RDAs, as some of the 
biggest quangos now being established, for a purpose, I 
do not dispute, will be included in that scrutiny. 
Otherwise, an enormous part of the Government's new 
political and economic structures will be set up absolved 
from any scrutiny requirements upon them.
<P>
<B>Mr Adrian Sanders (Torbay):</B> I welcome you to the 
Chair, Mr. O'Brien. I wish to speak briefly to 
amendments Nos. 106 and 107.
<P>
When we first considered the Bill we noticed the 
exclusion of unitary and metropolitan authorities. We 
looked at one another, thinking that the mission of those 
authorities could not have been a mistake, and thought 
nothing more of it. Others thought that there had been an 
omission. Will the Minister say briefly whether this was 
a simple drafting oversight or whether those councils are 
covered by some other term that we have been unable to 
discover in the provision?
<P>
On a lighter note, as a Member of Parliament who 
represents a newly created unitary authority, I am tempted 
to vote against the amendment, so that unitary authorities 
can be exempted. We could then compare the best value 
authorities with those that do not provide best value. That 
would provide an added comparison of service levels 
and performance.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am grateful to Opposition Members 
for the way in which they tackled the amendments. They 
suggested that the amendments were probing 
amendments, which rightly try to clarify the scope of the 
duty and the categories of authorities to which it will 
apply. However, many of their anxieties are misplaced, 
and I hope that I can reassure them.
<P>
I shall deal with amendments Nos. 111 and 112, tabled 
by the hon. Member for North Essex. Those amendments 
would exclude specific police authority functions from the 
Bill's best value provisions. However, that would not be 
consistent with our best value objectives for the police 
service. Those objectives include ensuring that the police 
provide high-quality services across the full range of 
their activities.



<P>
Matters of national security and operational 
effectiveness will always be priorities for police 
authorities and chief constables, as they are for the 
Government. Nothing in the best value provisions will 
affect the ability of the police to discharge those functions.
<P>
The amendment would also exclude from best value 
provisions functions that constitute a statutory duty of a 
police authority. Under the Police Act 1996, a police 
authority has only one statutory function, which is to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"secure the maintenance of an efficient and effective police force 
for its area."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, the amendment would exclude police 
authorities and, by implication, chief constables, from best 
value provisions. That is undesirable, and I am sure that 
Opposition Members do not intend such an effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> In north Yorkshire, the police have 
undergone a detailed inspection by the chief inspector of 
constabulary. The number of diversions will be reduced 
from seven to three because of the savings requirements. 
Under best value provisions, will there be a further 
examination by an authority other than the chief inspector 
of constabulary? If so, how do the inspections 
complement each other? What is the difference between 
the aspects they examine?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The current inspection arrangements 
by Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary will 
continue. The Bill does not alter them or the ways in 
which police discharge their functions. Clearly, the police 
authority in north Yorkshire and the chief constable they 
have different roles are responsible for implementing 
the HMIC report and for deciding how to take action at 
operational level in response to the HMIC inspection. 
That will continue, but the police authority and the chief 
constable must monitor that. Extensive discussions have 
taken place between the Department of the Environment, 
Transport and the Regions and my right hon. Friend the 
Home Secretary, who is keen for best value provisions to 
be introduced in the police service.
<P>
Another Opposition amendment would exempt support 
services from the duty of best value.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The Minister seems to be saying 
that the current procedure will continue and that the police 
authority will provide reports. We will then introduce best 
value. If there is a problem, will it be brought back to a 
different Secretary of State or to the Home Secretary or 
will the two work together, or what?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Opposition Members seem to take the 
view that best value is somewhere out there and that it 
can just be captured and brought in. We are talking about 
the way in which authorities such as North Yorkshire 
police authority should in future approach the regular 
evaluation of their work. They should not have to wait for 
inspectorates. Of course inspectorates will enter at a 
specific stage to say that certain functions are not being 
fulfilled. However, best value is all about authorities 
taking responsibility, continually, for how their functions 
are discharged, how their statutory obligations are met and 
how they respond to the public that they serve. They 
should be matching the aims, ambitions and needs of the 
public with the delivery of services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> If the hon. Lady can clarify an issue now 
it may save us having to debate it later when the same 
question will arise. In response to my initial question she 
said that the police authority would monitor the 
implementation of an inspection by Her Majesty's 
constabulary.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I said be responsible for, not monitor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Now the police authority is not an expert 
on the details of policing, which is a technical issue. What 
would the authority, as opposed to the chief constable 
decide to look into? Would the authority be at liberty to 
invite or commission HMIC to pursue an intermediate 
inquiry, for example? Two years down the line from a 
present inspection of north Yorkshire, people will want to 
know whether the force has delivered as expected. Can 
the authority call on the inspectorate to help it do so?



<P>
As the hon. Lady said, this is not supposed to be an 
airy-fairy sort of thing but an integral part of performance. 
Opposition Members want to know about practice: how 
will it happen and how will it be delivered? Who calls on 
whom and what sort of questions will be asked? It is a 
more general issue: it applies to education, which also 
has an external inspectorate. We want to know about the 
relationships between external inspectorates and 
responsible management authorities 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Chair desires to facilitate 
debate. Interventions must be interventions, not speeches. 
If the hon. Gentleman wishes to make another speech, he 
must do so.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. The right hon. 
Member for Skipton and Ripon wants to make sure that 
this Committee answers to every single operational 
decision. I recall great debates in the previous Parliament 
about the operational responsibilities of the chief 
constable or the head of the prison service, and about 
powers of intervention or powers to organise policy and 
frameworks. The issues apply here too.
<P>
There has to be a good relationship between the chief 
constable and the police authority, but they also have 
distinct responsibilities. The chief constable has particular 
responsibilities for operational policing; the police 
authority must carry out its realm of responsibility. They 
both affect the effectiveness of the police service as a 
whole and it is important that through best value we can 
consider the best way of working together to secure the 
most effective delivery of statutory requirements and the 
most effective response to local populations.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have not yet finished with the right 
hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon. He asked about 
inspections. At the moment the inspectorate has some 
autonomy over the timing of inspections. That is a good 
principle, which I wish to maintain under best value. 
Authorities that do good work will get a good inspection 
result.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Inspection does not half concentrate the 
mind.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Of course it does.
<P>
Irresponsible authorities will get a poor inspections 
result. That is why the previous Administration decided 
to take a hard look at inspections, especially those in some 
service areas. We wish to ensure that authorities in the 
local government sphere that are precepting or raising 
taxes recognise their duty to monitor and evaluate their 
work in relation to the public whom they serve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Is the Minister saying that there are no 
restrictions on how the Secretary of State applies his 
powers of intervention? We are all in favour of local 
authorities doing their best to achieve best value. 
However, are police activities immune from the Secretary 
of State's intervention under the Bill? Will the Minister 
confirm that the Secretary of State will not interfere in 
arresting, charging, and gathering evidence for 
prosecution.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We are not changing regulations or 
laws on how the police and chief constables execute 
their duties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Yes, the Government are.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No, we are not. We are ensuring that, 
in executing their duties and meeting their responsibilities, 
the police get best value for the public whom they seek 
to serve. That is not the same as changing every law 
relating to the police authorities.
<P>
We will tackle matters of intervention when we come 
to debate clause 13. Clause 1, however, addresses whether 
police authorities and chief constables should be subject 
to the duty of best value.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I will decide what is in order. 
All debate so far has been in order.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am certainly not saying that debate 
has not been in order. However, powers of intervention 
will become clearer when we come to debate clause 13.
<P>
I come now to the Bill's implications for police 
authorities. Amendment No. 112 would remove their duty 
to provide best value support services. I assume that the 
Opposition are referring to services such as 
administration, information technology, training and so 
on. We do not see why such services whether provided 
nationally or locally should be removed from the duty 
to provide best value. They should be critically reviewed 
and inspected regularly, so that we can be sure that they 
are provided efficiently and effectively.



<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
The duty of best value does not relate to the day-to-day 
operational responsibilities of police forces.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkins:</B> Where does it say that?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The proposal applies to the way in 
which the chief constable and the police authority will 
take their decisions. As I said, amendment No. 112 seeks 
to remove support services from the relevant provisions. 
We think that they are applicable in this context, which is 
why we drafted the Bill in the way that we did. I assure 
the hon. Gentleman that the duty of best value does not 
relate to operational matters, which are a matter for the 
Home Secretary the Bill will not undermine that 
arrangement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for her 
clarifications, but I must correct one point about 
amendment No. 112. Paragraph (4A) (d) of that 
amendment makes it clear that we do not exclude all 
support services, full stop. The amendment would give 
the Home Secretary the discretion to exclude a support 
service, because there may be operational reasons relating 
to policing why he needs to do so.
<P>
However, I must press the Minister further on this 
crucial point. The Bill does not allow any police activity 
to be exempt from best value. That does not mean that 
we do not think that police forces should provide best 
value we are in favour of efficiency and effectiveness 
but no police activity is exempt, ultimately, from the 
powers of intervention, which we shall discuss later.
<P>
I find the Minister's statement surprising. Compulsory 
competitive tendering was limited to certain functions, but 
the Government's proposal is all-embracing and it puts 
powers in what I may call the hands of the Secretary of 
State. In this context, I use that description as a wide 
generic term that ultimately refers to the Treasury rather 
than the Home Secretary. We may table an amendment 
on Report stating that, with respect to police authorities, 
the relevant powers should be held by the Home Secretary 
and not generally by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It is clear that this aspect of the Bill 
relates to police authorities' duty to secure the 
maintenance of an efficient and effective police force in 
a region, which is their single, statutory duty. That is what 
best value applies to it applies not to the operational 
duties of police forces but to police authorities. I hope 
that that clarifies the situation.
<P>
There appears to be some misunderstanding about the 
amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Mole Valley 
(Sir P. Beresford). Those amendments would remove 
waste disposal authorities from the scope of the Bill's best 
value provisions. Best value is needed to ensure that waste 
disposal and collection authorities and the waste industry 
take a more integrated approach to waste management and 
that they deliver efficient, effective and high-quality 
services.
<P>
The companies that the hon. Gentleman mentions 
welcome the introduction of best value and the 
consultation document that we released last year. Last 
summer we consulted on a paper called "Less Waste More 
Value"	, in which we showed how we shall deal with the 
Environmental Protection Act 1990, which required the 
mandatory transfer of waste disposal functions from local 
authority control, and the introduction of best value. In 
our paper, we signalled our intention to repeal those 
provisions of the 1990 Act that deal with mandatory 
transfer. The waste industry was fully involved in that 
consultation. It supported the consultation exercise and 
the Government's view that best value should be 
introduced.



<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Repealing those provisions brings 
to mind the clicheÂ of stable doors. There are only six 
statutory waste disposal authorities, four or five of which 
have already put the work out to contract. The contracts 
are extensive and have tight specifications. Change would 
be extremely and may be exceptionally expensive for 
local authorities. Changes in what waste is disposed of 
could simply be brought about through the waste 
collection authority rather than the disposal authorities. 
That might be the more practical way to proceed. When 
does the Minister intend to introduce legislation to remove 
the appropriate sections of the 1990 Act?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The essence of best value is that no 
authority can take a decision that involves it in 
unnecessary expenditure The hon. Gentleman implied that 
authorities will try to unpick the provisions and not go for 
the most efficient method, partly because of the contracts, 
which is fair enough. But they certainly would not be 
achieving best value if that were the case. Not only would 
he and the waste authorities have something to say about 
that, but so would their auditors and the public.
<P>
Best value exists to ensure that authorities get the best 
price for a particular activity, which is of a standard that 
satisfies local people. The principles of best value will 
apply to all functions of waste disposal where possible. I 
accept that good results are being achieved in many areas, 
including my own. The hon. Gentleman was right to say 
that I recently approved a private finance initiative for 
Surrey county council to help it to move forward with its 
waste disposal programme.
<P>
It is important that councils do not do something and 
then forget about it. They have a responsibility to ensure 
that best value is achieved on a continual basis. It may 
well be that they should expose their arrangements to 
regular review and compare the performance of services 
being provided to their citizens with what is happening 
elsewhere. That is what best value is about. It is about 
ensuring that the relationship between the private and 
public sector provides services in the most efficient way 
and on a continual basis, because those services are of 
intense public concern. Such services should not last for 
just a couple of years but for the foreseeable future.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I recognise the good words. They 
applied when the changes were initiated and they have 
produced competitively tendered best value. The 
financially most beneficial contracts have not always been 
accepted reasons to accept other contracts have been 
given and approved. The contracts in question are 
exceptionally long-term contracts. If a local authority or 
a group of local authorities, such as LAWDC, decided 
that they wanted to make dramatic changes after 
consultation with the public who may not understand the 
length and tightness of the relevant contract how would 
the changes be implemented? What would be the reaction 
to the financial kickback that may arise if the contract 
is changed?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It is not my responsibility to know the 
nature of every contract. I would be horrified if a contract 
was set in stone and there was never any chance to secure 
recovery or improvement. We want to ensure that councils 
get the best deal for people. I understand the hon. Member 
for Mole Valley; he was largely responsible for the 
introduction of the relevant legislation and he wants to 
defend it. Our measure does not undermine or unpick it. 
It ensures that authorities will not forget about their 
responsibilities and that they will work with some of the 
relevant companies to see where further efficiency can be 
achieved through, for example, bringing some functions 
together and improving waste recycling. That will lead to 
the other benefits that the pubic want.
<P>
Repeal of the provisions will not be a signal for waste 
disposal authorities to take waste functions back in-house. 
Rather, it will provide the flexible in-service provision 
that a best value authority will need. I do not suppose that 
I shall ever reassure the hon. Member for Mole Valley, 
but I hope that other right hon. and hon. Members will 
accept that our approach is intended to maximise 
effectiveness.



<P>
Amendments Nos. 106 and 107 would expand the 
definition of a local authority under clause 1(2)(a) to 
include a specific reference to unitary and metropolitan 
councils respectively. The amendments are unnecessary 
because both kinds of council are covered by the term 
"district council"	 used in clause 1(2)(a). I understand hon. 
Members' confusion. anyone who tries to take a 
common-sense approach to these matters can be confused 
by the language and the references to different classes of 
authority, as I understand they are known. However, I 
hope that hon. Members will be reassured that the 
paragraph is not a devious means of excluding unitary and 
metropolitan authorities from the measure.
<P>
I am grateful to Opposition Members for bringing to 
the Committee's attention, through amendment No. 108, 
a possible threshold for the application of the best value 
duty. The local government White Paper last year 
suggested a figure of £500,000 as a possible de minimis 
level for best-value authorities in England. That is because 
we recognise that a statutory duty could be onerous if 
applied in full to the smaller town and parish council. We 
are considering whether that would be an appropriate 
level and are consulting interested parties particularly 
the National Association of Local Councils about it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister will be aware that that body 
is now making representations to the effect that the 
threshold should be higher £750,000. The real point is, 
as the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) 
mentioned, that there was a de minimis limit in the 
compulsory competitive tendering legislation. Surely it 
would be sensible, for clarification, to include a statutory 
limit in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I do not agree with that. I know of the 
representations being made by NALC. I had heard that 
several alternative propositions were on the table. Clearly 
we need to discuss the matter with those concerned, 
although it will be for the Government to agree the level. 
We do not want the threshold to be specified in the Bill 
because we want it to be reviewed and amended as 
necessary. I said that the Government would make the 
decision, but of course Parliament would do it, because 
the provision would be in secondary legislation.
<P>
Setting the figure by order provides us with the 
flexibility that will be needed to review the de minimis 
level, but the de minimis level will none the less be set 
through secondary legislation. I would not recommend 
specifying the amount in the Bill. That would be 
unrealistic and would not allow for a consideration of 
changing circumstances. We need to think carefully about 
whether we could amend the de minimis level in such 
changing circumstances. I assure Committee members 
that the Government are not trying to avoid a de minimis 
level we suggested a figure of £500,000 in the White 
Paper.




<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment No. 17 which was tabled by the Liberal 
Democrats, although several Opposition Members 
referred to it would subject regional development 
agencies under the previous Government for many a long 
year, I understand Opposition Members' concern and was 
interested to hear this morning's debate. I was not a 
member of the Committee that debated regional 
development agencies. Perhaps some lessons have been 
learnt, and having been unable to persuade the 
Government of the time of things that might be done, hon. 
Members are now trying to ensure that we do what they 
were unable to do.
<P>
The Bill's object is those authorities that fall within the 
scope of the local government finance system that is, 
billing, precepting or levying bodies. I acknowledge that 
at some stage there may be a directly elected relationship 
between the regional government tier and regional 
development agencies, but it does not yet exist. Even if 
that were the case, there is still doubt about whether such 
bodies would have precepting, billing or tax-raising 
powers. That will not be clear for some time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I should like just to finish my 
argument.
<P>
The Bill deals with only those authorities I have 
mentioned. There are a raft of other bodies to which the 
same argument that hon. Members used in relation to 
RDAs could apply. I accept the spirit in which that 
argument was made, but the Bill is precise and is not 
competent to wander into those other areas, as would 
happen if we accepted the amendment.
<P>
The London development agency is different. The Bill 
identifies it as a best value authority because it will be 
precepting on the Greater London authority, which means 
that it will fall within the local government finance system 
and, therefore, within the scope of the Bill.
<P>
At this stage, RDAs are not within the local 
government finance system; they are non-departmental 
public bodies which are funded by central Government 
grant-in-aid and accountable to the Secretary of State and 
Parliament. Moreover, their financial arrangements will 
be set out in a financial memorandum and they will be 
audited by the National Audit Office. RDAs, like all 
NDPBs, will be subject to periodic financial management 
and policy reviews. There are, therefore, satisfactory 
arrangements in place to safeguard the probity and value 
for money aspects of RDAs. The necessary powers are 
contained in the Regional Development Agencies Act 
1998. If we accepted the amendment, we would open up 
best value to NDPBs. People might like to return to that 
argument at some stage, but at this stage there is a clear 
audit and accounting system for such bodies, which is 
outside the Bill's scope.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I take the Minister's point about the RDAs 
being quangos, but they are like no other quangos. The 
whole point about the way in which they have been 
introduced and about the Government's rhetoric is that 
they are quite separate and different from typical quangos. 
If they were simply quangos, much of the rhetoric would 
become empty and meaningless. In the case of a specific 
area of service delivery, such as economic development, 
which is a stated objective of RDAs and local authorities, 
the local authority will, under the Bill, be subject to best 
value criteria to which its matching RDA is not. That is 
inequitable and unreasonable, and places an undue burden 
on the properly and democratically elected body the 
county council or district council in question.



<P>
Finally, because RDAs are not yet elected and are, 
therefore, not accountable to the electorate, they should 
be accountable to no one else.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am bewildered by that intervention. 
I have spelt out how RDAs are accountable and how their 
funds and so on will be audited. The hon. Gentleman 
suggests that there should be a double count and double 
accountability. He is being unrealistic. RDAs may be 
different in function and make-up from other NDPBs, but 
they are accountable to Parliament, the Secretary of State 
and the National Audit Office in the same way as other 
NDPBs. They are not elected, and the beauty of best value 
as currently envisaged is not appropriate to a non-elected 
body.
<P>
If best value is a success, as I hope that it will be, we 
may be able to extend it throughout other public services. 
We want to make sure that it works. Opposition Members 
have been pushing us to ensure that we get the detail and 
the way in which it will work right. I have said outside 
the House that the political momentum in any authority 
to which best value is applied is important. There has to 
be political ownership of what goes on in terms of best 
value, whatever the party may be. I cannot say that in 
relation to RDAs or other NDPBs.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I am quite puzzled by the Minister's 
reasoning. She seems to be saying that if a body is not 
elected, its financial dealings are audited and it is 
accountable to Parliament, it does not have to meet the 
duty of best value. Yet, she puts the burden of double 
accountability and double counting on local authorities, 
which have a mandate and which are directly elected. The 
Government have got their priorities the wrong way 
round. They should have started best value with the 
non-elected bodies. A good place to start would be with 
those that they created themselves the regional 
development agencies.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Again, the real problem is that 
Opposition Members think that the duty of best value 
relates to the councils; in fact, it relates to the public. 
The authorities with which the Bill deals will be primarily 
responsible to the public for the manner in which services 
are organised and delivered. They will be responsible to 
the public for the services that they decide are appropriate 
for them to consider.
<P>
I understand Opposition Members' argument, but the 
Bill is part of our local government modernisation. It does 
not seek to take on issues relating to public services that 
are organised in other ways. It is not just that they are 
audited different, but that they have a different line of 
accountability and responsibility. To give them the duty 
of best value to their public in the way that we are giving 
it to local authorities would require slight differences. 
Local government may be able to lead the way in showing 
how to obtain the support for public services and 
commitment to them, to which we should return. That will 
be a hugh benefit for the rest of the public sector, which 
will then ask to take best value on board.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I want to press the question of which 
organisations are appropriate for best value. The Minister 
has made clear what she sees as the criteria she said that 
local authorities should lead the way, and that an elected 
body is suitable for regulation under the Bill. The clause, 
however, details a number of authorities that are not 
elected in the sense that the Minister means, and which 
are not directly comparable with district or county 
councils. She spoke about police authorities, which 
already have mechanisms for delivering audited tests of 
best value, but which will be obliged to take on another 
tier of management, or at least an onerous burden, in 
providing that they are delivering value for money. That 
does not seem to square with what she then said about 
RDAs. One accepts that RDAs are quangos, and that a 
quango would not usually be subject to such requirements. 
Given the RDAs' scope and responsibilities, however, the 
provisions are at least as applicable to them as to police 
authorities and to some of the other organisations detailed 
in the clause. The national parks authorities and the 
Broads Authority similarly spring to mind.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is not 
making an intervention, but a speech.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have tried to explain the usual 
definition of a local authority, which we have used in the 
Bill. It includes precepting bodies. All of the bodies listed 
by the hon. Gentleman are precepting bodies, which 
means that they come within the local government family. 
I am responsible for local government, and I am seeking 
to ensure that my responsibilities in government are 
reflected in the Committee. I am responsible for ensuring 
that the system of accountability for the spending of 
public money in local authorities can be defended. We 
believe that the system of best value is the means of 
achieving that. That is why the clause is drafted as it is.
<P>
I shall now give more detailed consideration to the 
Greater London authority. Amendment No. 18 would 
make the Greater London authority a best value authority 
by identifying it separately under clause 1(1). Amendment 
No. 19 would subject all the functions of the authority to 
the general duty of best value, and not just those corporate 
functions exercised though the mayor. Amendment 
No.21, however, seeks to remove in relation to the 
authority the definition of those functions, to which the 
Secretary of State may apply by order the duty of best 
value, preventing us from allocating the duty of best value 
to the assembly, or to the mayor and the assembly jointly 
in respect of GLA functions exercised in either of those 
ways.



<P>
Amendment No. 72 would remove the identification of 
the Greater London authority as a best value authority so 
far as it exercises its functions through the mayor. 
Amendment No. 113 would remove clause 2(4), which 
provides for the best value to be applied to the Greater 
London authority in respect of specified functions which 
it does not exercise through the mayor, and includes a 
provision for the GLA to be involved in activities in 
respect of functions of other best value authorities.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Government believe that the Greater London 
authority should be subjected to the duty of best value. 
But the way in which the duty of best value is applied to 
it needs to be flexibly drawn to take account of the 
different ways in which the GLA exercises its functions 
and its relationship with the four functional bodies which 
will deliver the main London-wide services the London 
fire and emergency planning authority, Transport for 
London, the London development agency and the 
Metropolitan police authority.
<P>
The Bill needs to be sufficiently flexible to cater for 
different internal working arrangements to ensure that as 
much of the GLA's normal work as possible is subject to 
the duty of best value. Clause 2(4) achieves that by 
allowing the Secretary of State to provide by order for the 
duty of best value to be applied to any functions which 
the GLA exercises other than through the mayor and to 
any role it plays in respect of functions of other best value 
authorities, such as setting a strategy for Transport for 
London.
<P>
This approach to creating a duty of best value for the 
GLA takes specific account of the range of different 
relationships that will exist between its constituent parts, 
and will ensure, as far as possible, that accountability for 
delivering best value will be attached to the bodies which 
are responsible for carrying out the various functions. 
These are separately audited and separately accountable 
bodies. The accountability for the duty of best value needs 
to be equally clearly drawn, so that there is no doubt 
where responsibility for delivering it lies. The 
combination of provisions in the Bill allows us to ensure 
that that will be the case. We will, of course, be prepared 
to assist the GLA and its functional bodies by means of 
guidance, should it prove necessary.
<P>
A simple application of the duty of best value to the 
GLA corporately, which is what amendments Nos. 18, 19 
and 21 seem to seek to achieve, would prevent these aims 
from being achieved satisfactorily. We run the risk of 
blurred lines of accountability if the application of the 
duty of best value is not clearly specified.

<P>

<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The Minister seems to be saying that 
the Secretary of State is to be given yet another power, at 
some unspecified time, to decide by order that best value 
will be extended to the GLA. What criteria, which are not 
available now, will he or she be using to make that 
decision at a later date?



<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We are talking about a body that will 
not be set up for some time. We want to be sure that we 
will be able to respond flexibly to the manner in which 
the authority is working, and to whether, at some period, 
it would set up another body to do something else that we 
have not yet thought of. I do not anticipate that. We 
therefore think that the Greater London Authority Bill and 
this Bill, as drafted, cover whatever will be necessary. 
None of us has the benefit of being able to see what this 
great city will look like in 10 years' time. By then, the 
GLA might well be saying new and different things. I am 
simply saying that that is what local government ought to 
be about. We need to be sure that the legislative 
framework covers that adequately. However, those are the 
realms of speculation, and I really should not be tempted 
down that route. The Greater London Authority Bill has 
clearly specified the relevant powers and functions. It has 
also specified the discrete way in which Transport for 
London, the London fire and emergency planning 
authority and so on will work. We must respond to that 
discrete analysis in applying best value.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That goes to the heart of a concern about 
the Bill that we share with Liberal Democrat Members. 
The Minister says that we are speculating, but she is 
telling members of the Committee that we can only 
speculate as to how the Secretary of State will use his 
powers in the future. We are, in effect, legislating to give 
the Secretary of State a blank cheque. At a time when 
local government is looking for stability because of the 
changes that the Government are currently making, the 
new Greater London authority will be permanently 
looking over its shoulder and wondering what the 
Secretary of State is going to do next and which new 
duties are going to be applied or disapplied to different 
parts of the authority. It is not satisfactory for the Minister 
to say, "We don't know and we are not prepared to 
speculate."	
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The amendments would make the 
situation even more wide and speculative. It is because 
we do not want to be so wide and generous that the Bill 
is drafted in the way that it is. As I have already said, 
simply to say the best value is delivered corporately 
would lead us into difficulties about how separate 
functions would carry out their particular areas of 
responsibility, and would also mean that we were unable 
to make sure that they were accounted for separately. 
Furthermore, it would imply that, whatever the body 
sought to do, corporate responsibility would mean that 
there is no involvement to bear. The Bill is more 
tightly-drawn that Opposition members want it to be, 
judging by their amendment. The amendment would make 
the situation more wide and speculative. That is why I 
said earlier that I was unsure as to whether the hon. 
Members concerned understood the scope of their 
amendments.
<P>
The simple corporate application would not allow us 
clearly to identify the roles of the mayor 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Who is "us"	?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> People would not be able to identify 
the separate roles and responsibilities of the mayor, the 
assembly and the functional bodies if the duty was simply 
applied in a blanket manner. That is why the Bill, rather 
than saying, "We think that this might be so in x number 
of years"	, stipulates how the duty of best value will apply 
to the Greater London authority by specifying the separate 
elements to which it will apply.[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have listened patiently to 
sedentary interventions all morning. I advise Minister and 
other hon. Members not to respond to any sedentary 
interventions. They are discourteous and make it almost 
impossible for the Hansard reporters to maintain a proper 
record of the proceedings.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I was not 
intending to respond on that occasion, but I shall 
remember your injunction for the future.



<P>
Amendments Nos. 105 and 109 both relate to the 
National Assembly for Wales. I hope that my hon. Friend 
the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Wales will be able 
to catch your eye, Mr. Gale, to speak to those 
amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I call the hon. Member 
for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), I remind hon. 
Members that the normal procedure is for those who wish 
to speak to catch the Chairman's eye and to rise in their 
places when the previous speaker has finished. The hon. 
Member for North Shropshire indicated to me that he 
wanted to speak, but he wishes to speak to an amendment 
that has not yet been discussed. That is proper, and it is 
right that he should be allowed to do so. However, it 
makes life difficult for the Chairman if it is not made clear 
that hon. Members wish to speak, because we try to call 
all hon. Members on all amendments before inviting the 
Minister to respond. Otherwise we are simply duplicating 
the process. It is not always possible, although we try very 
hard, to see every hon. Member when seated, so it would 
help the Chairman if hon. Members could rise before 
indicating that they wish to speak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I did in fact rise 
but next time I will ensure that I rise firmly in your line 
of sight and I will move my place.
<P>
Amendment No. 105 falls exactly within the remit of 
comments made by the Minister. She said that this was 
all about meeting statutory responsibilities to bring 
together aims and needs of the public as statutory duties. 
She made it quite clear that best value is not appropriate 
to a non-elected body. She said that the duty of best value 
is to the public. I would have thought that on all those 
counts the Welsh Assembly falls smack bang within the 
remit of what we are discussing.
<P>
What these bodies have in common is that they have 
been set up with substantial statutory responsibilities, 
delegated by central Government through primary 
legislation. They are given substantial public funds that 
are distributed by elected representatives who do not have 
the responsibility for raising those funds. What we are 
trying to grasp this morning is how we come up with a 
mechanism that artificially sorts out the problem of people 
spending money but not presenting themselves to the 
electorate with the consequences of their decisions. They 
are not responsible for having raised it.
<P>
The Welsh Assembly is anomalous in that. It is a totally 
unique body. It will have executive and derivative 
functions in the second tier. It will not pass any primary 
legislation. It will take on the role of the Secretary of State 
for Wales and it will distribute the Welsh block, which is 
currently provided by the Barnett formula. Those funds 
will be distributed, as I will explain, following the 
deliberations of the Assembly members, many of whom 
will be superannuated county councillors from the happily 
defunct second tier of county councils which were 
abolished by the previous Government. They will have 
the power to disburse public funds without the 
responsibility of raising them. That is the critical point.
<P>
Throughout the devolution debates the Government set 
their teeth against giving the Welsh Assembly any 
tax-raising powers, similar to the Scottish Assembly. The 
only area of fund raising in which the Welsh Assembly 
will be involved will be the levying of council tax, which 
will effectively be contracted out to local authorities, such 
as county councils, county borough councils or 
community councils.
<P>
The Government have set themselves up for a headlong 
constitutional collision. The Assembly members will 
inevitably develop their own dynamic, pressing for more 
public funds to be spent on a range of thoroughly worthy 
causes which they will be pushed into supporting by those 
who elect them. They will not have to go through the pain 
of raising those funds through taxation or of having those 
tax levels validated at the ballot box at the risk of their 
political careers.



<P>
It is worse in Wales because 25 per cent. of 
Government expenditure per head is derived from outside 
Wales, not raised from taxation within Wales. We have a 
responsibility to ensure that the assembly works within a 
clearly understood framework of best practice. The bodies 
in the list in clause 1 which have a status similar to the 
Welsh Assembly we have just talked about the Greater 
London authority fall into exactly that category. I do not 
understand why the Welsh Assembly has been exempted.
<P>
The Welsh Assembly will be similar to a local 
authority. It should also be included because it will have 
responsibility for an enormous budget. The Welsh Office 
currently spends £7 billion of public money. It will be 
costly to run. The White Paper on Wales told us that it 
would cost £15 million to £20 million and the Welsh 
Office about £72 million. During televised evidence of 
the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs, which I am free 
to use as it is already in the public domain, some of us 
were horrified to learn from the permanent Secretary or 
the impermanent Secretary she is bailing out at the end 
of February, perhaps because she foresees some 
unattractive solids hitting the fan in May that the current 
estimate of the cost of running the whole show is
£120 million. She said that she had kept back £5 million 
to £10 million because she was a cautious person. An 
assembly is set up to spend, not raise money.
<P>
A final danger in setting up an Assembly is that it will 
be dominated by the Labour party. Every area where 
Labour authorities have a total grip for example, south 
Wales, Doncaster, the north-east of England sinks into 
a miasma. Single party Labour government leads to a 
descent into a bog of inefficiency, corruption and 
malpractice.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am trying desperately hard to 
relate the hon. Gentleman's words to the amendment, but 
I am finding it difficult. Will the hon. Gentleman please 
stick to the point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Absolutely, Mr. Gale.
<P>
The amendments suggest that the Welsh Assembly 
should be included in the best practice provisions to 
prevent it from following the unhappy road that I 
described. The public will be reassured if the Assembly 
has a clear framework within which to operate.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for </B><P>
Wales (Mr. Jon Owen Jones): It is a pleasure to speak 
after the hon. Member for North Shropshire. He shows 
clearly how far the Conservative party has moved from 
its adherence to failed policies that the electorate rejected.
<P>
Amendment No. 105 would apply best value provisions 
to the National Assembly for Wales as well as to local 
authorities, national park authorities, police and fire 
authorities.
<P>
I am not sure about the hon. Gentleman's intentions in 
tabling amendment No. 109. Its effect would be to define 
the Welsh Assembly as an English local authority for best 
value purposes. It is difficult to believe that that is 
intentional, but, having listened to the hon. Gentleman's 
speech, he probably intends that effect.



<P>
According to The Daily Telegraph today, the hon. 
Member for North Essex is earmarked for preferment in 
the new Tory party, which, apparently, intends to sweep 
away some of its older Front Benchers. I tell the hon. 
Gentleman in the most friendly manner that it is not in 
his interest to anchor the Conservative party to failed 
policies that have been overwhelmingly rejected. I 
believed that Conservative party's current view was that 
we should make devolution work. If that is the 
Conservative party's intention, its members cannot 
support amendment No. 109. I am trying to help 
Opposition Members' preferment chances. The right hon. 
Member for Skipton and Ripon was also mentioned in the 
article in The Daily Telegraph.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> There was a condition, though.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> Yes. It was that the right hon. Gentleman 
should play by the new rules. I have always regarded the 
right hon. Gentleman as being on the progressive wing of 
the Conservative party. I have probably done him no 
favours by saying that.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon accused 
the Welsh Development Agency of poaching jobs from 
English regions. I refute that allegation. Understandable 
jealousy has resulted from the WDA's success. However, 
its success must be set against the decline of the gross 
domestic product of Wales, until it became the poorest 
region of mainland Britain, during the Conservative 
Government's period of office. The right hon. 
Gentleman's chances for preferment will not be helped by 
his criticism of the alleged poaching of the WDA, since 
the largest single investment of LG into Newport recently 
was achieved under the leadership of the current Leader 
of the Opposition. It will not do him any good to attack 
the WDA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The hon. Gentleman's concern for my 
career is deeply moving and I am grateful to him for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> It is genuine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman is 
in a position to influence it substantially. If he had listened 
to my debates about the Welsh Development Agency, he 
would know that I criticised that investment in Wales and 
said that it would cost an absolute arm and a leg a 
monstrous amount of money. Whether it is likely to take 
place does not matter now.



<P>
If the hon. Gentleman does not believe what I say, 
perhaps he will have a private conversation with the 
Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning, the 
hon. Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn), who 
knows that the Welsh Development Agency has been 
trying to induce Yorkshire business men to go to Wales. 
When I had responsibility for the south-west, such matters 
were the cause of constant complaints. There is a problem. 
I understand the enthusiasm of the Welsh to attract 
business, but one of the things that regional development 
agencies will have to do is put an end to such practice. I 
recommend the hon. Gentleman to get to grips with the 
situation and not to deny what is happening.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I was not denying that there are complaints 
and that a certain view is held. In fact, I tried to explain 
it by referring to jealousy of apparent success. I refute, 
however, that it occurs in the manner that has sometimes 
been described.
<P>
The assembly would wish to ensure that it operates in 
a transparent and efficient way through its first secretary. 
While I respectfully suggest to Opposition Members that 
it is not sensible for the Assembly to be a best value 
authority, it will have to act in a similar spirit. It is at the 
heart of our devolution proposals that the Assembly will 
bring greater transparency and openness to government, 
crucially in the spending of taxpayers' money.
<P>
The Conservative party has never been slow to point 
out the importance of cost and value for money in the 
devolution settlement. If the Assembly disregarded the 
importance of such issues to the people of Wales, it would 
pay the price at the ballot box. In addition, the 
Government of Wales Act 1998 establishes the office of 
Auditor General for Wales as a new and powerful means 
of ensuring that the Assembly provides high quality and 
value-for-money services in Wales. It is also in the Act 
that there should be an audit committee to ensure that 
that occurs.
<P>
I hope and expect that the Welsh Assembly will operate 
as a model for others. Indeed, Parliament may wish to 
emulate some of its practices. As a Minister, I cannot 
possibly criticise the way in which Parliament operates its 
cost-effective procedures, but there is always room for 
improvement.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I hesitate to speak, with all the 
accents running round the place, but fortunately the All 
Blacks have not dealt any blows on Wales for some 
time that will probably happen in the rugby world cup. 
I notice that Wales is building up its forces by using the 
All Blacks to train its players, which is at least one thing 
with which we are in agreement.



<P>
I am fascinated about the way in which the Minister is 
giving us excuses and his reasons why the Welsh 
Assembly does not need to be included in the provision. 
He talks about value for money, transparency and so on. 
If I picked one authority from those listed in the Bill and 
suggested that it should not be a best value authority, I 
would be pooh-poohed and shot down. The hon. 
Gentleman had better work out which side of the fence 
he is on, because at the moment he is just straddling it. 
As an ex-farmer, I can inform him that that can be painful 
on occasions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> At least, I can agree with the hon. 
Gentleman that the £250,000 that the Welsh Rugby Union 
paid for the services of his countryman was, indeed, best 
value. However, we shall judge whether we have achieved 
best value by results, which is its objective.
<P>
It will be the duty of the Welsh Assembly to ensure 
that best value operates within the local authorities. 
Nobody can ensure that the best value operates within 
the Welsh Assembly unless we remove the principle of 
devolution and state that the Welsh Assembly is entirely 
responsible to the House of Commons for its actions. I 
know that that is what most Opposition Members believe, 
but the Leader of the Opposition has moved on and now 
says that he wants devolution to work.
<P>
The Assembly will also want to play a full part in 
implementing the provisions of the White Paper on public 
service agreements 1999-2002, which focuses on 
improved accountability based on the transparent 
reporting of performance. The Assembly will also want 
to assist the Government's objectives of greater efficiency 
and effectiveness and better government. Many of those 
objectives are contained in last year's publication by the 
Cabinet Office, entitled "Better quality services"	, which 
promotes principles of best value such as the reviewing 
of services and the setting of challenging targets.
<P>
Opposition Members should also note that, because the 
Welsh Assembly will have a committee structure in which 
members of all parties will participate, and because those 
committees will function differently from Select 
Committees, the Assembly will demonstrate a far greater 
degree of transparency and openness than either the House 
of Commons of local government.



<P>
The Government have been generous to the Liberal 
Democrats in introducing proportional representation, 
which is the only mechanism through which they are 
likely to achieve representation in the Welsh Assembly. 
We expect one or two Liberal Democrats to be elected. 
They will be able to scrutinise legislation and to see that 
best value will be delivered in a manner superior to the 
House of Commons or local government.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Perhaps it is because of the 
mixture of accents, but I am somewhat confused. The hon. 
Gentleman talks about clarity and so forth, and says that 
the authority will be accountable. It will be accountable 
to the electorate but, like other local authorities that the 
Bill will cover, it will be accountable ultimately to the 
Secretary of State.
<P>
I admit that I have not taken much interest in the Bill's 
application to Wales. Many years ago, a dim gentleman 
made the not very clever suggestion that I stand for a 
by-election in Wales, despite my accent and the fact that 
the All Blacks had recently torn apart the Welsh rugby 
union team.
<P>
As I understand it, the Secretary of State for Wales, 
like the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport 
and the Regions, will be ultimately responsible for 
achieving best value. Therefore, the Bill could and 
should be applied to Wales.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> The hon. Gentleman fails to realise that the 
Welsh Assembly will not be local government, but will 
be responsible for it. The amendments would allow the 
police to retain too much power, but they would not grant 
enough power to devolved structures such as the Welsh 
Assembly or regional bodies. Despite the Leader of the 
Opposition's efforts to change the Tory party's image, the 
amendments make it clear that new conservatism is as far 
away as every from accepting devolution.

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I reiterate that we are not against best

improved, and our concern is that the Bill will not do that.
<P>
I do not apologise for tabling probing amendments that 
seek to include the Welsh Assembly in best value. The 
Welsh Assembly is an extraordinary body. It is neither a 
local authority, nor a quango nor a parliament such as the 
Scottish Parliament. It is a crown body that is an extension 
of the Secretary of State's persona. The Under-Secretary 
says rather blithely that the Assembly should be beyond 
the scrutiny of the House of Commons, but it is the House 
of Commons that will fund it.
