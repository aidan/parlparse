Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): Welcome back to the Chair,
Mr. Benton, on the downhill slope to the end of our
consideration of the
Bill.</div><a name="09070761000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we adjourned, I was explaining that business supports the new clause. I
had mentioned the support of the Employers Forum on Disability and the
Federation of Small Businesses, and was about to come on to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column742" />Column number: 742</div>CBI&#146;s support. Subsection (2)(a), (b) and (c) meets the points
raised by the CBI in the Work and Pensions Committee evidence
session.</div><a name="09070761000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
make no apology for speaking on this matter because it is important.
That importance is illustrated by question 43 of the first
sitting of this Committee, in which my hon. Friend the Member for
Forest of Dean
asked:</div><a name="09070761000072"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Can
I ask whether you support such a restriction on pre-employment
questionnaires?&#148;</div><a name="09070761000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
response from Caroline Gooding of RADAR
was:</div><a name="09070761000073"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
think that, in relation to the employment of disabled people, that is
probably the single biggest difference and improvement that could be
made through the Equality
Bill.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Equality
Public Bill Committee, </i>2 June 2009; c. 23,
Q43.]</div><a name="09070761000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has been praise for the new clause from many sources, but that
quotation sums it
up.</div><a name="09070761000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend mentioned the Government response to the Select Committee
report. Paragraph 42
states:</div><a name="09070761000074"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government is not convinced of the need to outlaw pre-employment
disability-related
enquiries&#148;.</div><a name="09070761000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I may give the Minister some wriggle room, that answers the wrong
question. The Select Committee never proposed outlawing pre-employment
disability-related inquiries, but said specifically in its report that
that should be done on certain occasions and that questions about
health and disability should be raised only at certain
times.</div><a name="09070761000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the Minister has enough scope to reach a sympathetic
conclusion on this issue, which has acquired an enormous consensus,
including disability groups, the Select Committee and
business.</div><a name="09070761000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070761000104"></a><b class="B">Lynne
Featherstone</b> (Hornsey and Wood Green) (LD): Welcome back
for our last sitting, Mr.
Benton.</div><a name="09070761000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
rise simply to vocalise Liberal Democrat support for the new clause,
which was tabled by the hon. Member for Stroud. We think that the
removal of barriers to employment is important. The new clause seems to
be the simplest way forward. There are no legitimate arguments against
such a move. It is not dissimilar to the idea behind no-name
employment. It is about removing, in an informal sense, the first
barrier, which people find so hard to overcome. It can be removed so
easily and in a cost-free
way.</div><a name="09070761000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070761000105"></a>The
Solicitor-General (Vera Baird):</b> Welcome home,
Mr. Benton, for what will be a short stretch of further
incarceration.</div><a name="09070761000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clauses 20 and 21, which were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for
Stroud, would limit the circumstances in which employers can use
pre-employment inquiries to determine whether job applicants are
disabled or to ascertain the extent of their impairments. Employers
would be allowed to ask for such information only to identify the need
for reasonable adjustments, to facilitate the monitoring of disabled
applicants, to support positive action in recruitment or to determine
whether someone can perform a specific job-related function. He makes
no apology for raising this issue again and neither do Opposition
Members. I do not think that they should apologise. We discussed this
area on 18 June, when debating amendments 207 to 212, and the new
clause has come from that debate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column743" />Column number: 743</div><a name="09070761000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our precise
concern about the new clause is that it is about capturing information
for the purposes of identifying the need for reasonable adjustment. For
example, someone with a mental health condition may require more time
at interview to consider questions and put together their answers.
There is nothing to stop an unscrupulous employee using that
information to discriminate unlawfully. We want to be careful, since
one purpose of the Bill is to simplify and streamline protection, not
to do anything that would be contrary to that aim. If we restricted the
use of pre-employment inquiries to that set of closely defined
circumstances and put tight conditions around their use, that could be
an unwelcome area of complexity. There is obviously a balance to be
struck in respect of disability and equalities
rights.</div><a name="09070761000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have seen the brief from the National AIDS Trust, the Terrence Higgins
Trust and Rethink, the Work and Pensions Committee inquiry material
that has been mentioned already and the research by the Chartered
Institute of Personnel and Development, mentioned in the Work and
Pensions Committee report, which found that 60 per cent. of employers
said that they had disregarded applications&#151;and, by implication,
would do so&#151;from people with drug or alcohol problems, criminal
records or a history of mental health problems or incapacity. That is
clearly blatant, direct discrimination that must be
tackled.</div><a name="09070761000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is already a mechanism for challenging direct disability discrimination
in employment under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, and those
provisions are carried forward in the Bill, which provides for anyone
who considers that information about their disability has been used to
discriminate against them can challenge the employer through an
employment tribunal.</div>
<a name="09070761000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was
some discussion about the burden of proof. The briefing from the NAT,
Terrence Higgins Trust and Rethink acknowledges that current disability
law provides that protection and considers such cases hard to prove,
but it does not recognise the fact that legislation puts the burden of
proof on the employer. Typically, the questionnaire procedure would
probe why the job offer was not gone through with or was withdrawn. So
that would, one imagines, make available the first step to the
aggrieved party, which would show that there has been some
discrimination. Then the burden of proof turns immediately to the
employer to show that it has not discriminated. That is some element of
important protection for disabled
people.</div><a name="09070761000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070761000106"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): I think that the
Minister said at the beginning of her answer that some survey evidence
showed that 60 per cent. of employers had withdrawn job offers for a
number of reasons, including someone&#146;s having a mental health
incapacity. That implies that such discrimination is fairly
widespread&#151;although that may be a slight exaggeration&#151;and
is certainly not uncommon. Given what she said about employment
tribunals, will the Minister share with the Committee any information
about the number of successful and unsuccessful cases that are brought
against employers for such discrimination in the employment process? If
she is correct in what she is saying about the protection that is in
place and about such discrimination being widespread, we would expect a
significant number of cases at least to be brought to tribunal, if not
brought to a successful conclusion.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column744" />Column number: 744</div><a name="09070761000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070761000107"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> No, I cannot directly help with that,
but they are taken to tribunal; I am in no doubt about that. I cannot
say what numbers were behind the 60 per cent. of employers who
responded in that way to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and
Development research. So I am afraid that I cannot throw better light
on that matter at
present.</div><a name="09070761000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has been suggested in Committee that the use of pre-employment
inquiries is limited in other jurisdictions. The US is one jurisdiction
that is usually cited, and there pre-employment questionnaires are only
allowed if they relate to
the</div><a name="09070761000075"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;ability
of an applicant to perform job-related
functions.&#148;</div><a name="09070761000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The note from
NAT, Terrence Higgins Trust and Rethink contends that that ensures that
it is easier to recognise cases where employers have discriminated
against applicants, and it cites data from a 2002 research report that
16,000 discrimination claims are filed under the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 each year. We have looked at the US
experience, but we have not been able to find any evidence to show that
that specific element of protection is widely used, or that it has had
any positive effect on the recruitment of disabled
people.</div><a name="09070761000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have also
tried to make a comparison between the claims filed in the US and in
this country. About 19,500 disability discrimination claims were filed
with the US equal opportunities commission in 2007-08. In
Great Britain, just over 5,800 claims&#151;not necessarily
specifically about this provision&#151;were registered with the
Tribunals Service. That is about one third of the US total, in a
country with a population about one fifth the size. That does not
suggest that a greater proportion of people are finding it easier to
take enforcement action in the US than in this
country.</div><a name="09070761000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
need to look at the Rethink survey quoted in the documents. It
indicates that some 41 per cent. of mental health service users who
were surveyed said that they were put off applying for jobs for fear of
being discriminated against. An important duty that we all have is to
try to accelerate the rate at which disabled people who want to work
and who can work come into employment. Therefore, we must attend to
this
topic.</div><a name="09070761000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
position, as Opposition Members would see it, is that I responded
positively to the debate on 18 June, and on 23 June&#151;aha, a split
in the Government&#151;there was a less positive response from a
different Minister. One of the happy things about the new public Bill
procedure is that we take evidence, which is put into <i class="I">Hansard.</i>
It is readily available to assist in convincing people who are
concerned that there is not a strong push from the employees&#146;
side to ensure that the change is brought about, and that the business
sector will resist it. The <i class="I">Hansard</i> extracts that indicate a
keenness for it from the employees&#146; side and, at the very least,
a relaxed if not actively supportive approach from the
employers&#146; side have been useful since 23 June. We will
introduce a clause to deal with the problem on Report, if my hon.
Friend the Member for Stroud will withdraw his  new
clause.</div><a name="09070761000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070761000108"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Drew</b> (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op): With that delightful
news, and in the spirit of consensus that I hope the Committee will
finish with, I am delighted to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070761000109"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> May I take this opportunity, before we
put our final question, to thank you, Mr. Benton, for your
fair and helpful chairing, and may I through you offer our thanks to
Lady Winterton, who has been as fair, helpful and engaging as you have
been? I add our note of thanks to your fellow Chairmen, Mr.
Taylor and Mr. Bercow. There was an empty chair at some
strategic point in this Committee, which both of them in sequence were
able to fill, and we owe them a debt of gratitude for coming to our
rescue at that stage. You, Mr. Benton, and Lady Winterton
have ensured that the Bill has had a fair hearing in the evidence
sessions and has been subject to proper scrutiny subsequently. That is
no mean task, because it is large and
wide-ranging.</div><a name="09070761000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am most grateful to my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary,
Government Equalities Office, for his support in the Committee. I am
also grateful to all Committee members from all parties for their
contributions. I think that we have focused on the right issues and
ensured that the most important have had a good airing.</div>
<a name="09070761000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
discussed the Bill mostly in a constructive and positive way, while
recognising that there are, as one would expect, different views on
some of the many matters that it covers. These are important issues,
and I am pleased that they have been treated with the seriousness, and
given the attention, that they deserve. Occasionally, they have been
given attention again and again, but they have none the less been
treated in an appropriately serious way.</div>
<a name="09070761000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the hon. Members for
Forest of Dean and for Hornsey and Wood Green for their contributions
and for leading on behalf of their parties. May I also seek your
indulgence, Mr. Benton, to make particular fond reference to
the hon. Member for Daventry, who has told us that he is retiring from
Parliament at the next general election? Over the years, he has made a
magnificent contribution to the cause of equality and particularly to
the cause of the disabled. He has made an excellent and characteristic
contribution in this Committee, and his comments have been very well
informed and sensitive. We shall miss him, his intellectual rigour, his
robust common sense and, overwhelmingly, his compassion.</div>
<a name="09070761000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
to the Clerks, who have supported us all in the Committee. I am
grateful to the attendants, the police and to the <i class="I">Hansard</i>
writers, who do not always have a straightforward job. I also thank the
officials from the Government Equalities Office and from other
Departments that were involved in the Bill. They
could  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column746" />Column number: 746</div>not have been more helpful to me, staff on the Committee, the <i class="I">Hansard
</i>writers and, from time to time, other members of the
Committee.</div><a name="09070761000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am pleased that we have been able to take forward our debate in a
rational and positive way. The Bill has been improved by scrutiny and
by a number of amendments, although they were all the
Government&#146;s. However, I have agreed to consider five matters:
whether to include various fire and rescue bodies in the socio-economic
duty, as proposed by the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green; the
clarification, if necessary, of the asymmetric nature of disability
protection in clause 13(3); the issue around the case of Malcolm and
whether we need to make the protection in clause 14 clearer; the case
for representative actions; and, very recently, whether to limit the
use of pre-employment disability questionnaires. That is a little
survey of the work that I still have to do before we gather again on
Report. I will seriously consider all those proposals.</div>
<a name="09070761000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
good Bill, which will advance the cause of equality, and I hope that it
will help to drive culture change. It still has to go through one or
two stages, but I could not resist looking back at a series of cartoons
about equality that I have in my office. We have been advancing the
cause of gender equality to a large extent, and one really nice cartoon
shows a lady, whose hands are in the kitchen sink and covered with
Fairy Liquid-type bubbles, saying to her little girl, &#147;I have to
keep my hands soft in case I ever get back to being a brain
surgeon.&#148; The second cartoon that caught my eye depicted a
figure lamenting, &#147;Seasonal work, long hours, low pay, no health
and safety, no danger money, but they did say I could keep the
dress&#148;&#151;it is the fairy on top of the Christmas tree. I am
grateful to all participants and I look forward to our proceedings on
Report.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070761000110"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Without repeating everything that the Minister has
said, I would like to echo her thanks to you, Mr. Benton,
and, through you, thank Lady Winterton, Mr. Taylor and
Mr. Bercow&#151;if we are still allowed to call him that
now that he has been elevated to the Chair.</div>
<a name="09070761000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
Clerks and the witnesses, whom I do not think the Minister mentioned.
As she said, the evidence that they gave in our evidence-taking
sessions was very helpful in some of our later deliberations. I would
also like to thank those who have served us in the Committee room,
including the Doorkeepers and the police officers.</div>
<a name="09070761000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank
members of the public who have listened to our
proceedings&#151;sometimes with great interest and sometimes, I am
sure, with less interest. I also thank all members of the Committee for
our debates, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for
Weston-super-Mare, who sadly is not here to listen to my thanking him
for his work in supporting me on the Front
Bench.</div><a name="09070761000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
echo the Minister&#146;s comments about my hon. Friend the Member for
Daventry, who, on this particular subject, brings a huge amount of
wisdom and experience both in office and outside it. If he is not
dragooned into being a member of another Committee, this may well have
been his last Public Bill Committee before he leaves the House. That
will be sad. He has conducted himself to the credit of the Committee
and has brought a great deal of wisdom to our proceedings on a number
of matters, for which I am grateful&#151;as is the hon. and learned
Lady.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column747" />Column number: 747</div><a name="09070761000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also thank
my hon. Friend the Member for Henley, who for most sittings has been
splitting himself between our proceedings and those on the Finance
Bill, and has acquitted himself well. Last, but not least, I thank our
Whip, my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay. We must never forget
the Whips or they will certainly never forget
us.</div><a name="09070761000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the Minister for the way in which we have had a good-natured and
fruitful debate on most occasions, apart from when I usually spoilt
them by referring to Baroness Thatcher, which seemed to rile the hon.
and learned Lady. Apart from that, she has dealt with the Committee in
an even-handed and thoughtful way, and I echo her thanks to her
officials who, on occasions, have been very helpful to the
Opposition.</div><a name="09070761000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also thank the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green, who speaks for
the Liberal Democrats on such matters. Finally, I thank the hon. Member
for Glasgow, East, who speaks for the Scottish National party, although
on many occasions, as he made clear, not on religious matters, when he
spoke for himself. I thank you again, Mr. Benton. We are
almost
there.</div><a name="09070761000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070761000111"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I wish to say what a pleasure it has been to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton, and through you I
convey my thanks to Lady Winterton. I thank the Clerk and the officials
who have helped to make our proceedings so pleasant and smooth running.
The hon. Member for Daventry has added wisdom, and I often found that
we were speaking in a similar manner on similar issues. That may or may
not please him&#151;I have no idea&#151;but he brought a great deal
of experience to the
Committee.</div><a name="09070761000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank my excellent colleague, the hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon, who has scrutinised in great detail, with great wisdom and
commitment, parts of the Bill, which after all is the job of the
Opposition. Despite the occasional strange look on the faces of members
of the Committee, he has done a remarkable job. The Solicitor-General
has omitted one thing. We have had a very good debate and I am very
pleased with the matters that she will take away to look at, and
perhaps bring
back.</div><a name="09070761000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should be very interested in, and look forward to hearing about, the
results of the work of the Department for Work and Pensions on
discrimination in the workplace. I also thank the hon. and learned Lady
for her tolerance and patience on some occasions and for conducting the
Committee. I have not taken part in many proceedings in Committee, as
is probably apparent, but it is quite a task for a person to be on her
feet throughout proceedings in Committee on demand and I pay tribute to
her for
that.</div><a name="09070761000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
pay tribute to the hon. Member for Forest of Dean, who picked arguments
extremely well, and also to the hon. Member for Glasgow, East, who
speaks for the Scottish National party for some of the time.</div>
<a name="09070761000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we are on
jokes, some members of the Committee might not be aware that, in a
previous life, I was a designer and an illustrator. When I joined the
Liberal Democrats, I did some cartoons about equality and fairness, one
of which showed a high chair with Paddy Ashdown next to it and a
woman&#151;it could have been me&#151;saying, &#147;But, Paddy,
this is not what I meant by a safe seat.&#148; A second cartoon was
about a little child tugging his mother&#146;s skirt saying,
&#147;Mummy, mummy, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column748" />Column number: 748</div>why is daddy never here?&#148; to which the mother replied,
&#147;There, there, darling. He is out campaigning every night for
fairness and equality.&#148; I thank the
Committee.</div><a name="09070761000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070761000112"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): I would not have risen to my
feet, but saying a word on behalf of the Back Benchers collectively
might be appropriate, Mr. Benton, not least because for
various reasons I probably have had more to say than most of
them&#151;not for the first time&#151;and for that I apologise to
the
Committee.</div><a name="09070761000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to record that everything that has been said from the Front
Benches has been entirely appropriate, accurate and fair, which is not
always the case, but was on this occasion. I include all the
participants, from the Solicitor-General, through my hon. Friend the
Member for Forest of Dean and the rest of our Front-Bench team, to the
Liberal Democrats and those who have served in silence, but with
interest and courtesy, as well as all the rest. It has been very
welcome.</div><a name="09070761000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to respond to the exceptionally generous remarks of the
Solicitor-General and of the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green. In
the light of those remarks, I am inclined to think that it is possibly
just as well that I am retiring, because I am not sure that they would
have advanced my parliamentary career. In a sense that does not
matter.</div>
<a name="09070761000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I advert,
although I do so reluctantly, to my comment on the conduct of the Bill
on &#147;The Westminster Hour&#148; on Sunday night&#151;those
who have not heard it can still hear it on iPlayer. I made the point,
without being invidious, about the distinction between those Bills in
which there is a common spirit and a Minister who is prepared to lead
things into improvement, and those that are about doing the press
release, drafting the Bill and so on. The Bill has been one of the
former. It is very much better for Parliament if it can do that. I
still think in a funny and rather old-fashioned way that legislation
matters, that it is better to get it right than half right and that it
is better to talk about it than to leave it
unconsidered.</div><a name="09070761000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have enjoyed the Committee. To finish, my hon. Friend the Member for
Forest of Dean referred to archers this morning and, having a Welsh
wife, I have a certain interest in that profession as well. I recall
that, after a much more contentious Committee on the National Minimum
Wage Bill, I concluded my remarks when I was in his post by referring
to Henry V before Agincourt and
saying:</div><a name="09070761000077"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
would not have missed it for the world.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report, Standing Committee D, </i>17 February 1998; c.
1037.]</div><a name="09070761000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070761000113"></a><b class="B">John
Mason</b> (Glasgow, East) (SNP): I thank you, Mr.
Benton, and through you Lady Winterton, for looking after us over the
past 20 Committee sittings. You have managed to keep us from straying
too far, as when we seemed to get bogged down in discussing Scotland in
one of the
debates.</div><a name="09070761000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee is only my second Public Bill Committee as I come towards the
end of my first year as a Member. I was extremely impressed by the
Solicitor-General, who handled everything herself; on my previous Bill
Committee, with the hon. Member for Forest of Dean as well, there were
I think four Ministers, who all took turns. I assumed that that was the
norm, so I was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column749" />Column number: 749</div>impressed with the Solicitor-General&#151;with her colleagues, too,
with some of whom we had robust debate, but we managed to avoid being
too
personal.</div><a name="09070761000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also thank the hon. Member for Forest of Dean and his colleagues for
their helpfulness. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon and I,
in particular, seemed to have a few intellectual jousts or whatever the
word is. However, we managed to keep a reasonable tone throughout the
debate, and discussing some of those issues, including religion and so
on, is
good.</div><a name="09070761000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill is extremely good, the vast majority of it my party and I are
supportive of, and we look forward to it reaching the following
stages.</div><a name="09070761000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070761000114"></a>The
Chairman:</b> First, I thank the Minister, the Opposition
spokesmen and all Committee members for the courtesy extended at all
times to the Chair. All the nice remarks will be passed on to Lady
Winterton, Mr. Speaker and David Taylor. Thank you all very
much for
that.</div><a name="09070761000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also thank the learned Clerks and all people who have contributed to
the smooth running of the Committee, which has been interesting. I have
enjoyed it&#151;very informative.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column750" />Column number: 750</div><a name="09070761000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to conclude with my own appreciation of the hon. Member for Daventry.
As he was speaking and as the Solicitor-General was making her
comments, my mind went back many years ago to my arrival in the House.
I soon became a member of the education team and had the good fortune
to work on a further education Bill, on which the hon. Gentleman was
further education spokesman. I was immediately impressed by his wisdom
and by his contributions to that Committee. That has not changed much
over 18 years. His contribution, which he still makes and which has
been indicated clearly during consideration of the Bill, has been deep,
thought-provoking and positive. I add my compliments to you, sir, and
wish you all the best for the future. You will be a loss, although we
shall still remain politically divided. Thank you
all.</div><a name="09070761000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
