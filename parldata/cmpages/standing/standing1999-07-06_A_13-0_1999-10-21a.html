<H4><center>UCITS QUALIFIERS</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 195, in page 14, line 29, leave out `UCITS' and insert `Part XVI'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government amendment No. 196.
<P>
Amendment No. 212, in page 14, line 30, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) The Authority may cancel the permission of a UCITS qualifier under Schedule 5 (unless it is a permission resulting from the UCITS directive or any similar EU directive) as if it was a Part IV permission and a UCITS qualifier ceases to qualify for authorisation under Schedule 5 if the Authority does so cancel it.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 197 to 199 and 206 to 208.
<P>
Amendment No. 162, in schedule 5, page 204, line 17, leave out `within the meaning of' and insert 'subject to'.
<P>
Amendment No. 213, in schedule 5, page 204, line 18, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(aa) the relevant person has no EEA right to carry on the relevant activity or is not able to use the EEA right it has to carry on that activity; and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 214, in schedule 5, page 204, line 19, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(including a provision requiring notification to the Authority)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 236 to 238, 209, 239, 240, 211 and 217, and 200 to 202.
<P>
Before we start, I should make it plain that a number of these amendments relate to schedule 5, not clause 33. For the convenience of debate, we are taking them under clause 33, but they will, of course, be voted on formally when we reach schedule 5.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We have a quite formidable group of amendments to deal with. It will help everyone if I separate them into slightly smaller groups. First, however, I shall try to explain what we hope to achieve with schedule 5. I should warn the Committee that what follows is necessarily rather technical—especially so for 9 am on a Thursday.
<P>
Schedule 5 provides for the automatic authorisation of certain persons concerned in collective investment schemes in two particular cases. The first is persons connected to incoming passporting collective investment schemes under the UCITS directive. When those schemes meet the conditions set out in clause 235 in part XVI—that the scheme operators have notified the Financial Services Authority at least two months in advance they intend to promote the scheme in the UK, and that they have provided the FSA with a certificate from the home state regulator to confirm that the schemes comply with the UCITS directive requirements—they are therefore allowed to exercise their passporting rights under that directive; and schedule 5 gives automatic authorisation to their operators, trustees or depositories.
<P>
The provision is necessary because the passport rights under the UCITS directive attach to the scheme itself and, for those rights to be effectively enjoyed, we must ensure that the operators of such schemes can act in relation to the scheme without breaching the general prohibition.
<P>
The second case is of operators of authorised British open-ended investment companies—OEICs—which are affectionately called ``oiks''. The reason for that, too, is technical: an OEIC is its own operator. The OEIC is authorised as a product under part XVI; but, because, as operator, it will be carrying out regulated activities, it needs authorisation also as a person, or it will be in breach of the general prohibition.
<P>
Schedule 5 provides for the operator to get automatic authorisation, thereby avoiding the need for the same corporate body to have to go through two authorisation processes. The authorisation of the OEIC as a product will involve an assessment of the fitness and properness of the operator to act in that capacity because we believe that it would be unnecessarily burdensome for them to have to go through the separate processes of applying for permission and authorised-person status under parts III and IV of the Bill. Schedule 5 does not at present make that dual effect clear. The purpose of the Government's amendments is to rectify that, and to clarify exactly who gets automatic authorisation under schedule 5 and which activities they have permission to carry out.
<P>
As I have said, the schedule concerns two distinct groups. I shall deal first with the persons connected with EEA passporters under the UCITS directive.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 206, 207 and 208 simplify the schedule. They make clear the direct connection between the authorisation of persons connected with, an incoming UCITS scheme and the recognition of such schemes under clause 235. They remove the direct reference to the UCITS directive, which is a necessary change, because that name will become obsolete.
<P>
Clause 235 details the requirements that an incoming collective investment scheme must meet in order to exercise its passport rights under the directive. Schemes that meet those requirements will be `recognised'.
<P>
Paragraph 2 of schedule 5 unnecessarily duplicates the conditions that a scheme must meet. The amendments remove that duplication and provide simply that, once a scheme has been recognised under clause 235, its operator, trustee or depositary will be automatically authorised.
<P>
The amendments also relate to a second category of persons—operators of OEICs. Amendment No. 236 provides that the operator of an authorised OEIC will be authorised. As I explained, the change is necessary to avoid an OEIC being subjected to two separate authorisation processes—one for authorisation as a product and one for authorisation to act as operator.
<P>
Amendment No. 209 details the regulated activities for which operators of OEICs will have permission to carry out as a result of their automatic authorisation.
<P>
Amendment No. 237 effects the third substantive change—the introduction of a new label, ``Part XVI qualifiers'', to describe persons authorised under schedule 5. Amendment No. 199 deletes the current label, ``UCITS qualifiers'', which will be replaced by ``Part XVI qualifiers''.
<P>
The amendments make it clear that schedule 5 relates to other products as well as EEA passporting collective investment schemes. The term ``UCITS qualifiers'' is therefore misleading, and is not sufficiently broad to cover all the categories of people who can automatically be authorised under schedule 5.
<P>
The new label refers to ``Part XVI'' rather than ``schedule 5'' because part XVI provides for the requirements that schemes must meet in order to be authorised as products, in the case of OEICs, or to be allowed to exercise their passport rights, in the case of EEA collective investment schemes. Automatic authorisations under schedule 5 will follow.
<P>
The rest of the Government amendments—with the exception of Nos. 240 and 211, which align the wording of paragraph 2(3) with that of paragraph 2(2) and clause 48—are consequential to the label change. They remove all references to ``UCITS qualifier'' in and schedule 5 and clauses 33, 45 and 352.
<P>
References to ``UCITS qualifier'', will be replaced either with the term ``Part XVI qualifier'', when the intention is to refer to both categories of persons authorised under schedule 5, or, when the intention is to refer only to persons connected to passporting UCITS collective investment schemes, with a reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``person qualifying for authorisation under paragraph 1(1)''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to schedule 5. I realise that that is not a catchy phrase, but, as I explained, the amendments remove the reference to the UCITS directive, because that name is likely to become obsolete, and replace them with ``Part XVI qualifier''.
<P>
I hope that I have made the purpose of the amendments clear, and that, in light of the amendments, Opposition Members will not press amendments Nos. 162, 213 and 214, which relate to provisions to which we are proposing substantial changes. Otherwise, our proceedings will become horribly disorganised.
<P>
I should like to say a few words about amendments Nos. 212 and 217, in the hope that Opposition Members will not press them, either. Amendment No. 212 is designed to give the FSA the power to withdraw permission given to operators, trustees or depositaries of incoming passporting UCITS schemes under schedule 5, thereby cancelling their automatic authorisation. However, directive does not enable such a withdrawal.
<P>
As I explained, a scheme that meets the requirements for recognition under the UCITS directive may exercise its passporting rights in the UK. Although the FSA has some discretion to prevent such a scheme from doing so, its discretion may be exercised only when a scheme's marketing arrangements do not meet the FSA's prescribed marketing standards.
<P>
If the FSA is unhappy with an incoming UCITS scheme, it must appeal to the scheme's home state authority. The home state authority will have the power to prevent the scheme from marketing aboard—that is why the FSA has an express power to stop UK UCITS schemes from exercising their passporting rights to market abroad.
<P>
Amendment No. 217 is unnecessary. It seeks to treat the permission that the operator of an authorised OEIC gets under schedule 5 in the same way as a permission under part IV. We assume that the purpose of that is to ensure that the powers in part IV, for example the FSA's power to vary a person's permission on its own initiative, can be applied to operators of authorised OEICs. As I have explained, the operator of an OEIC and the OEIC are one and the same. The power to vary the permission of an operator is therefore the same as being able to vary the terms on which the scheme itself operates. These powers will be provided for in relation to OEICs under the regulations to be made under clause 233. Members of the Committee will see that part XVI already provides the FSA with various powers in relation to unit trust schemes—for example, powers to revoke authorisation and to intervene. I assure the Committee that the regulations relating to OEICs under clause 233 will provide for a similar set of powers. I hope that hon. Members will withdraw their amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Simpson </B>(Mid-Norfolk): What do the Liberals have to say about it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I welcome you to the chair, Mr. Gale. I apologise for having jumped the gun in taking my jacket off. I have a filthy, flu-ey cold, so my voice will be bad; I also apologise for that. People should keep well back.
<P>
I should declare an interest. Everyone knows that I am the director of an investment management company. I know what OIECs and UCITS. are. I am not yet the manager of an OIEC—
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Simpson:</B> The hon. Gentleman will be a Whip one day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> If I am lucky.
<P>
As we have heard, the amendments deal with extraordinarily technical territory. The Government amendments and our amendments deal with different themes. The Minister has argued that the second group of amendments is unnecessary; I am not sure that that is correct. Our amendments focus on the difference between EU-passported UCITS, which the FSA has no choice but to accept, and domestic UCITS—which will in most circumstances be an OIEC, but could be a unit trust, which the FSA should have powers not to approve automatically. In that complicated area, there is slight confusion about where the two types overlap; insufficient distinctions have been drawn between two basically different circumstances. We may not resolve that question fully today, but it is at the heart of most of our amendments. Even if it remains  unresolved, I ask the Government and their legal advisers to go through that crucial point again.
<P>
The Minister said that she thought that amendment No. 212 sought to give powers to the FSA in regard to passported UCITS. It specifically does not do that. It states that the permission of a UCITS qualifier may be cancelled
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``unless it is a permission resulting from the UCITS directive for any similar EU directive''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment makes the point that schedule 5 gives automatic authorisation to a UCITS operator, but does not seem to allow the FSA to cancel the authorisation in any circumstances. Clause 33(3) defines a ``UCITS qualifier'' as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a person qualifying for authorisation under Schedule 5'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
even if that person does not qualify under the UCITS directive. Although other conditions, which have not all been specified, need to be satisfied, the main condition for authorisation seems to be that the collective scheme is constituted as an open-ended investment company or as an undertaking for collective investment of transferable securities under the UCITS directive. It is unclear whether the latter structure needs to be subject to the UCITS directive which is much more limiting.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the UCITS qualifier does something which the FSA does not like, the FSA should have the power to cancel his permission if it is not a passported UCITS. If that is his only permission, we ought to incorporate the protective procedures to which the FSA is subject in the case of the cancellation of a passport permission. In any event, the FSA should probably not be allowed to terminate the permission if it results from the UCITS directive—the key point that the Minister made—because the host member state where the UCITS is marketed is not allowed to impose authorisation requirements.
<P>
Amendment No. 162 is designed to restrict the schedule 5 automatic authorisation for UCITS investment funds to funds that are subject to the UCITS directive. It would impose two restrictions. First, the investment fund should be open ended and secondly, it must have been approved or authorised in its member state for marketing to the public. In other words, it must be equivalent to an authorised unit trust or a UK OEIC. In the case of a unit trust or other UCITS which is not an open-ended investment company, the UCITS is covered by the directive that applies, where the management company has its head office which must be in the same country as the registered office.
<P>
The point that we are trying to make with amendment No. 213 is that if the manager of a UCITS is authorised under the investment services directive or the UCITS directive mark 2, it will receive automatic authorisation under schedule 3 rather than under schedule 5. Amendment. No. 213 is designed to avoid the overlap.
<P>
The point we are making with amendment No. 214 is that although the UCITS directive requires notification of marketing procedures to the FSA, we should ensure that everyone who wants to use a schedule by permission informs the FSA, even if they are not subject to the UCITS directive.
<P>
We need to define a UCITS permission in the manner set out in amendment No. 217 because someone who is authorised under the UCITS directive or a similar directive would obtain automatic permission under schedule 5. The definition is used because there needs to be an exemption from being a schedule 5 permission to be a Part IV permission.
<P>
In summary, we are in pretty obscure technical territory. I am satisfied that the Government amendments meet some or most of our points by a different route, but I am not satisfied that they necessarily meet the fundamental distinction that I made at the beginning of my remarks. Is the Minister comfortable that that central point concerning the different powers that the FSA should have in relation to a UCITS, depending on whether it is passported or domestic, is adequately covered by the Government amendments?
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I shall take amendment No. 212 first. Automatic authorisation for operators of UCITS schemes under schedule 5 applies to schemes constituted in other EEA states not UK UCITS. I hope that addresses the point that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) has just made. The powers to control UK OEICs will be conferred under regulations in clause 233.
<P>
I am sorry, which amendment does this brief refer to?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am afraid that the Minister cannot take verbal briefing from civil servants.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I stand corrected, Mr. Gale. I shall make a further point in relation to amendment No. 212. If a scheme no longer meets the requirements for recognition under the UCITS directive and cannot exercise passporting rights, the commission for its operator under schedule 5 lapses.
<P>
Having realised that we must replace references to a UCITS directive, we have made several technical changes as well as alterations. We shall bear in mind the hon. Gentleman's wish that we should keep an eye on matters that may require further examination. However, I cannot provide any assurances about that and I urge Labour Members to reject the Opposition amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are happy not to press the amendments. In the short term, the Financial Services Authority will have to live with the position if we get it wrong.
<P>
Consultation between the Treasury lawyers and those advising Conservative Members would be useful in sorting out such territory in a professional manner, as we are not going to resolve legal niceties in Committee. I am therefore happy not to press the amendment on the understanding that the issues will receive further legal investigation and that any provisions that are not right in the Bill as currently drafted will be dealt with later. 
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I can give the hon. Gentleman that assurance.

Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Fifth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): I welcome the Minister and congratulate her on her appointment.
<P>
Before we add schedule 5 to the Bill, I should like a little clarification as to the kind of dealers and traders who will come into this country from other parts of the EEA to offer products. How will they compare with the dealers and traders who already offer similar or different products in this country? I hope that this is not too fast to fall, but I freely confess that I find it difficult to understand exactly who we are talking about in relation to the UCITS directive and who will be OEICs. If the Minister could put a little flesh on this morning's rather technical discussion, that would be welcome.

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I thank the right hon. and learned Gentleman for his good wishes. Probably the most helpful thing that I can say is that it would be better for me to return to the question later because I detect a certain lack of certainty as to the answer. I cannot give him any detail now, so perhaps I could write to him.
<P>
I have a couple of brief points. The schedule is extremely technical but very necessary. It provides for the effective exercise of passport rights under the UCITS directive and eliminates an unnecessary additional layer of bureaucracy for UK-incorporated OEICs.
<P>
The authorisation of collective investment schemes in the Bill is separate from the mainstream authorisation powers because the UCITS directive and domestic regulation of collective investment schemes that can be promoted to the public have tended to focus on the product as much as on those who operate it. That means that the product has to be vetted and authorised before it can be generally sold. It means that requirements are applied to it so long as it continues to be authorised, for example, in relation to the constitution and management of the scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister. Perhaps I could lend a little assistance. At present, the Luxembourg and Dublin funds constitute most non-UK UCITs. They are operated by the subsidiaries of UK fund management groups in Luxembourg and Dublin. They use the laws and legal structures in Ireland and Luxembourg because they have certain advantages over those in the UK for certain markets.
<P>
One or two US investment management businesses are setting up subsidiaries in Dublin and Luxembourg and offering their products in the EU. In most cases, however, the subsidiary companies in Dublin and Luxembourg are subsidiaries of the US company in the UK. Therefore, the overwhelming majority of passported UCITS relate back to subsidiaries of UK businesses.
<P>
In the fullness of time, one would expect some wholly French, German or Luxembourgois companies to market their Luxembourg or Dublin products in the UK. However, such companies are often structured for their own markets, which have slightly different requirements from the market here and may, therefore, be unsuitable. All their documentation will be in French or German, rather than in English. The number of genuinely German, French or Italian EU UCIT products marketed here is tiny.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 5, as amended, agreed to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we move on to clause 34, I apologise to hon. Members for the fact that a howling, cold draught is blowing through the Room. It is due to modern technology, which is being attended to. No doubt it will be put right by the end of the evening. I am also sorry that we are in a pall of gloom. I have endeavoured to have the blinds lifted. That, too, appears to require major surgery. Again, however, we are trying.
<H4><center>Clause 34</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exemption order</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 215, in page 15, line 9, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) No exemption order to which subsection (7) applies may be made unless a draft of the order has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House.
<P>
(6) An exemption order to which subsection (7) does not apply shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.
<P>
(7) This subsection applies to an exemption order which—
<P>
(a) is the first order to be made under this section in respect of a particular person; or
<P>
(b) varies an order previously made so as to vary or remove an exemption.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 215 is essentially a probing amendment.
<P>
As the Committee will be aware, clause 34 deals with exemption orders giving the Treasury the power to make orders, exempting specific matters, people or classes of person from the general prohibition under part II and, therefore, from the need to be authorised. Will all the exemptions under the Financial Services Act 1986 continue under the new regime?
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for tabling the amendment, which deals with the procedure that should apply to exemption orders under clause 34. Such matters are dealt with in clause 363, where we have provided for the negative resolution procedure to apply to orders made under clause 34. When an exemption order under that clause is to be made, the Bill requires that, after it is laid, the order will be subject to annulment by resolution of either House of Parliament.
<P>
Under the amendment, it is proposed that when making the first order under clause 34, or when varying or removing an exemption under that order, the affirmative resolution procedure should apply instead. In other words, it is proposed that both Houses of Parliament must approve the order in those circumstances. I agree with much of that. I agree that the affirmative resolution procedure should apply when making the first order under clause 34, and that the affirmative resolution procedure should also apply when removing or restricting an exemption.
<P>
I should like to consider that issue with the draftsmen, with a view to tabling appropriate amendments in due course. We are consulting on which exemptions under the Financial Services Act should be retained. Most will be retained, but some will become obsolete. We shall consider any new exemption on its merit. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): Will obsolescence be the only criterion for not transferring an exemption under the Financial Services Act to the Bill?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We are consulting on what the exemptions should be. Not only the Financial Services Act, but the Banking Act 1987 is relevant. I have made it clear that we accept the substance of the amendment, but the draftsmen need to look at some of the details. We should like the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment so that those matters can be reconsidered, bearing in mind the assurances that I have given to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am sorry to return to probe the same point. Will all the exemptions from the Financial Services Act be transferred to the Bill, except those that are obsolete? Given what the Economic Secretary has said, I am concerned that exemptions deemed worthy of removal for reasons other than obsolescence might not be transferred. I want the Economic Secretary to give an assurance that obsolescence will be the only criterion for not including an existing exemption in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am waiting for further inspiration.
<P>
We are carrying out a full review and consulting on such matters. The presumption is that all the exemptions will be retained unless there is a good reason not to do so. That might not be a very helpful answer to the hon. Gentleman's question, but it at least makes it clear that obsolescence might not be the only criterion.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I shall briefly take up that point because it is one of real substance, not merely a technicality. Those operating in the markets who have exemptions will no doubt be attempting to follow in the financial press what is going on here.
<P>
This morning's proceedings have demonstrated to every member of the Committee, some of whom—although not me—have been considering the matter for about a year, how hugely technical the matter is and how extremely difficult it is to follow exactly what is happening. If exemptions are not carried through automatically, traders who now have an exemption may find that they no longer have one. The effect of that will be that business that they are carrying out—no doubt, in entirely good faith—will suddenly become a criminal offence and unenforceable at law.
<P>
We have been pointing out in a wider sense that there are sharks on both sides of the issue. There are also people who make bona fide investment decisions, but who find out that they have gone wrong—their investments did not make the profit for which they had hoped or even maintain their value, but lost them a lot of money. Those people will be looking for lawyers to help them to find ways to limit their losses. Other bona fide traders with whom they have done business, if they no longer have the exemption that they had expected to have, may suddenly find that they are unable to enforce their bargain. It is somewhat unlikely that they would be immediately prosecuted by the FSA, because I hope and expect that it would exercise sensible discretion in what is a highly technical area. However, they would be vulnerable to losing large amounts of money, so an important issue arises in this technical area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am sorry to return to the matter, but I entirely agree with my right hon. and learned Friend. Such problems often crop up when we transfer existing legislation into a new, omnibus Bill. Every time that there is uncertainty about the transfer because of the way in which the Bill is written, we potentially incur a cost, at best, in terms of groups of lawyers and compliance officers in the City and, at worst, in terms of lost business. We may even criminalise someone by accident. That is a matter of considerable concern.
<P>
I was perturbed by the Economic Secretary's reply to my earlier question, because she confirmed that obsolescence would not be the only criterion that may lead to the non-transfer of an exemption. I think that she said that that may happen where another good reason leads to an exemption not being transferred under the Bill. If there are to be other reasons and criteria, they must be set out by the Treasury at the earliest possible date. We must let those who will be affected by the Bill know immediately if such exemptions are not to be transferred.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> First, it is important that I reiterate the point that I made in response to the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie). I said that the presumption is that exemptions will be retained unless there is good reason not to do so. I want to ensure that that is on the record.
<P>
In February, we published a draft exemption order, which is obviously in the public domain; that draft order makes clear what exemptions are envisaged. There is a danger that this debate will reopen our discussion on clause 24 and unenforceability—clearly, we cannot return to that. In general, where there are difficulties, it is important that we receive responses to consultation and respond to them in turn, and that such matters are dealt with by the draftsmen.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful, but I think that the Minister said that there is a danger of our reopening discussion of clause 24. Will she reflect on the fact that there is much more danger if we do not take seriously the objections to clause 24 and its widespread unenforceability? The matter is being treated as something that has worked for some years and can therefore be carried through. As I made clear a moment ago, some of us have great anxiety about the blanket use of unenforceability.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I assure the Committee that we shall not reopen the debate on clause 24. If it has to be discussed again, it will be done on Report.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> In the light of your advice, Mr. Gale, I have nothing else to add.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are pleased that the Government have taken the main, self-evident points in our amendments. It is fair to say that the crucial issue is what the exemptions will be. On the basis of the Minister's comments and given that there has been no change in Government policy in relation to the content of the exemption order, it would be appropriate to withdraw the amendment. However, the Government should take particular note of the points made by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell) and my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester about the need, as the new legislation comes into force to avoid a situation where businesses carrying on activities that were exempt are unclear about the new circumstances, or people find themselves committing a criminal act because part of the law was obscure. Part of the central process of the new legislation will be to make exemptions absolutely clear. The industry is bound to assume that things will continue to be as they were unless parts of the Bill render them obsolete. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 34 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 35</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exemption of appointed representatives</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(WelIs): l beg to move amendment No. 216, in page 15, line 23, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) Business prescribed for the purposes of subsection (I)(a)(i) shall include—
<P>
(a) procuring or endeavouring to procure the persons with whom he deals to enter into agreements with his principal or (if not prohibited by his contract) with other persons;
<P>
(b) giving advice to the persons with whom he deals about entering into agreements with his principal or (if not prohibited by his contract) with other persons; or
<P>
(c) giving advice as to the sale of investments issued by his principal or as to the exercise of rights conferred by an investment whether or not issued as aforesaid.
<P>
(2B) In subsection (2A) ``agreement'' shall bear the meaning given by section 24(3).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause makes provision for appointed  representatives and permits them to carry on business on behalf of authorised persons. To do that, they must comply with certain conditions: they must have a contract with the authorised person, and accept responsibility for their actions. All that is familiar, as it carries forward provisions in the Financial Services Act 1986.
<P>
Our amendment would ensure that the same classes of business are permitted to the appointed representatives. I believe that that is what the clause is intended to achieve, although the notes on clauses state that it is impossible to replicate exactly the previous arrangement, because it might conflict with certain prohibitions in clause 18. I am not sure that possible conflict with earlier provisions is a good reason: if that were possible, it might be that the earlier provisions were defective in failing to anticipate later problems. There should be a presumption that if an arrangement works reasonably well in the market and is understood by traders and their representatives, it should be carried forward as it stands. After all, we do not change laws simply for the sake of it.
<P>
I ask the Government to accept the amendment as a way of clarifying the classes of business that can be carried on in this way rather than rely on our old friend, secondary legislation.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The explanatory notes refer to the Treasury's intention to bring forward regulations in due course, but we have heard that many times before, and it is no substitute for the certainty and transparency of primary legislation. The Act will be studied and familiar to people. Regulations, even if consulted on, tend to stack up without being referred to—unless a great consolidation is undertaken. The Minister should therefore agree that it is desirable to roll forward existing provisions and I ask her to do so.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Briefly, to back up what my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) has said, the amendment sets out existing classes of business that are exempted in the case of an appointed representative. The list is included to ensure that the new regime is at least as wide as the current regime and to install established practice into primary legislation. It harks back to the principle of not leaving out people who are currently in—a straightforward principle likely to be acceptable to the FSA, so it makes sense to build it into the Bill and make it easier for the ordinary reader to understand. In that spirit, I support my right hon. Friend's amendment.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Wells for tabling the amendment and raising these points, as it provides me with an opportunity to explain the Government's proposals for the regime established under clause 35.
<P>
As the right hon. Member for Wells has just said, the clause provides an exemption for persons who carry on certain kinds of business as representatives for an authorised person—their principal—as long as they comply with any relevant requirements. The principal must have permissions covering the activities of the appointed representative and has to accept responsibility in writing for those activities just as though they were carrying them out themselves.
<P>
The amendment would specify in the Bill certain conditions that would need to be fulfilled in order for a person to benefit from the exemption.
<P>
Our general approach with the Bill has been to take powers to prescribe certain matters in regulations, rather than include them in the Bill. The Committee has already looked at that in the definition of regulated activities under clause 20 and the exemptions under clause 34. We believe that it is better to have the full picture spelt out in regulations—the old friend that the right hon. Gentleman urged me to dispense with.
<P>
In this case, there are two reasons why we believe that the detail should he set out in secondary legislation. First, the exemption will rely on the content of the regulated activities order. To set out conditions relevant to the specific regulated activities would anticipate what those activities are to include.
<P>
Moreover, restricting the types of conditions that are to apply now would limit our ability to update the legislation over time. It would not therefore be possible to keep pace with regulatory or commercial developments in the areas where the clause is trying to provide relief from the regime.
<P>
I can confirm, however, that I do not have any strong objections, in principle, to the sorts of conditions that are set out in the amendment. They are broadly translated from existing provisions under section 44, from which clause 35 is derived. I can tell members of the Committee that it is our intention to incorporate provisions along those lines—at least in general terms—into the regulations provided for in subsection (1). The drafting may differ slightly but the overall objective will be the same.
<P>
We also need to take into account that, in the context of the Financial Services Act 1986, the concept dealt with in the clause is straightforward as the types of business that may benefit from the exemption are quite narrow. They relate to investment business as defined under the 1986 Act. We propose at the outset that the exemption will have similar coverage. However, that may not always be the case in the future, given that the potential scope of regulated activities is much wider than under the 1986 Act and the same conditions may not be relevant to such activities. That is why it is appropriate to deal with the conditions under secondary legislation.
<P>
I can assure Opposition Members that activities will be drawn widely enough to cover existing appointed representatives, who will need to rely on clause 35. I hope that they find my words reassuring and will consider that their amendment is unnecessary and withdraw it. If not, I shall urge my hon. Friends to oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's clarification of the Treasury's position, which was very much as we expected. There is, however, a more general point to be made about secondary legislation. Of course, it is convenient for the Government and the FSA to have at their disposal regulations that can be used to update and change the scope of the Bill. Indeed, it is true that, in an evolving market, additional products and activities may fall to be regulated, but I am not aware of any great problems with the 1986 Act in that respect nor do I believe that its provisions are now out of date.
<P>
Against the convenience to change matters at will is the fact that the regulated community—the traders, the market makers and, indeed, the public—will rely on the Act. Ministers do not fully understand the inconvenience of expecting people to refer not to a single Act of Parliament, but to a mass of confusing and changing regulations. That may be fine for the experts in the FSA, Treasury officials and even Ministers; it is their duty to work full time on such matters as part of their daily routine, but such a routine does not apply to people who are selling products and earning money for themselves and the country.
<P>
Such measures are often necessary to such people, but they are a nuisance nevertheless. If people are expected to comply with such legislation, we, as a Committee, should try wherever possible to minimise such a problem and make it easier for them to understand the legislation. After all, people can be sent to prison or face unlimited fines for infractions. I wish to put down a marker now that we shall seek wherever possible to simplify and consolidate, and lay down the scope, provisions and obligations of the Bill under primary legislation.
<P>
Having said that, I listened to the Economic Secretary's stated intention that the new provisions will broadly replicate those of the past. We shall not press the amendment to a Division, but I ask the hon. Lady to acknowledge, not necessarily at this point in our debate, that there is a need to have regard to simplicity and transparency, which often means laying down matters in primary legislation that can be scrutinised in debate. Regulations and orders flow through the House often without anyone noticing or debating them—a point that we have made in the past.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> In answer to the previous debate the Minister said that the Government have put out a consultation document on the classes of exemption. I confess that I have not seen it, but I should be grateful for it to be drawn to my attention within the next few hours. Am I right in thinking that that document proposes that precisely those classes of business that are currently exempted—and which are frightfully obvious, as they are exactly the sort of thing that an employee of such a business would be expected to be doing all the time—will continue to be exempted?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The right hon. and learned Gentleman is trying to draw us back into the debate that we had a few moments ago. He should look at the document, and if there is anything in it on which he wishes to write to me, I guarantee to respond.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I do not want to harry the Minister unduly, but it is for her rather than the Opposition to be satisfied about such matters. It is the Opposition's duty to probe to ensure that stupid things are not done in legislation. It would be undesirable if such matters were missed out; it would cause chaos in the City. It is up to the Minister and those who support her to get it right.
<P>
I am reminded of what the Foreign Secretary said when he was asked about the difference between being Foreign Secretary and shadow Foreign Secretary. I cannot do a Glasgow accent, but he said, ``I have 2,000 people to help me and when I was shadow Foreign Secretary, I had two.'' The City is entitled to look to the Minister to be confident in such matters rather than expecting Opposition Members to write to her to point out problems.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> It would still be appropriate for the right hon. and learned Gentleman to see what is in the document. I note that his remarks have led to a remarkable improvement in the lighting in this Room. We welcome the Opposition's contributions whenever they cast light on matters, but I am satisfied about the arrangements that have been made. If the right hon. and learned Gentleman is not satisfied, it is for him to raise the detail with us when he has seen the document.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 35 ordered to stand Part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we move on, I must apologise to the Committee for the technical adjustments that have taken place in our proceedings. We are gradually getting to where we wish to be.
<P>
Clause 36 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 37</center></H4>
<H4><center>GIVING PERMISSION</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I have one question about clause 37. Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Authority may give permission for the applicant to carry on the regulated activity or activities to which his application relates or such of them as may be specified in the permission.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Are we trying to replicate existing statute in the new Bill, or are we doing something different? I think that clause 37 is merely replicating an existing set of rules. Section 27 of the Financial Services Act 1986 states that the Secretary of State ``shall'' rather than ``may'' grant permission. Why is the authority being given discretion, which is implicit in the use of the word ``may'', even when all the other conditions will have been satisfied? That discretion is not afforded to the Secretary of State in the existing legislation. He had to grant permission if he concluded that the conditions had been met.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Perhaps it is best if I explain that the clause sets out the test that the FSA must apply when considering whether to grant permission. The FSA must be satisfied that the applicant would satisfy the qualifying conditions in schedule 6 in respect of all the regulated activities covered by the permission that it would have.
<P>
The conditions are broadly expressed in order to ensure that they remain current and in order to set out parameters for the FSA without inhibiting their pursuit of their statutory objectives or the application of the other principles set out in part I.
<P>
The goal is to give the industry a degree of certainty about the tests to be applied, but not in a way that risks becoming outdated and a drag on innovation, or which interferes with the FSA's ability to pursue its statutory objectives in the most appropriate way, in keeping with the principles of proportionality and competitiveness.
<P>
In line with that philosophy, the Committee will wish to note that the FSA will have discretion to grant permission for all the activities applied for, or just some of them, or to frame the permission it grants so as to cover activities which are wider or narrower than the activities described in the application.
<P>
That will allow the FSA to limit the way in which an activity may be carried on, if necessary, but without requiring it to refuse the whole application, which is a vital element of ensuring proportional regulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I have an allied query to that raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie), relating to subsection (5)(a) which states that the authority may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``incorporate in the description of a regulated activity such limitation (for example as to circumstances in which the activity may, or may not, be carried on)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What does the Minister have in mind with that example? It seems to me to be largely unworkable. How can the authority foresee circumstances in which someone wishes to carry on his business? It is rather intrusive for the authority to try to restrict an activity, to comply with certain hypothetical circumstances. The authority should either be authorising the business or not. That is a sufficient limitation. To try to delve into the circumstances in which the business is conducted is unnecessarily vague, unworkable and unenforceable. Will the Minister shed some light on that provision? It must be deemed important for it to have been singled out as an example. If the matter is covered anyway in the clause, it must have some additional significance to be given as a specific example in that subsection.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Before answering the right hon. Member for Wells, perhaps I can return to the point made by the hon. Member for Chichester. The exercise of discretion by the FSA can be reviewed by the new tribunal. If a firm can show that it satisfies the conditions, the FSA will have to convince the tribunal that it has good reason still to refuse. Therefore, a further safeguard is built into the arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Does the Minister accept that that is offering a safeguard to what is effectively a new power? It does not currently exist in present legislation. As I understand it—the Minister will correct me if I am wrong—section 27 of the 1986 Act, on which clause 37 is based, is quite clear. Section 27(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State shall grant the application if it appears to him from the information furnished by the applicant and having regard to any other information in his possession that the applicant is a fit and proper person''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is the fit and proper test with which everyone is familiar. It seems to me, on reading clause 37, that someone could pass the fit and proper test, based on the information available to the FSA, yet the authority would still have the discretion to withhold permission. The Economic Secretary has said only that, if that were to happen, the matter could go before a tribunal. That is a substantial increase in the FSA's power. The Minister should explain it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That was an intervention. I appreciate that these are complex issues, and that they require a fair amount of detailed discussion. If hon. Members wish to, they may intervene; but if they wish to say more, they must make speeches.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall respond to the hon. Gentleman's comments in a little more detail. The FSA must be satisfied that its conditions will be met. It is for the applicant to satisfy the authority, but the authority must specify the information that it requires to make a judgment. If the FSA proposes to refuse some or all of the permission applied for, it must issue a warning notice setting out its reasons.
<P>
The applicant will then have the opportunity to make representations. If, in the light of that, the authority subsequently decides to refuse to grant permission, the matter may be referred to a tribunal.
<P>
It is essential that the FSA has the discretion to grant a narrower permission, otherwise it would have to refuse to grant any permission if it was not satisfied or if a person had met only part of the conditions. That, we believe, would be disproportionate. The ability to grant a wide permission also enables the FSA to standardise permissions when it is sensible to do so.
<P>
I shall now move on to the other points that have been made. The Financial Services Authority may need initially to restrict the degree to which a business can be expanded. Limits are often placed on insurance premiums at present. The authority may also wish to make authorisation conditional upon fulfilling one aspect of the business plan.
<P>
Finally, I have received further inspiration. What was said by the hon. Member for Chichester was an arguable interpretation, and I shall add to it. A degree of discretion already exists under current legislation, including under the Banking Act 1987.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> There is more to it than that. The Financial Services Act 1986 is much shorter and crisper. One finds the fit and proper person criteria in section 27(2). Under the Bill, one has to look in schedule 6 to discover what criteria the FSA can apply; and in paragraph 6, when one eventually comes to it, one will find the fit and proper person test. However, if one jumps back to paragraph 5, one will find an adequate resources test. That latter test seems to answer the Minister's point about restricting the ambit of a person's activities on financial grounds, but it is already in the schedule.
<P>
Why is that extra discretion needed? How are market traders to know whether or not they are likely to get a permission? We have faced such difficulties in all our debates on the Bill. One quite understands the Government wanting belt and braces, but the Bill seems to include every other kind of external and internal force to give the Government a discretion so wide that one loses sight of the principle.
<P>
Does not the Minister accept that the main principle must be the fit and proper test? Those who do not have enough money to carry on a business satisfactorily—those who do not have sufficient capital, sufficient backing or a sufficiently good financial track record—will not be fit and proper persons. Paragraph 5 of schedule 6, which deals with adequate resources, is therefore scarcely necessary. Those who drafted the Bill seem to have been told to give the Treasury and the FSA an almost unlimited discretion.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister shakes her head. Perhaps she was shaking it in wonderment. She was a member of the committee before being promoted to ministerial rank, and she has heard all our debates.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester said, the Bill provides sufficient power without adding the extra discretion included in clause 37. Can the City be satisfied that straightforward and comprehensible tests will be applied? Can businesses be satisfied that they will not have to go through elaborate procedures on appeal before tribunals simply because they do not know what principles will guide the FSA in deciding whether or not to grant a permission?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My right hon. and learned Friend has summarised our concerns extremely well. It seems increasingly that the Bill has been written with an almost excessive desire to meet the convenience of the Government and the FSA, and, if there is likely to be any doubt, that is tilted heavily in favour of giving the discretion to the FSA. We understand that the Government are cautious about a market that they must now regulate in the round, and that there are unexpected aspects to the market with which they are not familiar. However, that should not override the rights of the regulated community to know where it stands in rather greater certainty than appears to be the case.
<P>
We have hit upon a rather good example of that; we are in danger of giving the FSA untrammelled authority and discretion, which is not good law. The tradition and principle of our law is that people should be able to see precisely where they stand in relation to civil and criminal law, particularly if they face penalties and especially if their livelihoods could be at stake. We are talking about people who are trying to earn a living by pursuing regulated activities and who wish to comply with the law but who find it increasingly difficult to discover exactly what the law is and what powers they face.
<P>
It is not a happy clause, especially because, as my right hon. and learned Friend has pointed out, the necessary restrictions and safeguards appear elsewhere in the Bill. It is a duplication of powers. Although I do not intend to pursue the clause to a Division, we wish to record our disquiet. We shall certainly scrutinise other clauses for the same problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I agree with my right hon. Friend and perhaps I can add my threepenny-worth. During the Burns committee we heard much—we shall come to it in later clauses—about the capacity of firms with grievances to challenge the law, and whether they could have those grievances considered under the European convention on human rights. That is one of the more weighty matters that we shall deal with later. As my right hon. Friend said, we are talking about the livelihoods of individuals working for small firms—independent financial advisers or whatever—which often do not have the financial clout to challenge the diktats of the FSA if it decides not to give permission to carry on business.
<P>
The FSA and the Government have an obligation to ensure that the grounds on which someone can be deprived of their livelihood—by failing to be granted permission to carry on their business—are crystal clear. That applies particularly to smaller firms that do not have the resources to challenge such a decision, whereas the larger firms will take it all the way through the courts to Europe. The one or two-man—or woman—operation legitimately offering financial advice will not have that recourse, and it is incumbent on the Government to set out the rules so that people can abide by them. They should not face the catch-all discretion whereby the rules are deemed not to apply to particular cases—perhaps because the cut of the coat, or whatever else that stands for metaphorically, is disliked. Here we have yet another example of rules being changed at a whim on discretionary grounds, and it is not good enough. We must have more clarity than that.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Opposition Members are becoming unduly emotional on this topic without due cause.
<P>
The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire asked whether resources in the schedule were adequate. The FSA should be able to place limitations on the permission rather than reject the application if the case is marginal. That is intended to help people rather than the opposite. My example was of business carried on by an insurance company—not relating to its financial aspects. That reflects the existing discretion in current legislation.
<P>
I would not disagree that the Financial Services Act 1986 is crisper than the Bill. The Bill rationalises a raft of complex and inconsistent legislation. Copies of the many amendments made to the 1986 Act are available only on the private market. The Act is now enormously complicated and reflects an outmoded view of the financial markets. I had thought that Opposition Members were in favour of modernising.
<P>
I conclude by reiterating our commitment and belief that the Bill will lead to light-touch regulation and modernise the legal provisions under which financial services operate by reducing regulation and duplication. I therefore urge my hon. Friends to support the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I apologise for having turned a previous intervention into a speech: I shall now try to turn a speech into an intervention.
<P>
I summarise my remaining concern, having heard the Minister's remarks, by asking a simple question. We already have a fit and proper test. In what way will the application of that fit and proper test be altered by the translation of the clause from existing legislation into the Bill?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> It will remain the same.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Some hon. Members appear to be under the impression that we are debating an amendment, but we are conducting a clause stand part debate.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 37 ordered to stand Part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we debate schedule 6 I should point out to the Committee that while it was entirely proper to refer to that schedule in the previous debate, which was directly related to clause 37, rehearsing the same arguments would be unwelcome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 220, in page 204, line 34, after second `to', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the continuance of'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister's statement illustrated why schedule 6 generally is somewhat over-prescribed. Our amendment No. 220 is on a point of legal definition. As we see it, as there is no application for authorisation as such, which is somewhat strange, and differs from existing practice, there should be a reference to ``the continuance of'' authorisation, not merely to authorisation. There is no point of principle, merely a legal drafting point.
<P>
Amendment No. 163—
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> Order. We are taking amendment No. 163 separately.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> We agree with the substance of the amendment and with amendment No. 255, which relates to clause 44 and address the same point.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs is quite right to say that the requirement that an authorised person should meet the qualifying conditions in respect of the entire permission he holds is continuous. That is shown by the fact that failure to meet the conditions would be grounds for the Financial Services Authority to exercise its own initiative power under clause 40. The hon. Gentleman was right to say that we would make that clear. We have asked counsel to draft amendments to this effect which we propose to table on Report. I am sorry that we were unable to do so before the Committee reached this part of the Bill. On that basis, I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We thank the Minister. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The two amendments pose a question because I am unclear about what the Government intended with this provision. Amendment No. 163 is a definitional point, in that, for example, a business in the United States of America could have its head office and registered office in the same country but in different territories. There may be a head office in New York and a registered office in Delaware and I presume that there could be an analogous position in relation to the European Union. In our understanding, inserting the word ``territory'' after the word ``country'' would unintentionally exclude that.
<P>
Amendment No. 221 goes somewhat further. The Government's objective may be very much what I call the Bank of Credit and Commerce International point, but it may be difficult for European economic area firms which are not bodies corporate, and non-EEA firms which do not have a registered office, to comply with paragraph 3(5), to which the amendment relates. If, for example, a firm is a German or EEA banking or investment partnership, so outside paragraph 3(2), or is a Swiss or other non-EEA partnership without the equivalent of a registered office, therefore outside paragraph 3(3), it follows that as a result of paragraph 3(5) it would seem unable to obtain authorisation in the United Kingdom unless its head office was here. However, it would be unlikely to have a UK head office, so could not be authorised—therefore could not have an office in the UK. Surely that was not what the Government intended. The amendment would allow such companies to be authorised if they carry on business in the United Kingdom from a UK branch. However, there is likely to be a financial supervision problem, so we suggest that the FSA impose other requirements for the purpose of prudential supervision. In other words, the BCCI principle, which is understood, could inappropriately exclude certain businesses. That must be addressed.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I want to back up my hon. Friend's comments, because there are anti-competitiveness implications in the measures.
<P>
Paragraph 3 unnecessarily restricts foreign entities from seeking authorisation or permission in the UK. Non-EEA bodies corporate might not always have a registered office, as my hon. Friend said. The US is a good example of a place where firms have a head office in a city and a registered office in the state as well. That particularly refers to US firms. I see no reason in principle to bar any foreign partnership—for bodies not in corporate form—from establishing authorised branches in the UK. Indeed, EEA individual sole traders or other EEA entities that are not in corporate form should be free to establish branches in the UK or to seek additional permissions when conducting cross-border business.
<P>
There is a case to be made, and I hope that the Minister will respond favourably. Indeed, one day she might even accept an amendment, rather than have the draftsmen change the odd conjunction to prove that it was not down to the Opposition's abilities that a point had been shown to be wrong.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The best thing would be to run through my brief, which responds very much in the terms in which the hon. Members for Arundel and South Downs and for East Worthing and Shoreham posed their questions.
<P>
Paragraph 3 implements requirements under the post-BCCI investment services and UCITS directives to ensure that financial services firms covered by the directives have their head offices in the same legal jurisdiction as their place of incorporation. Members of the Committee will not need reminding that that is one of the main lessons that emerged from the Bingham inquiry into the supervision of BCCI. The Commission and other member states rightly took that lesson.
<P>
BCCI group had a complex structure, but it had two main companies. One was based in the Cayman Islands and the other was incorporated in Luxembourg but run from London. Bingham identified that latter split of accountability as a significant factor in the events that led to the group's failure. The directives therefore ruled out such a structure for firms covered by the banking, insurance, investment services and UCITS directives.
<P>
I think that I have understood the hon. Gentlemen correctly when I say that the amendments are aimed at two things. First, amendment No. 163 reflects concern that, by referring to a ``country or territory'' a second time, in line 13, the paragraph inadvertently rules out the possibility of a firm being authorised here if it is incorporated in one territory in a non-EEA country but has its head office in another territory in the same non-EEA country. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs mentioned the example of a bank that was incorporated in Delaware but run from New York. The situation arises because the term ``territory'' can sometimes refer to part of a country, as in the case of the individual states that make up the US. I am happy to confirm that the occurrence of the scenario that has been outlined is not our intention. I shall take the point away and consider it further.
<P>
Amendment No. 221, relates to the category of authorised or would-be authorised persons who are not bodies corporate in the UK or in any other state in the EEA, and who are not constituted under the law of any non-EEA country, and have a registered office or equivalent. In effect, that category includes unincorporated bodies from the EEA and bodies with no registered office from other countries. It is a narrow category, but not an empty one. The Bill envisages the possibility that an authorised person might not be incorporated or have a registered office.
<P>
I sympathise with the Opposition's contention that the requirement for that category is too tightly drawn. We should not rule out the possibility that such persons could legitimately run their businesses from abroad, nor insist that their head office is in the UK. That is also a matter that we shall consider further. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman withdrew the amendment on the understanding that we will consider the matter further in the context of other changes that we intend to make to the schedule. We shall aim to introduce amendments on Report.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister. We are satisfied that the Government have taken the point and will address it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 222, in page 206, line 18, leave out `an additional permission' and insert `permission under Part IV'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 223, in page 206, line 20, leave out `additional' and insert `a Part IV'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> With this brief amendment, we seek clarification. We are again dealing with authorisation under schedule 4. Amendment No. 222 would replace ``an additional permission'' with ``permission under Part IV''. I do not need to remind the Committee that part IV permission covers permission to individuals, bodies corporate, partnerships and unincorporated associations.
<P>
The term ``additional permission'' which was in paragraph 8 of schedule 4 was specifically defined in the draft Bill, when that was published in the dim and distant past; however, it appears to have been dropped from the present Bill. We feel it is necessary specifically to refer to ``permission under Part IV''. Similarly, amendment No. 223 would replace ``additional'' with ``Part IV''. Could the Minister shed some light on why the specific definition in the draft Bill was dropped? I hope that she will be prepared to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> It will be helpful if I describe the changes that we intend to make to part IV and to the schedule. We recognise that, in an ideal world, we might have tabled amendments for the Committee to consider today. I apologise for the fact that we have not been able to do so. On the other hand, the Opposition have shown their interest in this part of the Bill by tabling a number of amendments to it, so we will be able to take full account of today's debate when finalising our improvements on Report.
<P>
First, we intend to make it clear that the requirement that an authorised person meets the qualifying conditions in respect of the entire permission he holds is continuous. That has always been the intention. We can come back to this when we debate amendments Nos. 220 and 255.
<P>
Secondly, we may also need to make it clearer than it is now that requirements may be imposed under clause 38 on an authorised person who otherwise is not allowed to carry on any regulated activities. We are pursuing that point with the draftsmen. That may require some reworking of the way in which part IV works.
<P>
Thirdly, we are not fully satisfied that there is adequate recourse to the tribunal in some circumstances. For instance, a person who is not allowed to carry on any regulated activities, but is subject to requirements, may have accepted the case for the initial action, but believe that it is no longer justified and that the previous extent of his or her permission should be restored. In addition, applicants for a new or different permission who do not have their application granted in full should have the clear right to refer the matter to the tribunal. We intend to ensure that the Bill is clear that they do have such recourse.
<P>
We also have some concerns that the procedural clauses later in this part might not be sufficiently clear to enable the FSA to take urgent intervention action when it needs to do so. There can be no question that the FSA is not able to step in when necessary to protect the interests of consumers, or to prevent systemic harm to the system. We are pursuing that point with the draftsmen.
<P>
We can come back to those procedural issues later, but I am confident that members of the Committee share our desire for the Financial Services Authority to be able to act quickly and effectively in time of crisis. We will therefore table Government amendments on Report to ensure that that critical part of the Bill works as it should.
<P>
I do not see any value in replacing ``additional permission'' with ``permission under Part IV'', as  proposed in amendments Nos. 222 and 223. The meaning of the term is clear enough and the draftsmen clearly regard it as necessary to distinguish in this context between additional part IV permissions held by an EEA or treaty firm. I cannot see that there is any reason for that other than terminological. Accepting the amendment would not benefit the Bill and, in the light of my remarks about the major changes that may be necessary to that part of the Bill, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it. We will return to the matter on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Again, I am happy not to press the amendments to a Division. However, given that we are at a fairly advanced stage of the Bill—it is now more than 15 months since the original draft Bill and consultation exercise—that our amendments on the schedule were tabled some time ago, that the draftsmen have had the entire summer recess to look at the flaws in part IV and taking into consideration the concerns raised during the Burns joint committee on the workings of the tribunal, which we shall consider in detail later, it is highly unsatisfactory for the Minister to be acknowledging only now that there may be deficiencies such that the Government may have completely to rework part IV. Part IV is a crucial part of the legislation.
<P>
We shall be exceedingly busy on Report. It is not just today that the Government have said that they propose to table amendments on Report, having failed to do so in the time scale of the Committee. Surely the optimum time to table such amendments would be during the full gamut of detailed debate in Committee? We are just being told—we have been told it for some time—that our amendments have a point but that no Government amendments are being tabled. I request the Government to allow sufficient time on Report to discuss the issues. The Minister is loading on a tremendous number of extra new amendments and provisions that we are denied the opportunity to debate properly in Committee. If we are allowed only the odd day or so to consider them on Report—as well as other major issues that we want to revisit and on which we have had more detailed, but still insufficient, debates—the process will become an absolute farce. If that happens, when the Bill becomes an Act and goes live, our fear of complete pandemonium, with various firms suddenly finding that they are not allowed to get on with their business and that part of their livelihood has being taken away from them—simply because the Government have not done their homework at the right time—will be realised. It is a point of grave concern that we are being asked to rely on the Government's good devices to come up with fresh amendments at a later stage. However, we will reluctantly not press the amendments to a vote.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not for the chairman of a Standing Committee to intervene in the Government's business management, but I am sure that the Government's business managers will have taken due account of what the hon. Gentleman said.
<P>
Amendment, by leave. withdrawn.
<P>
Question Proposed, That this schedule be the Sixth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I wish to make a few general points about the schedule, which are not covered in the amendment. For some time in our proceedings, I have been trying to flag up the ways in which the Bill will extend the FSA's powers beyond those under current Acts. As I understand it, schedule 6 is indicative only. That might explain why the discretionary word ``may'' is used in clause 37 instead of the word ``shall'', which is used in previous legislation. It is difficult to find that out from the wording of schedule 6, but it is made unambiguously clear in the Treasury's explanatory notes on the schedule. Paragraph 669 of the explanatory notes states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Authority retains some discretion to refuse an application even where all these conditions are satisfied.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is that discretion a reference to the fit and proper test; is it a reference to that test and other issues; or is it a reference to something else?
<P>
When I asked the Economic Secretary whether the application of the fit and proper test under the Bill would differ from that under previous legislation in the debate on clause 37, she replied that it would be the same, and she is nodding her head in the affirmative now. That is pure Pepper v. Hart country, and I am sure that the courts will take it into account if such matters are subject to judicial review. The Economic Secretary has taken an important and helpful step forward. In the same vein, I ask her to clarify how schedule 6 should be interpreted.
<P>
In the debate on clause 37, I explained that section 27 of the Financial Services Act 1986 has not been transferred. I shall not go over that debate again. I acknowledged that some checks on the FSA exist in relation to such matters. Under clause 49, the FSA must issue a warning before it refuses permission. Clauses 338 and 339 lay down the procedure that must be followed to implement clause 49. Many of us will have something to say about that when we debate that clause. As the Economic Secretary mentioned in the debate on clause 37, a right to appeal to the tribunal exists under clause 52(1). That is all very well.
<P>
I do not want to detain the Committee for too long, but it would be useful to hear more of the helpful clarification that we heard at the end of the debate on clause 37. The Economic Secretary should tell us whether I have got it wrong and, in fact, schedule 6 is not indicative but limits the extent to which the FSA can exercise its discretion. She should tell us whether the additional discretion that the authority is said to retain, to which paragraph 669 of the Treasury's explanatory note refers, is a reference to the fit and proper test; whether it is a reference to more than that test; or whether I have got it completely wrong.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The hon. Member for Chichester asked whether the wider discretion is a reference to the fit and proper test. The answer is no. The fit and proper test is included in paragraph 6 of schedule 6. The wider discretion flows, as now, from the overarching responsibility of the regulator under the Bill to protect consumers and maintain market confidence. As we proceed, we must not lose sight of the importance of the objectives set out in clause 2—I think it is—because they must guide the work of the FSA. It will have that wide discretion under those responsibilities.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In broad terms, the schedule sets out the conditions that the FSA must be satisfied that a person meets in respect of all the regulated activities that he has permission to carry on. That covers the fitness and properness of persons, the adequacy of their capital and other resources and the appropriateness of their corporate or organisational structure. They are all important factors that underpin modern financial regulation, and which are enshrined in one form or another in international standards and European law. However, as we discussed in the context of the amendments, it is our aim that those factors should be set out in a form that gives the industry sufficient certainty, without constraining innovation in the organisation of financial services business, and those factors are intended to be timeless.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> It will be interesting to read what the Economic Secretary has said, because she wanted to move on and read her brief out quickly. My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester asked, and I am also trying more clearly to understand, what is meant by the explanatory notes, which state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Authority retains some discretion to refuse an application even when all these conditions are satisfied.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understood the Minister to have said that the authority will set out in much more detail what will fetter its discretion, so that those in the market will understand more clearly what it is likely to have in mind. I cannot say that I am happy with that answer, because the Bill is extraordinarily wide and we need to know while it is passing through the House how the matter is to be approached. Will the Minister tell us when we shall see some clear description of how the authority intends to operate in that area?
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): I hesitate to add to the right hon. and learned Gentleman's reading burden, but he may have recently received the FSA's consultation document ``The Permission Regime'', which sets out all the information for which he just asked. That document does not affect the good debate that we have had about principle, but it sets out how the FSA intends to proceed in granting permissions and provides the detailed clarification for which the right hon. and 1earned Gentleman just asked.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> That was a helpful intervention. Perhaps the Economic Secretary will clarify whether she is referring to that document?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> It is only a consultation document; it is not a statement of the Government's position. We need a statement of the Government's position to clarify the authority's discretion to go beyond the guidelines set out in schedule 6.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He reinforces my question to the Minister: when will we receive an ex cathedra statement, which the market will know to be how the Government, the Treasury and the FSA propose to handle such matters? I suggest that it should be soon, so that we can consider it in our discussion of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I can confirm to the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire that that was the document to which I referred. I can give him no satisfaction at present on his later question about exactly when the details will be announced, except to point out in response to the remarks of the hon. Member for Chichester about consultation that we do not issue consultation documents and at the same time announce what we will do in detail. That would be ridiculous. I do not know whether that was the previous Government's policy, but it is not our policy.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 6 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 38</center></H4>
<H4><center>Imposition of requirements</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 241, in page 17, line 1, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
Clause 38 gives the Financial Services Authority powers to impose requirements on those who are applying for permission to carry on regulated activities. It enables the authority to require them to take certain action or to prevent them from so doing. Subsection (4), however, is a rather remarkable extension of the Bill because it will extend such powers to activities that are not regulated. For the first time, we see the ability of the FSA to stray into commercial activities that are not regulated. We saw earlier in the Bill that the definition of a regulated activity is very wide and that it can be extended by order, as a result of which there will be no restriction on what the FSA can regulate if it considers it in the public interest to do so.
<P>
The clause gives the FSA the ability to lay down requirements on people and firms about activities that are not regulated and that could cover just about anything. There is no commercial activity, such as buying, selling, investing, changing money or depositing it in one bank account from another that could be covered in such a way. It is important therefore to lay down some restrictions or limitations under the Bill to keep the FSA regulating activities that are defined as being worthy of regulation.
<P>
Will the Economic Secretary explain the reason for the subsection? It strays into general areas, which was certainly not the intention when the FSA was set up. Most market traders and members of the public would accept that the FSA has a duty to regulate certain activities as defined and that such activities should be capable of expansion, but if the same people had been asked whether the FSA should be able to lay down conditions and regulate activities that are outside the scope of the Bill—which could cover just about anything—they would have been surprised and rather alarmed at such a prospect.
<P>
Our amendment would delete subsection (4). It would not do violence to the intention of the clause or its ability to allow the FSA to impose requirements on a regulated person, but it would stop it straying into the general area of unregulated activities.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his remarks. It is essential that the Financial Services Authority can impose requirements in relation to an authorised person's unregulated activities. There may be reasons for the FSA having cause for caution about how regulated and unregulated activities will be carried on together. There are any number of ways in which unregulated activities can impact either on the soundness of the firm or on the way in which it carries out its regulated activities.
<P>
It may be useful if I cite an example to illustrate what we have in mind. The provision will give the FSA vital flexibility; for example, the applicant may have little or no track record in offering the services concerned and the FSA may need to monitor events closely. Without such ability, the applications may have to be refused, which otherwise need not be refused. The provision will provide additional flexibility in the interests of industry and competition. Such restrictions may involve the FSA imposing a limit on the amount and type of business that someone may conduct during a specified period immediately after receiving a new permission. That is already established practice in the insurance sector, and is often used in relation to the amount of new business that insurance companies may take on in the period following their authorisation to undertake a new form of insurance business.
<P>
As has been said, requirements may also be imposed in relation to unregulated activities, should the FSA have cause for concern about how regulated and unregulated activities will be conducted together. For example, the FSA may not want an investment manager or a bank operating a casino on premises already used for other activities.
<P>
At present, the FSA must approve business plans under the Financial Services Act 1986. The Bank of England has always felt it necessary to constrain aspects of a bank's non-deposit-taking business. Lending is the most obvious example of a non-regulated activity that may affect a bank's resources and whether it is a fit and proper business. Such circumstances lead us to wish to retain clause 38 in its current form and I therefore urge Conservative Members to withdraw their amendment. However, should they feel unable to do so, I urge my hon. Friends to oppose it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The drafting of clause 38 shows a lack of clarity. As the Minister said, the Bank of England or the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation currently have the power to refuse to regulate a business unless it ceases its unregulated activities on the side or conducts those activities in a certain way. There is, therefore, an informal conditionality.
<P>
However, subsection (4) implies a formal requirement to regulate unregulated activities. That is otiose, as the FSA may easily use its leverage to grant permission. For example, it could use such leverage in the case of the casino cited by the Minister—admittedly, that is at the far end of the spectrum—saying that full permission will not be granted unless such and such is done.
<P>
Matters do not have to be prescribed in such detail. Clause 38(4) implies something that goes beyond the leverage that has been common-sense practice. It does not propose that the FSA should regulate unregulated activities, whatever its intent.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman's remarks suggest that we are all discussing a similar position. He says that clause 38(4), in its current form, does not make the provision that it should. We believe that it does. However, we have listened to the hon. Gentleman's arguments, as have our officials. I am not convinced that there is any legal uncertainty at the moment. However, should there be so, we can examine the matter later. I therefore request the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs is right to say that the FSA is at liberty to refuse an applicant a licence to undertake regulated activities if it is unhappy about how it is conducting business. Indeed, part of the FSA's licensing or authorising duties is to go into the background of applicants and examine their business in order to assess their suitability.
<P>
We object to the FSA having a defined ability which spreads its powers into unregulated activities. That broadens the scope of the Bill, and imposes on the FSA no limits whatsoever. The FSA will be allowed to make specific requirements to act or refrain from action in areas that do not come within its ambit or authority. That is a regrettable extension. The Minister gave some plausible examples, but we are concerned about the lack of restrictions on the FSA. It will not be required to act in the instances suggested by the Minister, which could be specified, at least in general terms. The FSA is being given a green light to start interfering in unregulated activities and in the affairs of people about whom it has suspicions, which may be entirely groundless. That is an unwarranted extension, so I must ask the Minister to try to define more precisely exactly what she wishes the FSA to be given the authority to do, rather than give it a general power.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> A moment ago, the Minister referred me to the document, ``The Permission Regime'', which was published this month. It deals with the matter of regulation that we are discussing now. I should like clarification so that we can understand how these matters will work. Paragraph 5.1 on page 21 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The FSA is reviewing the prudential requirements of all the firms it regulates ... a new Prudential Sourcebook will not be implemented until some time after N2.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To clarify the time scale, will the Minister say what or when is N2?
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I shall respond first to the right hon. Member for Wells and the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs. I cannot remember whether I have said it before, but it is important to remember that, whatever is done about unregulated activities and with regard to the matters that we are now discussing, the applicant or the authorised person who objects to the requirement being imposed by the FSA can refer the decision to a tribunal. That point should be placed on the record.
<P>
Opposition Members have spent some time this morning arguing that such matters should not be dealt with outside primary legislation, but should be written into the Bill. We are now discussing a subject on which the Bill is designed to achieve greater transparency by including an informal conditionality. Some Opposition Members have suggested that the FSA could rely on informal leverage, so they should approve of the clause. They cannot have their cake and eat it.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Many things are included in the Bill and many things are not. Is it not the case that the Government are having their cake and eating it?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> No. The Government are making sensible decisions about what needs to be included in the Bill and what should be covered by secondary legislation. That is entirely right and proper. N2 is the implementation date for the main powers in the Bill. We hope that that will be sooner rather than later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We believe that the Bill should be about giving the FSA powers over regulated activities and not about giving it powers over unregulated activities. The subsection does that, so, as a mark of our disquiet, we shall press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we move to the next clause, I remind hon. Members that the Committee will adjourn at 11.30 am—precisely the same time as the House sits. As no procedures are yet in place and as most hon. Members are not equipped for time travel, they will have to make their own arrangements if they wish to attend Speaker's prayers.
<H4><center>Clause 39</center></H4>
<H4><center>Variation etc at request of authorised person</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 242, in page 17, line 24, after `it,' insert `after receiving representations'.
<P>
The clause allows permission to be varied or cancelled at the request of an authorised person, and also allows refusal of an application. The amendment would limit the authority's ability to refuse an application, unless the interests of consumers were adversely affected. Relevant evidence would be that representations to that effect had been received. Otherwise, it would remain a mystery why an application had been turned down or refused by the authority when no apparent damage to consumers would have resulted. As I said, receipt of representations to that effect would provide a good test, which is what the amendment would add to the clause.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The amendment would clarify that, should the FSA decide to refuse an application on the grounds of consumer detriment, it must have regard to the applicant's representations on that point. We agree with that approach in principle: it is right that applicants should have adequate time and opportunity to put their case to the FSA, and that authority should consider those representations.
<P>
However, I would ask the hon. Members to withdraw their amendment. This amendment could have the effect that the FSA could do nothing until it had received representations and we would not want such an open-ended requirement to be placed upon the FSA in that way. For example, it is usual to place a time limit on responses. If the FSA received no representations, it could be unable to act further with regard to the applicant's permissions.
<P>
We are currently considering how best to make sure that the correct change is effected, so that the authority must be required to consider representations by applicants. I should like to thank the right hon. Member for Wells for raising this useful point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification of intention, in the light of which I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 218, in page 17, line 32, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(6) In this section ``consumers'' has the same meaning as in section 9(7)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 227, in Clause 40, page 18, line 36, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4A) For the purposes of Case C, ``consumers'' has the same meaning as in section 9(7)'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> We need not linger on these clear amendments. The Bill does not have a clear definition of consumers anywhere, so far as I can tell. We have already passed two definitions: one in clause 9 (7), the other in clause 5 (3). The amendments would incorporate the definition of ``consumer'' in clause 9(7), which excludes authorised persons and covers only end users. The use of the definition in clause 5(3) could conceivably incorporate authorised persons as ``consumers'' in certain circumstances.
<P>
In view of the intention of the clause in respect of part IV permission, it would be appropriate in this case to use an end user definition, and I hope that the Economic Secretary will accept the amendment as a means of achieving that clarification. I ask her to go slightly wider than the narrow point raised by the amendment and to tell us whether the Government have a view on whether the Bill should contain a standard definition of ``consumers''; if so, what that definition should be? Clause 39 is not the only clause on which we shall encounter that problem. Will more than one definition be retained, as the clauses that we have agreed should stand part imply? Has any consideration been given to the problems that might be created by a lack of clarity in the Bill about what constitutes ``consumers'' when elements of the legislation are subjected to judicial review?

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I thank Members for expressing their anxieties about consumers. As we have said previously we shall consider the case for a more consistent approach to defining ``consumer'' throughout the Bill. Nevertheless, there are good reasons for the different definitions of ``consumer'' in the Bill. The definition that in clause 9(7), which Opposition Members propose to insert in clause 39, applies to consumers in a narrower sense than the definition in clause 5. The definition in clause 9 relates to the consumer panel and excludes authorised persons because they are covered under the provisions relating to the practitioner panel.
<P>
The definition in clause 5 covers market users of the financial system as well as ordinary consumers. If we were to insert a definition of ``consumers'' into clauses 39 and 40, that definition would need to be even wider. For example, the FSA might not want a person to have permission to take deposits light of the impact on the banking system as a whole.
<P>
Because the amendment will not work, I shall have to disappoint the hon. Member for Chichester and ask either that he withdraws it or that my hon. Friends oppose it. We intend to consider the definition of ``consumer'' in the Bill at a later stage, and that is the best way forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am slightly surprised that a definition that already appears in the Bill in another context cannot be used in this clause. However, I am heartened by the Economic Secretary's restatement of her commitment to try to bring greater clarity to the definition of ``consumer'', and of her intention to return to the issue. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave. withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I should like to ask several questions about the clause. What will happen if the authority decides that consumers' interests have been affected? What recourse will people have against the FSA's exercise of that judgment? For example, could firms, consumer groups or even individual consumers sue the FSA for failure to do a good job in establishing consumers' interests?
<P>
Clause 19, which we have already debated, exempts the FSA from being liable for damages. That is wrong. We had a long debate about the matter, and I shall not rehearse those arguments. Schedule 1 is another relevant provision that has already been debated. However, it was clear when we debated that part of the Bill that the FSA would not be exempt from judicial review.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I favour some form of recourse for those who feel that the FSA has incorrectly interpreted and identified what is in the interests of consumers. It may be that authorised persons as well as consumers may lose out if the wider definition of consumers that the Minister mentioned is implemented. I shall get nowhere by suggesting that the FSA should be liable for damages; however, Opposition Members may one day—perhaps soon—find themselves sitting on the Benches opposite, and the Government may then reconsider that question. It is certainly unacceptable that the FSA should have such a blanket exemption.
<P>
I have another suggestion, which could have been framed in an amendment but which I would like to put to the Economic Secretary now. Would she consider making the exercise of the FSA's power, as set out in clause 39(4), at least subject to review by the consumer panel? The consumer panel is established under clause 7, and we have some idea of what the FSA might consider relevant for the consumer panel to consider when it is assessing the protection of consumers under clause 5(2).
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I shall give way in a moment.
<P>
Will the Economic Secretary say today whether the consumer panel might be given a role at least in monitoring what happens under clause 39? The panel is well placed to give consumers that sort of protection, and to act as a counterweight to the potentially arbitrary power that is being handed to the FSA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> The third objective of the FSA is the protection of consumers. As I understand it, the hon. Gentleman's proposal would make that objective workable under clause 39 only if the consumer panel agreed. Why should the authority derogate that sort of power to the consumer panel when it is a central objective of the authority itself?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am not suggesting that the whole parcel of objectives should be subject to veto by the consumer panel. I suggest something much more limited: that the panel should be given a clear direction to monitor the exercise of power under clause 39(4) if the FSA is blocking something on the grounds that it is in the interests of consumers. Making that decision subject to review by the consumer panel is a far more limited proposal than the hon Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard) suggests.
<P>
The wider issue—I shall refer to it only briefly—is whether we got the objectives right at the beginning of the Bill. Although various quarters of the Committee made informal complaints about the time that we took making those points, those early clauses go to the heart of the Bill. That is why we took so much time making sure that people had understood our concerns. As framed, the objectives are inadequate. That is another issue to which we shall return in government. The way to achieve the ultimate correct balance when defining consumers' interests is to ensure that there is sufficient competition in the market. In that way, consumers are protected by the free exercise of market competition. The absence of competition as an objective at the head of the Bill generates many weaknesses elsewhere; we have been talking about just one. I make those points because they are pertinent to the general point that the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford made about the first few clauses of the Bill.
<P>
I want to end by asking the Minister whether she thinks that the consumer panel should have a role and whether judicial review is an adequate counterweight to the discretionary power vested in the FSA to cancel part IV permission on the grounds that it is detrimental to consumers.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks about a firm whose application is refused. Such a firm has the right to go to the tribunal.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman seems to posit judicial review of the granting of permission by a disgruntled consumer. The FSA must keep permission under review. If the way in which a firm carries on its business is to the detriment of consumers, the FSA has adequate powers under the Bill to deal with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The issue is who defines the consumer's interests. It might be in the FSA's interests to be extremely stringent and to say that a consumer will be badly hit. However, other consumers might say, ``No. Let's have more competition in the market. Bet these people into the market because that will bring prices down and make the market more competitive.'' How should that judgment be made? What counterweight is there in the Bill to ensure a review of the FSA's decision?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> There is a tribunal, which acts as an arbitrator in such matters. The hon. Gentleman is trying to reopen the wisely lengthy debate on the objectives and principles at the start of the Bill. They have been substantially discussed. Decisions are a matter for the FSA, given the objectives and principles under which it will operate under clause 2.
<P>
As regards the consumer panel, the FSA must, under clause 7, have effective arrangements for consulting consumers on its general policies and practices. There is no reason why the consumer panel should not take an interest in practices in the area that we are discussing. However, it is up to the consumer panel to determine its priorities.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 39 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 40</center></H4>
<H4><center>Variation etc. on the Authority's own initiative</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 224, in page 18, line 15, leave out from `which' to first `the' in line 16 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`is listed in the annex to the second banking co-ordination directive or'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We now come to the way in which the authority may vary or cancel part IV permission. The Bill helpfully gives four cases in which that might apply. The reasons for which the FSA may revoke or vary terms and authorised persons' permissions on its own initiative are laid out in those four cases.
<P>
I am primarily concerned with Case D in this and subsequent amendments. Case A is reasonable. It describes a situation in which the FSA considers that the qualifying conditions are no longer satisfied in relation to the existing permission. We have no great argument with that. In Case B the FSA has cause to believe that authorised persons are likely to contravene a requirement under the Bill or have knowingly or recklessly misled the FSA. Case C protects the interest of consumers or potential consumers.
<P>
In Case D, however, the FSA has been informed by the Director General of Fair Trading that authorised persons, who would be able to carry on business with the EEA under the second banking co-ordination directive or the investment services directive, have done any of the things listed in section 25(2) of that Consumer Credit Act 1974, such as contravene provisions of the Act through fraud, dishonesty, violence, racial discrimination and so on.
<P>
The DGFT has to inform the FSA if the authorised person or someone connected with him has acted improperly, but it is unclear why that is limited to deposit taking and services listed in the investment services directive. Surely it is also relevant to any of the activities listed in the EU's second banking co-„ordination directive of 1989. The amendment seeks to find out whether there is a hidden reason why the same terms should not apply to the second banking co-„ordination directive. Perhaps the Minister can either allay our fears about that and explain the reason why, or accept our amendment.

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> There was some discussion about the differences between the activities covered by these two single market directives: the second banking directive and the investment services directive.
<P>
We accept that there might be a problem with the drafting here, and I am grateful to Opposition Members for drawing our attention to it. The FSA should certainly not be unable to exercise its own initiative power on behalf of the Director General of Fair Trading because the firm in question is passported here to carry on an activity covered by the annexe to one directive, but not the other.
<P>
That is an area where we will need to make some further minor amendments to ensure that the passport provisions take full account of the fact that the second banking directive and investment services directive passports can cover consumer credit. The current provisions are not quite right. We shall look at that point at the same time.
<P>
I accept the thrust of the Opposition's amendment, and will bring forward amendments with the same substantive effect in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> We have scored another hit, although it is slightly disappointing that the Government have, yet again, not accepted our amendment although they accept the thrust of it. On the basis that yet more amendments will be added on Report—we are looking forward to it eagerly and will not book our holidays for a long time yet—we shall withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has drawn the distinction between the second banking directive and the investment services directive. One of the things that is causing me a little concern as a I look through documents such as ``The Permission Regime'' is that distinctions are drawn between those who have a right to accept deposits and those who do not. Could the Minister find an opportunity, either now or shortly, to explain what is understood by ``acceptance of deposits''?
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I shall take an opportunity to do that at some later point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 225, in page 18, line 30, after `firm', insert `or a Treaty firm'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No 226, in page 18, line 32, at end insert

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I see from the clock that I am about to be cut off. I do not know whether I should begin my flow or just have a gentle preamble and get to the meat of it this afternoon.
<P>
We are dealing here with the problem of inconsistency between the EEA firms and firms permitted under the treaty. We have already had a lengthy and highly technical debate, helped in part by the interventions of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire on Tuesday. Amendment No. 225 seeks to add ``treaty firm'' after ``firm''.
