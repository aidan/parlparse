<P>
Question proposed [22 July], That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I caution the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) that my ruling of last night still stands. The 50 per cent. capital charge relates to clause 42, not clause 43. Clause 43 is about who gets the capital charge, not the charge itself; it is therefore not in order to pursue it as a principle in a debate on clause 43.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam, may we remove our jackets?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes, it will be very hot today, and I think that I will take my jacket off too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): I entirely accept, of course, that clause 43 is about who gets 50 per cent. capital allowances. Last night I was trying to explain that there seem to me to be three principles behind this clause, and that each of them is problematic. One of them is the idea of 50 per cent. capital--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the hon. Gentleman continues to argue about clause 42, he will be instructed to resume his seat. He may argue about what kind of company gets the capital allowance, but the 50 per cent. capital allowance is part of clause 42, which the Committee has now agreed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I have been a Member of Parliament for some time, Mr. McWilliam, and have always understood that one is normally allowed to make a few introductory remarks. Where there are three discriminatory principles--as in this case--I hope that one is allowed to refer to all three before focusing on one or two of them.
<P>
I understand, Mr. McWilliam, that you do not wish me to speak at any length about the issue of 50 per cent., and I do not intend to do so. It is, however, important that the Committee should realise that what we are talking about is within the context of the 50 per cent. capital allowances, and that that figure is an entirely arbitrary one, as I am sure you will agree. The question involves the three discriminatory principles that lie behind the clause: whether they should be time limited and whether they should be limited to small companies.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The only one of the three principles that the hon. Gentleman has enunciated that is in order is the last one. The first two are not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I hope that you will accept, Mr. McWilliam, that all three principles are discriminatory, and that the third principle comes within the context of discrimination and arbitrariness. At least I should be allowed to make that point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Of course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> As I said on Second Reading, the whole Bill is based on a large number of arbitrary and discriminatory principles. When you come, Mr. McWilliam, to distinguish between a smaller and a larger company, you immediately have a distortion in the marketplace. That must be obvious. No doubt the Government intend that distortion and that discriminatory principle.
<P>
Knowing that you, Mr. McWilliam, are about to pounce upon anything I say and possibly rule it out of order, I proceed with great nervousness and caution. However, it seems to me that the first problem with a principle that discriminates between smaller and larger companies is that if it discriminates in favour of the smaller against the larger, it creates a deterrent or a cost for companies moving from the smaller category across the arbitrary threshold to become larger.
<P>
Surely, Mr. McWilliam, if you had a rational Government, rationally committed to the well-being of the economy, that Government would be only too pleased to see firms moving from a smaller to a larger category--wherever you might arbitrarily choose to draw the line for that threshold. Perversely, companies that succeed in expanding their business will go through a threshold that will result not in reward, but in the loss of significant tax benefits.
<P>
You, Mr. McWilliam, might say that as this benefit lasts one year, a company could carry out its investment expenditure this year and hope that its turnover does not increase through the threshold, taking it from the category of smaller to larger company, until it had gained the benefits of tax relief--of the additional advanced appreciation that the clause aims to provide to companies. That theoretical, rhetorical suggestion, which I am sure is in the minds of many members of the Committee, re-emphasises the arbitrariness of the 12-month limit on the period during which the expenditure can be incurred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend is explaining the arbitrariness of the size criteria and is moving on to the time criteria. Does he agree that, despite the heroic efforts of the Revenue and draftsmen to produce viable distinctions in the clause, with the best will in the world, companies and individuals will seek to avoid these provisions by creating artificial arrangements from which they can benefit without being a normal taxpayer? Does that not add a further major complication to the tax system?
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. The clause, which is more than two pages long--it runs to more than 100 lines--is a good example of how discriminatory provisions in a Taxes Act create an increasing number of anomalies. It shows that to overcome the anomalies and to prevent tax avoidance, further limiting provisions have to be made.
<P>
Much of the clause is taken up with company structure. Several companies that might qualify as small companies will be aggregated, in a group or under a holding company, into a larger whole. I have no doubt that the Government thought that without such a provision, it would be easy for any business--including ICI, RTZ and other businesses mentioned yesterday afternoon--to disaggregate themselves into sufficiently small companies to qualify for the 50 per cent. capital allowances. That is why this complicated clause, with so many rules about holding companies, is in the Bill.
<P>
Under these burdensome rules, it is likely that sensible and rational arrangements that would otherwise have been made by small companies--such as merging with other companies to set up a holding company--will now be impossible if they wish to take advantage of the 50 per cent. capital allowances. It is not merely the regrettable discrimination between small and larger companies, or that expenditure will benefit from 50 per cent. capital allowances for only one year, that is distortionary, it is the dysfunctional impact on corporate structure. Companies will be able to take commercial and rational decisions on merger or partnership only if they hold back and delay taking them; otherwise they could fall foul of the Bill or lose a benefit which they might otherwise have had when making capital investments.
<P>
I am sure that you, Mr. McWilliam, know an awful lot about business, if only from having listened to so many Finance Bills being debated in Committee. You will therefore know that a negotiation, project or deal postponed may be a negotiation, project or deal lost.
<P>
On the basis of probably the finest intentions by the Government--to provide some benefit to small businesses--there is, once again, an artifical obstacle to those businesses' ability to pursue commercial activities in the way that seems most rational.
<P>
Small businesses are not allowed to grow beyond an arbitrary figure in the course of the relevant year. That is rather an extraordinary thing for a Government to proscribe. The Government are saying to companies, ``You must not be too successful and grow too fast, or we will take away a benefit we were going to give you.'' It would be more rational to say, ``If you are successful and grow, we will give you a greater benefit.'' We know, however, that the Labour party is not really the new Labour party: it remains the old Socialist party. Labour Members believe in penalising success, rather than in supporting and rewarding it. Indeed, they believe in rewarding and subsidising failure. Given that context. I suppose that it is perfectly rational that that distortion is in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): Is not the clause a typical example of the problems that arise when a limit is set on under what circumstances an allowance or relief is available? On or about that limit, activities are undertaken and commercial decisions are made to prevent the company's turnover, assets and even the number of employees from increasing, so that the company is not taken beyond that limit. When drafting tax legislation, it is generally inadvisable to impose artificial limits because they have unforeseen consequences on commercial activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. I hope that we shall persuade the Government to reconsider the artifical categorisation of different types of company able to benefit from different kinds of tax regimes. It is an extremely dangerous road to take.
<P>
Given that it is a faster rate of depreciaton than is economically justified, the effect of the 50 per cent. of capital allowances will be to bunch investment artificially in a particular year. My hon. Friend has argued that the effect of limiting the benefits to small companies will be to bias the management of firms so as to ensure that they gain the benefit of these capital allowances, even if they are generating enough profit to cover investment plans to enable them fully to so benefit.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Dawn Primarolo): Is the hon. Gentleman arguing against giving companies the benefit?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am arguing against the discriminatory tax allowances. I am doubtful about the principle of special capital allowances. As I have argued before in debates on previous Finance Bills--I hope that I shall be allowed to repeat the point, as it is very germane to the clause, as you will see, Mr. McWilliam--I favour taxes being imposed on accounting profit. I am against the traditional artificiality under which companies draw up one set of accounts on artificial principles for the Inland Revenue, and another set of accounts, on, they hope, not artificial principles, using current accounting standards, for the benefit of their shareholders and others with an interest in the performance of the company. That is a thoroughly artificial distinction, and I welcomed the changes made by the previous Conservative Administration in a series of Finance Bills, which brought taxable profits into line with accounting profits.
<P>
The Financial Secretary is defending the Bill, and the purpose of her intervention was to persuade me to follow the Government's line, which moves away from that principle. If you, Mr. McWilliam, were to adopt my approach rather than the hon. Lady's, a company would calculate the depreciation of capital equipment according to its economic life, and would have to satisfy its accountants that that depreciation is rational and acceptable for that industry. It might then make a depreciation provision against the current profits, according to the expected economic life of the plant or equipment in question.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In other words, the total value or historic cost, or, ideally, the replacement cost--an interesting subject on to which I know that you, Mr. McWilliam, do not want me to stray--incurred by a company in investing in that plant or equipment, would be divided by the number of years for which that equipment was expected to be used.
<P>
That raises an interesting argument--which I know that you, Mr. McWilliam, do not want me to pursue in this context--about whether there should be a declining balance or straight line approach to that depreciation. You would then end up--I hope that the hon. Lady will agree--with an economically rational system of depreciation, which followed proper accounting principles and which did not discriminate between companies or periods of time.
<P>
It would also mean a great benefit to this country--although certain people sitting to your right, Mr. McWilliam, may not agree--because it would result in a much thinner Finance Bill, without so much verbiage. That would be a pity, of course, because we would not be able to have debates stretching into the night. Nevertheless, I hope the Financial Secretary will consider my pleas for transparency, as future Finance Bills could be shorter and lighter, and we would not need 100 lines of text to define a small company. That creates a danger of larger companies finding ways of splitting themselves up to take advantage of those rules.
<P>
Companies' distortion of commercial behaviour may be as follows: they may hold up investment; they may bring forward investment that would have happened two or three years later, so as to remain within the ambit of the clause--as must my speech--and they may avoid relationships with other companies to stay within the Bill's holding company provisions. The extend of that distortion depends on the advantages that their business would obtain through 50 per cent. rather than 25 per cent. capital allowances. You might say that those allowances are not likely to make a big enough material difference greatly to distort behaviour, but in that case why do we have this proposal? Presumably, the only reason for this proposal is that it will increase the investment rate of small companies.
<P>
You could argue that there is no reason why investment by small companies is better than investment by big companies, but reference to that part of the Bill's essential economic rationale has been entirely missing from any intervention by Labour Members. We all agree that investment is good and that future ouput is a function of present investment, and that if other things are equal--as economists like to say--including the controversial issue of constant returns to capital, a higher investment rate will lead to higher output and greater prosperity for us all in the future.
<P>
Unless the Financial Secretary is to make an interesting contribution to economics today, however, I am not aware of anyone producing, in the 200 years of economics as a science, any empirical or theoretical reasons to suggest that investment by a small company produces a greater increase in future output than investment by a large company. It is true that small companies tend to grow fast, but so do many large ones. The clause's economic rationale has been unexpressed and rather unconvincing.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am following my hon. Friend's argument with interest and, indeed, a good deal of sympathy. Does he agree that although the evidence about the propensity of small and large companies to invest and thereby increase marginal productivity is a little questionable, a substantial body of evidence suggests that the bulk of employment creation is achieved by small firms?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That is true, but I am not sure whether my hon. Friend is supporting my argument or that of the Financial Secretary.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Perhaps I can assist the hon. Gentleman: the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) is trying to get him into trouble again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I do not think that my colleague is trying to get me into trouble--you, Mr. McWilliam, might be, but that is a different matter.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry makes an interesting point, but if you are looking to small companies to maximise job creation, it would not, according to the principles of theoretical economics on maximising welfare, be necessary to bias commercial decisions between labour-saving capital investment and increased labour inputs. It is extraordinarily perverse if the object of the clause is not economic optimisation but simply the maximisation of employment generation by small businesses, because if you want to maximise job creation the one thing you do not do is provide an artificial inducement for higher capital investment. There is, of course, a trade-off between the use of capital and labour, and, in so far as you persuade small businesses to invest more capital, they will employ less labour. They will increase labour productivity and output if that substitution is made rationally--it will not be, however, because of the distortions in the Bill--and in many instances that will be a sound and welcome decision by a small business. But to push small businesses, as the Financial Secretary appears to be, to increase substitution of capital for labour to a higher rate than would otherwise apply is profoundly irrational. I do not know whether that is the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry was trying to make, but if it was it was an extremely pertinent one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies (Croydon, Central)</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I gave way to the hon. Gentleman who bears my name; I must give way to him in those circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I wish to make one quick point, although there are many points on which I take issue with the hon. Gentleman. Does he agree that he is taking a short-term view of the capital-labour ratio? By investing in the short term in capital to boost growth, we are boosting company size, and therefore employment prospects, in the long term. The hon. Gentleman's argument does not stack up, other than against a simple static model.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Of course it does; I reject that suggestion. We all know that when a firm seeks to increase output it must make a choice. The hon. Gentleman is, no doubt, familiar with the indifference curve between capital and labour. Various combinations of capital and labour can deliver the same increase in output. The clause aims to push small companies down the indifference curve in the direction of more capital and less labour. That is hardly sensible if the object is, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry suggested, to maximise job creation among small businesses. I shall happily take another intervention from the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) if he disagrees, but I am being forced to deliver almost boringly conventional economics.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> As we are on boring economics, do you agree that the idea is not to move things along the indifference curve but to push them to a different indifference curve? The capital-labour ratio may have increaased, and the overall amount of labour may still have increased. Although it is a waste of time--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I can understand why the hon. Member for Croydon, Central is using the word ``you'', but the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, who really should know better, is using the word ``you'' a lot this morning. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Ruskin college studying for my economics diploma and I am enjoying the debate. But I am not involved in it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> It is clear that many investment projects involve both the taking on of new labour and the taking on of new capital equipment. Surely that would be a fairly typical situation, except in a service business--excluding perhaps real estate--that employs almost no fixed capital and, thus, would not be affected. I hope that at this point I can rely on you. Mr. McWilliam, as you are the guardian of the relevance of the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I think that I am following the argument of my hon. Friend, but I am almost indifferent to the indifference curve. Can I direct him back to what I take to be the main thrust of his argument? It seems that the Government are raising the cost of labour in several respects, such as the prospective minimum wage, the social chapter and so on. That will drive companies into investing in plant and machinery.
<P>
Although the Government are introducing a measure that will apparently accentuate that position by giving additional help to capital investment, they have been careful to make it only short term. Instead of thinking in the long term, they are restricting the period to only one year, perhaps in order to minimise the damage that may be caused by a wholesale flight from labour employment into the employment of capital. That would be extremely harmful for the unemployment figures. Is that the thrust of my hon. Friend's argument?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My right hon. Friend has made some germane points. If we are to have some form of advanced depreciation for tax purposes, I agree that the idea of limiting it to one year is unsound. Empirical evidence shows that that will not increase the secular investment rate, which, I presume, is the intention of the Bill. Such a measure will only bring forward that investment.
<P>
In other words, the measure will affect the commercial decisions of companies in relation to time, not in relation to their investment rate or to the rate of substitution of capital for labour. That, in itself, is problematic. If you do not make investment decisions at the optimum time, it is likely that the return on investment will have a negative impact, so you will get less output in future. The Government will, in effect, be contributing to reducing the aggregate productivity of investment, which is another perverse, interesting accomplishment to notch up for the Financial Secretary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Cotswold)</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call Mr. Clifton-Brown, I wish to tell the Committee that too many ``you's'' are flying around the Room. I am trying to encourage members of the Committee, especially new hon. Members, not to get into that bad habit. I must caution the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford: will he try not to encourage members of the Committee into developing habits that could get them into trouble in the future?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I refer to one of the effects of the distorting mechanism of accelerating the normal business decisions to invest in capital allowances. Given that that measure will be aimed specifically at small businesses, does my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford agree that some of those businesses may become over-geared as a result of taking decisions on an accelerated basis, which will weaken their balance sheets? The clause will not result in the long-term growth that was intended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. It is generally true that the small businesses that are being targeted by the clause are often run by entrepreneurs who are trying to do many things at the same time. The entrepreneur is his own chief engineer, his own designer, his own chief marketing man, his own chief finance officer and so on. Such businesses, which are clearly not managed professionally, are much more likely than others to make professional mistakes. They are more likely, therefore, to be carried away by the blandishments of 50 per cent. capital allowances and to do foolish things.
<P>
Some business men may consider 50 per cent. capital allowances to be so attractive that they would make an investment that they would otherwise not have made for a year or two--or even at all. They may have to take on much debt to finance that investment, but they may not calculate whether the cost of the debt would be less than the prospective return. The risk is that the prospective return would not be achieved. By increasing financial leverage, they will have increased the volatility of their earnings, thereby increasing their companies' vulnerability in a downturn and making their collapse more likely.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Following the inducements of the Labour Government, those business men will have undermined the solidity of their businesses. Following that logic--[Interruption.] The Financial Secretary laughs, but the logic is not mine; I simply draw a logical conclusion from the important contribution by my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown). The only possible conclusion is that the provision will undermine the solidity of those small businesses that are seduced into allowing their commercial decisions to be so influenced, thereby leading to a higher bankruptcy rate than would otherwise be the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey (Kingston and Surbiton)</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I shall give way first to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey). He has been trying to catch my eye, and it would be unfair not to allow the Liberal Democrats the chance to make their contribution to this important debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. Has he considered what might lie behind the clause and what drives the Government's philosopyhy? Does he recall that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, when he was Shadow Chancellor, made a famous speech about the importance of the theory of neo-classical endogenous growth, written by Edward Balls, a former colleague of mine? Perhaps the time-limited capital allowance for small business is meant to encourage the take-off that new economic theory.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman has read the new endogenous growth theory. However, it does not apply to clause 43.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I am not familiar with that title, Mr. McWilliam. I think that I would find neo-classical endogenous growth theory rather attractive, but I would not talk about it much in public, although this might be the exception.
<P>
I was upset to hear that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), the Shadow Chief Secretary, is indifferent to indifference curves. I was extremely worried about that. I do not know whether he means that indifference curves are not a useful tool in economic analysis, or whether he is indifferent to the results of the biasing of such a curve by the provisions in the Bill, which would be unfortunate. That subject, however is germane to the impact of the clause on small companies, in so far as small companies are effectively biased in substituting capital for labour. Not only would there be sufferers, but people who might otherwise enjoy employment in those firms would find that there was no demand for their labour, so their jobs would not be created, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold suggested, the company might as a result find itself taking on a great deal of gearing, much debt. That might result in the jobs of the remaining employees in that business being negatively impacted.
<P>
Such discrimination is presented as being in favour of small companies, but it might greatly operate against small companies and, specifically, aginst the interests of their employees. Surely, it is right for hon. Members to consider not ony the interests of shareholders but the interests of people. Far more people are employed by small companies than hold shares in them. I hope that we have demonstrated that the clause is extremely negative and potentially damaging to the interests of employees in the small business sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My hon. Friend has professional experience in the City. Does he agree that the logical conclusion of my previous intervention is that companies are generally ill-advised to take commercial decisions purely for tax reasons? The clause is a distorting measure. It is better that companies should take such decisions for purely commercial reasons. The acceleration of capital allowances is generally bad, and the money deployed in the clause would be better deployed elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I agree whole-heartedly with my hon. Friend. As I always advised my clients when I was in business, a tax break does not make a bad business decision into a good one. A tax break's apparent attractions are such that sometimes even cool-headed people, who ought to know better, will be seduced into making the wrong business decision. I hope that, during my business career, I was reasonably consistent in giving that advice, but--I say this against myself--I remember that by far my worst personal investment decision was tax driven. I breached the principle when I invested in a lousy business expansion scheme which got nowhere at all. To be honest, I did it only because the then Labour Government were charging me about 83 per cent. marginal tax. I thought that the investment would not be a bad idea, even though the risk was high, because 83 per cent. of it was being borne by the Labour Government.
<P>
That illustrates the principle that the distortionary effect of such discriminatory tax legislation is greatly increased when tax rates are high. Luckily, as a result of 18 years of a good sound Conservative Administration, tax rates have steadily decreased. It follows that the negative economic consequences of measures such as we are discussing, are--although serious, and well worth discussing at length--not quite as bad as they were under the previous Labour Government or as they will be, I fear, when the current Labour Government have begun to jack up tax rates, contrary to all their election promises. When that happens, the biases will be even more distortionary and damaging to the economy for exactly the reason that my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold suggests.
<P>
I repeat that small businesses are much more likely to be influenced by the superficial attractions of a tax break than larger, more professional businesses, which perform complicated cost-of-capital and discounted-cashflow analyses and which are therefore less liable to overestimate the advantages of tax concessions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am interested in what my hon Friend says about companies deliberately acquiring assets soley for tax purposes. He refers to an era when tax legislation was such that it was worth buying equipment to avoid paying 83 per cent. tax. Does he agree that, at that time and for many years afterwards, manufacturing companies--especially smaller ones, which are the subject of the clause--created tax losses for themselves, despite remaining profitable? That merely engineered the creation and growth of the leasing industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I totally agree with my hon. Friend. The idea that intelligence and management time should be devoted to the creation of artificial tax losses is deeply offensive both to common sense and economic science--we do not want such a society.
<P>
In the confusion of the moment, I may have made a historical error, for which I hope that I will be forgiven. I mentioned that I made an unfortunate and mistaken BES investment, but I realise that that could not have been under the previous Labour Government, although in those days I had a marginal tax rate of 83 per cent. even on a relatively modest salary. I made my investment under a Conservative Government, when we were in the process of bringing down marginal rates. Marginal rates were then at 60 per cent., which was still far too high, at least for someone as weak-minded as myself, who found himself wrongly tempted into making an investment that otherwise he would never have made.
<P>
The Committee will realise that I speak about the distortionary impact of arbitrary and discriminatory tax breaks with some passion because of personal experience. I have great sympathy with those who may, if they pursue the logic of the Financial Secretary's proposals as enshrined in the Bill, be seduced into undermining their own interests, their business interests and the future of their employees--incurring external opportunity costs by eliminating the prospect of hiring additional people who might otherwise have been hired.
<P>
To sum up, the clause will have a triple distortionary effect. It will have an effect on the structure of industry--[Interruption.] I am sorry, Mr. McWilliam, were you calling me to order?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No, the Clerk was giving me some very useful advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I hope that the Clerk was not advising you to interrupt me again, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. No, I usually do that on my own account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> You see, Mr. McWilliam, you have made me so jumpy that every time that I see you rise six inches in your Chair, I feel that I must immediately sit down. Otherwise, I may compound whatever offence I have committed by not responding rapidly enough to you. It is difficult for us poor mortals who have to serve under your chairmanship. I hope that you may give us some sympathy in your private thoughts from time to time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Serving under my chairmanship is not a strange experience for the hon. Gentleman--he has done so several times before--and I have every sympathy with him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> If I can sum up, Mr. McWilliam, the Bill will produce three important distortionary effects. I do not know whether the Government have taken them fully into account and decided that they are desirable, whether they have not properly considered them or whether they have simply not given themselves the time to consult with those who may be affected--a theme to which we have legitimately been forced to return in debate on almost every clause of the Bill so far.
<P>
However, the fact remains that it is likely that, in so far as the Bill will increase the investment rate in plant and capital in small businesses above the optimum, it will artificially reduce the creation of jobs. That is a curious thing to do, and the Government are doing other foolish things, such as imposing the windfall tax to finance a welfare-to-work programme that will involve the creation of artifical jobs elsewhere in the economy. Why prevent existing small businesses--the businesses targeted by the clause--from generating viable, economically rational jobs and spend a lot of money, taken from successful large companies by the windfall tax, to create completely artifical jobs elsewhere? I do not ask that question rhetorically; I would be only too happy if one of the Labour Members sitting in complete silence were prepared to volunteer an answer, but answer comes there none, and answer can there be none.
<P>
As I have already mentioned, the Bill also introduces an artificial bias into corporate structure, which makes no sense. Some people who may have already claimed a capital allowance at the rate of 50 per cent. will find themselves deterred or disbarred from making a business arrangement with others that they might otherwise have made. If such opportunities are lost for only a few months or even a few weeks, they may be lost permanently, causing permanent damage. [Interruption.] Is the hon. Member for Croydon, Central seeking to catch my eye, or was that simply a hand gesture?
<P>
I hope that it will not be said that that point is entirely artificial because, as I said, a delay in such a transaction of only a few weeks or months can often result in the opportunity being lost for ever. That may ultimately be seen to have been a sad and regrettable moment in a company's history. I do not see why it should be our business in this place to try to place pressures on businesses not to engage in inter-business relationships or transactions that they might otherwise consider rational.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is another bias: if small businesses increase their investment rate, the first distortion to which I referred will apply; if they do not, they will simply bring forward their investment spending into that particular year. You have to ask, Mr. McWilliam--

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not need to ask anything. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to Standing Order No. 41 which deals with repetition. He really ought to watch it; he is coming awfully close.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I remember that Standing Order, and I hope that I was not guilty of repetition, but I should be especially insulted to think that I was being tedious.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. No, I shall apply that Standing Order when the hon. Gentleman is becoming tedious, but repetition is not in order when it is persistent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I certainly take your advice very strictly, Mr. McWilliam. That is why I shall immediately deal with a matter that I have not yet mentioned: The economic impact of the clause. Let us suppose that the clause causes small businesses to bring forward their expected investment in plant and equipment to the current financial year, rather than spending it over a number of years. Logically, that is inevitably what they will do with their existing or expected level of investment, irrespective of whether or not the clause will cause them to increase their rate of investment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Some minutes ago, the hon. Gentleman said that he was introducing his concluding remarks. We are, in fact, debating time-limited legislation. Can he advise us on how long his concluded remarks will be? Will they be longer than the period for which the tax break is in operation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I am sorry, but the hon. Gentleman has not been listening to me. I do not want to repeat myself--otherwise, I should be in trouble with you, Mr. McWilliam--but I made it absolutely clear when I began my speech that I wanted to deal with the distortionary effects of the clause on business behaviour. I summarised the three categories of such effects; I shall not repeat them otherwise, I shall be in trouble. I said that I wanted to consider the impact on the economy as a whole. So I made the reasonable move from the micro--the impact on small businesses themselves and the structure of business--to the macro, the impact on the economy and aggregate demand of the behaviour of the small businesses that will be affected by the clause. I hope that the hon. Gentleman understood what I said.
<P>
I shall ask a question which I shall endeavour to answer. What would be the impact on the economy if small businesses were to bring forward into the current financial year investment which they might otherwise defer, or more naturally undertake, at some future date? Indeed, what would happen if they were to undertake more investment than they would normally carry out, which we have already agreed would be irresponsible, as a result of the seductive appeal of the 50 per cent. capital allowances?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Another thought has just occurred to me on the subject of accelerated capital allowances. Given that suppliers of capital equipment take some time to gear up, is not one of the possible effects of encouraging small businesses to accelerate their capital expenditure that they are likely to suck in imports? I say that because small businesses can spend their money only on the products of foreign companies which have such equipment readily available for the world market.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Mr hon. Friend is absolutely right. There can be only two possible consequences--or a mixture of both--of an increase in demand for plant. One is that the domestic suppliers' orders of the relevant plant and equipment will increase; the other is that imports will increase. If imports increase, a number of foreigners will no doubt be happy. But what will happen if there is increased demand on domestic order books? That depends on the extent to which domestic order books are already full, but it is likely to increase any tendency to overheat that exists in the capital goods sector of the economy and to lead to price rises. The question is whether the economy is overheating.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold, unknowingly, but with uncanny intuition, brings me exactly to the point that I was about to make when I pointed to the Red Book, which is on the Table to guide us throughout our proceedings. At every clause, we should look at the Book to see the impact of the provision on the macro economy. I know that you have read that Book, Mr. McWilliam, so you and members of the Committee who have read it in considerable detail will know that the Government are concerned about overheating in the economy. At present, consumer spending is increasing by 4.5 per cent. and investment spending by 6 per cent., yet the capacity of the economy to expand output is reckoned by the Government--and who am I to argue--to be 2.25 per cent. per annum. How can you have consumer and investment spending increasing by 4.5 per cent. and 6 per cent. respectively, yet capacity increasing by only 2.25 per cent?
<P>
There are several things that might be done. Imports might be increased and exports reduced, so that the net export sector takes the slack, but, of course, net exports are only 20 per cent. of gross national product, so there is limited scope there. The Government could greatly reduce their spending, but they are not doing so by very much. The public spending round is already regarded as being very tight, so there is not much scope there. Alternatively, there might be spare capacity in the economy, so that demand for both capital goods and consumer goods and services rises faster than the sustainable trend rate of growth of the economy. But we know from the Red Book that the output gap is now regarded as being at or close to zero.
<P>
What will be the effect of the clause on driving small business to increase its investment rate on the macro economic equilibrium as set out in the Red Book? We are already suffering from overheating, and we shall suffer from some more. Nothing could be more perverse than causing small companies to bring forward now, at a time of overheating, investment expenditure, which left to themselves naturally they might have undertook in the future? Small businesses will spend their money on plant and equipment now and there will be a sudden falling-off, like falling over a cliff, at the end of the financial year, when they will not be buying anything.
<P>
Let us consider the other measures that are being taken not by the Chancellor--I wish they were--but are being forced on the Bank of England as a result of the Chancellor's failure to rein back consumer spending. The most notable is the rise in interest rates, which I am sure will continue, and the appreciation of sterling which is crowding out demand for British exports. The effect of that could produce a considerable recession in this country in the next year or two. There could be a considerable recession in investment spending, too. Logically, it would be much more sensible if the clause applied not in the current financial year, but two or three years down the line, to persuade people to hold off spending at a time of great demand pressures and potential overheating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My hon. Friend has hit on the precise point. When Norman Lamont, a former Chancellor, introduced similar acceleration of capital allowance measures, it was done at the bottom of a recession. That is the time to stimulate capital expenditure, ready for the right time in the cylce when demand picks up. By stimulating advance capital expenditure when the demand cycle is at its peak, small firms may find that when their capital expenditure comes into effect in increased production, demand is considerably reduced and interest rates, which they have incurred in borrowing to meet their capital expenditure, have been considerably increased. Therefore, such companies will face a double whammy of having made the wrong decision at the wrong time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. While there is a little break, may I apologise to the Committee? I referred to Standing Order No. 41, but the number has changed in the new book. It is now Standing Order No. 42 and it may interest the Committee if I read it. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Speaker, or the chairman, after having called the attention of the House, or of the committee, to the conduct of a Member who persists in irrelevance, or tedious repetition either of his own argument or of the arguments used by other Members in debate, may direct him to discontinue his speech.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is a yellow card to all members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That means that I must limit my comments on my hon. Friend's intervention to saying that it was a powerful endorsement of my argument. I know you were listening extremely carefully to me, Mr. McWilliam, and I think that you will agree that every word that I pronounce and every thought that I express will be a new one and therefore, I hope, worth listening to--especially by Labour Members, who have something to learn on the matter. There are those who believe that Governments have such superior wisdom as to be able to intervene, in an attempt to smooth the trade cycle, by effective counter-cyclical monetary or fiscal policies. There are those, on the other hand, who believe that no Government can second guess the trade cycle and that intervention in that discretionary fashion is likely to increase rather than reduce the volatility of the economy.
<P>
The Government have framed the clause in such a crazy fashion that it cannot be justified on either principle. They are intervening in a discretionary fashion to encourage small businesses to bring plant and capital spending into the current financial year at a time when, by the Government's own admission, the economy is overheating. They are therefore intervening pro-cyclically. I am sure that I am right to emphasise that point because the clause is an interesting historical text. There have been many examples in this century of appalling Government mismanagement in Latin America and eastern Europe, but I do not know of a G7 Government--a Government in a civilised, rational country--who have attempted to intervene pro-cyclically. Whether it is accepted or not, the clause should be lifted from the Bill and placed in economic text books as an example of a Government deciding to take advantage of overheating in the economy--overheating not by my analysis but by their own--to try to coerce the small business sector, with extraordinary disregard for the human consequences of casualties in the sector, by intervening pro-cyclically. The clause will enhance an already apparent overheating and thereby enhance the recessionary impact of a future downturn, because investment that might otherwise have been forthcoming will have been anticipated and brought forward.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman misrepresents the situation because Britain is suffering from chronic undercapacity due to underinvestment. The overheating is on the consumption side and there is inadequate investment to deal with that increased consumption. The strategic solution to that problem is to increase the capacity of British industry. The clause therefore seeks to encourage productive capabilities to meet higher levels of consumption; when the hon. Gentleman talks of capital-goods overheating, he is therefore missing the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam--this is a genuine point of order; I seek your guidance. Am I allowed, without terminating my speech, to advance to the small table in the middle of the Room to pick up the Red Book, leaf through it and respond to the hon. Gentleman's comments? If he looks at the figures on the state of the economy, he will see that investment is buoyant--the figure of 6 per cent. that I gave earlier is correct. I shall read a passage in which the Government themselves acknowledge that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I can assist the hon. Gentleman. He has again managed to drift close to the subject of the 50 per cent., without referring to small companies. Will he drift back into order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The passage that I wish to read--and it is so apposite to my response to the hon. Gentleman that it will benefit the whole Committee if I quote it--is paragraph 3.46 of the Red Book, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``total business investment is forecast to grow by 9&#188; per cent. in 1997 and 6&#188; per cent. in 1998.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>On the Government's own admission, business invesment is extremely buoyant. In those circumstances, it is extraordinary that the small business sector should be encouraged not only to over-invest, but to over-invest at this time. 
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I can hear the clock chiming, and I have no desire to stretch your patience unduly, Mr. McWilliam. However, I hope that my small contribution has drawn the Government's attention to some of the obvious anomalies in the clause. In future, I hope that they will think much harder before introducing discriminatory legislation of this type, whether it is targeted at the small business or any other sector of the economy. They may appreciate that what looks like a gift may turn out to be poisoned. It is a case of ``timeo Danaos et dona ferentis'', if I may be allowed to use a foreign phrase. I feared that you, Mr. McWilliam, might have ruled me out of order for doing that, but that motto might reasonably be applied to the clause.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. For the benefit of the Committee, I inform hon. Members that the Chairman must understand what is being said. The hon. Gentleman was quite in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The quotation roughly translates as, ``I fear the Greeks even though they come bearing gifts.'' Carrying gifts might be the more literal translation of dona ferentis.
<P>
Small businesses should approach the Government in the way that the Trojans were urged to encounter the Greeks. Small businesses should realise that what looks like an attractive gift may lead them to take decisions that will be damaging to their individual businesses and to the economy as a whole.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall be brief but, first, I wish to say how much the Committee enjoyed the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford. As a Member of Parliament, he is unlikely to attract an 83 per cent. tax rate. Under the new arrangements, he would not quite reach that point. Nevertheless, we understand why he is a top earner. If he were an hourly-paid lawyer, he might earn more.
<P>
I would not advise my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford or my other hon. Friends to oppose the clause for a number of reasons. The simplest reason is summed up by the remarks of my mentor, the late Iain Macleod, who I have quoted before, if not in Committee. In his characteristic fashion, he once said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I would not shoot even a one-legged Santa Claus.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Even in my wildest moments, I would not wish to suggest that the Financial Secretary was a Santa Clause--let alone a handicapped one.
<P>
We are grateful for the concession to small businesses, and I say that as a small business person. Despite the fears that my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford expressed on my behalf, I hope that I will be able to take rational business decisions and will neither be tempted unnecessarily by the Government's offers nor reject them when they are sensible and available. However, I fully understand the criticisms that my hon. Friend outlined. They were of interest to the Committee, and I look forward to the Financial Secretary's reply.
<P>
My concern is with the deadweight cost of the measure, and that point has not yet been developed sufficiently. Many businesses will invest in the normal course of events and as part of their rational decision-making processes, and will then find that they receive an uncovenanted--I will not say unwanted or unwelcome--acceleration of their capital allowances. I find myself in that position and it is proper to declare an interest. Perhaps alongside the category of those who have been introduced but are not members of the Committee, such as the Daventry mother, we could record the Daventry tractor which is due to be bought for my farming business in the course of the year. Unless I have misread the detailed provisions or my accountant is falling down on his job, I am quite sure that I shall be able to incorporate this major purchase, which was already intended. As the cardinals would say, it was in pectore, if I may be allowed to use a classical phrase. It was inside but had not yet been announced. It will take place and I shall benefit from the capital allowances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> My hon. Friend is being very frank with the Committee and revealing a personal interest in the clause, and I feel that I should therefore do the same. I have just bought a grasscutter which I would almost certainly not have bought this year but a year or two hence had it not been for these 50 per cent. capital allowances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps I can assist the Committee. In one sense, we all would have to declare an interest in the clause because we all have the benefit of certain schedule E allowances on our office costs and secretarial allowances. As it would be impossible to find someone to chair the Committee who did not have the same interest, I consented to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is very perceptive of you, Mr. McWilliam. The point of these exchanges is simply to consider the various situations and possible responses. My hon. Friend has accelerated expenditure. I might have been about to undertake expenditure anyway, and if the Government want to give me a cash flow advantage and a slight benefit in the form of an accelerated capital allowance, I shall not turn it down.
<P>
The question for the Committee to ponder is whether the price is worth paying. It is a heavy price in terms of the complexity of the system. My judgement is that, within the overall context of Government policies, it is acceptable. We shall get by this period without undue complications, although there will be problems at the margin as my hon. Friend pointed out. Therefore in small terms, we should be grateful for it. I hope that it will not be a long-term strategem, but I also hope that it will not be seen as an expedient for papering over some of the other rather less palatable things that are being done to business by the Government. The increase in VAT which we touched on earlier imposes significant costs on business. The increase in stamp duty, to which we will be turning later, also imposes significant costs on the business.
<P>
My criticism of the Government is that they are sometimes given to gesture politics. Perhaps gesture is in the nature of politics. Given that this is a gesture which will not hugely affect behaviour and will not transform the British Economy, not even that of small businesses, and in so far as it is a friendly gesture, we should accept it. But in so far as it remains only a gesture, we remain sceptical about its overall effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I wish to address some of the brief comments by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. He managed to compress them into just over an hour. It is good to see him here today after his absence last night. We missed him very much, although as we approached the hour my feelings began to change. His first point was that this was a discriminatory piece of tax. It is; that is the point. We are discriminating in favour of small businesses to bring forward investment, forward growth and forward employment opportunities. As has been pointed out, in terms of gearing for employment, small businesses are much more efficient producers.
<P>
Despite what has been said about perfect economics and that what we want is some sort of optimal result that does not necessarily mean a distortion in favour of labour, the community, who have whole-heartedly elected this new Government, believe that it would be a good idea to get people into jobs. People in jobs can contribute instead of descending into crime and the social problems related to unemployment. The theoretical indifference curve mentioned by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford is, to some extent, a matter of judgment and expressed preference by the House. The discrimination is intentional.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that discriminatory benefit was given to small rather than large businesses. That is not unusual. Under a progressive taxation system, companies that made more money would be taxed more. The amount of differentiation and discrimination is a matter of political judgment. That is right and proper. In the short term, we are rightly discriminating in favour of small businesses. It was suggested that such a policy would lead to the disaggregation of businesses. The prospect of ICI breaking up into hundreds of small businesses to enjoy a one-year tax allowance is absurd. That is what you suggested.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> ``The hon. Gentleman suggested.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman suggested it--you would never suggest that, Mr. McWilliam. The suggestion that businesses would disaggregate to obtain the allowance is ridiculous.
<P>
The hon Gentleman claimed that the provision would deter the growth of small businesses because they would no longer benefit when they outgrew the specified size. That does not stand up to scrutiny. Big companies were not born large; they developed from small companies, or an aggregation of small companies. Large companies benefit from economies of scale, and they receive competitive advantages on several purchasing opportunities and various costs. A small company that is given a hand up will not forego becoming a big company for a one-year benefit. The provision will not act as a deterrent, but if it did, it would do so for only a year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman's point is valid, but does not apply to the margins. Tax policy affects the economy at the margins. A company that has 250 employees and relies on that to qualify for the higher capital allowance might like to engage another employee. However, it did that before the end of the relevant accounting period, it could lose &#163;500,000 of tax allowances. Therefore, the employment of an extra person would be delayed. The provision will affect commercial activity at the margins.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I agree. The marginal effect will have a long-term impact. The point about the capital-to-labour ratio was correct: in the short term, there is a bias towards capital investment. Over time, the balance will return to the market norm. We intend to pump prime growth, which leads to more employment in the long term. 
<P>
The trivial examples of the tractor and grasscutting machine are all very well, but it is a good idea for people who have decided to effect a rational concept to increase productivity and capacity in the economy earlier than they would otherwise do that. That will increase employment earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I do not seek to upset the hon. Gentleman's argument, but it can be viewed only in the context of the overall pressures on the economy. There may be circumstances in which severe pressure of overheating already exists. In such cases, it may not be sensible to accelerate investment artificially but to allow it to take place naturally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> We have had exchanges on the conflict between overheating, consumption, investment and the overall capacity of the economy. We believe that it would be useful to increase the capacity of the small business sector to enable it to produce more. It is a one-year allowance. The idea that it would spin the economy into overheating is false. In sharp contrast, the suggestion that it is gesture politics, and will have a marginal impact reveals a divergence in our expectations of the significance of the change.
<P>
The example of an entrepreneur who takes this opportunity and rushes in with a rash investment was given by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford who said that such ideas would already have been formulated within a business plan, that it would not be a case of someone thinking, ``Oh no, I have got to do something rash''. No doubt some people will take rash business decisions, but I suggest that people who are susceptible to taking such decisions will not last long in any case.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On the point about the capital allowance for gearing a small business perversely creating debt, it seems odd that reducing the cost of capital to a small company will somehow mean that its debt will be higher than it might otherwise have been. Presumably what will happen is that it will buy the capital machinery that it intended to buy anyway at a lower cost, which reduces its debt, or it just introduces new ideas that it could not afford before. If you go one step further, obviously you would have to be a fairly unstable investor--
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb</B><I> rose--</I><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman gives way, I say that I am not going any step further than lunch at 1 o'clock. I call Mr. Gibb.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman may have missed the point of the intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford. It is linked to the matter to which the hon. Gentleman has just referred, that he would find it difficult to envisage circumstances in which a small business would purchase a piece of equipment soley because of this relief. Experience shows that, previously, when there were high capital allowances, companies purchased unnecessary equipment. Shining new printing equipment would suddenly arrive in the printing works, and the purchase of such equipment did serious damage to the business simply because it took on too much debt to fund the purchase of that equipment, and was thus driven into bankruptcy. That was the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold was making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The time-limited, one-off nature of the proposal means that that is not relevant to this initiative. Businesses will have a one-off opportunity to bring forward plans for capital investment that they cannot yet afford so that companies can grow more quickly. It is a re-phasing of business management.
<P>
Many Opposition Members want to speak and some people have taken more time than they might have done, so I shall not, like some hon. Members, run through a list of ideas embracing Trojans, Greeks and seduction, but just sit down and let others contribute.
<P>
<b>Several hon. Members</b> rose--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I call another hon. Member, may I say that I have been very tolerant but it is time to close down a bit and to consider what the clause is actually about. It defines a small company; but there is a danger of hon. Members creeping back to discussing the 50 per cent. argument, which was relevant in the previous clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I take your advice very much to heart, Mr. McWilliam. Part of the problem with our debate on clause 43 is that clause 42 deals with the principle and clause 43 with the mechanism.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Clause 42 deals with the principle, clause 43 deals with small companies, the definition of a small company and how it is accounted for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Exactly, Mr. McWilliam. It is very difficult to discuss the mechanism without also referring to the principle.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are about to have the same problem again. We are discussing not the principle or the mechanism but what is or what is not a small company for the purposes of this part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Precisely, Mr. McWilliam. That is exactly the point that I was coming to, because the problem with the effect of clause 43 is that it breaches two of Adam Smith's general principles of taxation, it--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman has a problem with the text of clause 42, because according to his argument that certainly breaches two principles of Adam Smith's theories, but clause 43 does not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> As you rightly said, Mr. McWilliam, clause 43 applies to small businesses. One of Adam Smith's dictums was that a measure should not be arbitrary in its effect. By merely applying to small businesses, clause 43 is. The question of where we pitch the definition for small businesses is most important. We could equally argue that a small business is one to which the small rate of corporation tax applies. It depends on what the measure aims to achieve.
<P>
In general, I accede to the principle of having the lowest possible rates of taxation with the lowest number of tax breaks. I do not especially like measures that favour small businesses, although I must declare an interest in that I am a small business man--a farmer. Like most hon. Members, I shall take advantage of these provisions. However, that is not to say that we are not elected to Parliament to look after Adam Smith's generality of taxpayers, to consider what is best for them and for long-term security and growth, and to seek an increase in employment in the economy. That seems to me to be the primary purpose for which an hon. Member is elected to this place, and we should uphold the highest possible principles.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that clause 43 breaches yet another good rule of taxation--which is that taxation law should be clear and unambiguous? I refer my hon. Friend to clause 43(2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``For the purposes of section 22, capital expenditure is capital expenditure incurred by a small business if it is incurred by a business for the purposes of a trade (the `first trade') carried on by that business; and were the first trade carried on by a company (the `hypothetical company') in the circumstances set out in subsection (3) below, that company would qualify as small or medium-sized in relation to the financial year of that company in which the expenditure would be treated as incurred.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Does not my hon. Friend agree that that is extremely bad syntax and, frankly, unintelligible?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. As was pointed out to me yesterday, it is a tautological inexactitude. It would be useful if one or two of the general practitioners on our side of the Committee were to contribute to the tax rewrite and see whether we cannot write some of these clauses in plainer English. I urge Ministers and officials involved in drafting financial legislation to bear in mind that all they do by making clauses more complicated is give more work to tax advisers and other professionals.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Perhaps I can assist the hon. Gentleman. The parliamentary draftswoman is sitting beside me. She tells me that she will see the hon. Gentleman outside afterwards.
<P>
<B>Mr Clifton-Brown:</B> I shall be happy to meet the parliamentary draftswoman at any time to discuss the clause. I am sure that we shall be able to make mutually acceptable progress.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> My hon. Friend's tone is a little out of place. As I understand it, he has a date.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I do not want to be tempted too far down this road, Mr. McWilliam, for fear that you would rule me out of order on the ground that I was bringing the Committee into disrepute, and that sleaze might be involved. After our new leader's dictum this morning, Conservative Members wish to avoid that at all costs.
<P>
I was about to examine the clause in detail. I refer the Committee to clause 43 22A(6). We must decide what constitutes a small business--a line of argument that you, Mr. McWilliam, have tried to bring us back to all morning. I wish particularly to examine whether and when a small business that is in a group of other businesses will be entitled to the relief for which the clause provides.
<P>
I am accustomed to a situation where a partnership often involves a service company running the administrative side of its business. I can imagine circumstances in which the partnership did not qualify as a small business but the service company did. Equally one could envisage the reverse circumstances. I should like to know from the Financial Secretary--if it is she who will reply to the debate; perhaps it will be the Paymaster General, whose presence here is a welcome sight--what would apply, under the proposed new section 22A(6) of the Capital Allowances Act 1990, either where a partnership that was a small business was being serviced by a company that was not, or where those circumstances were reversed. One could envisage, in such a group situation, conflicting decisions on accelerated capital allowances. Perhaps the partnership would want substantial improvements to its office building, which it owned; or the service company might want to add a substantial new purchase to its information technology equipment. The principals of the partnership and the directors of the company would need to study the relevant provision carefully before deciding which option would be better for the business in the long term.
<P>
Another complication that could be thrown up by the scenario that I envisage concerns the accounting year ends. Let us suppose that there were different accounting year ends for the partnership and the service company. If the partnership year end fell on 1 August, would the partnership have 11 months in which to make the necessary decision--given that, as I understand it, the provision comes into effect on 2 July 1997 and ends on 1 July 1998--or would a company with a year end on 1 June have only one month in which to make the decision? The matter, as I have put it, may sound trivial and trite, but to the small business trying to take that decision, it is very important.
<P>
Small businesses heard about the principle in clause 42 and the mechanism in clause 43 only at the Budget. Then they had to begin to make large strategic decisions. It will take many of those businesses some time to consult all their advisers--to see their bankers to arrange finance, to ask their lawyers about the section of the business to which the provision might apply, and to consult their accountants for advice about tax. Anyone who has had anything to do with a small business knows that by the time such advice has been accumulated, many months can have expired. I hope for an answer to the question that I asked yesterday with reference to clause 42; if a small business genuinely wanted to incur expenditure on an accelerated capital allowance within the time frame laid down in the Bill, and had not incurred that expenditure but had made a prepayment on account, would that be acceptable under the clause? That is important and should be clarified.
<P>
I hope that the clause will not lead people to make wrong investment decisions. I remember that in the old days of accelerated capital allowances of 100 per cent.--I appreciate that we are now dealing with accelerated capital allowance of 50 per cent.--some farmers had a barn full of new tractors. They used to send a man in to clean and polish them every few months. Eventually, when the lease ran out, they were obliged to sell them for a loss. Overall, I doubt whether such investment decisions did those businesses any good. I am sure that many small businessmen will welcome the provision with open arms, but I hope that the mechanism in the financial legislation that we are considering will not become the norm. There are better ways to regulate small businesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> My hon. Friend is making some extremely good points. Does he agree that when we had 100 per cent. capital allowances many small businesses, particularly in farming, complained that they were making an insufficient return on capital employed? When one looked at their accounts, one often found that the capital that they were employing was excessive, and the reason for that excessive investment was the distortionary impact of excessively high capital allowances.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> As always, my hon. Friend makes the perfect point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Unfortunately, the hon. Gentleman is debating the principle in clause 42, not clause 43.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Nevertheless, when a small business becomes highly geared to pay for the accelerated capital allowance--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps hon. Members do not understand what I am saying. Whether it is a small business or a large business, whatever decision it takes based on the 50 per cent. capital allowance was debatable under clause 42. Clause 43 deals with what constitutes a small business and how they are accounted for, not with whether it is a good or a bad idea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful for that advice, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
How will the small business acquire the assets that it needs to comply with the Bill's provisions? There is an important debate to be had here. Like other hon. Members, I spend a great deal of time going round businesses in my constituency and I always look at the capital plant and machinery that they employ. I regret to say that one nearly always finds that, particularly in the engineering and specialist manufacturing sectors, that capital plant comes from Italy and Japan. It would be folly indeed if--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are on the principle again. Hon. Members must not persist in trying to have on this clause arguments that should have been made on clause 42.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
I come back to the small business sector, which the clause is intended to benefit and which is specifically defined by the Bill. I return to where I started. One must set thresholds for a small business, and that is where the clause falls down. If one wishes to help the small business sector, the best way to do so is by other means. I urge the Government, instead of making the mechanism in clause 43 of accelerated capital allowances the norm in any future tax-raising scenario, to look at other help for small businesses and, in particular, at offsetting the devastating effects of the uniform business rate. I know, Mr. McWilliam, that you would quickly rule me out of order if I went too far down that line, but one could look at the definitions in the clause and ask the Government some serious questions. How many small businesses are involved in the thresholds that the Government have set in the definitions in subsection (3) out of the total number of small businesses? Why have they set those thresholds? What was the rationale behind setting them? There must have been some particular thinking behind it. Why did the Government come up with 250 employees, &#163;5.6 million of assets and &#163;11.2 million of turnover, because they go quite a long way up the scale of a medium-sized business?
<P>
If one wished to assist particularly the small business sector, there is a much better case for doing so--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The criteria that the hon. Gentleman just cited do not arise from the clause. They are part of the Companies Act 1985, which, being an Act of Parliament, is not debatable under the clause. Parliament has already decided the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Yes, Mr. McWilliam, but subsection (7) refers to section 247 of the Companies Act. I seek your guidance on the matter, Mr. McWilliam. You have advised us all morning that clause 43 specifically defines the mechanisms for small businesses. Is it in order to discuss the thresholds, on which the whole clause 43 seems to be predicated?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is not in order to discuss the thresholds as such. They are part of an Act of Parliament, which has already been enacted and is not being amended. The clause simply controls the way in which small businesses account for that Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> May I seek your guidance, Mr. McWilliam? I have nearly come to the end of my peroration, but this is an important point. Is it in order on clause 43 to debate whether the definition in section 247 of the Companies Act is relevant or whether we ought to have a different one? The general principle of what constitutes a small business seems to me to be germane to clause 43.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It would be reasonable to argue that the criteria may not be the right ones, but not that the definition as it stands is inaccurate or not carried by Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Perhaps I was not being particularly articulate. By defining the thresholds, I was trying to adduce the argument that they were not necessarily the right ones. I hope that that is in order in a discussion on the clause. I see by the fact that you are nodding, Mr. McWilliam, that we are beginning to get there at long last.
<P>
The thresholds are well up the scale of what constitutes a small business. I and my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford have made it perfectly clear that that does not reflect a good general principle of taxation and that it distorts investment decisions. I can, however, see that if one wished to make a case for the proposal, it would relate specifically to small businesses. In that case, however, the thresholds are far too high. By reducing them, one would reduce the costs. That is a much better general principle of taxation.
<P>
I have detained the Committee for too long, but I want to end with one Latin maxim, which is my family's motto: E Labore est Stabilitas--from hard work comes stability. Everything that I have achieved in life has arisen from hard work and I shall continue to work hard on behalf of my constituents.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend, whose dictum I whole-heartedly endorse. My dictum is ``keep plodding''.
<P>
I want to raise three points on the clause, which arise out of subsections (1) and (2)--there are, indeed, only two subsections. Subsection (1) would add new section 22A to the Capital Allowances Act 1990. I want to raise two points about proposed new sections 22A(6) and (7).
<P>
Proposed new subsection (7), which as my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold has just said, defines a small or medium-sized company. It refers to section 247 of the Companies Act 1985. The notes on clauses that we were all given state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Subsections (7) and (8) provide that a company or group qualifies as small or medium-sized if it would do so for the purposes of section 247 . . . of the Companies Act 1985 . . . Broadly, this means that it so qualifies if it satisfies two of the following conditions: . . . turnover not more than &#163;11.2 million . . . assets not more than &#163;5.6 million . . . not more than 250 employees''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That brings me to the essence of my criticism of such tax legislation. The proposals seek to establish a demarcation between a regime that applies to companies that fall within proposed new subsection (7) and those that do not. If one is lucky enough to have a company that happens to fall within the definition, one has a considerable competitive advantage over companies in the same sector or the same geographical location which do not fall within that definition. That can have significant and devastating consequences for businesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The question that I did not share with the Committee--perhaps my hon. Friend and the Financial Secretary would like to reflect on it--is whether, given that there is an element of discrimination built into the clause, there is any danger of legal challenge under European Union competition provisions between one company that is not able to avail itself of the provision and another that is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention. The Financial Secretary shakes her head. From my limited knowledge of European law, I consider that there may be a prima facie case because the provision could be construed as a state-aided grant to some companies, which other companies do not receive. Larger companies that do not fall within the definition in subsection (7) may want to take legal advice on the clause, but, of course, legal action is expensive and may not be worth while.
<P>
I was referring to a great injustice. In my short time in the House I have received correspondence from businesses in my constituency which are worried about similar injustices relating to, for example, the VAT threshold. A cafe in my constituency is registered for VAT, whereas a smaller one up the road is not. As a consequence, the smaller cafe is able to charge lower prices and gets most of the business.
<P>
We are creating yet another distortion in the tax system, which will then create further examples of unfairness between businesses that may be run on similar lines and provide similar services and products. Yet one gains a significant tax-cost advantage that the other company does not. In this day and age, when we are trying to bring about a simplified and fair taxation system, we should not create more distortions in the tax regime.
<P>
I am convinced that in a few months' time I will receive a number of letters about this provision containing examples of the disadvantages and injustices to which I have referred. I am giving a general warning that measures should not be introduced which create an artificial demarcation.
<P>
My second point concerns the definition of business in subsection (6) of proposed section 22A of the Capital Allowances Act 1990. The subsection says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``
`business' means--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<ul><font size=-1>
	(a) an individual; or
</ul>
	<ul>(b) a partnership of which all the members are individuals''.</font>
</ul><p>
It then defines a company as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a company, or an oversea company''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That brings me to a question initially asked by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, to which I hope the Financial Secretary will respond. Does an oversea company mean, as I think it does, a UK branch of an oversea company, so that they will fall within the definition?
<P>
Subsection (6)(b) refers to--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a partnership of which all members are individuals''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That means that a partnership is not included if any of the partners is a company. I refer the Financial Secretary to the well-drafted representations by the Institute of Directors, which has rapidly got to grips with some of the key problems of the Bill. Its representations on clause 43 refer to subsection (6) of proposed section 22A of the Capital Allowances Act and say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Partnerships which include company members cannot qualify as small businesses.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The organisation goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We would have thought that they could have been included, perhaps on condition that the company partners agree not to claim first year allowances for any of their own assets.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Have companies been excluded from the definition because they might try to claim allowances for their own assets? I should be interested to hear the Financial Secretary's opinion. Could not a measure removing that possibility have been included? I should have thought that there would be just as much risk if a series of individual partners was included, because they could also include own assets in first-year allowances. Indeed, there are mechanisms in place in the taxes legislation to prevent that occurring.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The other problem with a strict definition is that, yet again, it prevents companies from qualifying under the legislation just because they fail to fall within the definition in subsection (6). As I have explained in relation to subsection (7), there may be companies which, because of their structure, fail to qualify for the very generous allowances on capital expenditure. They may be competing in an area or a sector with companies that qualify because they are a partnership of individuals, or a company within the definition of subsection (6), and will therefore obtain the benefit of these advantageous provisions while a company with a different structure does not.
<P>
Here we have a second example of a demarcation that will create unfair and unjust distortions in the business world. In the coming months I expect to receive correspondence from businesses in my constituency about the unfairness of the fact that companies or partnerships up the road from them are able to produce a product or supply a service at a reduced price simply because they qualify under the Bill.
<P>
Although we shall not vote against the measure, we believe that it is wrong to introduce legislation that will create distortions and genuinely unjust situations. This is yet another symptom of a rushed Finance Bill--there has been a lack of consultation with business--which has been put in to Committee too hastily. Had the Government consulted the Institute of Directors, for example, they would have been aware of the problems that will be created by the proposed section 22A(6). Had they consulted small and large businesses, they would also have been aware of the injustices that such a demarcation can cause.
<P>
Clause 43(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This section shall have effect in relation to every chargeable period ending on or after 2nd July 1997.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
An accounting period ending on, for example, 31 July would leave only 29 days from the Budget and only eight days from today to complete that capital expenditure, which is a problem. It would have been better to use the words ``beginning on or after 2 July''. If a company happens to have a June year end, it wlll obtain a full year's allowance from the measure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> This is an important point. What would be the position of a company whose financial year ended on 3 July? Would it not have merely 24 hours to complete that expenditure in order to qualify?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. He is right; if a company happened to have an accounting period that ended on 3 July, it would have just one day on which to make the expenditure and obtain advantage from the measure. Some companies have strange times for year ends. For example, retailers will often use the first or the last Sunday in a month so that they can do a stocktake when the shop is closed. That means that the ends of their accounting periods are at slightly strange times.
<P>
It is also worth while having a slightly obscure year end to obtain a cheaper audit--the costs of audits tend to rise around popular year ends because so many audits have to be crammed in. It seems unfair that a company with even a September year end will gain more of an advantage from the provision than a company with an August year end, and it goes on through the calendar.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Like every other Member of Parliament, I have a year end of 31 March.
<P>
<B>Mr Gibb:</B> I am grateful for your intervention, Mr. McWilliam. That means that you would have to effect your expenditure before 31 March 1998, which would give you an eight or nine-month advantage. If, however, you were in competition with a company that had a year end of 30 June, it would have a competitive advantage over you as a result of the clause. That is yet another example of the Bill and causing discrimination and unnecessarily setting business against business.
<P>
There is a more serious point. One wonders with what intention the Government introduced clause 43--as one of my hon. Friends said, it could just be gesture politics. The Government know full well that because a lot of companies will not have much time to purchase equipment before the clause expires, it will not be as costly as they initially anticipated--or as they led the public to believe in the Budget statement.
<P>
What publicity have the Government undertaken to alert companies to the provision? Subsection (2) means that they will have to make such expenditure, or at least contract--as I understand it, the Capital Allowances Act 1990 means that putting in place an unconditional contract determines the date of expenditure for the purposes of that Act. Companies with, for example, an August or September year end will have to set up such contracts pretty soon if they are to benefit from the provision.
<P>
I suspect that there has been no such publicity and that the Government are relying on small companies to be aware of the minutiae of the Bill. But the fact that they are small companies, without large legal or tax departments, means that they will not be aware of it. Many small companies will fail to avail themselves of the provision simply because they happen to have a year end at the wrong time.
<P>
Unfortunately, clause 43 introduces discriminations and distortions into the world of business which will create a number of injustices. A distortion could arise from the definition of small companies, because companies in similar sectors or similar geographical areas to others that are covered by the definition may well not be covered. Another distortion arises from the definition of business--a company may not fall within the definition, and yet may have a business similar to that of a competitor who does fall within it. That will create another injustice.
<P>
Finally, a distortion arises from the purely capricious way in which businesses choose their year ends. The Government's choice of 2 July for Budget day and the clause itself will determine whether, or to what extent, a business benefits from the provision. Companies that have not got their act together may well miss out altogether. It is unfair that companies with a year end of 31 July will not have made the necessary expenditure before the Bill is even enacted. Although the provision takes effect from 2 July, it is odd that a relief will have expired before the Bill that proposes that relief has even passed on to the statute book.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> We have now been discussing for nearly three hours--last night and this morning--a clause that Opposition Front-Bench Members say they support. I do not want to get involved in Opposition Members' internal grief about the clause. I shall take my lead from the hon. Member for Daventry, the Front-Bench spokesman for the Opposition, who welcomed the clause--I cannot remember precisely how long ago--and said that the Opposition would not oppose it.
<P>
A number of questions were asked about the operation of the clause. To recap and to make it clear to the Committee, we are debating the definition of small businesses and the clause provides that the appropriate definition is the definition in the Companies Act 1985. I had thought that that was a small and uncontentious point, but three and a half hours later it is clear that it is not. The clause is a modest measure aimed specifically at assisting small and medium-sized businesses. The Government were delighted that the Federation of Small Businesses welcomed this assistance, albeit only for one year.
<P>
My advice to the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford is, ``when in a hole, stop digging.'' He argued his way round and round the issue of whether the allowance should be made. I was a little perplexed since I thought that his reason for so doing was penance for missing his amendments last night. Those had tried to extend the remit of the clause, which he then described as Armageddon for small businesses. In fact, he was so carried away that the hon. Member for Daventry had to rise to remind the Committee that the Opposition supported the clause.
<P>
I shall try to answer questions as they arise. However, over two days, questions have been repeated by different Opposition Members, so I shall endeavour to answer the questions rather than refer all the time to individual hon. Members.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is fine as long as the hon. Lady answers only once.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am mindful of your ruling, Mr. McWilliam. First, I was asked whether the provision would be challenged under EC rules. I am sure that that is not a serious question: the proposals are applicable to any company within the UK tax net and there is no discrimination against non-UK companies. It is such an important issue that I shall go further and tell the Committee that the European Union has been asking member states to consider special fiscal support for small and medium-sized companies--precisely what we are modestly seeking to achieve in the clause.
<P>
I was asked about company sizes. The Companies Act definition has to be met for the accounting period during which expenditure was incurred. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford was trying to suggest that companies could find themselves beyond the threshold and unable to claim the benefit. He will know that the Companies Act allows a company to qualify if it grows above the set level but is still regarded as small in the first year that it exceeds the limit. Thus it is counted as a larger company only if it exceeds for longer than one year and this provision is a one-year allowance.
<P>
Another question was asked about companies at the margins. The margins are set so that 99 per cent. of all businesses qualify. Are hon. Members seriously suggesting that a business with a turnover of more that &#163;11 million and assets of more than &#163;5.5 million is likely to alter its business plans to obtain one-year relief? The hon. Member for Daventry said that small businesses will approach the proposal rationally and carefully and I am utterly convinced that businesses will make decisions in that way and to their benefit.
<P>
When the debate started yesterday evening the right hon. Member for Wells asked some questions. He asked first about the doubling of the allowances and why that applied only to small businesses and not to all businesses. That is confusing because today, most Opposition Members are against it applying to anyone. It would be very expensive to double the allowance for all businesses and that could not be justified. By restricting it to small businesses we are targeting the assistance where it is likely to do most good.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): On the logic of what the hon. Lady said previously, I agree that there will be little impact on the behaviour of those at the larger end of the definition of small and medium enterprises in the Companies Act 1985. If it will have no effect on companies at the top end of the range, why did not the hon. Lady try to target the relief more specifically at genuinely small companies, such as sole traders and very small companies? The logic of her argument is that she is using an indiscriminate measure which will have no effect on the behaviour of many of those to whom it applies. I am not sure why the Government have not chosen a more targeted scheme.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> That is a similar point to that raised by the hon. Member for Cotswold. The answer is that 3.5 million businesses are covered and no small businesses are excluded unless they are part of a larger group. The measure was aimed at small and medium businesses and it reaches all of them if they decide to use the option provided by the clause.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells wanted to know whether overseas companies would be included if they were members of a larger group, and that was a similar point to that raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. When the parent of the group is a United Kingdom company, all the companies in the group will be taken into account wherever they are situated. When a small or medium company is a subsidiary of an overseas parent, it will be considered in isolation because it would not be worth imposing on businesses the compliance costs involved in establishing the position of an overseas group for the sake of one-year tax relief.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells and the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked about the position of someone who carries on more than one trade in a partnership. All business carried on by an individual should be aggregated when deciding whether it qualifies as small or medium for the purpose of the new first-year allowance. He will not have to count any business carried on with other partners. In the case of a partnership all the business carried on by the same combination of individual partners must be aggregated. Partnerships may ignore activities carried on by separate partners or sole traders.
<P>
The next point raised was dead weight and whether we were carrying more costs than necessary. We looked carefully into the ways in which special assistance could be most effectively given. We considered limiting the doubling of allowances to increased spending, but decided that that would be complicated and would spread the relief too thinly to do any good. That is why we decided to target it on smaller businesses and give new investment to them.
<P>
The next question--raised also by the Law Society--was on what the taxpayer would have to do to demonstrate that he or she was entitled to the 50 per cent. Individuals whose turnover is less than &#163;15,000 a year are allowed to submit to the Revenue a three-line statement of business results. Those individuals would not have to submit anything extra to establish that they qualified. The Inland Revenue will automatically accept those as small businesses. In other cases, businesses must submit accounts to support their returns and those will generally be sufficient to establish the scale of the business. In that case, no extra information would be required.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The hon. Lady may intend to cover this point, but will pre-payments qualify, as I asked yesterday?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Yes. I will come to that point. If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me for a moment, I am trying to work through points raised. I hesitate to say that I am trying to do so logically as the debate did not exactly follow a logical progression, but I will come as close as I can to the points raised by the Opposition.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned unincorporated businesses. I have dealt with that point by saying that the three-line summary submitted to the Inland Revenue will be sufficient.
<P>
Further points were raised about the qualifying period for the 50 per cent., what will count as expenditure and whether payment on account would qualify. The answer to that last point is yes. Any expenditure incurred on machinery or plant during the year ending 1 July 1998 will qualify, and that includes the payments on account raised by the hon. Member for Cotswold. The hon. Gentleman asked also about differing accounting periods. The clause refers to the period when expenditure was incurred, and that is from 2 July for 12 months. That will not be curtailed by the end of a business's accounting year.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked also about service companies and partnerships. A company is considered on its own merits, taking into account the whole group. I have covered that point already. Partnerships will also be considered on their own merits, but the anti-avoidance measure in new subsection (6C) of section 22 of the Capital Allowances Act 1990 will prevent one small business from artificially obtaining the allowance for the benefit of another, larger business. We made sure there to reinforce the targeting.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, during his second contribution to the debate, asked why trusts and mixed partnerships were excluded. Simply, under the criteria in the Companies Act 1985, trusts and mixed partnerships do not fall easily into the relevant group. Incredibly complex rules would be required to bring them in, which would open possible abuses of tax-driven options that the hon. Gentleman would deprecate. I think that I have covered all the points that have been raised about the year ending. The grant will be available from 2 July for 12 months.
<P>
On the subject of publicity, the Federation of Small Businesses knows about the change, and I am sure that it is informing everyone. Accounts know about it and information on obtaining the allowance is available to small businesses. The clause is a modest, helpful boost for small companies, specifically targeted on them to assist in investment in plant and machinery. I hope that the answers that I have given clear up any queries so that the Opposition can support the clause not with a heavy heart but with enthusiasm.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I beg to move amendment No. 52, in page 39, line 29, after `person', insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`other than a relevant person'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 53, in page 39, line 44, at end insert--
<ul><font size=-1>
`(5D) For the purposes of subsection (5A) a relevant person is a company whose relevant accounting period is a period ending on 31st March;
<P></ul></font>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(5E) For the purposes of subsection (5D) ``relevant accounting period'' means the accounting period of the company in which the capital expenditure referred to in subsection (5A) is incurred.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The amendments were tabled in a helpful spirit and we hope that the Government will be minded to accept them or at least to reflect on them and table similar amendments on Report.
<P>
My hon. Friends and I agree with the clause's intention to introduce anti-avoidance measures to prevent the abuse by some finance leasing companies of writing-down allowances--setting up a whole series of subsidiaries with non-conterminous accounting periods, and using those subsidiaries to claim allowances throughout the year.
<P>
While I do not want to be an entrant for the Hartlepool cup for sycophancy, I support the thrust of the clause but believe that the anti-avoidance provisions go too far, perhaps as a result of the haste in which the Bill was drafted. In trying to close loopholes, the clause will have damaging effects on the industry. These are serious amendments and I hope that the Government will reflect on them.
<P>
The problem is that in trying to level the playing field, the Government have tilted the balance the other way. Their intention of trying to prevent tax abuse is honourable but the provisions go much wider. The main theme of the Bill is to encourage investment and to ensure that the tax system does not distort investment decisions, but because the clause goes too far, it may result in reduced investment.
<P>
If one considers how investment is funded by industry, one finds that leasing finance is increasingly favoured by both small and large companies. In 1996, over 37 per cent. of plant and equipment was funded through leasing or hire-purchase arrangements, which amounted to 32 per cent. of all manufacturing investment that year. We are dealing with a huge sector.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the Government are to change the tax regime that applies to company investments, they should at least introduce a level playing field; they should not push companies in any one direction with regard to financing their investment decisions. Companies find leasing, which is the present means of financing investments, an attractive system. Various studies have shown the widespread and effective use of leasing finance. One study that was brought to my attention was by Lasfer and Levis of the City university business school. It showed that many firms--especially small firms--in their start-up phases are significantly reliant on finance leasing. The study showed that foreign companies that directly invest in our country often choose finance leasing because it is the best way to meet their investment demands, and the study goes on to emphasise the key role that leasing finance plays in the development of the private finance initiative.
<P>
I am sorry that the Paymaster General is not in his place--I wanted to urge on him the importance of not going through with the anti-avoidance measures, as the Government propose to do, and to stress the need to accept the amendment or a similar alteration of the clause. That would assist private companies that want to get involved in the private finance initiative. They need to have the flexibility of leasing finance to ensure that they can take part in the PFI, which is a key part of the Government's policy. Other public sector--or near public-sector--organisations that rely on leasing finance will also be affected by the proposal.
<P>
Members of the Committee may have received a letter from Mr. Newman, the director of the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive. In that letter he described the development of the south Yorkshire supertram, which is being financed in large measure by the private sector. There are many schemes to assist the private sector in that process. Mr. Newman said that if the clause is enacted, it will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``effectively eliminate the possibility of implementing the second half of our sale and leaseback plan. This reduced ability to achieve more efficient financing will have a major adverse impact on the four District Councils of South Yorkshire, and thereby create even greater pressures on finance for 1998-99 and beyond.''
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, which I want to allude to further in connection with a later clause. The supertram project--which I know well and often travelled on during my time in Sheffield--is a major environmental improvement project which cost well in excess of &#163;300 million. It was a joint project between the Department of Transport, private finance and local authorities. It will be detrimentally affected by the Budget's proposals. That goes against the spirit of environmental improvement, in which the Budget was supposedly dressed up. We should also bear in mind the attack on the finances of local authorities in south Yorkshire, which are already under enormous strain because of the ACT changes in pension funds, which we discussed previously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, which could be extended: other transport investments will be affected by the clause.
<P>
When in opposition the current Minister of State with responsibilities for the environment, transport and the regions--and, no doubt, for quite a few other matters as well--was keen on promoting leasing in the private railway industry, and rightly so. Members of the Committee should agree that it is important for public sector and public service organisations to have as many ways of financing their investment open to them as possible, and tax legislation should treat them equally. Without the amendment, that may not happen.
<P>
I want to impress on Ministers that we are trying to be helpful. They are right to crack down on the abuse of capital allowances by some leasing companies. Current tax legislation does not produce a level playing field. Leasing companies can set up different subsidiaries to take advantage of capital allowances throughout the year. They have managed to reduce the average delay between incurring expenditure and benefiting from the capital allowance from an average of 15 months, which an owner-user company--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member is going way beyond the scope of the amendment. His comments are more suited to a clause stand part debate. He may continue in that vein, but I will have to take that into account when I consider whether to allow a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful, Mr. McWilliam, for that advice. I was trying to explain how the amendment fits in with the overall thrust of the clause.
<P>
Tax legislation means that the average delay before an owner-user company benfits from writing-down allowances is 15 months. The delay for a leasing company using staggered subsidiaries can be as little as 10.5 months.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The clause will not affect the time delay; all it does is stop companies exploiting a loophole. It ensures that if there is a third of a year left, companies get a third of the allowance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> With respect, Mr. McWilliam, that is the point: the amendment would level the playing field to make the time delay the same for all companies. Without the amendment, there would be an average 21-month delay before a leasing company could claim the allowance rather than the 15-month delay experienced by an owner-user company.
<P>
We have tabled the amendment so that lessors face the same tax regime as owner-user companies making investments. We do not understand why lessors should be the only companies facing the time-apportionment rules. Our proposed common year end for their tax regime will prevent there being a non-coterminous accounting period of a number of subsidiaries of the same leasing company. The amendment is in the spirit of the clause but it avoids the draconian restriction of time apportionment to lessor companies. They should be able--like owner-user companies--to claim a 25 per cent. writing-down allowance in the acquisition year irrespective of the time of the purchase.
<P>
In conclusion, I congratulate the Government for attempting to tackle the abuse, but I urge them not to take a sledgehammer to crack a nut, thereby discouraging possible investment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman answer one query? He said that the amendment would enable companies to obtain a year's allowance. I understand that the amendment--which I have given only a cursory reading--would introduce a single possible accounting period for leasing companies of 31 March. It would not alter the remaining provisions of the substantive clause which restrict writing-down allowances to when the asset was purchased. Am I right to think that, under the amendment, someone who bought the asset on 1 April would get a full year but someone who purchased it on 1 September would get only six months?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I believe that the hon. Gentleman is right. The amendment may be imperfect in that respect. If the Government agree with the hon. Gentleman and they agree with the spirit of the amendment, perhaps they will produce a more workable amendment that would enable a leasing company to receive the full value of the writing-down allowance, but within one common-year-end accounting period. I urge the Government, therefore, to reflect on the amendment. I hope that they respond positively to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am delighted to support the amendment, not least because members of the Committee always enjoy it when a Liberal Democrat Member makes a sporadic appearance--

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> And before lunch.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed, as my hon. Friend points out, before lunch. That may be a record, and we look forward to welcoming back the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton after lunch.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Would my hon. Friend agree that it is odd to see Liberal Democrat Members on the Opposition Benches? Given the new stance of the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown), perhaps the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton should be sitting on the Government Benches.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I suggest that the hon. Member for Ashford does not follow the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton down that road.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed, under your guidance, Mr. McWilliam, I shall not--not least because, to be fair, when Liberal Democrat Members have been here, they have by and large voted with us. For all the problems that the right hon. Member for Yeovil has in mistakenly supporting the Government on some policies, on the Finance Bill, even Liberal Democrats have realised during our proceedings that most clauses are badly drafted, ill thought out and actively damaging. That is why Liberal Democrats have often joined us in voting against Government proposals. The broad thrust of the amendment would improve the clause. Anyone who reads a Finance Bill carefully can distinguish between clauses that relate to Government policy and those which relate to Treasury and Revenue policy. Clause 44 is one of the latter. The Clause serves no purpose for the Government as far as the budget is concerned. I suspect that many of the Government's friends and associates would find its provisions actively damaging.
<P>
I received the letter from the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive--as did the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton and, I am sure, all other members of the Committee--complaining about the extremely damaging effects that the clause's provisions would have on the supertram project. When I found out that that letter had been sent to every member of the Committee, I thought that at last we might hear contributions from Government members because Labour seats and Labour district councils would be most affected by the proposal. When we reach the stage where Labour controlled authorities have to appeal to Conservative and Liberal Democrat Committee Members to protect them from the depredations of the Labour Government, the conspiracy of silence, which has been imposed on the Government Back Benches throughout our debate, is damaging the wider interests of the Labour party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> May I ask the hon. Gentleman, who keeps saying that Labour Committee members are mute, whether he is deaf?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Yesterday I said that no Labour Members had made a contribution. I enjoyed greatly, however, the hon. Gentleman's contribution this morning, although I would welcome another contribution from him later on this specific point. If he is prepared to defend the clause to the South Yorkshire passenger transport executive and the Labour district councils that are involved in that project, I am sure that they--and the Government Front Bench--would be grateful to hear his remarks.
<P>
The amendment is expecially welcome because, as the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton has said--
