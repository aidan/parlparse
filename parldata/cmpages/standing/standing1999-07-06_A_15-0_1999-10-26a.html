<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 324, in page 24, line 23, leave out from `perform' to end of line 28 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`functions in relation to a regulated activity carried on by an authorised person or an exempt person.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 325 to 327.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson, as we begin our deliberations on part V.
<P>
It might be helpful if I explained a little of the background to clause 53 and to this part of the Bill to put our simple amendments in context.
<P>
Essentially, part V provides powers for the Financial Services Authority to exercise a degree of control over people employed by authorised persons. Clause 53 gives the authority powers to prohibit a person from being employed to perform specified functions in the financial services sector. Later clauses require firms to obtain the FSA's approval before engaging staff to perform particular functions. They also give the FSA powers to issue statements of principle, with which approved persons must comply. Finally, they provide it with powers to discipline approved persons who are guilty of misconduct.
<P>
The measures are an important part of the authority's armoury, which will ensure that it can regulate effectively. They mean that it will be able to prevent people who are not fit and proper to perform particular functions—perhaps where they do not meet the required standards of competence—from putting people's money at risk.
<P>
That is not a new idea. Many existing regulatory regimes include statutory arrangements for vetting directors and senior managers. The self-regulating organisations under the Financial Services Act 1986 have introduced vetting and discipline arrangements for employees of investment firms. The council of Lloyd's has introduced similar arrangements under its byelaw-making powers.
<P>
Clause 53 carries forward and improves on arrangements that were provided for under section 59 of the 1986 Act. It gives the authority powers to make orders to prohibit individuals from being employed in the financial services industry. That is an important power if the authority is to achieve its objectives. However, we would not expect it to be used lightly or routinely.
<P>
The clause refers throughout to an individual performing functions rather than being employed. In part, that is necessary because some people who work for a firm, such as its directors, might not technically be employees of the firm. Modern working methods and employment practices mean that many complex and innovative structures exist. Outsourcing is common place. Many people work as freelancers; others work on a temporary contract and might be employed by their agency rather than the place in which they work. Those features of the workplace are as relevant to the financial services industry as they are to any other industry.
<P>
The situation is further complicated by the fact that larger international groups, in particular, structure their business in such a way that their subsidiaries carry out specific but complementary functions. That might involve an employee of one company managing part of the business of a sister company—the term matrix managers is used to describe that arrangement. The provision has, therefore, been drafted so as to be neutral as regards contractual or other relationships between the individual and the firm.
<P>
The Bill will enable the authority to exercise its powers in relation to a firm that carries on any regulated activities. The power to issue a prohibition order will, therefore, need to be sufficiently flexible to apply only to particular regulated activities specified in subsection (3)(a). It does not necessarily follow that someone whom the authority deems not to be not fit and proper to work in derivatives trading, for example, is not fit and proper to sell general insurance, as the two businesses are very different, so a prohibition order covering more than was necessary or appropriate would be excessive.
<P>
An individual may not be fit and proper to carry out certain functions, such as those performed by a chief executive or managing director. However, allowing that person to carry out a different, perhaps more junior function may not be a problem. Subsection (2) therefore enables the authority to specify the functions covered by the prohibition order in the order itself
<P>
Subsection (3)(b) enables the authority to make a prohibition order relating to different types of authorised and exempt people. The FSA may therefore specify that someone subject to a prohibition order may not be engaged to perform relevant functions for a bank or insurance company.
<P>
Factors specified in the clause as currently drafted will enable the authority to make a prohibition order as narrow or almost as broad as circumstances require. An order made under that power may be narrowly defined. However, in the most extreme cases, the FSA may find that so great is the risk to consumers and market confidence that it must make an order prohibiting someone from working in the financial services industry at all.
<P>
I anticipate that such a blanket ban will rarely need to be imposed, but I do not rule out that eventuality altogether, as such a ban is possible and, indeed, has been imposed using powers in section 59 of the 1986 Act. However, in the current drafting of the Bill, it is not clear whether a blanket ban would be possible and, were one to be imposed, whether it its validity would be challenged in the courts. We must address that risk in order properly to protect consumers' interests.
<P>
Government amendments Nos 324 to 327 are intended to remove any doubts about the authority's ability to make prohibition orders banning someone from performing any function in relation to regulated activity carried out by authorised persons. Our amendments ensure that the existing power is carried across to the new regime.
<P>
In seeking to deliver that certainty, we have identified changes that will simplify the drafting of the clause. I am keen to take the opportunity—
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): I apologise for interrupting the Financial Secretary. I would have been happy for him to finish his sentence.
<P>
It has been helpful to have the explanatory notes prior to our discussion of the Government amendments, of which there are several. Given that the Committee will be sitting for some time before and after the Queen's Speech, would it be possible for the redrafted clauses to be published in a booklet? Government amendments will obviously result in clauses being redrafted, and such a publication would make the Bill easier to read in the weeks ahead.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Is the right hon. and learned Gentleman requesting that we consolidate items relating to the Bill that appear periodically into a single document?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I may be able to offer assistance to the Financial Secretary. When the Bill is republished in the new session, it will contain all the amendments that will have been made thus far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson, for your help. However, I believe that the right hon. and learned Gentleman's question related to the explanatory notes to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> No. Let me clarify the matter. We are moving quite fast, so is quite hard to write in all the Government amendments and get matters straight. Therefore, if it is not too difficult, would those assisting the Financial Secretary provide a re-„draft of the clauses that included changes made by Government amendments? That would make the Bill easier to read as our discussions proceed. However, what you say, Mr. Atkinson, may make that unnecessary as 17 November approaches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Indeed. Mr. Atkinson, you understood and dealt with the question better than I did.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am sorry, I did not hear that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Mr. Atkinson understood the question better than I did and I trust that his response covers the matters raised by the right hon. and learned Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am sorry, I am not making myself clear.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> To any of us.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Financial Secretary's predecessor kindly provided such a draft for an earlier clause to which substantial amendments were proposed. When a clause is to be substantially rewritten, especially by interpolation of phrases here and there, it is much easier to discuss the amendments if the clause is written out as amended. It is not terribly difficult to provide that on a sheet of paper, and I should be grateful if it were done reasonably promptly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I now understand the point. I cannot give an assurance that we will do that on every occasion. Although, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman said, that was done for one earlier clause, it was then made clear that we could not guarantee to do so every time. However, I will certainly bear the right hon. and learned Gentleman's point in mind, and we shall be helpful where we are able.
<P>
To conclude, we have taken the opportunity presented by the need to make changes to simplify the drafting. I hope that the Committee will welcome that, and I commend the amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): May I also welcome you back to the Chair this morning, Mr. Atkinson. As we move onto part V and the approved persons regime, I should make clear that the large points of principle will be raised under clause 56. As the Financial Secretary has pointed out, the Government amendments to clause 53 are intended to clarify some potential ambiguity in the existing drafting. I had read the existing draft of the clause as continuing existing arrangements for the fit and proper test, under which the FSA has the widest powers to ban as well as narrow and specific powers. We therefore have no opposition in principle to that being clarified.
<P>
The Financial Secretary rightly made the point that the industry is increasingly flexible, involving many freelance and self-employed individuals, as is necessary in today's age. I am sure that he will understand the problems raised by any threat to that necessary regime. I should, however, stress—as this point relates to other clauses in part V—that the prohibition is purely under the fit and proper test, which is an established and understood doctrine. Whatever the FSA does under clause 53 will be done purely on that count, and does not relate to any other powers that it may seek to assume under part V.
<P>
We are therefore happy to accept the amendments—with, as the Financial Secretary pointed out, the expected proviso that the FSA will use its total ban powers in an extremely cautious and limited fashion and in exceptional circumstances only.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 328, in page 25, line 8, leave out `A' and insert `The'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 330.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> These are both drafting improvements. With amendment No. 328, we are taking the opportunity to correct a point of grammar, replacing ``A'' with ``The''; and amendment No. 330 would standardise the terminology in subsection (4) and make it the same as in subsection (1), which refers to ``making'' rather than ``pursuing'' a prohibition order. I doubt whether these amendments will prove controversial and I commend them to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 329, in page 25, line 9, leave out subsection (3).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 331, 332, 333, 341, 342, 344 and 345.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> When the authority proposes to take action under the Bill, it is initially required to give a warning notice to the relevant person. Thereafter there is a period for representation before deciding whether to proceed with the action and confirm intentions with a decision notice. The standard procedures for warning and decision notices—we have already referred to them in our deliberations—are set out in clauses 338 and 339 respectively: but those procedures are modified and supplemented, as necessary, in the context of the relevant powers.
<P>
For example, if the proposed course of action relates to an intention to impose a penalty, the clause conferring the power to impose that penalty will require a warning or decision notice, which must specify the proposed amount of the penalty. Under clauses 338 and 339, where such notices refer to a third party and any references may be prejudicial to that third party, the FSA is required to provide copies of relevant notices to those other people. Recipients of copy notices then have the same rights as primary recipients to make representations.
<P>
The relevant provisions in part V, including clause 54, currently disapply the clauses 338 and 339 requirement for notice to be given to third parties—or, in clause 64, disapply the requirement when the third party is an authorised person against whom action is being taken under part XIII.
<P>
Initially, we did not believe that third parties would generally be relevant to action taken by the Financial Services Authority under its part V powers. On reflection, however, we concluded that that would not always be the case. For example, in explaining the reasons for the proposed prohibition, the notice might refer to the actions of a colleague or employee in a way that implied criticism, even though the authority did not believe that such a person's conduct justified taking regulatory action against him. We do not want third parties in those circumstances to be deprived of their fundamental rights or of their opportunity to defend themselves if they feel that they have been criticised.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 329 and 331 would make the required corrections to clause 54 in respect of warning and decision notices when the FSA proposes to make a prohibition order. Amendments Nos. 332 and 333 make corresponding changes to the procedure when the FSA decides not to vary or revoke a prohibition order, and amendments Nos. 341 and 342 make similar changes to clause 59, which deals with the notice procedure for approval to perform controlled functions. Amendments Nos. 344 and 345 relate to disciplinary measures against approved persons under clause 64. We shall debate clauses 59 and 64 shortly, but all these amendments deal with the same issue—third party rights. I ask the Committee to support the amendments, which extend to third parties the basic protections given in similar contexts elsewhere in the Bill. We do not think that there is any ground for disapplying those protections, which is what the Bill as drafted does. On that basis, I commend the amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Can the Minister clarify one point? He said that one of the amendments requires the amount of a fine to be specified. Will that be in the Bill, or is it a Pepper v. Hart indication?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It will be in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Which amendment is it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It is already in the Bill: I hope that further information will tell me where in the Bill and perhaps I can then send a note to the right hon. and learned Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): We probably agree that the amendments apparently afford sensible protections to third parties: we know the problems that can arise from an innocent party having connection with a wrongdoer. However, the explanatory notes to amendments which came through only yesterday are perhaps somewhat generously titled, given that they form such a thin document. I am grateful for the Minister's further amplication, but more detailed explanations beforehand would have been of greater help. We put questions to the Minister and intended ourselves to raise the issue of which other third party employees, not to mention employers, will receive notification.
<P>
Can the Minister comment on the public availability of the register of prohibited persons? I know that there has in the past been such a list in the cellars of the regulatory organisations, but can the Minister say how public the FSA intends making the list in future, so that people who have been condemned with a black spot or whatever are set out in black and white, by comparison with those who, by third-party association, may be tainted unreasonably. Will the hon. Gentleman elaborate a little?
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I may be out of order in raising this small point, Mr. Atkinson. Clause 56, which contains some of the amendments now being dealt with, begins by defining an authorised person as ``A'' and later, in subsection (2), A is used a couple of times. Further on, we jog back to the use of ``the authorised person''. It occurred to me that the use of ``A'' may be more confusing than helpful, especially as it does not appear to be carried through. There may be a reason for it. I simply draw attention to it for the consideration of the draftsmen. I do not expect a detailed answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> How does the Minister interpret clauses 338 and 339? Our understanding is that employers are not included in the definition of third parties. We are therefore somewhat surprised that clause 54 does not appear to require copies of the notices to be given to a banned individual's employer. That, to us, would be the first port of call in protecting and informing third parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall return to the point raised by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell) about the amount of a fine. It is covered by clause 64(3) which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A warning notice about a proposal to impose a penalty must state the amount of the penalty.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am grateful for the general welcome that has been given to the amendments. I thought that they would find favour with the Committee. On the question of the status of the register, it will be public. It is required to be public under clause 304. I shall return to the question about employers, but let me respond to the right hon. and learned Gentleman's point about the use of the term ``A''. That interested me too. It is a matter of debate whether referring to an authorised person as ``A'' is helpful or unhelpful in setting out the clauses
<P>
My view would be that to refer to ``A'' in two subsections is all right because the concept has been introduced sufficiently recently for people to follow the argument. There is some benefit in being able to refer to ``A'' rather than to keep referring to an ``authorised person''. It would be confusing if it were continued later on in the clause. There is a virtue in inconsistency here, but I entirely accept that it is a matter for judgment. In communicating complex matters in legislation, sometimes these devices are helpful and at other times they may appear unhelpful.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> For what it is worth, I think that it would be more elegant to drop ``A'' completely and just use English.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am sure that those who are responsible for these matters will have noted the right hon. and learned Gentleman's extremely well-informed view on the subject. For my part, I feel there is some merit in having ``A'' a couple of times in subsection (2) rather than repeating ``authorised person'', but, it is a matter on which individuals differ.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) asked me whether employers would automatically receive a copy of the notice. If a person is no longer employed, as may well be the case, it would not be appropriate to require the FSA to notify the former employer. A prohibition order would probably be publicised and communicated in that way to the employer, where appropriate, and then by inclusion in the register rather than by the device that he suggested. I hope that that covers the point.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> If one thinks about when these things occur, surely if someone who is in the employ of an organisation receives a warning, the organisation would need to know all about it? It goes to the heart of the monitoring process and the approved person regime. The initial notice may turn out to be just a warning notice and may not be followed by an order. The issue of advising employers needs to be dealt with and clarified somewhere in the Bill. It would be nonsense if the most important party had no legal right to know what is going on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Our expectation is that the FSA would be in close contact with the firm in such a situation. It would need to have been in contact in order to make the inquiries that are required. I am not persuaded that a routine copy of the notice is necessarily needed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The Minister makes the case that if someone has left the employ of a firm it is really immaterial. Surely, if it turns out that he left the firm because he had done something wrong within that firm, the former employer should certainly know about it. Secondly, if the FSA has been in close contact with the firm and suspects wrongdoing in the firm itself, it may not be so keen to volunteer information. Surely there should be a statutory duty so that the firm knows exactly what it faces in terms of the penalties that are imposed on individuals which may then relate to it too. It seems slightly absurd that all the employees in the firm may know about this, but those running the firm, the employers themselves who may have the most to lose, do not.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I would not expect that to be the outcome. If everyone in a firm knew what was happening, one could take it for granted that those running the firm would know too. They would be required to be informed of the inquiries that were being made by the authority and the outcome of them. I am not persuaded that a routine copy of the <P>
notice needs to be sent.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham gave the example of a case where a person had left an employer. If an individual was facing a prohibition on the basis of what had happened with his former employer, certainly the employer would know all about it. He would presumably have been party to what the authority was doing. There is no intention here to make it difficult for anyone to get hold of the information, but equally we do not want to add excessive measures to the legislation. Opposition Members' points will be covered by what will already happen.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am not sure whether I am making an intervention or a speech, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think it is an intervention.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Then I shall be brief. Can the Minister clarify the position of the rules which will specify controlled functions? Are there controlled functions under the present legislation that will be carried through, perhaps with some small modification, or are these entirely new rules? If so, have we had a draft of them and if not, when will we see one?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The three conditions are new. Effectively, this is a rationalisation of the patchwork arrangements that have grown up under the 1986 Act. The formulation in the three conditions in the clause is new. The FSA will issue information on how it intends to apply those conditions—indeed, it already has. It is responsible for publishing that information.
<P>
To return to one or two earlier points, a firm that is under investigation will have protections under part X, which provides a notice requirement in certain circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My apologies for labouring the point, but we see no reason for the employer not to have a copy of formal notices—providing them is not an arduous task.
<P>
Secondly, there is the important issue of people's terms of employment, of whether they are entitled to redundancy if they leave and how that relates to their contracts. It might be legally necessary for a firm to have a copy. The employer might have a copy, which he could give to the firm, but who is to say that that is correct? I can see only obfuscation in the Government not ensuring that employers are included in the list of third parties in clauses 338 and 339.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> All I can say is that there is no amendment to that effect before the Committee, although the hon. Gentleman might want to table one. We are dealing just with the Government amendments before us, which are not contentious and which I hope the Committee will accept.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I might have missed it in all the detail, but I am not sure whether the Minister answered my written question about the availability of the prohibited list. Also, to return to my hon. Friend's point, what is the downside of automatically including employers on the notification list? Will the Minister explain why—other than the cost of a first-class stamp—it might be a bad thing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I did answer the hon. Gentleman's point. The register will be public, as required under clause 304.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> It has been made public before, but the public never gets to see it. How public will it be? Will it be published on the internet, of which there was much mention in the consultation paper? Can a member of the public simply ring the FSA and say, ``Please send me a copy of the list''? Or must one make an appointment to go to Canary wharf to look at the list in a darkened room, without photocopies? That is not a facetious point; the arrangements have not worked in practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Clause 304 sets out at some length the authority's duties in terms of the public record. It will be for the authority to determine how it exercises its obligations under that clause. Opposition Members might want to pursue the matter further when we reach that point.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs asked what the problem was with introducing extra provision for copies of notices to be made available to employers. The point that I attempted to make was that I am not persuaded that it is necessary to do that. However, it is open to members of the Committee to table an amendment if they think that that would help to achieve the Bill's intent. If they table an amendment, I will respond at that point.
<P>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I want to press the Minister further on whether a firm should be given a copy of a prohibition order if it is varied or revoked. That issue leads on from earlier comments made by my hon. Friends about clause 54, which also apply to clause 55.
<P>
The Minister was unconvincing about firms not needing to be kept informed about prohibition orders relating to their employees. A firm is certainly entitled to know what is happening to its employees, especially when an individual is not forward or open with the employer. An individual might prefer to deal privately with the FSA, but allowing that would be wrong. An employer who pays salaries and is liable for redundancy payments and other matters concerning its employee has a right to know what is going on.
<P>
We believe that in practice, for the sake of good regulation, the firm will seek to comply—and to ensure that all its employees comply—with the requirements of the Bill. It is impossible for the FSA adequately to supervise the hundreds of thousands of people working in the market. It will always be the responsible employer with the rule book who ensures that the firm and all its employees comply with the myriad rules and regulations governing the market. It is therefore important that firms are regularly and routinely informed about matters such as prohibition orders that affect employees. A firm cannot do its job under the Bill unless that takes place.
<P>
Will the Minister tell us more about the reasoning behind his argument that it is wrong for employers to be informed? If he does not have a full answer now, will he undertake to return to the matter later in our proceedings, and take it away for a rethink?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We need to distinguish between different types of prohibition and different types of FSA action in the provisions. The prohibition in clause 53—clause 55 deals with variation or revocation of a prohibition order and clause 66 with approval—is directed at an individual, who may or may not be employed at the time. The prohibition may relate to the individual's current employment or to something that happened in a previous employment. It is for the FSA to decide the extent to which an individual's current employer needs to be involved. In many circumstances the authority will decide that it is appropriate to inform the current employer, in which case it will do so. But I am not persuaded of the inevitability of a current employer always needing to see a copy of the prohibition order, which is why we have not included this requirement in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Approval, however, is integral to a firm's operation, so clause 56 makes clear provision for consultation arrangements. In answer to the right hon. Gentleman, I am not persuaded that there will always be a need for the FSA to send to an employer a copy of the prohibition notice about an individual currently in its employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> This is yet another example of the Minister conceding that a case exists and then saying that it does not need to be written into the Bill because he is sure that the FSA will always be reasonable and responsible, and keep employers informed. I have no doubt that that is the intention, especially of the FSA's present management. However, I can imagine a situation in which a firm learns quite unexpectedly, late in the day, that an employee has had an application turned down, with this causing consternation in the firm, and bringing about reciprocal repercussions not only for the employee and his relationship with the firm, but for the firm and its reputation. The firm will ask the FSA why it was not kept informed; the authority will reply that it usually tries to keep people in touch, but that the Act states clearly that it does not have to do so. It will say that it is unfortunate, but that that is the end of the matter. I find that wholly unsatisfactory. Reasonable requirements on the FSA ought to be written into the Bill. After all, many reasonable requirements on firms and individuals will be specified there. We do not like the asymmetry of all the obligations being on the market and all the suppositions of good will being on the FSA. Once again, it seems that the Bill is being written for the convenience of the Treasury and the FSA.
<P>
There is a most regrettable silence from the Government Benches whenever these matters are raised. But, frankly, one of the Committee's jobs is to try to ensure fairness and equality, so that fair obligations are put on both sides of this regulatory system. We shall not press the clause to a division, but I must make the point that unless the Minister shows greater willingness to try to understand the points that we make—there is nothing partisan about them; we are genuinely trying to improve the Bill and to ensure that the FSA itself is given obligations that it must, by law, discharge—we shall have to return to these matters, perhaps at greater length, on Report.
<P>
It would be much better if the Minister were to make small concessions much earlier, and thereby engage his own draftsmen to improve these legislative proposals in the usual way.

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> This is a bit of clause stand part speech on clause 56. Is it appropriate, Mr. Atkinson, or shall I wait?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Wait.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall respond briefly to the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory). We have taken note of numerous points raised by members of the Committee and, where appropriate, shall continue to do so. The difficulty is that we are debating an amendment that has not been tabled—I do not know what the amendment contains because neither I nor anyone else has seen it. It is therefore a little unreasonable to chastise me for not accepting it.
<P>
On the general topic that has been raised, it is not taxing the imagination of members of the Committee to think of circumstances in which, as I said earlier, a prohibition order about a particular activity relating to an individual's former employment may be issued. Opposition Members have, not unreasonably, occasionally raised concerns about the treatment of individuals and the line that we are taking may well raise issues about the privacy of an individual receiving a prohibition order. We cannot automatically assume that the terms of every prohibition order should be communicated to that individual's current employer because they may bear no relation to the kind of work that that individual is doing for his or her current employer. If Opposition Members have an amendment that deal with those concerns, I will be happy to respond to it—once it is tabled. I repeat that, as we have done throughout the debate and will continue to do, when Opposition Members raise reasonable points that require a positive response from us, they will receive it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We come to an example of the kind of positive response from Opposition Members that I spoke of a moment ago. Amendment No.288 picks up an important aspect of the approval arrangements under the clause that the Government are anxious to clarify. We have sought to address the point more fully in Government amendments Nos. 334 and 335, and also in Government amendment No. 343 to clause 61. As I explained in our discussion of amendments to clause 53, the drafting of this clause is complicated because we seek in part V to address a wide range of current arrangements—over and above contracts of employment—for the performance of particular functions. However, the key test—as is evident from clause 58—is the fitness of the person performing the function, not the precise detail of the arrangements. That is not to say that that detail is irrelevant, because the FSA will need to consider the qualities and competence of a person in the light of what is required under the relevant arrangements.
<P>
However, there is a distinction between, on the one hand, the FSA looking at the arrangements that specify what a person is doing in order to assess the candidate's suitability for the job and, on the other hand, seeking to determine the details that specify more general matters such as pay or terms and conditions which are not normally a matter for the FSA. The issue of pay is picked up particularly by the Opposition amendment.
<P>
In order to clarify that—and, as I said, we recognise the appropriateness of that concern—we have introduced Government amendments Nos. 334, 335 and 343, which help to address the relevant concerns by moving the focus of the authority's approval from the details of the arrangements to the fact of them being entered into with the particular person concerned. The FSA should be looking at whether someone is a fit and proper person to do a job and not at the terms on which that person is employed. Our amendments clarify that.
<P>
The exception to the general rule that remuneration is not a matter for the regulator occurs in relation to remuneration arrangements incentivising poor standards of conduct. The authority has general and legitimate interest in such matters. For example, evidence that high bonuses and commissions give people the wrong incentive to do their job—as has been alleged for pensions salespeople in the past—is a regulatory concern covered by other parts of the Bill. However, there is no question of the authority having power to determine pay levels. Indeed, the authority has already discussed that matter with the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs.
<P>
I shall deal briefly with amendment No. 294. It may help Opposition Members—and indeed, may support the argument that I made a few moments ago—to know that, had we not introduced Government amendment No. 343 simplifying clause 61(7) and aligning it with clause 56, we would gladly have accepted their amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We have much to say about clause 56, which is one of the Bill's most important provisions. In its current form, it gives the FSA complete power to determine on a whim whom a company may and may not hire. It extends the territory of the approved regime to another layer of people, affecting those carrying out mezzanine functions as well as those carrying out front functions.
<P>
We are grateful that the Government endeavoured to accept our main argument that, as originally drafted, subsections (1) and (10) would give the FSA power to control remuneration and, as a result, tabled amendments designed to stop that happening. However, the amendments, which are convoluted, do not achieve that, as the FSA still has a great deal of leverage to say that it does not like terms.
<P>
The Financial Secretary referred to the Government's intent to echo clause 53 in clause 56(8). The FSA's approval is crucial, as it must be satisfied that someone is fit and proper to perform a controlled function. Will the Government reconsider how best to word their intention to exclude remuneration from the FSA's bailiwick?
<P>
The Financial Secretary raised the related matter of the FSA continuing to claim power to influence remuneration in relation to bonuses and incentive payments. The senior executive of the FSA has already discussed that with me. We accept that incentivisation may encourage undesirable behaviour. However, a quasi-government agency has no role in influencing or determining remuneration, as it is the responsibility of businesses employed to do that. A business that makes a mistake will pay the price in due course. The concept of a body such as the FSA having powers over remuneration is unacceptable.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The juxtaposition of the Government's amendments and ours is slightly complex. The Minister thinks that Government amendment No. 343 deals with the definitional issue that we raised in amendment No. 294. I trust that that is the case. The wording of the clause is wrong and should refer to a controlled function, not a regulated one.
<P>
Amendment No. 288 would make it clear in black-and-white terms that FSA approval of arrangements does not cover those for bonus, salary or other remuneration. It relates to an earlier point that I made, and is considerably stronger than the rather convoluted way in which the Government sought to tackle the issue. We still want our amendment to be made to clause 56
<P>
The whole financial services industry was especially incensed when it understood what clause 56 meant as it stood. There will be some relief that the Government have taken the point. However, we are not satisfied that amendments Nos. 334 and 335 achieve the desired objective, and we should like amendment No. 288 to be included.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am confident that the Government amendments deal with the point that we are discussing. I refer the Committee to the beginning of clause 56. We are changing the wording of subsection (1) from
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``unless the Authority approves that arrangement''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which could be read in the way that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs feared—to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the performance by that person of the controlled function to which the arrangement relates.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That clearly moves the focus of subsection (1) onto the individual's performance of the job. The hon. Gentleman said that the industry was relieved at the change, which clarifies what the authority is to consider in making its determination.
<P>
The FSA could—not so much in this part of the Bill, but elsewhere—have concerns about remuneration arrangements that provide incentives for undesirable conduct. For example, a salesman who was so dependent on commission payments as to have an incentive to mis-sell investment products would be a legitimate object for the authority's concern.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester) rose—
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall just finish the point and then I will gladly give way to the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie).
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs said that a business that made a mistake would eventually pay the price. No doubt that is true. However, many people could be seriously disadvantaged before it paid the price, and restitution might not be provided to them. So, I would certainly defend the need for the authority to be able to take an interest in such matters in a carefully defined way. In such circumstances, it would make rules under clause 110 to control arrangements. The objective would be to protect the interests of consumers. That is legitimate and right, and I would defend the authority's ability to take an interest on those grounds.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Is not there a distinction between unacceptable conduct, which the FSA has a duty to keep an eye on and regulate if necessary, and business decisions, including those about remuneration, which cause or may result in misconduct? Is not that central for distinguishing between decisions that are integral to what a business does and the effects of those decisions on the market in which it operates?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> That is a helpful distinction, and the point of the amendments is to make the object of the FSA's concern the performance of the individual in this role and therefore on the business operations of the organisation. I detect a slight nuance of difference between what the hon. Member for Chichester and the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs said, and I prefer the hon. Member for Chichester's presentation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Is the Minister saying that there can never be a scintilla of difference between myself and my hon. Friend?—[Interruption.] I shall have to look up the word scintilla to check that it is useful in that context. Perhaps there was only a cigarette paper between us.
<P>
My point was accepted by the Minister, but it should lead directly to the view that the FSA should not have a role in examining pay levels, even if they generate activity that the FSA believes is wrong.
<P>
The conduct or performance should be regulated, not the cause of it, which should remain a matter for the business. I disagree with the Minister when he says that the FSA should have an interest in incentive schemes, pay and remuneration. That is the central difference between us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I reaffirm my earlier point. If it were clear that a bonus or incentive arrangement was encouraging employees or an approved person to behave in a way that was contrary to the interests of customers—mis-selling, for example—it would be legitimate for the authority to take an interest in the matter and issue rules. Before the general election, I was a member of the Treasury Select Committee and was party to the inquiry into Barings. I know that the Securities and Futures Authority took an interest at that time in the way in which employees of Barings were being incentivised. Such matters arise from time to time and I do not wish to prevent the authority from taking an interest in them.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 283, in page 25, line 39, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or allows it on a temporary basis subject to such terms and conditions as it considers appropriate'.<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or pending such approval allows it on a temporary basis subject to such terms and conditions as it considers appropriate.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> There is no mechanism in the Bill for the FSA to allow a person to perform a controlled function pending the approval by the FSA of the arrangement under which he is engaged. The amendment would provide flexibility by allowing the FSA to permit a person to perform a controlled function under an arrangement with the relevant authorised person on a temporary basis. It would also provide that the FSA can lay down such terms and conditions as it considers appropriate. Behind that provision lies the concern that the FSA will face a huge task in investigating, assessing and judging all those arrangements. The market is huge and constantly changing; new products and ways of working are being developed all the time and new relationships are forming between market makers and customers. The FSA is taking on the task of approving many of the arrangements. That is a huge responsibility and I trust that the authority is appropriately staffed and resourced to undertake it. Indeed, one of my questions for the Minister is whether he believes that the FSA is capable of undertaking the obligation set out in this part of the Bill.
<P>
In a changing market, the FSA could become swamped by new applicants undertaking new tasks and it would be wrong if such market-driven changes were held up because of a bureaucratic constriction in the FSA, which might not have the trained and skilled staff to undertake the necessary checks. If the FSA authorises people without an undertaking that the right investigations will be made and something then goes wrong, it will be failing in its duty. It is therefore sensible to have a safety valve in the Bill that would permit the FSA to allow arrangements to be made pending full approval and which would allow the FSA to lay down certain conditions on that—perhaps regular reporting or other appropriate conditions that may provide a safety catch. We must look ahead and view it sympathetically from the FSA's point of view; it will be faced with that task and it is only sensible to anticipate problems that would allow it to undertake or allow authorisations on a temporary basis. Would the Minister respond to that suggestion and also answer my general inquiries about the staffing and resourcing of the FSA and my question on whether it has made contingency plans for what could be a substantial regulatory task?
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I rise to support my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and to ask a few more detailed questions. I agree with my right hon. Friend that the FSA seems to be setting itself an enormous task. Will the Minister tell us, so that we can get some idea of the ambit of the task, how many people the FSA anticipates it will need to approve? The explanatory notes seem to indicate that such people as directors, proprietary traders, financial advisers and stockbrokers will be affected. There must be large numbers of such people. To what extent is it anticipated that grandfathering rights will apply so that there will be a sensible transfer from the current to the new regime? What numbers of staff does the FSA have at its disposal?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the right hon. and learned Gentleman but that may be a subject more appropriately dealt with in the clause stand part debate rather than within the narrower scope of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I could focus my argument onto the amendment, Mr. Atkinson, but I accept your guidance. I have indicated my questions, so that may help the Minister when I raise the subject again in the debate on clause stand part.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I hope that we may take that as confirmation that you will allow us a debate on clause stand part, Mr. Atkinson, because I am sure that there are many more general points on which we should like to chip in. 
<P>
I support the two amendments tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and will add other considerations that are especially germane to the debate.
<P>
Consultation document No. 26, which relates to the approval regime, suggests that approval could take up to three months, although the FSA is examining ways of reducing this, perhaps by the use of the internet. We must wait to discover what it will do about that. There may be conditions whereby a firm is left with a large gap, perhaps because of a death or because a member of staff has been head-hunted and is leaving. My understanding of the way the clause will work is that if a firm switches an approved member of its staff to another role, it must seek a new approval from the FSA before that member of staff can be given approval for that controlled function. A firm that has taken on a member of staff initially because it deemed that person fit and proper to hold a post with the firm, and fit and proper for the job in hand, will no longer be allowed to use its judgment simply because there may be a promotion within the firm or a transfer between departments—that often happens in international services because of dealings in different types of financial services or products. The person must re-seek approval for the new controlled job.
<P>
If a person leaves a firm through either of those two circumstances, the last thing that the firm needs is for that job to be left in limbo, or, more particularly, for the previous employee's clients to be left in limbo if someone is not there to cover.  The clients of a firm of stockbrokers, a bank, or whatever may be left completely uncovered. It is most unsatisfactory that it could take up to three months for the FSA to approve a new person to cover that job, even though the new person, who must re-seek approval, may have worked for the firm for five, 10 or 20 years and done a parallel job but under a different controlled function. It creates serious questions about the continuity of care for clients. Insurance trade bodies have raised the possibility of there being some form of post-approval facility. Can the Minister say whether this might be allowed, to enable a firm to use its own initiative to ensure that a fit and proper person, who has been approved generally, can cover—at least in the short term—before being formally recognised for approval by the FSA, or, if the FSA decides that it cannot approve that person, to enable a firm to find another suitable person for the job? We seem to be leaving a big gap, which begs the question whether consultation document 26 potentially imposes enormous requirements on the approval regime for employees, with little by way of compensation in terms of more rigorous service standards being required of the FSA so that it ensures that these things happen speedily, effectively and seamlessly. Rightly and with common sense, the amendments attempt to provide for a person to be able to fill a gap created through the two circumstances that I have outlined. The person who did the job previously may even have been the subject of a warning notice and left under a cloud. It is essential that the firm which knows the clients and customers can switch somebody across to cover matters as soon as possible, without having to go through the potentially enormously bureaucratic process before us. However good a person is—he might be the best person to do the job—he could have to wait three months to receive further FSA approval for a control function before he can start work.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): The amendment seems reasonable on the surface, but it could introduce an enormous loophole into the Bill.
<P>
There is no definition of the term ``temporary''. One can foresee circumstances in which many people might be working in various organisations on temporary approval, without having been scrutinised in keeping with the main motive behind the Bill. To that extent, those involved would bypass the Bill and the regulations, and there would be no incentive to do otherwise.
<P>
Far from acting as a safety valve when the FSA was understaffed or under-resourced, the amendment would almost induce that. It would offer an incentive to avoid raising the number of staff on the FSA to meet the requirements in the Bill and would provide an excuse for doing so.
<P>
We all know of temporary arrangements that become permanent. In this case, that would result in an army of people in the organisations that we are discussing never being vetted by the FSA in any way. Far from achieving what has been suggested, the amendment could result in the FSA budget being kept down and temporary arrangements applying to a large proportion of people who operate in the affected industries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. Is he saying, following on from my point, that there will be insufficient people and resources in the FSA to give full approval? If so, he is implicitly saying that an awful lot of firms' clients and customers will be left in financial limbo.
<P>
As regards justifying temporary provisions, why not include a service requirement that they should be for three months, as in the consultation document? In that way, there would at least be an obligation on the FSA to ensure that it got on with implementing the Act. It is much better to have a properly approved person than a temporarily approved one. The onus is on the FSA to get on with things.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> That is not the case. As has been said, there will be enormous pressures on the FSA to keep down its staff numbers and costs, particularly given the way in which it is funded. That could be achieved to an extent by policing the number of people on a temporary agreement.
<P>
I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's point. If we accepted the amendment, we would build into the Bill a direct incentive to rely on the temporary category to a larger extent than would otherwise be necessary. We would, therefore, quite by accident, build in two classes of approved people. One would be temporary and would be around for quite some time without having been vetted; the other would come along in the fullness of time and be vetted according to the prescriptions in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I want to make a brief point about the amendment and the question of temporary approval. I strongly support the amendment and urge the Minister to consider it carefully. The speech by the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard) raises an important point. It demonstrates the chaos that might arise if there were no opportunity to give temporary approvals. I shall develop the point a little more on clause stand part.
<P>
One asks oneself whether the issue is not more profound than keeping down the number of FSA employees. The Financial Secretary will appreciate that it may be difficult for the FSA to rapidly recruit people who are competent enough to give final approval. Consequently, there may be a logjam in the market. I shall address that matter later.
<P>
Having the capacity to give temporary approval would greatly assist the FSA. Not having it may have profound consequences which I shall explore in our clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Clause 56 will be unworkable without such a provision. No great issue is at stake in defining ``temporary''. As I mentioned earlier, clause 56 brings new people—I call them the marzipan layer—into the approved regime.
<P>
There may be cases in which teams of people move from one firm to another at short notice. The clause effectively breaches the legal entity and determines who wields power in organisations. The chief executive of a major American bank operating in London would be astonished to discover that he or she must be an approved person. Getting approval for the appointment of a new chief executive would involve quite a lot of hassle. In the meantime, in relation to the approved person regime, such a person has no power over the organisation that he or she runs.
<P>
My experience is that ridiculous situations have arisen when someone has left and existing staff are used to cover gaps and look after client needs in a diligent and conscientious manner. In such an event, problems may occur in connection with an approved person regime. If the Government are not prepared to accept the amendments, how will they address the practical issues that already exist and will increase considerably when the Bill is enacted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Authorised persons should be required to obtain the authority's approval before entering into the arrangements covered by clause 56(10). That is the right approach and the Opposition's argument contains a serious flaw.
<P>
Clearly, it would be extremely unsatisfactory for people to leave perfectly good jobs to take employment elsewhere, only to find a few weeks after assuming their new post that they were unacceptable to the FSA. By then, it would be too late to return to their previous employer, so they would be in a dreadful position. That would be an inevitable consequence of temporary permissions of the type advocated by Opposition Members.
<P>
Our view is informed by awareness of equivalent arrangements under existing legislation and the rules of the old private-sector regulators or self-regulating organisations under the 1986 Act. The Investment Management Regulatory Organisation, the Securities and Futures Authority and the Personal Investment Authority have operated without difficulty a system requiring approval prior to appointment.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells asked about the practicality of the provision and its implication for staffing. I assured him that I am satisfied that the FSA can resolve such matters, and in doing so I draw a good deal of encouragement from the experience of the organisations that I have just mentioned. The number of those with approval will be between 150,000 and 200,000, which is not very different from the levels operated by those organisations.
<P>
Examples involving IMRO and the PIA demonstrate that existing regulators are interested not only in front-line sales staff. The PIA, for instance, registers people responsible for day-to-day supervision of investment business. All the SROs register compliance officers currently. To suggest that this is some huge and unprecedented new task is misleading.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the statutory systems for banking and insurance permit notification after a person has been appointed to a post. But experience shows that in practice the firms covered by those statutory regimes consult the regulator before engaging people to take up their positions, no doubt precisely because of the problem that I outlined of people finding themselves suddenly without a job through no fault of their own.
<P>
I entirely accept that the arrangements under part V should not disrupt business or employment practices or create a burden for firms. The FSA has plenty of discretion to design control functions in a way that anticipates some of the problems that hon. Members have described. For example, when approving someone to act as deputy chief executive, it can be made clear as part of the approved arrangement that the function includes standing in for the chief executive in case of illness, incapacity or whatever. It could exclude from the definition of a control function performing such functions on a temporary basis and in particular circumstances.
<P>
It would be open to organisations to apply explicitly for a temporary arrangement and the FSA could grant that if it chose. The amendments would not materially affect the way in which the arrangements for approval operate. Nothing in clause 56 prevents an authorised person from seeking the FSA's approval of a temporary appointment in cases of urgency where that was sought by the authorised person. The worst case that we might contemplate such as the death of a senior executive director of a financial institution—
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I will give way in a moment. Doing nothing following such a death is clearly not an option. If the FSA is satisfied with an interim arrangement to fill a gap in the senior management, whether by bringing some willing person in from outside or by temporary promotion, it will give its approval in accordance with clause 56 as it currently stands. The amendments would address such situations. They are undesirable for the reasons that I have described and also because the status of temporarily approved persons would be ambiguous. My hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford made an important point in that respect. There is a danger that comfort would be taken from the approval whereas the relevant vetting would not have taken place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The Minister seems to be arguing completely against the comments made by his hon. Friend. If he now says that there is plenty of scope for temporary arrangements in the Bill as it stands, his hon. Friend will argue that we will have a two-tier system and that all the people who are there as temporaries will be there for some years. Who is giving us the right answer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> My hon. Friend has made some important points to which I want to return. It will be for the FSA to decide whether to accept a temporary arrangement when such an arrangement is proposed. There is no need for the provisions that the amendments would add to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I have been trying to follow the Minister. Does the FSA have existing powers as well as powers under the Bill to grant temporary approvals anyway?

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Yes. Nothing in the clause as it stands says whether an arrangement is temporary. If an organisation proposes a temporary arrangement, the FSA can approve it. An explicit reference to temporary arrangements is not needed to make that permissible.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> What about all the elaborate forms that have to be filled in? To what extent can the FSA grant a temporary approval even without receiving the form? How wide will its powers be? Can it simply—if not ride roughshod over—circumnavigate all the detailed provisions that we are discussing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, it would not need to do so. My point is that the FSA would deal with an application for a temporary arrangement with the normal formalities, but the organisation would have made it clear that it had in mind a temporary arrangement because of a particular situation. There would be nothing to prevent the FSA from agreeing such an arrangement if it were asked to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> That suggests that the FSA can ignore all of its own procedures if it so chooses and put in place a temporary arrangement. If the Government agree that the FSA should take that approach—the Financial Secretary can tell me whether they do—that reinforces the argument for such arrangements to be written into the Bill, and not left entirely to the FSA's discretion. We are concerned that that discretion may be exercised inappropriately or in a manner costly to firms. If the Government are conceding the principle that the FSA would in certain circumstances need to exercise temporary powers—the Financial Secretary cited an example in which a death had generated an emergency within a firm—I cannot see their argument for not bringing clarity to that area for the benefit of the regulated community by including a clause or an amendment in the Bill enabling temporary appointments to be made prior to full approval.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> For the reasons that I set out earlier, that might create difficulties for people who entered posts on the basis of a temporary approval and subsequently discovered that they were not approved. They would be in an extremely difficult position, which none of us would want. However, as I have said, if an organisation approached the FSA with a request for it to approve a temporary post, nothing in the Bill would prevent the FSA from giving approval. There is therefore no need for the changes for which Conservative members of the Committee are asking.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Can the Minister clarify how someone will know whether they have received a temporary approval? Suppose that someone rings up and says, ``Mr. X has moved posts. You allowed him to do this previous job. We are sending in forms, but will you approve him to undertake this separate controlled function?'' If someone says yes on the telephone, will that be sufficient? How will the system work?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> There will be the normal processes for giving approval. The application would be for the approval of a temporary post, and the FSA would say yes or no. There will be no separate category of temporary procedures, which is what Conservative Committee members want. My point is that that is not necessary, and would indeed be dangerous.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Will the Minister give way on this, please?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Let me just deal with a couple of other points that were raised, and then I will give way to the right hon. and learned Gentleman, if he seeks to catch your eye in a moment, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire asked me about grandfathering. We envisage that people currently doing jobs will be able to continue without having to reapply. Existing employees or directors will need to make applications only when they propose to take up new jobs or change their employer.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford made the telling point that we should all be focusing on ensuring that the FSA delivers, expeditiously and fully, on the commitments in its consultation document and that it does not encourage another arrangement, whereby a different category of approvals is given on a temporary basis.
<P>
The authority is conscious of the need to process applications as quickly as possible. In the CP26 paper, which has been referred to, on the arrangements that the authority proposes to implement in exercise of its powers under this part of the Bill, it is made clear that approvals will, as a matter of course, be granted in days or weeks. As has been mentioned, the authority has said that it will examine the use of new technology to reduce delays further. It has asked in the consultation document for views on the trade-off between rapid turnaround times and the higher costs that high service standards necessarily imply. As I said to the Committee last week on the arrangements for the processing of applications for permission under part IV, the FSA has undertaken to publish service standards and to report on its performance against those standards. The same is true for applications under part V. The FSA has also expressed a willingness to prioritise certain applications in urgent cases. Given that explanation and those reassurances, I hope that Opposition Members will not feel it necessary to press the amendments to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's reply, although he seemed at times to be making a case for our amendments. We now learn that the FSA will be able to grant temporary permission; it therefore seems highly desirable that that should be explicit and accompanied by the ability of the FSA to lay down such terms and conditions as are appropriate to that temporary working. Faced with a huge backlog and pressure from the market, the FSA could, under the Bill, easily be tempted to authorise all sorts of arrangements without proper checks and without any conditions. That would be an inferior arrangement to laying down a recognition that there will occasionally be a strong case for allowing temporary working. All that the Minister said in opposition to our amendments was that it would be unfair for practitioners and employees to be temporarily authorised and for that authorisation to be revoked. I think that employees would rather take that chance than be held up by the FSA from taking what may be a lifetime career opportunity by switching firms, possibly at short notice and possibly to do a specific, short-term task. In most cases, employers will be confident that they can comply with any necessary requirements; the great majority of them are fit and proper people and they would prefer an arrangement to be available in the Bill than to take up the posts, often at extremely short notice.
<P>
The Minister does not fully appreciate the realities of an active market. Tens of thousands of people switch jobs in the City and elsewhere every week and firms go under. Whole teams of market traders can switch from one employer to another, or become self-employed, or a buy-out can result in a change of ownership. Receivers and administrators can be appointed, often at short notice and an administrator running a company unexpectedly and at short notice might have to obtain the necessary authorisation to do so. It would be absurd if that were to be held up by the FSA saying that it had not heard about an individual who was expecting to run a firm that had been put into administration. Weeks could go by, with all the creditors and employees in limbo—the firm gradually going under, debts mounting and creditors at the door. Yet the FSA's response would be, ``We have received your application on the internet and will get round to dealing with it in due course. The internet has saved us a few hours, but we still have to make the proper checks.''
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It would be much to the advantage of everyone if it were conceded that temporary arrangements could from time to time be appropriate. The Minister suggested that that could be done informally, but it would be much better if it were made explicit in the Bill.
<P>
We can return in the stand part debate—if you allow us, Mr. Atkinson—to a more general debate about resourcing the FSA and about the number of market participants to be dealt with in this way. The Minister provided some figures, which seemed much the same as the presently authorised figures. However, the notes on clauses state that the existing regulatory framework is inconsistent and imply that the FSA, by providing consistency, might well bring larger numbers of employers into its regulatory net. I expect the figure to rise. We can debate that in the future, but at present we want some explicit assurances from the Minister. Unless he has anything further to say about temporary arrangements, we intend to press one of the amendments to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I want to back up some of my right hon. Friend's comments. The more the Minister said in the debate, the less convinced I was by any reasons for not accepting the amendments. We have arrived at an absurd position. Labour Members told us that anything temporary is bad and leads to a two-tier system: it is not allowed to happen and should not be allowed to happen in the future. Yet we were then told by the Minister that we already have provisions for temporary arrangements and that temporary is good and flexible—a complete contrast, so one wonders what the Labour side of the Committee is trying to achieve.
<P>
Opposition Members are attempting to be more explicit about temporary arrangements and to provide for them in the Bill: if temporary exists as it does, let us try to tighten up its definition and thereby improve the provisions. Many options are possible. If the FSA consultation document states that there should be a maximum of a three-month wait for approval, we could limit temporary arrangements to a three-month period. It would be sensible to align the provisions in that way. It is little different from putting someone on a probationary period. An employee could be put on probation for six months, and if found not to be fit and proper for the job, a temporary contract only would apply—exactly what we are talking about here.
<P>
In some specific cases, it is purely common sense. I have already mentioned three examples: death, someone headhunted through a firm or, most importantly, someone dismissed because something has gone wrong, as evidenced by a warning or other notice being served by the FSA. Technically, Mr. Leeson, having been suspended by Barings, could not have been replaced until the firm received approval for a replacement to carry on his job. If we had had to wait not three months, but one month, three weeks or even three days, we might not have known how much damage was being done. Indeed, hundreds of millions of pounds could have been compounded to the Barings loss in mere hours, depending on when the Japanese options market opened.
<P>
Strictly speaking, under the Bill, Barings would not have had the facility to appoint somebody to pick up the pieces left by Mr. Leeson or somebody in an equivalent position. That is an absurd situation for a company, which faces compounding its losses if proper stock losses are not executed. Ultimately, it is even more absurd and dangerous for the firm's underlying clients, who stand to lose an awful lot of money simply because they are waiting for a bit of paperwork from the FSA. The very people whom the Bill is supposed to protect will be prejudiced by a ridiculous bit of red tape that could easily be removed by the commonsense measure of allowing a temporary permission, as already exists in practice.
<P>
For goodness' sake, let us tighten up the provision and define it more closely. That is all we are trying to do in the amendments. It is not good enough for the Minister to say, ``We do not want to define it.'' That makes me doubt whether the promise of service standard requirements, which has been tossed around and which, it was loosely suggested, will come in with the authorised rule book next year, will amount to anything. It would be quite simple under the citizens charter qualification or whatever to require the FSA to do something within a certain time—just as it requires everybody it regulates to do things within a certain time and under certain conditions. It would be simple to make it absolutely compulsory for the FSA to grant approval within three months or be in default. If it were in default, of course, there would then be the problem that we would have no powers to uphold a complaint or to award compensation. That is another subject on which we have touched before and to which we shall return.
<P>
The more we debate the amendments, the more they seem to be not just common sense, but essential. The more the Government argue against them, the weaker their case appears to be. All that we are trying to do in the amendments is to be explicit about a practice that is clearly common sense and which apparently already exists. We are trying to make it explicit that there are practical solutions for everyday occurrences that affect thousands of people. If we do not take them up, we lay firms and their underlying clients open to potential negligence, simply because no one is there to look after them because those responsible are waiting for the requisite paperwork from the FSA.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I confess that I had not thought a great deal about the issue until I started listening to the debate. At first, I did not think that the matter was terribly important, but as I have listened I have come to the conclusion that it is. The people that we are trying to regulate will be very concerned if we get things wrong.
<P>
The Minister has done a 180 degree turn during the debate. However, as is the way with Ministers—this is no reflection on the Financial Secretary—they will be reluctant to admit it in debate. I did not get the Minister's exact words down, but I wrote them down as fast as I could. As I understand them, he did not want to put interim arrangements in the Bill because that might allow someone to start work in a firm which would subsequently find that he had not obtained approval. That clearly contradicts what the Minister then said when he supported and elaborated on an interpretation of the Bill under which the FSA could give interim and temporary approval. As he put it, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent it from doing so. If the Government are satisfied that the FSA needs to take on board interim arrangements as a matter of principle, there is surely a strong case for putting such a principle in a Bill of this detail. The Minister might be worried that that could curtail what the FSA can do. He should carefully examine the wording of our amendment. As I said, I came to it relatively recently, although it is tabled in my name.
<P>
Amendment No. 284 contains the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``subject to such conditions as it''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
—meaning the FSA—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``considers appropriate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, our amendment would enable the FSA to determine how to implement permission for interim arrangements.
<P>
Our amendments represent a halfway house. They would give the FSA a large measure of discretion and would add to the Bill the principle that interim arrangements may be made.
<P>
Not having such arrangements is the alternative to the principle of temporary approvals and would, inevitably, result in delayed appointments. Discretionary power is currently exercised with extreme caution and I assume that the Bill will tighten that.
<P>
Delay in appointment relates to matters that we have already debated at length. Indeed, Labour Members expressed annoyance about the time spent on them. However, delay affects City competitiveness. Business will be lost and go elsewhere if people cannot be got into the right slots at the right time. Therefore, there will be a cost.
<P>
I do not want to elaborate in too much detail, as such matters relate to future amendments. However, I shall flag up some basic questions to which it would be helpful to receive answers.
<P>
How long is the expected delay? What is the average time lag between application and FSA approval? What incentive does the Bill give the FSA to get on with the process of granting approval?
<P>
As predisposition to grant at least a temporary arrangement is absent from the Bill, it should surely make provision to encourage the FSA to get on with the job of giving approval. Otherwise, the costs to business, to which I have alluded, will be all the higher.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I hope that the Minister will do what is often done when constructive suggestions are made in Committee. If we withdraw our amendment, will he examine the matter carefully before making a proposal of his own?
<P>
We respect the Minister, as he is clearly thinking hard about that. It would be unfair to say that he is on the run. However, it might be unconstructive.
<P>
We have debated the important matter of temporary posts. I wonder whether what the Minister said about the current power to grant approval of such posts—and, indeed, our own amendments—is adequate, as provisional approval of a permanent post will be required more often than approval of a temporary post. In such cases, practical and actual approval will be made in a few days or weeks.
<P>
Earlier, I asked how such approvals are to be conveyed by the FSA and those acting on its behalf. Conservative Members have asked some serious questions and we may have to press the amendment to a vote if agreement is not forthcoming. However, our arguments are sufficiently strong to encourage the Minister to reconsider the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I do not believe that they are.
<P>
Opposition Members have missed a key distinction. Their amendment would allow the FSA to respond to a normal application for a permanent arrangement by granting it on a temporary basis. That would have serious and damaging consequences as I have spelt out. Under the Bill as drafted, if an organisation approaches the FSA for approval for a temporary post, the FSA can agree to it. That is the distinction that I hope is clear in the minds of hon. Members. Under the amendment, the FSA would be given the extra ability to say, not yes or no, but, ``We approve this temporarily'', and that would be damaging and undesirable. I would not want to give the Committee the impression that if I went away and thought about it some more I might change my mind.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Will the Minister point to the passage in the Bill that gives that power?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> There is nothing in the Bill that prevents a person from approaching the FSA and explicitly saying that it is for a temporary post. Therefore the FSA can say yes or no to that application if it is couched in those terms by the applicant.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Am I to understand that the Minister cannot point to anything in the Bill to give that power? His only answer is that nothing in the Bill would prevent it. Are we saying that the FSA can do anything it likes unless it is prevented by the Bill and why are we spending months on this?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, we are not saying that. As it stands, clause 56 covers any kind of arrangement. That is what it allows people to apply for. If they apply for a temporary post, the FSA, under the powers given to it in the clause, can say yes or no to the application. It is quite straightforward. I am puzzled as to why hon. Members are making such heavy weather of it. As I said at the outset, IMRO, SFA, PIA all currently work in this manner. There is none of the difficulties that hon. Members have suggested are likely to arise. If they have evidence of them I should be interested to hear it.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I will gladly give way in a moment. If they had any evidence, they would doubtless have brought it to the Committee's attention. The system works perfectly satisfactorily on this basis at present and it will continue to do so. If, unwisely, Opposition Members push this to a vote, I will urge my hon. Friends to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister said that a business can apply for the approval of a temporary post. Can the business apply for the provisional approval of a permanent post and if it did could the FSA grant it? Where in the Bill are any of those powers expressed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> People can apply for a post which has whatever characteristics they wish. They can apply for a temporary post and the FSA, under the powers given in the clause, can say yes or no to the application. The post is defined not by the FSA but by the person making the application. The amendment would enable the FSA to respond in a different way to applications and instead of saying yes or no, saying yes temporarily. If that were possible, it could be quite damaging. It is not the practice of the current SROs. They have managed well without that ability, as will the FSA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> We cannot let the Minister get away with that. It is misleading to claim that the provision is harmless and merely maintains the status quo. It is patently not so. Pages 22 and 23 of CP 26 contain a complete section on defining all the sorts of managers and other key personnel whom my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs describes as mezzanine and marzipan—anything with an M and a Z appears appropriate for both categories of people. There is a great raft of people not now covered whom it is proposed to cover. That is not maintaining the status quo.
<P>
Consultation paper 26 also contains a section on firms incorporated outside the United Kingdom, and completely new proposals involving foreign firms taking over UK firms. For example, it refers to the making of new rules requiring such firms to notify the FSA within 14 days of subsequent changes to management. That begs the question whether a firm will want to launch a takeover without some facility for clearing it with the FSA first so that the people that the firm has taken over and brought on board will be given approval to carry on with the function that they previously carried out for another firm. I should like there to be some facility for that, because such circumstances could be a major deterrent to a firm wanting to take over another firm in that it might consider that it could be buying a great many people who no longer have approvals to carry out controlled functions. It simply is not good enough for the Minister to say that the provision is harmless. There has been enormous contradiction in the Committee between Ministers and Government Back-Bench Members about whether ``temporary'' is good, or bad, or whether it even exists. Labour Members are in the most enormous muddle. As the Minister said, clause 56 allows the FSA to do anything that it wishes to any firm it chooses, or to any employees of the firm, to give them approval, or otherwise. Clause 56 is a catch-all clause. Our amendment simply attempts to give some definition to a commonsense, practical measure that the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford is not sure is good or bad. We should at least have a compromise to allow some definition, to discover whether it could be good. It would be completely harmless and sensible and would clarify matters, given the current muddle into which Labour Members have got themselves. The amendment would allow everyone to know where they are. If after that we decide to debate a three-month or six-month period, that is fine. It is foolish simply to dismiss the amendment out of hand on the basis that there is no problem, that something happens now and that no changes will take place.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham. I intended to make some of the points that he made and did not think of others that he mentioned, which is often the case.
<P>
We have established that there is nothing in the Bill to enable the FSA to make temporary approvals. The Minister has assured us that if it feels so inclined, the FSA can do so. We are agreed that such approvals will be necessary if the City is not to be quite badly damaged.
<P>
Given the present drafting of the Bill, would not the authority find itself vulnerable to heavy criticism if even one case slipped through in which a temporary approval was made but subsequently turned sour—turned out to be a mistake because someone committed an offence before obtaining full approval? With the present drafting, would we not conclude that the FSA had done something that the Bill did not enable it to do, with the result that criticism would be heaped on the authority by all concerned? Also, would it not be in the interests of the FSA for the Bill to provide for the need for temporary appointments or interim arrangements? That would give it an incentive—or remove the existing strong disincentive—to make such interim appointments or arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am not sure that a great deal has been added to the debate. It is not in the FSA's interests to be able to grant a permission temporarily—and I am confident that the FSA would not wish to start doing that—because it would create all sorts of difficulties of the kind that I have described.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Let me first respond to the points made earlier. The FSA is currently consulting on exactly how the process is going to work. It intends to publish standards and to publish performance against those standards. The hon. Member for Chichester asked me what incentive it will have to keep its performance up to scratch. I think he would agree that publishing performance against the standards that have been set will be a very powerful mechanism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I thank the Minister for that information. He said that it is not in the FSA's interests to have statutory authorities making temporary arrangements. However, he acknowledged, almost in the same breath, that the FSA already does that. I cannot see any logic in maintaining those two seemingly opposed positions. If the FSA is to perform this role, there is an overwhelming case for providing for that in the Bill, given that it sets out in extraordinary detail everything that can and cannot be done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> There is a fundamental distinction between an organisation applying for an arrangement and the FSA responding to that by saying ``We will let that happen temporarily'' and an organisation approaching the FSA to say ``We want to make this temporary arrangement—will you allow it?'' and the FSA saying yes. I hope that that fundamental distinction is now clear, and I urge members of the Committee to resist the amendment.

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> It falls to me to introduce amendments Nos. 285, 286 and 287. As we discussed, clause 56 provides for the descriptions of functions that are intended as controlled to be specified in rules, which will appear in the dim and distant future. Those will be accompanied by all the wonderful service standard requirements, about which suspicions exist. However, clause 56(4) requires the FSA to be satisfied, when specifying descriptions of functions, that at least one of the conditions, which are set out in subsections (5), (6) and (7), is met. The first condition—under clause 56(5)—refers to a function
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``likely to enable the person responsible for its performance to exercise a significant influence on the conduct of the authorised person's affairs, so far as relating to the regulated activity.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, it is not clear whether that would cover a non-executive director who would not normally be concerned with the everyday operational matters of his or her firm. The purpose of amendment No. 285 is therefore to clarify matters in relation to directors and other officers of the authorised person or the contractor of the authorised person, as set out in clause 56(2). Officers would usually include the company secretary and the auditors of the company.
<P>
The amendment attempts to clarify the position of non-executive directors under the clause. In response to the issue of CP 26, Andrew Winckler, a former head of the SIB who is now the head of regulation at Ernst and Young—and with whom Ministers have held meetings about the FSA legislation—said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It will cause non-executives to think twice about accepting an appointment to a Financial Services company board.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He does have a point. Now that clause 56 places greater personal liabilities, obligations and requirements on individuals within a firm, there will be much less incentive for non-executive directors to open themselves up to such liabilities when they do not receive a full salary. Decent non-executive directors would normally contribute greatly to a financial services company and board. Their primary role is to advise on the salaries of executive directors, but they might also act as a check and balance on the potential ``excesses''—I use the word loosely—of a board that is too ambitious or a little lax on its financial adequacy requirements.
<P>
There is a fundamental problem with the way in which clause 56 treats non-executive directors. I am sure that the Government intend to include non-executive directors in the net, and I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on that. There are potential faults within the net, and non-executive directors may be deterred from becoming involved in the first place. A dichotomy exists there.
<P>
Amendment No. 286 deals with the second condition set out in clause 56. This condition is concerned with the function that involves
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the person performing it in dealing directly with customers of the authorised person''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
At present, the condition is restricted to persons who deal directly ``with'' customers. The amendment aims to extend the condition to those who deal directly ``for'' customers. There is a distinction, because if the wording were changed in that way, the proposal would cover, for example, an investment manager who may not deal with but deals for a customer.
<P>
That person is important because he is a fund manager responsible for managing the underlying client's wealth—a portfolio of shares or a unit trust, perhaps—although he never comes into day-to-day contact with the client. In many cases in collective investment or portfolio management schemes, the fund manager is not the client-contact person. As the proposal stands, the most important person is not covered. That is why we have proposed the words ``or for'' the customers, in addition to ``with'' them. This is particularly in reference to investment managers of an underlying client's assets.
<P>
Amendment No. 287 deals with the third condition set out in clause 56. The distinction may appear pedantic, but we believe that it is a meaningful one. We propose to leave out ``dealing with'', in line 17, and insert ``safeguarding the'' property of customers. The words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``dealing with property of customers''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
could cover a wide variety of functions. The clause would be improved if it described more precisely the function intended to be covered. I would stick my neck out and hazard a guess that all our efforts so far to give greater definition to the Bill have not been met with welcoming arms. That is a great pity. However, the key distinction here is that the amendment's proposal for safeguarding the property of customers would give a better, clearer description of the function to be covered.
<P>
I am considering how the clause will, in practical terms, affect back office staff in a firm of asset managers, stockbrokers or fund managers. They are members of staff who are, strictly speaking, dealing with the property of customers, but will not be required to be fully approved for a specific function. They are the people who do the paperwork, who fill in the crest transfer forms for share dealing, and who fill in the overseas registration forms for transferring various shares. Those people could be deemed to be dealing with the property of customers. Indeed, they are so doing. They are physically dealing with share certificates or with the crest records of shareholdings. They are dealing with people's assets. Surely we are not intending to incorporate the whole of a back office of a financial services firm, which would then be subject to all the rigours that we must impose on approved persons over specific controlled functions.
<P>
There is, therefore, a distinction between ``safeguarding'' and ``dealing with''. The safeguarding person is the person who has control over the asset, and who has made the decision about whether a certain asset—a share, a bond or whatever—is sold or not and, subsequently, what happens to the funds and how the purchase is paid for. Surely the measure is not intended to cover the rookie 18 year old who is performing a purely administrative function in carrying out the instructions of the person who is ultimately responsible for looking after a client's assets. That is an important distinction. If the amendment is not accepted, the future of many administrative staff involved in the financial services industry could be called into question, because they would be subject to so many additional requirements on the approval regulations.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will show a little more sympathy to the amendments than he did during our spiralling and circular argument about the previous set of amendments. We are trying to help by ensuring that this broadbrush clause does not haul in many people who were not intended to be covered.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I should like to speak to amendment No. 285. It would add to the definition of ``controlled function'', which is currently wholly imprecise. Clause 56(3) states that it means
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a function of the description specified in rules.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 285 would add:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`` `or acting as a director or other officer of A or of such a contractor of A as is mentioned in subsection (2).'.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister tell us when we are going to have the rules that specify the various controlled functions? It is clear from the explanatory notes that they are expected to include such functions as acting as a director, proprietary trader, financial adviser or stockbroker. During our previous debate, the Minister said that the FSA is really interested in front-line salesmen, who are probably not directors or proprietary traders and may or may not be financial advisers. Will the Minister clarify what functions are to be categorised as controlled functions and when we can expect the FSA to publish a draft or actual description of them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham indicated, the intention is to extend the definition of ``controlled function'' to include directors and other officers. I take it from the wording of the amendment that he wants to cover office-holders such as the company secretary, although he appeared at one point to be arguing that that should not be done. It is certainly the Government's intention that such people could be included. I touched on that when the Committee debated clause 53.
<P>
When the draft Bill was first published in July last year, clause 56 originally referred to employment. The amendment highlights the reason why we have already expanded part V so that it is not limited to contracts of employment in the strict legal sense. People may perform functions for a firm in many ways—usually under a contract of employment, but flexible labour markets and contracting out give rise to other examples. Directors of companies are not necessarily the companies' employees, and partners are not employed by their partnerships. For that reason, clause 56 avoids references to employment and is expressed instead in terms of arrangements for the performance of certain functions.
<P>
I can assure the hon. Gentleman that directors or authorised persons may already be specified as performing controlled functions under subsection (5). I should also make it clear that the clause does not impose any new liability on non-executive directors. I hope that that allays the hon. Gentleman's anxiety that non-executive directors will be judged in terms of their personal responsibilities in that capacity rather than there being a blanket requirement to approve people simply on the basis that they are non-executive directors.
