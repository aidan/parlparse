                     </span>
                  </strong> Good morning, Mr Brady. We now move on to the part
of the Bill that deals with automatic enrolment into workplace
pensions. I must say that one of the proudest achievements of the
coalition Government is that 2012 will actually happen next year. There
has been much speculation that there will be delay and that things
might not happen at all, but we were determined to press ahead with
auto-enrolment and in the words of the report, which will become our
gospel for the morning, “We were determined to make
auto-enrolment work”. Ring-bound copies of the report are in the
room for hon. Members, who have not yet had the chance to study it in
detail. The purpose of the clauses that we shall be dealing with today
is to get the nitty-gritty of auto-enrolment right and to refine the
detail, but to stick to the principle that has all-party support that,
if we want to do something about pension saving and workplace pension
saving, overcoming the inertia of choosing a pension, making sure that
we have an employer contribution, automatically enrolling people and
leaving them free to opt out is a better way to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000012">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause
4 deals with a technical problem under the Pensions Act 2008 that
brought in auto-enrolment, while Government amendments 1 to 5 to clause
4 and Government amendments 6 to 8 that relate to other clauses will
tidy up some of the detail. I wrote to all members of the Committee as
well as to you, Mr Brady, on 30 June with details of what the technical
amendments will do but, for the record, I shall just sum that up. To
explain Governments amendments 1 to 8, I shall have to explain the
purpose of the clause so I shall deal with that all in one go and not
return to the clause itself.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000013">&#160;</a>
               </p> 
               <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 170<a class="bkMark" name="Column170">&#160;</a>
               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause 4
covers the situation when someone has been auto-enrolled into a
workplace pension and then the person’s membership of a
qualifying scheme ceases. For example, if the employer cuts
their contributions below the minimum level, that scheme would cease to
count for auto-enrolment purposes. The question is then what would
happen to the employee, and we are keen to make sure that there is no
discontinuity in their membership of a qualifying scheme so the Bill
places a duty on firms to make sure that people stay in a scheme. As
currently worded, before we drafted clause 4, there was a danger that,
unless people actively consented to going back into a scheme, it would
not happen. Indeed, the effect of the law as previously drafted was to
make employers non-compliant whatever they did and, on balance, we
consider that that is not a good place for the law to
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000014">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
clause is designed to overcome such a position and to make sure that
people are re-enrolled with immediate effect if they cease to be
members of the qualifying scheme. The clause, as amended by amendments
1 to 8, will also cover a range of subsidiary issues. For example,
someone under the qualifying age for auto-enrolment—a
21-year-old—could be a member of a scheme and, if the scheme
closes, we still want them back in the new scheme. That would not have
happened as the legislation was originally drafted, and the amendments
tackle
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000015">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
shall run through the amendments succinctly. The technical amendments
will amend sections 2, 5, 6 and 54 of the 2008 Act to maintain the
policy intent. This is not about new policy, but about making the
legislation do what it was always intended to do. Taken together, they
have the following five purposes: first, they will ensure that, in
continuity of scheme membership cases—as I have just
described—re-enrolment must take effect from the day after the
day on which the jobholder ceases to be an active member of a
qualifying scheme; if the scheme ceases to be a qualifying one or if a
period were prescribed within that
period.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000016">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the amendments will ensure that there is an automatic re-enrolment
obligation in respect of all jobholders, not only those between 22
years and state pension age—the matter to which I have just
referred. Thirdly, they will remove the unnecessary reference to a
pension scheme ceasing to be a qualifying scheme under section 6(4), as
that is dealt with elsewhere and, fourthly, amendments 1, 6 and 8 will
correct various technical errors and cross-references. Amendment 7 is a
minor technical amendment, which will repeal section 5(5) of the 2008
Act because the postponement provisions are being repealed under the
Bill. As I have said, Government amendment 1 is technical and designed
to restore the original policy
intent.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000017">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
legislation for automatic enrolment is a proud achievement of the last
Labour Government. It will ensure that 7 million more people are saving
for a pension than were previously doing so. The purpose of automatic
enrolment is to extend pension coverage to those on lower and middle
incomes and further to reduce pensioner poverty, which was reduced by
1.1 million under the last Labour
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000031">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Automatic
enrolment was one of the key recommendations of the report of the
Turner commission, which concluded that an automatic enrolment scheme,
supported by what has now become the National Employment Savings Trust,
would<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000032">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“overcome
the barriers to rational decision-making, cost-efficiency and the
declining employer provision which undermine a purely voluntary system,
while leaving individuals ultimately free to make their own decisions
in the light of their own preferences and
circumstances.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000245">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Automatic
enrolment will make a huge difference to the retirement income of
future generations. In New Zealand, there is a similar automatic
enrolment programme called the KiwiSaver, which now has 1.6 million
members. Some 45% of its members said that they would not have signed
up if it had not been automatic, and 38% said that they would not
otherwise be
saving.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
the Minister has already said, when this Government came to power, they
instigated the Johnson review into automatic enrolment, and this part
of the Bill is based on its recommendations. I am relieved that the
review and the Government’s response in the form of the Bill
will not fundamentally dismantle the consensus achieved by the Pensions
Commission. As the Minister has said, automatic enrolment is going
ahead in line with the previous Government’s timetable. The age
bands remain the same, NEST has been maintained and small businesses,
as well as medium and large businesses, are included, which I
welcome.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000034">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Nevertheless,
we have specific concerns about the proposals being watered down, which
I am not alone in fearing. In its submission to the “Making
automatic enrolment work” consultation last year, the National
Association of Pension Funds
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000035">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the
Turner Commission’s analysis and recommendations still hold true
today. In fact, the evidence shows that the need for NEST and
auto-enrolment is stronger than ever, and that the reforms should not
be delayed or watered
down.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000246">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>My
amendment seeks to reverse one way in which automatic enrolment is
being watered
down.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000036">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Currently,
anyone who earns above the bottom of the band of earnings on which
contributions must be paid would be automatically enrolled. What we
call the trigger is the same as the contributions threshold. The Bill
proposes to raise the trigger point at which people 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 173<a class="bkMark" name="Column173">&#160;</a>
                  </div>are automatically enrolled and to make it equal to the income tax
personal allowance threshold, which is £7,475 in 2011 prices.
That change will impact mainly on part-time working women, of whom
600,000 will no longer be opted in because of the
reforms.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000037">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is also a serious question about where the trigger will go. If the
Government continue with their plan to increase the basic personal
allowance to £10,000, that will further increase the numbers
excluded from automatic enrolment. Indeed, when he appeared in front of
the Work and Pensions Committee, the Minister said that if the
automatic enrolment threshold were raised to £10,000 in line
with the PAYE threshold, 1.5 million people would drop out
of automatic enrolment. Does he still stand by that number, and is it
his intention to increase automatic enrolment in line with the PAYE
threshold? If it is, does that not seriously undermine the intention of
automatic enrolment, which was to encourage people who were not
previously saving for a pension—those on more modest
incomes—to start to
save?<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000038">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
whole point of automatic enrolment and of NEST was to nudge people into
a pension scheme, including precisely those low-paid and part-time
workers who would otherwise not join. That is why we want
it. Amendments 31 to 34 seek to insulate the threshold from other
policy imperatives of future Governments, in which thresholds can be
moved for a variety of reasons. Raising the entry threshold ultimately
to £10,000, which is half of average earnings for women, will
mean that those most in need of saving for a pension will in effect be
excluded from this and from employer contributions that come with
automatic enrolment. A woman on half of average female earnings will
have no pension at all, and a woman on average earnings would have only
half of her earnings covered by NEST if the automatic enrolment
threshold were increased to
£10,000.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000039">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
National Association of Pension Funds
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000040">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Increasing
the threshold to £10,000 would exclude 17% of all employees. It
would disproportionately exclude women, with 27% of female employees
earning less than £10,000, and part-time workers, with 58% of
part-time jobs earning less than £10,000. Whilst we accept that
the current £5,035 threshold should not necessarily be set in
stone, we have not seen any evidence that any savings from increasing
the threshold would be worth the
disadvantages.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000247">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
is not the only problem. As the gap between the contribution and the
enrolment threshold grows, there is a danger that a cliff-edge effect
will develop. As the TUC put it, the newly auto-enrolled may opt out
when they see a noticeable chunk of their earnings disappear in pension
contributions, if people are not automatically enrolled until after
three months.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000041">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let us
explore in more detail the arguments for raising the threshold. First,
the question of whether it pays to save and whether people on low
earnings benefit from saving. Throughout the debate on pension reform
we have discussed whether some people will not benefit from saving,
because of the interaction between small pensions and means-tested
benefits. Age UK does not believe that justifies the exclusion of up to
600,000 mainly female employees, and I agree. It argues that the same
applies to current pension provision and that people already feel they
are penalised by having saved. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 174<a class="bkMark" name="Column174">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Although admittedly they sometimes do not understand how the benefits
system works, it nevertheless influences their current savings
behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000042">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Age
UK goes on to argue that saving is normally worth while. It estimates
that 95% of people modelled in a recent Department for Work and
Pensions report were better off in retirement from having saved, and
that for more than 95% the return was greater than contributions made
even after inflation had been taken into account. A large majority
received more than twice as much as they put in, after inflation. This
research and work by the Pensions Policy Institute highlights some
people who may be at risk of not benefiting from saving, but it is not
always easy to identify individuals at risk early on in life when they
begin to contribute via automatic enrolment.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000043">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The argument
about low earners is also based on a fundamental assumption that
undermines it: the low earners will remain low earners. Age UK believes
that people earning at the bottom of the threshold at
present might build up only a small pot, which I will come
on to shortly, but that is not to say that they will be low earners
throughout their working lives. The small pot that they build up while
at the bottom of the threshold may form the basis of much larger
savings as they earn more in future. If automatic enrolment is to
encourage saving among everyone, it cannot miss that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000044">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <h4 class="hs_Timeline">10.45

               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Even
when…pension saving does little to improve someone’s
overall income, compared to relying on means-tested benefits, we know
that in reality many do not claim their full
entitlements”.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000248">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
was much talk in the other place and in the Johnson review about the
replacement rates for low earners. Both of those preceded the Green
Paper on the flat-rate pension, which is designed to provide the same
pension for everyone. That calls into question the debate on
means-tested benefits and replacement rates altogether. I understand
that the flat-rate pension will be operational before the 2017 review
date for automatic enrolment. Does the Minister think that the debate
has moved on as a result of the Green Paper? Will he take this
opportunity to clarify the Government’s thinking on pays to
save, given the future of state pensions as set out in the Green Paper?
If the flat-rate pension goes ahead, will the Minister reconsider the
automatic enrolment threshold, as it would change arguments about for
whom it pays to save and whether that money will be means-tested away
from people?<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000046">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Beyond
“pay to save” is the question of small pots that can
arise from saving at a relatively low level. People are worried that
those on the lowest level of earnings might end up with only small pots
of money, but that is one of the very reasons why NEST was created. It
is not right to exclude people from the opportunity of automatic
enrolment simply because they are below the trigger, even though they
are in the band of earnings that the report acknowledges should be
building pension pots. Indeed, Age UK has argued that many people who
end up with very small pension pots will be able to take them as cash.
People with less than a total of £18,000 in pensions can take
the whole amount as cash under trivial commutation rules.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000047">&#160;</a>
               </p> 
               <div class="columnNumber">

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Even if that
is not the case, anyone in NEST or an occupational scheme can take
small amounts under £2,000 as cash. People with earnings of
£7,000 a year will benefit from total contributions and tax
relief of £157 a year, and people with £10,000 will
benefit from £297 a year of tax relief. Unless their investment
returns are very high, their contributions increase, they have saved
for a long time, or they have other savings, they will probably be able
to take their savings in cash, and the cash sum may well be below the
capital disregard of £10,000 for means-tested
benefits.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000048">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Modest
amounts of pension savings might give an invaluable start to retirement
by providing a cash cushion or allowing people at the beginning of
their retirement to clear debts. To put it in context, the wealth and
assets survey shows that median non-mortgage borrowing at age 55 to 64
is £2,200, with a mean of £6,900. Collectively, those
reasons are simply not the basis for excluding 600,000 people, largely
women, from the groundbreaking steps that would have seen them
automatically enrolled into a pension, often for the first
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000049">&#160;</a>

national insurance—<em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>
                  <em>]</em> It is
about £5,700. That is the how the NI threshold has been
increased in line with inflation; it would have gone up in line with
the NI limit.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000051">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is a
wider question of how the pay-as-you-earn threshold will go up in
future and whether the level at which people are automatically enrolled
will go up in line with it. I believe that three ways are being
considered in the Bill to increase the automatic enrolment threshold in
future. That is key, because although some people have accepted the
increase in the PAYE threshold to the current level, if it goes up to
£10,000, and if the automatic enrolment threshold mirrors that
and goes up accordingly, 1.5 million people—not
600,000—will be excluded. The amendments in the group raise two
concerns. First, the increase in line with the PAYE threshold, and
secondly, what will happen to the automatic enrolment
threshold?<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000052">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Lady is absolutely right. The threshold was
£5,700 last year, but, because of the 1% national insurance
increase that was due to come through this year, the Government made a
substantial increase in the primary threshold for 2011-12. It is now
£7,225, which is about £250 short of what we are
proposing. Does that change her arguments at
all?<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000053">&#160;</a>

to more than £8,000. Both are going up. It would be
simpler—many agree with this—to keep the threshold for
automatic enrolment in line with the NI threshold. That was originally
recommended by the Turner report. Also, there is an issue of how we go
forward on this. While I do not think that there are plans
substantially to increase the NI threshold, there 
<div class="columnNumber">

of the different proposals on increasing the automatic enrolment
threshold the Government are minded to pursue, because it makes a huge
difference. In the answers that I have received to parliamentary
questions to the Department for Work and Pensions, the
Government’s estimates suggest a difference of some
£500,000.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000054">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that the Minister will also no doubt tell us that people can
enrol voluntarily if their earnings are between the contribution
threshold and the PAYE trigger threshold, which will ultimately be
raised to £10,000. Automatic enrolment exists because voluntary
self-enrolment has not worked for most people on modest and middle
incomes. The whole purpose of automatic enrolment is to challenge the
inertia that has undermined our pensions system for decades.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000055">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In any case,
there is the question of the persistency of savings. They might be
small pots to start with, but if people save persistently and build up
a habit of saving—even those on low incomes—for a period
of time, that builds up a pot that may not be insignificant at the time
of retirement. The Personal Accounts Delivery Authority has stressed
the importance of the persistence of pensions savings. Its discussion
paper on investing contributions states
that<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000056">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“persistency
in contributions has more of an influence than investment performance
in ensuring that member returns are maximised at
retirement.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000249">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>In
that respect, a higher threshold would exacerbate, rather than
alleviate, the effects of
means-testing.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000057">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
brings me on to the final amendment of the grouping, which was tabled
by my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead and
raises the important issue of mini-jobs. The amendment makes an
important contribution to this wider debate, particularly on the
differences between the pay-to-save element and the small pots element.
The Government are making substantial changes to welfare and pensions.
The amendment recognises the extent of those changes and the
interactions between them. Automatic enrolment is a major step forward
in the delivery of the Turner Commission proposals. The universal
credit is another significant change on welfare
policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000058">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is important, under these circumstances, that we keep the effects of
policies under review. The Pensions Act 2008 legislated for a review of
automatic enrolment in 2017. Taken with the other changes to the 2008
Act, including those we are debating today, hon. Members would surely
agree that we need to ensure that trends are properly monitored and
dealt with effectively. No doubt hon. Members will refer to the 2017
review. In other areas, however, it has been indicated that the review
process will be ongoing. Indeed, the Government have started to look at
the relationship between occupational and work-based pensions. The
Johnson review recommended a wholesale consideration of transfers into
NEST, wholly separate from the 2017 review. That is an area where
automatic enrolment, if implemented properly, stands to improve in
particular the pensions savings of people who work in a series of small
jobs. For that reason, my hon. Friend’s amendment is an
important part of this debate on how the areas of pension and welfare
policy interact.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000059">&#160;</a>

                  </span> Auto-enrolment and
NEST are very good things. I see that as a sea change in the way that
ordinary working people view pensions. My daughter lived in Sydney for
a number of years, and my granddaughter was born there. I had the good
fortune of going to visit. If someone goes into any bar in Sydney and
asks any ordinary plumber or person who works in a shop about their
“super”, they can tell that someone about how much it is,
what it is worth and how it is accessed. Those people know all those
facts. If someone asked the same question to the same people, but in
the UK, they would find that people do not have a “super”
and would think it to be absolutely mad. They would ask, “How
will we manage in old age? What will happen? How can we possibly plan
for our future?” The Bill is part of changing attitudes in
the UK.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000060">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Like the
Government members of the Select Committee on Work and Pensions, I was
lucky enough to visit NEST. I was pretty impressed by the way it was
taking the matter forward. We raised many queries, and I think
Government Members would confirm that it answered them comprehensively
and that it was an impressive visit. However, I have some concerns. My
main concern is about the attitudes of the wider pensions industry. I
believe that it has a desire to see NEST restricted, because it is
looking after its own industry. Some of the restrictions on NEST are
unwelcome. Without pre-empting the review in 2017, once it is over, and
once NEST has been bedded down and people are more used to it, does the
Minister hope that there will be some relaxation of the current
restrictions on NEST to widen it? I hope that NEST will be a success,
and if that is the case, I would hope to see the removal of some of
those restrictions and see it rolled out further.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My second
concern is that employers, particularly those who do not currently
offer pensions to their employees, will resist the scheme. I will come
on to my specific problems about that in a moment. My third concern is
that the Bill is based on existing working patterns. When the Welfare
Reform Bill is passed and universal credit is introduced,
people’s working patterns may change significantly.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000062">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Regarding the
effect on women, historically, women have faced disadvantages in
occupational pension schemes compared with men. Women are less likely
to be at work and have access to occupational pension schemes. When
they are in work, they often have lower rates of pay or work fewer
hours, and so are less able to contribute to a pension. Women still do
the majority of unpaid caring, which means that they are more likely to
have a break in their career and less likely to have the necessary
number of qualifying years. In order to balance their many caring
responsibilities, women are more likely to work part time, which means
that they are less likely to be able to afford to pay into a pension
scheme. I believe that the Minister himself once said that when it came
to pensions, it is as if women are an afterthought. I am hopeful that
with auto-enrolment and NEST, women will be central to the new
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000063">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As I said,
auto-enrolment is a good thing. One of my concerns is about the
earnings trigger and what constitutes earnings. I have a few questions
for the Minister. First, how will we be able to monitor who is an
employee and who is a worker for pensions purposes? There was some
debate about a qualifying person last week, but I am still not fully
clear about that. European law refers to a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 178<a class="bkMark" name="Column178">&#160;</a>
                  </div>worker, which means that a worker can access employment rights, even
though they might not be classed as an employee. I would like some
clarification on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000064">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
also want clarification on people who are engaged long term by an
employer through an agency, because if the agency has an overarching
contract with the individual, am I correct in thinking that the agency
will be responsible for auto-enrolment? If the person does not have an
overarching contract with the agency, will there be anything in what I
view as anti-avoidance legislation to stop employers ceasing an agency
contract at two and a half months, having a week off and then starting
it again, because that would go against the very spirit of what we are
trying to
do?<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000065">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <h4 class="hs_Timeline">11

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">On
what qualifying earnings should be, I am concerned about the
hospitality industry, in which many people are on a zero hours
contracts. Most of their income is from a tips and gratuities tronc
system, which would not necessarily be earnings from the employer, even
though it might make up a large proportion of their income. Has any
work been done on how that industry will be affected? That industry has
a lot of casualisation, short-term working and part-time hours, and
those working hard and for long hours in that industry would not be
able to access the
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000066">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
has been much talk about the plans to combine national insurance and
PAYE. Will that have any effect on the threshold for NEST? We are
considering the Bill as things are in the world. We have heard much
about universal credit giving flexibility to people to take what has
been coined a mini-job. At the moment, if people take a mini-job, they
lose their jobseeker’s allowance, but in future they will be
able to take one for even an hour, half a day or a day a week. We
cannot possibly tell how successful that will be, but I tabled my
amendment because I want the Minister to agree to hold a review once
universal credit has come in to see whether working patterns have
substantially changed and, if they have, whether the Bill should be
amended.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000067">&#160;</a>

share my concern that, while there may be a growth in mini-jobs in the
future, many women already have a patchwork of mini-jobs that make up
their total earnings? They might have a job for 10 hours a week with
one employer and for 10 hours a week with another, so they fall into
the category of those for whom saving is important, from the point of
view of the replacement rate, but they cannot be enrolled by either
employer because they are below the threshold, and that will be even
more likely with the increased
threshold.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000068">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I agree. As I have said, one of my concerns is
about how employers might resist. Will there be anything in the Bill or
the guidance to stop an employer of a team of cleaners in schools from
saying that the cleaners have a separate employment contract for each
school, so that they would be under the threshold in each contract? I
am interested to hear what the Minister has to say about that sort of
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000069">&#160;</a>

like me, imagine someone being 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 179<a class="bkMark" name="Column179">&#160;</a>
                  </div>employed by a private contractor or even, in the future, by a voluntary
organisation as a cleaner in a school and has another job at the school
for another employer? For example, it is common for someone to have
jobs as a cleaner and as a midday supervisor, but they might have two
separate contracts and the contracts might conceivably be with separate
employers, in which case their total earnings would take them over the
limit, but they would not have the right to be
auto-enrolled.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000070">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Yes, that is one of my concerns. As I have said,
the attitude of the pension industry is restricting what we would like
to do, which is a shame. The pensions industry fears that NEST will
become a huge and major player, and naturally it is protecting its
position. The Bill therefore does not go as far as to link separate
jobs together where there is a link. Under national insurance
legislation, there is an ability to link employments where there is a
link between the employers. I am not sure that that is the case
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000071">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My main
concerns are the attitude of the pensions industry and that employers
may resist this. I have no doubt that large employers will not resist,
but there are some small employers who already feel overwhelmed with
red tape and will find ways to resist this. The Government need to lead
the way on this, for the sake of this generation and future
generations, to ensure that people are provided for in their
retirement.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000072">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One of my
concerns is about how people will understand where their earnings
threshold is, for example if someone has linked employment,
particularly at a school. If someone works as a midday supervisor, then
as a dinner lady and then at an after-school club, those may be three
separate employments, but that person will feel that they work for the
school. Does the Minister have a view on that? When the 2017 review
comes in, will he be looking to amend any aspects of the
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000073">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I welcome
the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate on an
important issue. On Second Reading, I outlined a number of concerns
about auto-enrolment. I was particularly concerned that if the Bill
passed without amendment, it could reduce the number of people eligible
to be auto-enrolled in a pension scheme, thereby limiting the coverage
of the scheme and disproportionately excluding women.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I want to
focus on a couple of the points that my hon. Friends have raised this
morning. No one disagrees with the principle of ensuring that people
plan for their pensionable years. We should be doing everything we
possibly can to save, however small those amounts might be. One of my
worries, which has already been outlined on the earnings threshold, is
whether we are in danger of sending mixed messages. On the one hand, we
are saying to people that it is important that they put something away
for their later years in a pension scheme, but at the same time we are
saying that if it is too small an amount, that is not worthwhile or
valuable.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000075">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I understand
the issues about costs and ensuring that the public purse does not have
to spend money unnecessarily. There is also a danger that it sends
people a mixed message that they can expect to be in low-paid or
part-time work throughout their life and that that is not as valuable.
The problem with legislation is that it looks fine on paper until we
try to fit people’s lives into 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 180<a class="bkMark" name="Column180">&#160;</a>
                  </div>it. We have had good examples from my hon. Friend the Member for Erith
and Thamesmead on the reality of life for many people.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000076">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have come
to loathe the term “mini-job”. These are part-time jobs;
they are not mini-jobs. They should not be dressed up in any other way.
The reality of life for many women trying to put together a number of
hours that equate to full-time employment, to give them a decent
standard of living, means that the state’s responsibility should
be to support them. Through that, we can ensure that when they are able
to put those packages together, we make it possible for them to be
involved in the pensions scheme in an appropriate way to build
something for the future.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000077">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The other
important issue is that the issue of pensions and other welfare
benefits is inextricable. Nothing gets people more annoyed than when
they have saved for their pension and their occupational pension puts
them just over the limit for welfare benefits. They believe that other
people who have not saved are not held to account in any way. Those
things are important and are why we must ensure that as many people as
possible have the opportunity to participate in these
schemes.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000078">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> My hon. Friend makes a valid point that I had
intended to come on to, so I will do that now. There is a
lot of talk about the responsibilities of the individual
employee, which of course is important, but the
state and indeed employers also have some responsibility. It would not
be correct if the earnings threshold was set in such a way that people
lost out—exactly as my hon. Friend suggests—on the other
benefits that might be available, or if employers had a perverse
incentive not to do the right thing by their employees.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000080">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There are
other situations. My hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead
talked about the person who is a dinner lady or a supervisor in a
school, or who has a range of jobs. That situation can be further
complicated by not just a zero-hours contract, but term-time contracts.
Where does that leave people? What about seasonal employment? Some
people have a mixture of different types of employment,
perhaps in the public sector and perhaps topping that up on a seasonal
basis when they have the opportunity. Hairdressers are often
cited as an example. Increasingly in the
hospitality and service sector, people’s employment
status can be quite uncertain. Are they an employee for the whole of
the time or are they self-employed for part of the time? There is also
the position of agency workers to consider and a whole range of issues
around
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000081">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
hope the Minister will be able to answer the points raised this

people who will miss out on automatic enrolment, or 1.5
million if the threshold goes up to £10,000. Does she agree that
it is not just about the number of people, but the types of people who
will be excluded? In the Turner report, the point of automatic
enrolment was to bring into pensions the people who currently save
least for their retirement and who most need to put something aside.
The proposal would exclude not only 600,000 or potentially 1.5 million
people, but the people whom automatic enrolment was originally intended
to
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000083">&#160;</a>

is why I raised such concerns on Second Reading. The way in which the
Bill was constructed had unintended consequences. The people who most
needed to be involved in pension schemes and saving early for their
retirement would be the ones who would potentially lose out. As I said
earlier, we ought to give a message to people that from commencement of
their working lives, they should be involved in planning for their

Australia, where planning for retirement is almost accepted as part of
the culture. From my own family and from other people who have recently
entered the world of work for the first time, I know that sometimes the
last thing on young people’s minds is what will happen 40 or 50
years down the line. We have to change the culture so that people see
planning for retirement as their responsibility, but they should also
be able to expect their employers and the state to do the right thing
by
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000085">&#160;</a>

but everything that she says makes me think of new points. Does she
think there is a risk that if people are not automatically enrolled,
they will assume that enrolling themselves voluntarily will not be a
good thing for them? If they are not automatically enrolled by their
employer—or the Government, as they may see it—they may
assume that pension saving is not something that is appropriate for
them, and so will decide to remain opted-out, even though opting in
could lead to a higher pension income and could also get the very
important employer contribution. While automatic enrolment sends out a
signal and nudges people into saving, it may also send out a signal
that saving is not appropriate if someone is excluded because of the
increase in the threshold, even though, in many cases, it could be the
right thing to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000086">&#160;</a>

hand and the realities of people’s lives in the other. Let us
consider people who are trying to make ends meet, trying to hold down
two or three part-time jobs and who have a whole range of other things
going on in their life, such as child care responsibility or caring for
elderly relatives. If they do not have an easy way to get their
financial affairs in order and, as my hon. Friend suggested, can be
nudged into doing the right thing, everything else going on in their
life might take over.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000087">&#160;</a>

excluded if the earnings threshold increases significantly. As my hon.
Friend said, there is a tendency for part-time workers to work 16 hours
a week or more because they fall into the category in which they can
claim working tax credits. If people were working part-time, they might
be earning just below £7,475. I saw on the internet this morning
details of a team assistant working for bingo, a care worker, a
customer sales adviser working in the retail sector, a housing
assistant working in the national health service, people working in
admin, catering, domestic jobs and as porters, and people on local
government scale 1, such as cleaners. If such people worked part time,
their salaries would perhaps fall £1,000 below that level, and
those are the type of people who will be excluded from
auto-enrolment.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000090">&#160;</a>

people to whom she referred, particularly those in the public sector,
if some of them were on a scale that paid them a living wage, it would
certainly make their life somewhat easier. Indeed, they might hear so
many comments that they also believe that the public sector has
gold-plated pensions and that they do not have to do much more than
turn up for work in order to be looked after. However, many people are
involved in several part-time posts. As has been outlined, many of them
will be working, for example, in the education
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000091">&#160;</a>

UK’s assessment that 95% of people modelled in a recent
Department for Work and Pensions report were better off in retirement
from having saved, and for more than 95% the return was greater than
the contributions made, even after inflation had been taken out?
According to DWP numbers and Age UK work, 95% of people would be better
off by saving.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000094">&#160;</a>

to be automatically enrolled at the pound-one stage, but when people
start paying national insurance we can reasonably assume that they are
better off. Of course, however, everyone would have the option to opt
out if they thought that was the right thing to do in their
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000095">&#160;</a>

and complex their working arrangements. Again, I hope that the Minister

                  </span> I shall touch on a few
issues that have been raised. Saving for pensions, and
proper pension provision, is a long-term undertaking. Over the years,
we have not always addressed pensions as consistently and
thoroughly as we might, which is, perhaps, one of the regrettable
effects of political life and of not having a benevolent dictatorship.
As new Governments come in, they have a tendency to start fiddling with
arrangements—withdrawing this, changing that. Sometimes they do
that with the best of intentions, but one of the effects of such
changes—the Minister spoke about this powerfully in another
sitting—is variation in the pension provision that
people end up with. People who still have the
graduated pension, which preceded the state-earnings-related pension,
which preceded what is now called the second state pension, will know
that the situation has kept changing, which has made it difficult for
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000097">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is
important to encourage people to save for as long as possible, but
doing so requires at least some level of benevolent dictatorship. Hon.
Members might remember that old advert for chocolate, with a
young person who did not care and became progressively more
anxious—<em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>
                  <em>]</em> What it had to do
with chocolate I cannot quite remember. Perhaps it was not about
chocolate; perhaps it was actually about pensions. However, its point
was that often when we are 22—or whenever we become eligible for
enrolment—a pension is the last thing on our mind; it is the
most boring thing of all. Gradually, however, we begin to think about
it 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>and then we may wish that we had contributed, even though doing so might

               <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend rightly said that early on, people do not start contributing to
a pension, but later, they recognise that they should have done so.
Does she agree that that is the virtue of automatic enrolment, because
even if someone does nothing else, they will start contributing to a
pension? When they are in their 40s or 50s and start actively engaging
in pension provision, they will find, if they were automatically
enrolled and had been contributing for the past 20 or 30 years, that
they have built up a big pile of money. Also, even when someone first
starts in the labour market or takes time out to bring up a family, if
they are persistently saving, even while on a low income, they can
accumulate a pension pot that they would not have done if they were not
automatically enrolled.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000100">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> That is very much the point that I was trying to
make. In a sense, people have to be encouraged, and more than
encouraged, to make that kind of provision. In the end, it is both
cheaper for them and potentially less onerous on the state in picking
up the lack of provision. From that point of view, the sooner that
people can be auto-enrolled, the better. Although I understand some of
the arguments that are sometimes made, that we are almost being kind to
people in not forcing them to be auto-enrolled, it may end up being
false kindness. By saying, “You would be better off buying that
pair of shoes rather than saving,” we may inculcate the wrong
attitude in many ways, which people will regret it later, and we will
not be doing them any favours in the long term.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000101">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Johnson
report said that women in particular would be affected if the threshold
was raised from the original proposals or raised in line with income
tax thresholds. It also said that if there was a disproportionate
effect, which it saw, people would be concerned about that, unless they
were persuaded that they would not benefit from saving. The report
continued to address the question of whether that was the case and
whether people would not benefit from
saving.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000102">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
a long-term low earner were to remain below that level throughout their
working life, they would get an extremely high replacement rate from
the basic state pension and any other small state pensions they would
have accrued. On that basis, they would receive a higher replacement
rate, which is all right. What we are talking about are people who may
have a replacement rate as high as 90% of their low earnings, but who
still are on low earnings and who will be poor in retirement. Just
because people have a higher replacement rate, it does not mean that we
do not want to enhance their income at a time in their lives when they
may incur additional costs, perhaps in the type of housing or
assistance that they
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000103">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Also,
many may become single during retirement. That is a problem that many
women have had over the years. In the past, women were often encouraged
to rely on the support of their partner. They would go into 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 185<a class="bkMark" name="Column185">&#160;</a>
                  </div>retirement and share their partner’s pension, and therefore they
would be all right and would not need to save. I presume that that is
the origin of the fact that married women were able to opt out of
national insurance. That was another piece of benevolence that was
ultimately repealed. Some people at the time were not too pleased with
it because they suddenly had to pay national insurance when they
previously had not had to, or when they had only paid the very small
stamp. When the change took place, some people asked why the state was
telling them what to do and said that they had less income. However,
even in recent years, women have reached retirement age and discovered
that they did not have good pension cover because they had been on the
small stamp; indeed, some were able to go on doing it until quite late
because they had the option. They get to retirement and think,
“Hang on. That was not quite such a big gift,” and
complain about
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000104">&#160;</a>

people who will miss out most from the increase in the earnings
threshold, if it rises to the PAYE threshold and goes up further in
line with the Government’s intentions for the PAYE threshold,
are the women she is speaking about, who already have both lower state
and occupational pensions? Given that they are already under-served by
pension arrangements, is she disappointed that they do not stand to
gain more from automatic enrolment under the

is incumbent on us to look at which groups will be particularly
affected by such proposals. If women have consistently been in low-paid
employment, their need for good pension provision is greater, either
because they have always been on their own and will have to provide for
themselves or because there is still a differential in the life
expectancy of men and women, as we have discussed. That can be seen as
a benefit to women and it is sometimes said that, as women get their
pension for longer, they are more fortunate, but equally, a powerful
reason why many retired women are poor is that they do not have
adequate pension provision of their own after the loss of their
partner.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000106">&#160;</a>

other powerful argument about whether it is worth having small pots of
money is to do with what happens about means-testing. Making a small
amount of savings and having a small pension will not contribute to
people’s well-being in retirement, because that will simply be
cut off against some other provision. If the Minister’s
proposals on the flat-rate pension are approved over the next few
years—obviously, we still have to see a great deal of the detail
and no doubt the consultation is being assessed, but I am sure that the
Minister hopes to legislate on them in this Parliament—some

that the Government have frozen the savings element of the pension
credit, which reduces people’s incentives to save? Does she,
however, welcome the proposals for a flat-rate pension and, if that is

automatic enrolment in 2017, will it make sense to look again at the

                     </span>
                  </strong> Freezing the credit was the wrong decision. It
affects pensioners now. Part of the problem with the proposals for a
flat-rate pension is that people who are already in retirement will not
benefit from it, even when the new scheme comes in. That is where a lot
of the campaigning groups have severe concerns that many people will
still have 10, 20 or maybe even 30 years in retirement, not
benefiting from the new scheme and therefore still being affected by
all the issues around means-testing. Therefore freezing the pension
credit affects pensioners now and if it continues will affect
pensioners into the future, who will not have the benefit of the
flat-rate pension if it comes into effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000112">&#160;</a>

forward to understanding how the flat-rate pension proposal can be
introduced without additional cost. If it can be, it will indeed be a
good thing. I do not think any of us could oppose reducing the quantity
of means-testing. The relationship of that to the present discussion is
that if there is a flat-rate pension at the level suggested of around
£140 per week, having additional savings—even if they are
small—will no longer be the handicap that has been
suggested.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000113">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Yes, I think that is indeed the case. We should
err on the side of people being included rather than excluded. In these
situations, relying on people opting in is not particularly attractive.
Auto-enrolment was chosen for the very reason that, sadly, people do
not always look after their best interests and they do not necessarily
opt in. That was my criticism, which I voiced previously, of what
happened with the state earnings-related pension scheme during the last
Conservative Government. People were given freedom to opt out of SERPS
and a lot of people did opt out to their detriment. Freedom is not
always as desirable as it might sound on the
surface.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000117">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
other reason for allowing people to build up small amounts of pension
at times when they are earning is that earnings are not static. The
Johnson report says clearly that the model of somebody who remains on
low earnings from age 22 to retirement will be extremely unusual, and
that periods of very low earnings are likely to be followed by periods
when people earn more. That is the pattern, certainly of a lot of
women’s working lives, and it may be of men’s working
lives in the future as well. On leaving education, they enter
employment, work full time—and may do so for a considerable
number of years—then when children are young they may choose to
work fewer hours because of the difficulty of child care or because
they are making a positive choice that that is what they want to do in
that period of their life. They might return to full-time work when
children are older, and they might have to return to part-time work
again at a later date, particularly if they end up caring for elderly
relatives and can no longer sustain that with full-time work. It is an
up and down earnings pattern. In those down periods, if people can
continue to be covered by this kind of pension saving, then the total
amount they are able to benefit from ultimately would be
beneficial.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000118">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One argument
that is frequently raised is that this is not worth while, because
people will lose out on receiving other elements. However,
organisations such as Age UK have pointed out that it could be
particularly beneficial with low amounts, because it is being made
easier for people to take some of their small pension savings, whether
through NEST or otherwise.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000119">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
currently, as we have already discussed, there is a means-testing
element in relation to capital, if someone has below £10,000 in
capital they will still receive some of the means-tested pension
top-up. Therefore, it would be beneficial to them to have a cash sum of
£5,000, £6,000 or £7,000. They could continue to
save, or use that money to make the kind of adaptation that many
constituents of mine would like to make to their houses, such as
replacing the bath with a shower if they expect their mobility to
decrease. That is the kind of adaptation that will make their lives
better and with which they will often not get help from the state
because they do not meet the required level of substantial or critical
need. They are expected to find that money themselves, and people who
do not have any kind of nest-egg—as it used to be
called—will have considerable difficulty in doing
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000120">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If it is
possible to have small pension savings which can be commuted to cash
relatively easily, and which will not necessarily interfere with
receiving means-tested pension credit—even assuming that the
mean-tested pension credit continues in its present form—it is a

as long as possible, encourages people to see this as an important part
of their life.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000121">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I was struck
by what my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead said about
the attitudes of people in Australia. My Australian sister-in-law also
talks about that, and it had bypassed me that they really do consider
their superannuation arrangements to be an important part of their
lives. Over the years we have struggled to encourage people to save,
and we need to read across all our different governmental policies. I
was at a seminar yesterday for the all-party group, where various
caring groups were looking at the Dilnot report. We are struggling with
how we provide care for people in older age, and with the lack of
savings which often makes it very difficult for people to make
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000122">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As my hon.
Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead said, we must also look at
the proposals that are coming forward to encourage people to do these
mini-jobs, as they have been referred to. Those of us who were involved
with the Welfare Reform Bill will have heard mini-jobs referred to
endlessly. I share my hon. Friend’s aversion to this new
concept, which seems to make low-paid work sound fun, trendy and
exciting, like a mini skirt or a Mini car. The reality is that a lot of
people will be doing some pretty poorly paid jobs, and I am concerned
that although people will have some element of work in their lives,
they will be stuck on a treadmill of low-paid jobs over a long
period.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000123">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Does my hon. Friend share my concern about what
might happen? The importance of saving and developing a culture of
saving is vital. If people come into the workplace on a so-called
mini-job, or working for a low number of hours that might be below the
threshold, would there not be a temptation—as they increase
their hours, their earnings go above the threshold and they are
auto-enrolled—to choose not to pay into a pension? It is better
that people pay into their pension from day one. As their earnings or
hours increase, they would see the benefit of a higher total salary and
continue to make provision for a
pension.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000124">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> That is a powerful point because it again
illustrates the changeability in people’s working lives. We do
not want to create cliff edges or anything that can almost discourage
people from increasing their hours and therefore their earnings. I know
that the Department is very concerned about that because of the
benefits reforms that are being introduced. It is said that one
advantage of universal credit is that it will take away some of the
rather artificial points at which people make decisions such as,
“Do I work fewer or more than 16 hours? Is it worth my working
that extra hour, because it will not actually benefit me?” I do
not know whether that will be the outcome, but the intent of the
universal credit is to smooth things out and remove such situations. We
do not want to have people saying, “If I do that, I will have to
start contributing to a pension, and I do not want to do that because
it will make my position
worse.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000125">&#160;</a>

do the same thing. They will think about the sale rather than the needs

an independent vehicle or a helpline that people could ring to talk

                     </span>
                  </strong> I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention.
Obviously, good advice is important, particularly for people on low
incomes. The advantage of the system that the previous legislation set
up was to create a default position for people who do not have other
forms of coverage through their employment. The future of this could be
extremely important. I want to see NEST being built up. At the moment,
there are issues about the way in which it is structured and whether
people will be able to add bits of pension that they have earned
elsewhere, so that they can secure their position and take transfers in
and out.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000127">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Another
matter related to the question of threshold is the issue of people
having more than one job. The higher the threshold, the more likely
there are to be people who miss out, although their total earnings and
hours of work will actually be quite considerable. It is not unusual
for people to have more than one part-time job. Such work has become
more common because it suits the needs of employers, partly because of
the nature of the work. Caring jobs often require people to do a
certain number of hours, perhaps helping somebody in the morning or
evening. People often do such work for different employers. Some people
work for an agency as a care assistant for part of their week, but also
take on work for an individual, because that is the work that is
available. There will be more such work if people have personal budgets
for care, so people will be working far more for an individual than for
an
organisation.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000128">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Shops
like flexible working as well, because it allows them to take people on
for the busy times and not have someone there all day. It is
understandable, from a business point of view, that they might want to
do that. As shop hours have increased, the amount of part-time work has
increased too. It can be useful for the individual, because it allows
them to fit things around their life. It is useful for the employer
too, but it might mean that people will end up in a position where they
are not auto-enrolled in any of their employments, or are perhaps
auto-enrolled in only one of their employments. The higher the
threshold, the more likely it is that that situation arises. That is
why I support the amendment, which is asking for a report on part-time
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000129">&#160;</a>

increases—we have talked so much about seeing it
increase—we have to be sure that there are not groups, which may

pleased that I am here this morning, partly because we are teasing out
the issue on the importance of savings, not least for those on very low

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 190<a class="bkMark" name="Column190">&#160;</a>
                  </div>morning, because for the first time in 25 years I have heard the word
elevenses, which the shadow Minister used. It conjured up an image,
from long before the age of the Mini car and—if I may say
so—the mini skirt, of “Mrs Dale’s Diary”,
John Major’s warm beer, digestive biscuits and all the rest. It
is a credit to how we teach social history in our primary schools that
the shadow Minister has recalled that word. No elevenses for us,
however, as we continue this important
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000131">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Forgive
me for briefly sketching out the context, but here we are, arguing
about how we can tackle the national deficit—we can argue about
its causes, and we do not always agree—but we are also worried
that many of our constituents are building up great debts through
so-called credit cards and the rest. It is not unreasonable to place
this discussion on how we encourage savings of different kinds, which
in this case are pension savings, in that wider context. Most of us are
on the side that it is reasonable to encourage those
savings.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000132">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am bound to say that one attempt to boost savings culture was the child
trust funds, which unfortunately and ironically have been one of the
major victims of the deficit reduction programmes. There must be an
irony there that we attack a savings scheme because we are so concerned
about the deficit. We can reflect on that irony at another
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000133">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
also draw in evidence the excellent work of our credit unions, which
give many of our poorer constituents a way of borrowing far away from
the loan sharks that bedevil many of our housing estates. I mention
that because—although many people join credit unions because of
the opportunity to borrow, not least in the run-up to
Christmas—however low someone’s income, they have to save
as well, even if it is only a pound or two a month. That reminds us
that the credit unions are an example of the institutions that are so
important at the moment, because they instil that culture of saving.
Someone may be on a very low income and be hard pressed on how to buy
shoes and the kiddie’s clothes, but they have to save on a
regular basis. That is relevant to what we are
discussing.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000134">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
recognise, however—hence my eagerness to hear the
Minister’s response—that we are having a debate on both
the principles, which my colleagues have set out well, and the
realities. The hon. Member for Eastbourne asked my colleagues some
useful questions. That is what we are trying to tease out. The
Committee is in favour of auto-enrolment and NEST, and we are here,
looking at some of the details of them. It is great privilege for the
Minister to be able to come here today to give his own analysis of how
he is going to implement those two major Labour Government
policies—because they are indeed Labour Government policies.
Unfortunately, because of the deficit and the way in which this
Government are tackling it, he often has to become an apologist for
cutting people’s pension entitlement by changing the index
linking, and so on. Here, however, he has an opportunity to push
forward the two great social
reforms.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000135">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
auto-enrolment, I want to reflect on my experience in the
Minister’s seat, when we were developing proposals for what
became the Pension Protection Fund and, later, the financial assistance
scheme. This was in the era—I say “era”, but this
was only in the middle of the last decade—when we were
confronting an issue. Companies were going bust, and people who had
been building up their pension savings all their working lives were
suddenly 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 191<a class="bkMark" name="Column191">&#160;</a>
                  </div>in danger of getting, not nothing—that would be an
exaggeration—but only perhaps 30% or so of what they thought
their pension entitlement was. It was one of the great scandals of the
age. Ian McCartney—now Sir Ian McCartney; it sounds strange to
say that—grasped the nettle and urged the then-Government to
implement some kind of pension
protection.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000136">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
met some workers in the steel industry and, if I may say so, the
metal-bashing industry, who were nearing the end of their working life;
hence the urgency of pension protection for them. They told me that
when they joined the company and were told at 15 or 16 that they had
been signed up into the company pension scheme, they took it for
granted. A lot of them said to me, “If I had a choice at the
time, I probably would have said no, because I would have preferred the
extra quid or so to spend in more pleasant ways. But thank goodness we
were signed up, almost without being asked, into the company pension
scheme.” Now, facing retirement, that was a protection for them.
That convinced me that some paternalism in how we sign people up to
company pension schemes is important. The theme that we are discussing
is placing the principle that everyone should be encouraged to save for
their pension against the reality of whether that should apply to
people on low incomes.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000137">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Can the
Minister give us an overall analysis of how he thinks that relates to
our means-tested pension credit system? I know that he is
interested in that. What are his concerns? If we enable more people on
low incomes to sign up to company pension schemes or NEST, how would
that impact on entitlements to pension credit in the future?
I know that he has grand proposals to reform the whole thing.
Nevertheless, those proposals are not legislation at the moment and may
not occur in reality. His reflections on the relationship between
low-income people building up occupational pension rights and our
current means-tested system would be
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000138">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Notwithstanding
the important questions asked by the hon. Member for Eastbourne, I am
still on the side of saying that unless there are really good reasons
why we should exclude groups, the bias should by and large be towards
including groups. One of the reasons I say that is because if we are
talking about people in their 20s, 30s or 40s who are on low incomes,
would it not be profoundly pessimistic of us as a society and an
economy to say, “Those people are always going to be in
low-income jobs. There is no dynamism. Despite all the wonderful things
that we say about skills, training and education and giving people
second and third chances, and the need for all of us to become
reskilled several times in our careers, the people on x thousand pounds
a year will always be on x thousand pounds a year”? That would
be a huge betrayal of everything that we have all said about the need
to enable people to move further up the career ladder. For that kind of
reason, I am rather in favour of people—even those on the most
modest incomes—being signed up to occupational pension schemes,
which give them a foundation as, we hope, with better skills and
education, their careers move forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000139">&#160;</a>

take it to its logical conclusion, surely at £5,500—or if
the Labour Government had still been in control—many hundreds of
thousands of people would still be penalised. Why, therefore, do we not
go to £0, which would present a new range of issues and
challenges?<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000140">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> That is a perfectly reasonable question. I have
listened to my colleagues’ arguments, which I tend to support,
and I am genuinely interested to hear what the Minister has to say
about them. In principle, I have always been attracted to that idea,
but administratively it might be difficult. Ideally, even the student
or young person taking a summer holiday job should start to contribute,
as should his employer, to a pension that can build up. We have a very
flexible labour market with few jobs for life—although there are
more than people say—and people have different kinds of jobs. We
must therefore have pension arrangements that are sufficiently flexible
and fast on their feet to enable people to build up rights.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000141">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Just as we
encourage our children to save—although the Government no longer
do—even if it is only a few pennies a week, so should we
encourage people to get into a pension savings habit. We should
introduce a proper communications system, such as that in Australia,
which I witnessed myself. Such a system enables people to know how
their pensions are building up. We must do much more to communicate to
people how their pot is building, the options available to them and so
on. If we have that system, the sooner we get people into a savings
culture through pensions, the better.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000142">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have
another question for the Minister. I think we all support
auto-enrolment when the individual can opt out, but how will we protect
workers against unscrupulous employers? Such employers might come along
and simply say on day one, or after how ever many months have passed
before the Government allow them to auto-enrol, “Actually, son,
you don’t really want to be in this scheme. It’s going to
cost you money. You’d have more fun down the pub with that
money. Sign this form so that you can opt out.” Perhaps much
work has gone into protecting workers from that situation and I have
missed it, so I should be grateful for the Minister’s response.
There might well be unscrupulous employers who say, “You
don’t want to be part of this—it’s ridiculous,
it’s wasting your money. You’re only 18,” or
“You’re only 22; old age is a long way away. Sign this
and all this nonsense won’t affect you.” I would be
interested to hear the Minister’s observation on that
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000143">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Generally, we
have had a good discussion. I look forward to hearing the
Minister’s rationale for excluding people, including
those—I will not call them people in mini-jobs, because we
cannot say that and I understand the reasons why—in very
part-time jobs. In the Committee’s discussions last week, as
part of my arguments about the importance of social class, I quoted the
experience of one of my constituents. I referred to her as Jill Brown,

               <p class="tabbed">We
have been told that the reforms are Labour ones, but also that they
have many problems. For the last hour or so, we have heard that they do
not work well for people with multiple jobs or if there are
unscrupulous employers. We have heard a whole list of real problems
with the system that were either not addressed when the Labour party
designed it or that have since been addressed. It is interesting to
hear one of my predecessors’ anxiety about people with multiple
jobs, as the previous Government decided not to do anything about
them—I wonder why; I know why, and I will come on to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000148">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
whole debate has been founded on one misconception and one blind spot.
The blind spot was the staggering omission in almost all the speeches
by Opposition Members, particularly the shadow Minister’s, of
any assessment of the burden on the employer who has to administer
auto-enrolment. The shadow Minister probably has the script of what she
said, and if she can find a single reference to that in her whole
contribution, I want her to read it out again, because there has to be
a
trade-off.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000149">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
are requiring more than 1 million employers, many of whom have no
pension system at all, to bring people into workplace pensions. We are
doing that for the good reason that we think workplace pensions are
important, but that has to be proportionate. The problem with simply
saying that if we raise the threshold, we exclude people—with
absolutely no reference to the impact on the firms involved—is
that every time we keep the threshold down, we are incurring costs on
employers, particularly smaller firms that are more likely to employ
people in the lower earnings bands, to introduce contributions that
will sometimes be of pathetically small
amounts.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000150">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Committee should understand that we are proposing a trigger for people
being auto-enrolled, which will be a figure that is lower than the
start of the earnings band, so that once someone is above the threshold
a worthwhile sum of money will be paid in. However, amendment 28 would
realign those figures at the same number, which means that if someone
earns £1 above the threshold, 8p will go in—3p
from the firm, 1p from the taxpayer and 4p from the employee. We would
be requiring Britain’s small businesses to choose a scheme and
to put 3p into someone’s pension, which would bring the entire
scheme into ridicule and
disrepute.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000151">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
the nation’s small employers rose up as one and said, “We
are coming out of recession and times are tough—you want us to
take people on, but now you are

pennies,” we would be laughed out of court. People would think
it was an absurdity, but that is what amendment 28 would
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000152">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> There are two aspects of what the Minister is
saying. First, the onus of choosing a scheme is surely not so great
since the employer can use the NEST scheme. One reason for setting that
up was that it was acknowledged that many small employers would find it
difficult to set up their own scheme, and such a scheme has been very
much lacking in the past. Secondly, many small employers will have
people who are just above the threshold, and employers will therefore
still have the burden of setting up and operating a system, so why is
including those other people so much greater a
burden?<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000153">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> On the first point, NEST is available, and we will
flag it when we communicate with employers. They will still have to
make a decision and the Forum of Private Business, for example, is
anxious about that choice. We are trying our best to make that decision
as easy as possible, but some employers are worried that they might be
sued if they make the wrong choice. If we are putting a duty on firms
and trying to make that duty proportionate, we cannot expect them to
enrol people for contributions of pennies. I find it incredible that
the legislation we have inherited includes no concept of a minimum
amount, but that is the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000154">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Leeds West also said that when people earn above the
threshold, the process will have to be in place. However, as the Bill
stands, if the one employee of a one-employee firm is earning
£6,000 a year, auto-enrolment will not be necessary. I will now
come on to the figure, because I intervened on the hon. Lady to give
her a gentle steer that her amendment was based on a misconception. She
quite rightly said that last year the primary threshold, which is what
amendment 28 proposes to insert in the Bill, was £5,715.
However, since then it has gone up dramatically—not only by
normal indexation but by £1,500. If we took amendment 28 at face
value, therefore, we would be substituting £7,225 for the
£7,475 in the Bill; so we have been having an hour-long debate
about 250 quid. That is the difference between what the hon. Lady is
proposing and what we are proposing in the Bill—although I
accept the point that over time the amounts might diverge. The hon.
Member for Nottingham South then intervened and read out some jobs
which, if done part-time, might fall below our £7,475 threshold.
However, if they were £1,000 or so below—the figure she
quoted—they would all be below her threshold as well, because
the primary threshold is much higher than she thinks. So the whole of
the past hour has been based on a false
premise.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000155">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When
the legislation was introduced, the uprated version of that old
£5,000 was well below the tax threshold, but something dramatic
changed this year, which means that a lot of the figures quoted by the
hon. Lady—her 1.5 million, her 800,000—are wrong because,
compared with what is presumably the default position of the policy
under amendment 28, far fewer people are excluded by the Bill than she
suggested.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000156">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I thought the hon. Lady might ask me that. The
system includes many different thresholds. The old £5,035 which
is in the Act—the primary threshold—is now £7,225.
The Bill uses the income tax threshold, which is £7,475. Going
from the £5,035 to £7,475, we get the 600,000 number that
she has been quoting. However, out of that 600,000, more than 500,000
are taken out by her amendment, so the difference between her number
and our number is about 70,000 this year. I accept that that will grow
as the threshold goes up. If the tax threshold were to go up to
£8,105 next year, we are talking about getting on for another
100,000. If we go up to £10,000—remember that that is
nominal—the Johnson review said 1.4 million, but we have just
knocked out about 500,000 because she wants to go to £7,225, so
we are down to 0.9 million. However, that is based on £10,000
today, not on £10,000 by the end of the Parliament, which is the
coalition agreement commitment, so those are all overstatements of the
impact.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000158">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady is absolutely right that there are more women than men in
those bands—that is clearly true—so the measure will have
more impact on women than men. I do not dispute that for a second, but
the proportions of women and men are pretty much the same—the
extra thousands do not radically change the proportion. If we look at
the move from £5,035 to the tax threshold, 78% of the people
excluded are women; if we move up to the new tax threshold next year,
it is 76%; and if we move up to £10,000, it is 77%. So the
principle—the fact—that there are more women low-paid
workers is given, so the policy has greater effect on women than
men.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000159">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Intriguingly
however, if we take the Labour party approach, less money would be
required from many lowish-paid workers under auto-enrolment than we
will require, because Labour wants to apply contributions only above
the £7,225 number, whereas we want to apply them back down to
something like the lower earnings limit—a number of about
£5,000 that has not yet been determined. In other words, once
people are above the trigger, they will pay on the band of earnings
down to the floor, whereas the Labour party position is that once
people are above the trigger they pay on the marginal penny. So people
who are above the trigger—on, say, £8,000 in
2011-12—will put more money into their pensions under our
proposals than under the amendment. We have heard so much about how
important it is for low-paid workers to save, but £8,000 or
£9,000 is not well paid, and many of them would put less in
under her proposal than under ours. That is the fundamental problem
with the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000160">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">There
was a suggestion that with our proposal there will be a cliff edge, but
it will be relatively modest. If an earnings band starts at, say,
£5,000 and the trigger is £8,000, the band would be
applied to the £3,000, and 8%, when it is all fully in, is
£240, or £5 a week. That is split between the employee
and the employer, so it is a couple of pounds a week. That is a step,
and we think it should be a step to get people in, but it is not the
massive cliff edge that has been suggested.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000161">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Let us suppose that auto-enrolment starts in 2012,
and we use the income tax threshold of 2012-13, which the Chancellor
announced will be £8,105. A decision has not been made, but if
we used the earnings band down to the lower earnings limit of
£5,500, the band would apply on around £2,600. As the
right hon. Gentleman knows, 8% of that is about £200. That is
the sort of combined amount that would be going in. In pension terms,
£200 is small, but worth having, as we have heard, but that is
not the penny or 2p that would follow from amendment 28. It
is certainly a small amount, because a large amount would create a
cliff edge, so there is a
trade-off.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000163">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One
point about the Johnson review, which has been widely talked about, is
that it looks at all the pieces of the jigsaw, and suggests a trade-off
on earnings, on waiting periods, and on size of firms. The review tries
to achieve a balance, and to take all the measures together instead of
taking one out and changing it. For example, I said that I was worried
about the burden on firms, but we have not excluded micro-employers,
which we were pressed to do. Some people said that we should exclude
them, but we said no, we must have everyone in because we do not want
to exclude another 1 million people just because they do not work with
someone else. However, we recognise the burden on small firms, so we
raised the threshold and introduced the waiting period. It is important
to see all the different elements as part of a whole, instead of
picking apart individual bits and unbalancing them. The impact on
employers is significant, and the change helps with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000164">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The Johnson review considered that, but so did the
Turner report before it. In fact, Lord Turner was head of the CBI at
the time. Those different perspectives—the trade union
perspective and the employer’s perspective—were
considered in the review, which recommended that automatic enrolment
should start at the national insurance limit, not at the PAYE limit.

                  </strong> The hon. Lady raises a series of points. Clearly,
Lord Turner was making judgments in a very different economic world. It
was pre-crash, and since then we have acquired new evidence on
longevity, as we have discussed. The situation on annuity rates is very
different, and the coverage of private pensions has changed. One reason
for setting up the review last summer was that the world has moved on.
We are post-crash, and coverage of workplace defined-benefit schemes
has declined. The situation is different, and the point that I made at
the start about the primary threshold being much closer to the tax
threshold was not the case when Turner wrote his report. If it had
been, he might have come up with different
answers.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000167">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady says that people may opt in, but there is a world of
difference. The fact that they may opt in is crucial. For example,
people who have had higher-paid 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 197<a class="bkMark" name="Column197">&#160;</a>
                  </div>jobs in the past but now have a lower-paid job may be excluded by the
threshold. However, because they have connections to pensions and are
aware of them—they may have a NEST, for example—they are
more likely to think about that issue. Such people are not excluded by
our Bill; they can opt in. There is a world of difference between an
engaged employee opting in and a reluctant employer being forced to
enrol people for trivial amounts of money. It is good that people can
opt in, and it will provide a measure of reassurance for those in whose
interest it is to be auto-enrolled, even if they happen to be below the
threshold.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000168">&#160;</a>

                  <strong> </strong>Since the election, I have discussed pension
reform—including some of these measures—with Baroness
Drake and John Hills, although not with Lord Turner who, as the hon.
Lady will understand, has one or two other things on his plate. The
hon. Lady will know the views of Baroness Drake, who is a Member of the
other House and speaks on behalf of the Labour party in another place.
I have the greatest respect for Baroness Drake and her expertise in
these matters, but unsurprisingly her emphasis—perhaps
reflecting a trade union background, I do not know—falls more on
the side of the individual consumer and I understand that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000170">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">These issues
need balance, but we did not hear anything about the other side of the
balance from the hon. Lady, and there was nothing about the burden on
the firm that has to administer these matters. The Government have
introduced a three-year moratorium on regulation for all small firms
because of the crucial importance of those small firms to recovery from
the recession. To design an amendment that, if it did what she intended
it to do, would put a lot of burden on small firms, seems to miss an
important part of the debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000171">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The previous Government tried to recognise the
impact on small firms by phasing auto-enrolment and starting it earlier
for large companies while allowing it to take place much later for
small companies, particularly in view of the economic circumstances. By
the time that many small businesses become eligible to participate in
the scheme, hopefully we will have seen some sort of
recovery.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000172">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I hope the hon. Lady is right and that in a few
years, by the time smaller firms are phased in, we will be in a much
better place. But a burden is a burden is a burden. There will still be
a cost for the smallest firms and some sectors will still struggle. We
should not put costs on those firms for no obvious benefit. Many
employers will recognise the value of workplace saving, even if they
have not got around to organising it for their employees, and they will
take part in auto-enrolment with good grace. However, we will lose the
good will that is a crucial part of the system if people are seen to be
doing something futile by putting pennies into pensions. I 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 198<a class="bkMark" name="Column198">&#160;</a>
                  </div>have not heard during any intervention a sensible response to
the fact that if the Bill is amended in the way suggested, people will
be putting pennies into pensions. That will create a great
deal of hostility to the reforms.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000173">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The context
of the reforms and where people get their information from is
important, and the point about “Is it worth my while
saving?” is crucial. If we do not reform the state pension in
the way we have discussed, there is a danger that people will perceive
that their savings are simply replacing the means-tested benefits that
they would otherwise have received—that returns to the point
raised by the right hon. Member for Croydon North.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000174">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have heard
the detailed and thorough statistical work carried out by the
Department, which suggested that 95% of people would get back more than
they put in although not necessarily more than what they and their
employer put in. If at the time of auto-enrolment, stories in the press
say, “Don’t touch this thing with a bargepole if you are
on a low wage; you will lose your means-tested benefits,” the
people whom we most want to benefit from the policy and about whom
Labour Members are most concerned, will not save. That will fatally
undermine the whole project.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000175">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have been
asked how this policy interacts with our Green Paper reforms, and that
is why our state pension reforms are so important. The hon. Member for
Leeds West asked how that proposition might affect this conversation,
and it does so profoundly. It would greatly reward saving which, as we
have heard, we want to do. The other thing that it does is to greatly
increase replacement rates for low earners. Replacement rates matter a
lot because, if we are to go to the trouble of auto-enrolling people on
a low wage, there must be a point to it. If we are auto-enrolling
people on £7,000 a year, and paying them a pension of
£7,000 a year, why are we going through all that to take a bit
off their £7,000 now to add a bit on to their £7,000 so
that they have more money in retirement than they have in work? That
seems a strange thing to do. Therefore, the single-tier proposition
that we ought to enrol from a slightly higher threshold, not a lower
one, is complementary and reinforces the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000176">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Erith and Thamesmead cited the Australian example. She
is right. I recently met Senator Sherry. He told me that he comes over
each year and meets a different Minister each time, which I was not
wholly reassured by. As the hon. Lady says, he is in charge of the
“super”, and it has been a great success. She will be
well aware that it is more than auto-enrolment in Australia. It is
compulsory pension saving, but it illustrates the difference that can
be made from such a system and, indeed, the popularity of pension
saving when it is done well. We have gone for soft compulsion,
recognising that, for some people, pension saving is not the right
decision. We have mentioned that today. There may be a set of people
for whom it is not the right decision, and that is why we have left
them the freedom to opt
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000177">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked about the 2017 review, which will be conducted by my
successor but five, I suspect. I do not want to pre-empt that, but she
has tabled new clause 7 about NESTs and transfers, so I shall not
deviate too far down that track. Clearly, the Johnson review considered
that those limits should go in 2017, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 199<a class="bkMark" name="Column199">&#160;</a>
                  </div>and we might revert to that issue when we discuss the new clause. The
hon. Lady asked several practical questions about agency
workers and so on, and the crucial matter is the employment
relationship: whether they are employed by the agency or the people
whom they are to work with. It is the employer who has the
auto-enrolment
duty.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000178">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
was some pressure on us to exclude agency workers, but we said,
“No, those are classic people. They might do lots of different
jobs, but never get a pension.” It is important to include them,
but clearly there will be enforcement issues. The right hon.
Member for Croydon North asked about unscrupulous
employers, and I just want to say, as it will be relevant to all our
debates, that the Pensions Regulator will issue a contract to pay for
enforcement. The enforcement and compliance regime is designed to be
fundamentally carrot, supportive, encouraging and to make it easy for
firms, but it will have powers to penalise and fine if things go
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000179">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
had a meeting with the Pensions Regulator yesterday when we discussed
the contract for the compliance regime. It is something that we take
seriously, and we want to make it as easy as possible for firms to do
the right thing, but we know that there will be a minority that do not.
We therefore have the powers to act and to fine, and to take other
steps. In response to the right hon. Gentleman’s specific
question about the firm that says to the employees, “Sign this,
and we don’t have to bother about it,” he will know that
that is not how it works. The auto-enrolment relationship is between
the individual and the pension provider, and the opt-out has to go from
the individual to the pension provider, not the firm that provides a
measure of insulation. We cannot prevent such conversations from
happening, although it is an offence to induce people on the opt-out
issue. Firms are not meant to put undue pressure on individuals, but we
will have a compliance
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000180">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I understand that, and I agree that insulation is
helpful. Nevertheless, such a conversation could still take place
between the unscrupulous employer and people joining the company. Will
the Minister explain how the Pensions Regulator, which has many other
responsibilities, will police the matter, for example, if it were shown
statistically that 80% of new entrants were not joining the scheme?
Would the Pensions Regulator have that data? Would it be able to
intervene?<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000181">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The regulator will be monitoring compliance. That
will be a huge task, because many such firms will be micro-employers
and do not have employees in workplace pensions. There will be the
ability for the aggrieved individual to contact the regulator and the
agencies in respect of the enforcement, and to say, “Hang on a
minute, I’ve just been lent on”. The individual can
report it. The auto-enrolment process has to happen. That is the duty
and the regulator will know if that has not happened because they will
be logging the auto-enrolment. If someone opts out, that might be
genuine. The regulator will not be able to tell between genuine opting
out and leant-on opting out. That is where, inevitably, an individual
who feels aggrieved will be able to report it. If they do report it, it
will be taken seriously and there are statutory penalties where
improper processes have gone on.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000182">&#160;</a>

that I do not want to fall foul of unscrupulous employers. Will the

auto-enrolled, so that we can monitor
this?<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000183">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The way it works is that employers have to register
with the regulator. The regulator can compare the data that it is
getting on auto-enrolment with PAYE data. That is the cross-check that
is available. Inevitably, a risk-based regulator, which was what the
previous Government created, will focus its resources on cases where
opt-out rates look suspiciously high. That will not cover the
one-person firm. In that case, it will inevitably rely on the
individual complaining. If there are firms of a reasonable size who
show up as having disproportionate numbers of opt-outs—for
example, for their industry or for their size—the regulator and
the contractor to the regulator, who will deal with some of this, will
be able to take action on a risk-based
basis.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000184">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
do not want to create massive burdens of reporting, but we will
certainly be reporting back to the House on the progress of
auto-enrolment. I can write with further details of exactly what we
will report and how much the regulator will report. We will keep people
informed as to how auto-enrolment is working. I am sure that there will
be a lot of interest in
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000185">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">A
number of hon. Members raised the issue of multiple jobs. It is an
important point, which, as has been said, may become more important.
Amendment 37, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Erith and
Thamesmead, would require the Secretary of State to report to
Parliament on trends related to part-time work within one year of the
commencement of the universal credit, but universal credit is being
rolled out. After the first year it will apply to only a limited number
of people. Even the most optimistic of us think that it is too soon to
report on a major shift in part-time work from the partial roll-out of
universal credit. She raises an important issue, however, on the place
of part-time work.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000186">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is worth
not overstating the issue of multiple jobs. I asked for some figures on
how many people have multiple jobs and would have a problem with not
being auto-enrolled as a result, if we use the £7,475 threshold,
which is a tough test. At first glance, it looks like a big number.
Some 540,000 people have more than one job and fall within the age
bands for auto-enrolment, but of those 350,000 are above the
£7,475 threshold in one of the jobs. They will be
auto-enrolled—not on all their earnings in all their jobs, but
within that multiple employment there will be one substantive
employment, so they will be getting into pension saving and will be
aware of it. There are 80,000 for whom both their jobs are over the
£7,475 threshold. Perhaps that includes the constituent of the
right hon. Member for Croydon North. There are another 60,000 who, even
if their two wages were added together, would not get over the
threshold. I hesitate to call them mini-jobs, but hon. Members know the
territory we are in. They are very small
jobs.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000187">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Taking
out those categories that are less of an issue, because they are either
auto-enrolled anyway or earn too little, there are 60,000. Those 60,000
people clearly matter, but if we set up a complex system to deal with
those people who, if we could add their two jobs together 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 201<a class="bkMark" name="Column201">&#160;</a>
                  </div>would be auto-enrolled, but when they are taken separately are not
auto-enrolled, that would be quite a challenge. For example, if someone
does cleaning for two people, and the two jobs together would get them
over the threshold, whereas separately they would not, what would we
say? Would we say that the two employers have to each nominate a scheme
to auto-enrol into, which would have to be the same one? Would the
contributions be split? The overall amount would be tiny because it
would be half of the threshold. As soon as we start thinking about how
we might do it, we start to realise why the previous Government did not
do anything about
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000188">&#160;</a>

fix, and I am not proposing that there is an easy way to deal with it.
As well as the people whom the Minister just said would miss out, does
he recognise that if a person had two jobs that paid £8,000
each, the person would automatically be enrolled, but only on the band
of earnings between just over £5,000 and £8,000? However,
if that person was in one job earning £16,000, they would be
auto-enrolled into a much larger band of earnings. I know that there is
no easy fix, but is the Minister concerned that with the growth of
part-time work, and as more people work in such ways, the issue is
likely to become bigger in the future? Will his Department look at that
to try to ensure that those people are not missing out on the pension
contributions that they would be entitled to if they were in just one
job?<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000189">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Lady is right. The problem would be bigger
if we chose the threshold in amendment 28, which is
£7,000-odd. The situation would be even more acute. However, she
is right. If we have a band of earnings and a floor and we split it
across multiple jobs, that would be a band that does not get pension
contributions. For reasons that we have discussed, we are interested in
part-time work and lower-paid jobs. Partly in response to her request
for a report, regular annual statistics on part-time work are
published. We will certainly continue to monitor those trends and look
at the interaction with universal credit, which we have discussed. We
will certainly be mindful of the points that she raised. However,
returning to my previous point, working out how we might combine the
two is quite a challenge. It is not obvious that the administrative
structure that has to be in place to make that happen is proportionate
to the scale of the
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000190">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">A
few other issues were raised in the debate. The hon. Member for
Kilmarnock and Loudoun said that we should always encourage people to
save, no matter how small the amounts. I am not sure that I agree
entirely with her. I greatly value savings and I take her point, and I
agree entirely with her point about retirees thinking, “What was
the point of saving?” That is part of the point of the pension
reforms that we are looking at. However, there is a set of people for
whom saving is not the right decision, which is why we have stopped
short of full compulsion. We must leave people with the freedom to opt
out. Earlier on, it was said that the danger with auto-enrolment would
be that if we raised the threshold, we might send a signal that we do
not think people should save. However, the converse is true. If we

                  </strong> If we follow the Bill, we are talking about
auto-enrolling at about £7,500 in this year’s prices. Let
us suppose that we introduce the £140 pension, which is
£7,000 a year. Just to deviate slightly, we have discussed how
small pots can turn into capital for a home extension, and that is
clearly true. However, the amount of money that people would be putting
in at such income levels would be tiny. The question is whether it
would be in the interests of a hard-pressed, low-waged mum, for
example, to add a couple of pounds a week of private pension to her
£140 pension, or whether she needs the money now. Clearly, that
would be her choice. An opt-out means that it would be her choice.
However, we are enrolling
her.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000193">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have turned slightly to arguing about amendment 28, but
clause 5 will take us from £5,000 to £7,500 in rough
terms, and that is the major point. The argument between £7,200
and £7,400 is neither here nor there. With a threshold of
£5,000, we might say to a mum who is on £5,000 a year,
“We are putting you into a pension because it’s really
important that you save. You are on £100 a week; when you retire
you will be on £140 a week, but we think it is important that
you should be on £99 a week now so that you can be on
£141 when you retire.” I am not convinced that that
arithmetic works.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000194">&#160;</a>

presenting a static and gloomy view of society, is he not? Basically,
he is saying that the single mum who is earning
tuppence-ha’penny is always going to be poor and on a low
income, and that she is on a dismal escalator towards getting
means-tested top-ups in old age. Yet his own Government at least pay
lip service to the idea of training and skills enhancement—to
the role of the jobcentre in getting people into better work. Surely he
should be more optimistic about the capacity even of people on low
incomes to progress, or has he totally abandoned the idea of social
mobility?<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000195">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> As I mentioned, I think I have done my bit for
social mobility with the Wicks family already. Socially mobile people
who move up the income scale will be auto-enrolled—the second
they go over the threshold, they are in. All we are doing in the
measure is taking out of auto-enrolment people who would be putting in
tiny amounts of money. If someone has a brief spell on a low wage
before training, universal credit, the Work programme and all the rest
of it get them on to a damned good job, most of their lives they will
putting good sums in and will get a good pension. The fact that they
did not put a few pence into a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 203<a class="bkMark" name="Column203">&#160;</a>
                  </div>pension when we excluded them for a year will make practically no
difference to their living standard in retirement.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000196">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In the
depressing scenario that people are persistently on a low income
throughout their lives, the replacement rate is very high without
auto-enrolment. If they generally have a decent wage but have a spell
of low wages, that low-wage period will make very little difference to
their final pension outcome. In fact, the situation is much more
positive than the right hon. Gentleman suggests.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000197">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Leeds West asked about the £10,000 and so on. The
Johnson review weighed up the issues. On page 155 it recommended that,
as in the Bill, the annual earnings threshold be aligned with the
threshold for paying tax. I reiterate that it would be an awful lot
simpler for employers and firms to combine the threshold for
auto-enrolment with the threshold for running PAYE, but although it is
attractive to do so, the Bill does not provide for that. We choose the
number, but we leave ourselves the flexibility, which the hon.
Lady’s amendment does not have, to decide each year what the
right number will be.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000198">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It might be
that £10,000 is an option. Interestingly, Johnson et al
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000199">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“In
particular, we consider aligning the threshold at which a jobholder is
automatically enrolled with the income tax threshold to be consistent
with the Government’s stated aspiration to increase the tax
thresholds to £10,000 in nominal
terms”.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000253">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>In
other words, although Johnson knew that we were considering
£10,000 in nominal terms at the end of the Parliament, he did
not think that the arguments for the thresholds that he was choosing
and the arguments for not going too far were undermined by our plan; he
thought that those matters were consistent. However, we have not taken
a decision on the figure. We have said that we will have flexibility,
as is apparent in subsequent clauses, to look each year at things such
as part-time work, the national insurance thresholds and the tax
thresholds and make a judgment. There is a strong argument for using
the tax threshold, but we will consider the evidence and the impact
before doing so.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000200">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The whole
point of the clause is that enrolling at £5,000 uprated is too
low. It would bring in people who probably should not be saving and
people who would be putting in tiny amounts of money. At least for now,
alignment with the tax threshold gives employers simplicity and removes
some very heavy burdens on firms who employ low-paid people. It does
not have a major effect on most people’s long-term pension
incomes, because people who earn more later in life will be
auto-enrolled anyway. We believe that it strikes the right balance, so
I urge the hon. Member for Leeds West not to press the amendment to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000201">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I have enjoyed this morning’s debate and
the contributions that hon. Members have brought to it. The key point
about automatic enrolment has been emphasised by many hon. Members this
morning: it nudges people into saving for their retirement and they do
not get such a nudge under the current system. However, as my hon.
Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun and other hon. Members
said, the measure also sends a message to those who are not
automatically enrolled. The nudge to them is that pensions are not 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 204<a class="bkMark" name="Column204">&#160;</a>
                  </div>right or suitable for them, so many of them will choose not to opt in,
even if it might be in their interests to do so in the long
run.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000202">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
has talked about the burden on businesses, and small businesses in
particular. I believe that Lord Turner and his commissioners looked at
those issues as well. In their range of measures—the increases
in the state pension age, the earnings link for pensions, and automatic
enrolment—they found a balance between burdening businesses,
which no one wants to do, and ensuring that people get the pension
income in retirement that they need in order to make choices on how to
achieve a decent standard of living. The UK is not the only country to
embark on automatic enrolment; as I mentioned earlier, in New Zealand
there is the KiwiSaver, and although they go further than us in
Australia, their superannuation scheme brings people into the pension
system on a much wider range of earnings. We also have examples in this
country where people are already automatically enrolled into pensions.
The Tesco scheme, for example, automatically enrols workers.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000203">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As hon.
Members have mentioned this morning, we in the Opposition want to
achieve the maximum benefit from automatic enrolment. We believe that
the maximum benefit will come from automatic enrolment at the national
insurance threshold. We also believe that starting automatic enrolment
at a lower level of earnings instils in people a habit of saving and
leads to the persistence of savings. The Minister did not mention the
habit of saving in his speech, but evidence from the KiwiSaver shows
the importance of that. My hon. Friend the Member for Erith and
Thamesmead talked about the habit in the Australian system, and my
right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon North talked about the savings
culture that is so important.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000204">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Members also
spoke about the importance of the persistence of savings. My hon.
Friend the Member for Edinburgh East talked about the nudge into
saving, even before people fully engage with pensions, and how that
persistence can pay back in later years. My hon. Friend the Member for
Kilmarnock and Loudoun talked about the importance of saving over a
number of years, and how those small pots of money can all add up in
the end to a substantial retirement income which can make a huge
difference to people who do not currently have those savings to rely
on. My right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon North talked about the
importance of credit unions in building up a culture of saving, and the
importance of the persistence of saving, even if it is just £1
or £2 a month. It may not seem like much, but
£1 or £2, or even a few pennies a month, over
the period of a working life from say, 18 to 66, can turn into a chunk
of money that gives people real options in retirement that they would
not have had if they had not saved small amounts, month in, month
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000205">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend the Member for Edinburgh East also talked about the importance
of tax relief and employer contribution that people would miss out on
if they were not automatically enrolled. Not only would people not be
contributing themselves, but they would miss out on that 4% of income
that would have been saved towards retirement through tax relief and
employer contribution. Again, this can make a big difference to pension
savings. It is not just that the individual is not putting something
aside, but by not automatically enrolling this group of 
<div class="columnNumber">

               <p class="tabbed">My right hon.
Friend the Member for Croydon North sums it up well when he says that
the bias should be towards including, not excluding. He made a point
about the dynamism of the labour market, whereby people move from
lower-paid jobs and part-time work to higher-paid and full-time work.
He also talked about some of the radical reforms in the state pension,
which would make the bias towards inclusion even stronger, if a
flat-rate pension were to be introduced at some point in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000207">&#160;</a>

notes that I would talk next about mini-jobs, but in order not to
offend my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, I will
rephrase it as part-time jobs. There was much talk about that this
morning; my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham South spoke about the
number of people doing part-time jobs today, and gave some examples
that she found just this morning of people who would miss out on
automatic enrolment because of the increase in the
threshold.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000208">&#160;</a>

threshold and—<em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>
                  <em>]</em> Well, there
is clearly a difference. In amendments 31 to 34, there is a much bigger
difference of £2,000 or more as the threshold rises to
£10,000. Does the Minister not agree that if the threshold rises
to £10,000, the difference would exceed £2,000? He says
from a sedentary position that he does not, but if the
Government’s proposals to raise the PAYE threshold to
£10,000 proceed, the difference between the national insurance
threshold and the PAYE threshold will rise to more than £2,000.
The Minister said that about 900,000 people would be affected, 78% of
whom are women. That is a huge difference in the number of people who
would benefit from automatic enrolment. Under Labour’s plans,
about 7 million would benefit; under the Government’s plans,
about 1 million fewer will benefit if the threshold rises to
£10,000, as the Bill provides for.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000210">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead discussed how the problem is
likely to grow over time as more people work in part-time jobs.
Although that might benefit their incomes, more people will lose out on
the benefits of automatic enrolment. If the Government’s
ambitions in the Welfare Reform Bill for more people to do part-time
work materialise, even more people will miss out who would benefit from
automatic enrolment in a pension scheme. My right hon. Friend the
Member for Croydon North discussed his constituent, “Jill
Brown”, who did several different jobs during the course of a
day. People such as Jill Brown will not benefit from automatic
enrolment.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000211">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Although
I recognise, as my earlier question to the Minister stressed, that
there is no easy fix on some of the issues, I hope that he will go away

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 206<a class="bkMark" name="Column206">&#160;</a>
                  </div>them in conjunction with the Welfare Reform Bill to ensure that the
people who could benefit from saving for a pension do so, even if the
solutions are not always straightforward or easy. If we do not find
solutions, more people who have earned average or slightly
below-average incomes throughout their lives will find that they were
not automatically enrolled because they did more than one job, and will
miss out on a decent pension in retirement. That is an important and
growing issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000212">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Other hon.
Friends mentioned temporary and agency workers and asked who
is responsible for them. I welcomed the Minister’s
comments on the role of the Pensions Regulator in compliance. As my
right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon North said, there are
unscrupulous employers, and it is important that people are not
hoodwinked into thinking that opting out of automatic enrolment is the
right thing to do, even if they are tempted in the short run and their
employer encourages them to do so. It will be interesting to see over
time what statistics and reports the Minister’s Department
publishes on the success of automatic enrolment. It would also be
useful to see levels of automatic enrolment by income band and size of
firm, so that we can establish whether there are issues that we need to
face.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000213">&#160;</a>

Members mentioned the flat-rate pension. It was good to hear a lone
voice from the Government Benches; the hon. Member for Eastbourne spoke
about paying to save. Although I might not agree with him on
everything—I believe that for the vast majority of people, it
does pay to save—I welcome the fact that he is engaging in the
debate and is willing to consider the issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000214">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">As hon.
Members, including my right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon North
have said, the interactions between the flat-rate pension that the
Minister is keen to pursue and automatic enrolment are important
because the issues of paying to save are likely to be much less
important if the flat-rate pension is introduced. If that flat-rate
pension is introduced before the 2017 review into automatic enrolment
and NEST, I hope that the Minister will at least look at the issue of
the earnings threshold before then. Some hon. Members have made the
point about savings being taken away in terms of being means-tested
away. Those issues will disappear with a flat-rate pension.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000215">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">To conclude,
the Turner review delivered a consensus around the national insurance
threshold. I am disappointed that the Government are watering down some
of the provisions of automatic enrolment because, as my right hon.
Friend the Member for Croydon North said, I believe that the bias
should be towards including not excluding people and opting people into
pensions to help them build up the pensions they need to secure a
decent standard of living in
retirement.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000216">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am reassured by some of what the
Minister has said. One of things that concern me is that he
talks about the burden on employers. I would say
that employers are part of society and that there is a difference
between a burden and a responsibility. Employers have a responsibility
towards the people they employ because it is by employing people that
they make their profits and further their business. I differ with the
Minister on that because I see the matter as a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 207<a class="bkMark" name="Column207">&#160;</a>
                  </div>responsibility rather than a burden. I asked a specific question, which
was a little bit niche, about the hospitality industry and whether
there will be special guidance for that, because much of
people’s earnings in that sector is made up of tips and
gratuities, rather than earnings from their salaries. I would be
grateful if the Minister could consider that. If he cannot respond now,
perhaps he will write to me on that
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11071273000217">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am somewhat reassured and I take the point that it would not be
possible to ask for a report within a year because of the roll-out.
That is something I obviously had not considered. However, there is a
principle involved in looking at part-time earnings again because they
will change. Although I also do not like the term mini-job, it is used
a lot. How people currently work will fundamentally change under the
universal credit and we need to bear that in mind. I have been somewhat
