<H2><center>Standing Committee A</center></H2>
<H4><center>Tuesday 11 April 2000</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr John McWilliam in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/110/2000110.htm">Utilities Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the first group of new clauses, may I remind the Committee of the procedure? All the new clauses have already been debated and are therefore to be considered formally. In other words, no debate on them is in order.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. At 11 am on Friday, I received a fax at my constituency office in Bognor Regis of 14 Government new clauses. They are not technical-such as some of the amendments that the Government tabled earlier-but substantive new clauses, which were tabled late on Thursday evening. That is not acceptable. Following his apology to the Committee last week, the Government Whip, the hon. Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope), promised me that I would receive copies of the new clauses in good time. I overheard him telling the civil servants that the new clauses should have been on the Board on Thursday; they were not. They arrived by fax at 11 am on Friday, too late to table amendments to them. That is my first point.</H5>
</P>

<P>
Secondly, even if the new clauses had been tabled on Thursday, there would have been insufficient time for Committee members and outside bodies to consider them or to give any thought to the policy issues arising from them. I refer the Committee to the comment of the Electricity Association:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We do not have any comments on the new clauses and schedules at this stage, other than to say that it is completely unsatisfactory to have significant amendments, with far reaching implications, being laid at this stage in the Parliamentary process.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We will be working up our position on these amendments during the coming week, with a view to discussing them with the DTI's Bill Team, probably early next week. They have indicated that, whilst the amendments will be `nodded through' the Commons Standing Committee, any concerns we have wil  be addressed in the Lords.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the Department's officials are telling outside bodies that the Committee will nod through the new clauses and that any concerns of outside bodies and the interested public will be dealt with in another place. That is a gross contempt of the Committee and of the House.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is not, by and large, a point of order, but a complaint that should be dealt with through the usual channels. I assure the hon. Gentleman that any hon. Member who wishes to debate the new clauses, apart from the first group, is at liberty to do so.

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following:

<P>
Government new clause 13-Restriction on use of certain pipe-lines for providing a supply of gas;

<P>
Government new clause 14-Gas transporters' duty to make a connection.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The new clause completes the practical measures needed to put in place the policy of ending the geographical exclusivity of the areas covered by gas transporters' licences.

<P>
As the Committee will recall, the overall thrust of the policy was introduced under clause 64. As discussed, the motivation is simple: we wish to lower barriers to entry. An added advantage of the policy is that it will ensure that we comply-

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> What consultation has the Minister had with the gas industry on the new clause?
 
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I understand that there was extensive consultation before debate on clause 64. As I sought to make clear, new clause 12, which is mainly consequential, has few implications.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I do not know how the Minister knows that the new clause has few implications. The briefing that I received from GC plc was urgently put together on Monday morning. It said of the new clauses:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>They have been brought forward in a piecemeal way and have not been the subject of any industry consultation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That contradicts the Minister's comments; it makes it impossible for him to say that no implications arise from the new clause.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> As I have said, there are a number of reasons for the change. First, it is to promote competition. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is saying that we should do so or whether the industry is against it. It comes as little surprise when established operators prefer not to have their activities opened up to competitors. That should not put us off-nor should it put off the hon. Gentleman. Is he saying at this late stage that the Committee should not encourage greater competition? Will he enlighten us?

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It ill behoves the Minister to take that tone. He knows full well that Opposition Members have supported all opening up of competition in the gas transportation market, as in all other utility sectors. It is irritating that he has not addressed the concerns that I expressed about lack of consultation. The mood of the Committee is declining rapidly, because the way in which the new clauses have been tabled is unacceptable. I should be interested to hear the Speaker's opinion of how the Bill has been handled in the Committee, especially in the past few weeks.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not critising me or my co-Chairman. If he is, he is out of order. I call Dr. Howells.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I thought that the hon. Gentleman had finished his intervention; it was rather long.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I certainly do not want the mood of the Committee to deteriorate. In understand the frustration felt by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton about the late tabling of new clauses. My hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn apologised to him personally. Having been in opposition for 11 of the 18 years under the previous Administrations, I realise how difficult it is at this stage of proceedings to consider new clauses, but I am a little surprised, too, because the hon. Gentleman knows that the Government are determined that there should be greater competition in the gas industry. That will bring benefits to consumers. I have, however, taken on board the hon. Gentleman's point about his ability to consider the new clauses in time.

<P>
<B>Mr Gibb:</B> I really am getting quite sick of this. When the Minister apologises, he slides into his comments a criticism of Opposition Members. It is unacceptable.

<P>
To address your point, Mr. McWilliam, I criticise not the Speaker, Chairmen of the Committee or the Goverment Whip, but the Minister and officials in his Department for the way in which they have handled the new clauses. I should like an apology from the Minister, with no barbed comment attached, for the way in which the new clauses have been tabled, and an explanation of the lack of consultation.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We have gone on for long enough. Since that is not a point of order, may we return to the new clause 12?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I understand that there has been a full debate with Transco and other gas transporters about the provisions. They do not like all of them, mainly because we have taken away their monopoly. I shall say no more than that.

<P>
Overall, the new clauses cover the procedures to be followed when one transporter wishes to lay pipes within 23 metres of those of another transporter; treatment of pipes laid previously; clarification of which services a transporter can and cannot charge for; and what contractual terms it can impose. It also deals with clarification of responsibility for the maintenance of repairs to ground dug up in order to lay pipes. I commend the new clauses to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I seek clarification from the Minister, particularly bearing in mind the point he has raised about producing more competition. United Kingdom Offshore Operators has raised concern that the pipeline distribution network is not necessarily responding to changes in offshore gas extraction. It fears that the Bill-certainly as it stood before new clause 12 was tabled-is such that there is no obligation on the Secretary of State, the regulator or the transporter of gas necessarily to take account of the need to bring the product ashore. I was told that there could be bottlenecks on the pipeline simply because it was not an economic propostion for the transporter to put in extra capacity for waht might be a comparatively short period or at a time when the product price did not justify it.

<P>
The concern of offshore operators led me to table a new clause, which has not been selected. However, new clause 12 could facilitate competition that would permit a second bypass pipeline to be put in. Does the Minister agree with that view? How does he see the competitive pipeline grid working, and what is the intended effect of the new clause at that level?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> From representations that I have received the gas industry is not clear what new clause 12 is designed to achieve.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman clarify exactly which part of the gas industry he is talking about? Is it just Transco, or does it include other companies?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> So far, it is Transco, whose important concerns were not sought by the Government prior to Committee stage. No doubt, the Government expect their Back Benchers to nod the measure through so that they can deal with the concerns of industry in another place at another time. I find that totally unnacceptable, but it is how matters are being dealt with at the moment.

<P>
In the view of Transco, it is not clear what the bureaucratic new clause is designed to achieve. It is not easy to envisage circumstances in which a gas transporter could refuse to grant consent, or conditions that could be legally upheld. Will the Minister give some examples of when consent would not be granted, and of when Ofgem would find that acceptable? Transco also says that the amendment to subsection (1) appears defective because it assumes that all gas transporters will have completely overlapping licensed areas-they will all apply for a national licence. In fact, that may well not be so.

<P>
Will the Minister address the concern that if one transporter lays a pipe in an area that it not entirely its own, section 22A of the Gas Act will apply? If so, there is no policy reason why section 22A should not remain in place to ensure consultation and exchange of information.

<P>
The purpose of exchange of information and consultation was to ensure that all transporters knew where pipes were for safety reasons. Now, we have a new requirement for consent to be granted, but no one can understand the purpose of that rather than seeking consultation. Is there a safety reason? Is there an intention that such consents will be refused and in what circumstances? Will the Minister answer those specific questions, so that there is clarity about the policy? There is a general concern in the industry about whether the proposals will enhance competition. It is very expensive to build a pipeline into a remote village or small town. If another transporter has the right to piggyback or to it once it is built, without having to pay, there will be no incentive for gas transporters to install such pipelines in the first place. The Government's provisions could therefore result in less competition because they do not permit charging for new transporters.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
It is not clear whether new clause 14 will pass on civil or criminal liability-under the new Roads and Streetworks Act 1991. Will the Minister clarify whether the provision in new clause 14 that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A gas transporter may require any person who requires a connection under subsection (2)(b) to accept any terms-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) indemnifying the transporter in respect of any liability connected with the laying of the pipe<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
includes both civil and criminal liability?

<P>
The industry welcomes new subsection (5B), but it accentuates the gap between connections under section 10(2)(a) of the Gas Act 1986 and the issue about the gas transporter not being able to make a charge for the final connection. Will the Minister respond to those points?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I shall deal first with the points raised by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) about the concerns of the offshore operators. The regulator is under a primary duty to act in the interests of consumers, and relieving constraints on the system could well do that. If so, the new clauses could help. On the problem of possible future bottlenecks, once the Transco monopoly is broken and it is properly opened up to competition, I do not see why, with proper environmental considerations, there should not be other pipelines.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>( Milton Keynes, North-East): One of the issues raised by the offshore operators is that they are regulated by the Department of Trade and Industry while this part of the competition will be regulated by the new authority. The interaction between the two bodies concerns them.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Yes, indeed. We have undertaken to look closely at that. We are aware of those tensions and we shall deal with them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I want to finish responding to the hon. Gentleman's question before giving way to him. The second reason for ending geographical exclusivity is to comply with the EU requirement that objective and non-discriminatory criteria shall be used when authorising the construction and operation of pipeline systems. Restricting permission to one firm in any given area does not confirm with the principle of non-discrimination. Many in the industry would agree that the ability to apply once and for all for a license covering a large area-up to the whole of Great Britain, for example-should reduce regulatory burdens.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I think that I am right in saying that this is the first time during the course of the Committee that I have been in favour of greater competition while the Conservatives have been in favour of greater regulation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman cannot intervene on an intervention.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunel:</B> I thank the Minister for what he has said. In so far as there is a legitimate concern on the part of the offshore industry, the new clause goes some way towards meeting it. The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) asked for details of the Secretary of State's and the authority's roles. I should like the Minister to clarify that.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I shall deal with that in a moment, but I shall first respond to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb), who asked whether all transporters would have a national area. Arrangements for consultation regarding records of gas pipes are covered in condition 32A of the draft standard licence conditions. He also asked whether subsection (5B) provides for avoidance of criminal as well as civil liability. No, criminal liability cannot be avoided, and I hope that that is clear to the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
Let me deal briefly with some of the questions raised by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. New clause 14 clarifies various rights and responsibilities. Under section 10 of the Gas Act, transporters have two duties to connect, in addition to certain duties under section 9. First, under certain circumstances, they must connect premises. There has always been a charge for certain aspects of the work, and what they can and cannot do is set out clearly. We do not propose to change the provision. The second duty is to connect to the system pipes that the owner of premises has caused to be laid-or self-laid pipes, as they are called. Once the connection occurs, the self-laid pipes vest in the transporter. Does the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton want me to repeat that?

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I got it.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> He got it. I repeat that once the connection occurs, the self-laid pipes vest in the transporter. However, various consequences of the duty have been unclear in the past. If the self-laid contractor reinstated the ground above the pipe badly, it was not clear who should pay. Subsection (4) of new clause 14 makes it clear that liabilities-as well as rights-relating to self-laid pipes vest in the transporter. That covers maintenance of the reinstatement and also the possibility that the self-laid contractor did not acquire the proper permissions-such as planning permission or consent from landowners who own the land through which the pipes pass-to lay the pipe. It would be unfair for the transporter to be liable for mistakes over which it had no control. So subsection (2) of the new clause inserts a new subsection (3A), which allows a transporter to take on the pipe only if the self-laid contractor agrees terms concerning liability.

<P>
I am pleased that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton welcomed, on behalf of Transco, new subsection (5B), which allows the transporter to make a reasonable charge for connecting self-laid pipes to the system.

<P>
To return to the point raised by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, I suggested in my initial answer that consultation on the issue of eliminating potential bottlenecks is important and will be undertaken. The authority's decisions may have implications for the offshore industry, especially if the industry believes that the long-term interests of consumers will be affected. That certainly is a relevant concern for the regulator, whose primary duty is to the consumer, not to the offshore industry. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's questions.

<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Is it all right if we take off our jackets?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Gentlemen may remove jackets. Ladies, of course, do not need to ask.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Under new clause 14, if the transporter were to become insolvent, would the risk be passed on to the new transporter?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I do not know the answer, but I shall try to discover it for the hon. Gentleman in good time.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Again, I am disappointed. The answer is that it does. That demonstrates again that we are not scrutinising the Bill correctly. The new clauses before us were tabled late on Thursday, they have not been put out for consultation, industry has not had a chance to submit its opinion to the Committee and we have had only one small contribution from a Labour Back Bencher. As a result, I will urge hon. Members to vote against all the new clauses that were tabled on Thursday.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government new clause 23-Modification of standard conditions of gas licences.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The new clauses are closely related to clauses 30 to 32, which we have debated. Indeed, the overall effect is to introduce for gas exactly the regime that the Committee agreed to apply to electricity.

<P>
New clause 22(2) provides that the Secretary of State may determine and publish standard conditions of licences for each type of gas licence-that is to say, transportation, shipping and supply. Subsection (3) incorporates those conditions into all existing gas licences when the new clauses come into force. Although standard licence conditions are a new concept in electricity, they have been a feature of gas licences since the Gas Act 1995. None the less, the issues in the new clause are the same as those we considered earlier; there is nothing new about them.

<P>
The 1995 Act gave the Secretary of State a single-use power to determine and publish standard conditions for each type of licence. The clause gives the Secretary of State another chance to do the same thing, because the Bill makes some necessary changes to the standard conditions. The modification procedures in legislation should be used to make most changes to licences, but when conditions are changed as a matter of Government policy and in line with changes to primary legislation, a more direct means of modification is appropriate.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Government are taking a broad power but, in practice, the changes needed to gas licences will be limited because, legally and administratively, by far the most straightforward way of making the changes that we want will be to replace all the existing sets of standard licence conditions with new sets of conditions. Inevitably, much in the new conditions will be unchanged.

<P>
Taken at face value, the power gives the Secretary of State carte blanche to make new licence conditions whether or not they are related to the Bill. I therefore offer hon. Members a categorical assurance: the Government intend to use the power only to introduce conditions, or to amend existing conditions, when that is required as a matter of Government policy pursuant to matters dealt with in the Bill. Other proposed new standard conditions will have to be made using the existing or the new licence modification procedures.

<P>
I remind hon. Members that the Department is at present consulting on the second draft of the standard conditions to be incorporated into gas and electricity licences, and the deadline for comments is 31 May.

<P>
The purpose of subsection (1) of new clause 22 is to give effect to a more flexible licensing structure. It is designed to enable the authority to tailor application of the standard conditions to match the circumstances of a licence holder, thereby avoiding the need for him to be subject to unnecessary or irrelevant obligations. I hope that the Committee will welcome that.

<P>
We had a detailed discussion of the parallel electricity provisions in our 14 March sitting, and, as the same considerations apply to the proposal, I shall not repeat them. The same applies to collective licence modification, to which new clause 23 relates, as to electricity licences, which we discussed in detail on clause 32. New clause 23 replaces the existing collective licence modification provisions of section 23 of the Gas Act 1986 with provisions identical in effect to those that the Committee considered for electricity in clause 32 as amended.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following: Government new clause 16-Report on modification references

<P>
Government new clause 17-Modification following report

<P>
Government new clause 18-Modification by order under other enactments

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> We have suggested considering these clauses immediately after considering new clauses 22 and 23 because there is some linkage between the subject matter of the two groups, despite the fact that the clauses deal with electricity while the others dealt with gas. New clause 23 provides for new collective licence modification arrangements in gas. The clauses make consequential modifications to the Electricity Act 1989 to reflect, in the main, the introduction of the same arrangements for electricity by clause 32.

<P>
Sections 12 to 14 of the Electricity Act relate to licence modification references to the Competition Commission by the authority. Section 12 provides that the regulator may refer matters relating to activities carried on by electricity licence holders to the commission seeking a view as to whether they operate against or might be expected to operate against the public interest, and if so, whether the adverse effects might be remedied by modifying licences.

<P>
Section 13 provides that the commision shall report its findings and state whether any adverse public interest finding that it makes may be remedied by modifying licences. Section 14 gives the regulator a duty to modify licences following a report. I should remind hon. Members that we have recently considered clause 128, which inserts a new section 14A, which provides that the commission may veto the licence and substitute its own modifications.

<P>
Section 15 is related, though slightly different to, those sections in that it provides for licences to be modified by the Secretary of State following adverse public interest findings by the commission made under other Acts of Parliament. New Clauses 15 to 18 amend sections 12 to 15 of the Electricity Act 1989 respectively. Although they look lengthy and complex, their effect is pretty straightforward.

<P>
The amendments to section 12 provide for the authority to make licence modification references to the Competitions Commission, either in the case of individual licences or in respect of the standard conditions of a whole class of licences. The amendments to sections 13 and 14 are to a large degree consequent to the changes to section 12. The changes to section 15 allow the Secretary of State, following a reference report by the commission made under another Act, either to modify the conditions of individual licences or the standard conditions of all licences of a given type.

<P>
The resulting Electricity Act provisions will closely mirror the existing provisions of section 24 to 27 of the Gas Act 1986 and so achieve substantial further alignment between the two regimes. We have taken the opportunity to include in these clauses minor amendments consequential upon the separation of supply and distribution and on the establishment of the Gas and Electricity Consumers' Council. I commend the clauses to the Committee.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government new clause 20-Electricity Metering

<P>
Government new clause 21-the Gas Code

<P>
Government new schedule 1-Schedule to be substituted for schedule 6 to the 1989 Act

<P>
Government new schedule 2-Electricity Metering

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I will deal first with New clause 19. It amends section 24 of the Electricity Act to pave the way for new schedule 1, which replaces schedule 6 in the Electricity Act, the public electricity supply code being replaced by the electricity code. Schedule 6 deals largely with rights of entry to premises and powers of disconnection. It applies to public electricity suppliers only. The revisions are mainly consequential and are needed because the Bill does away with the concept of the public electricity supplier and separates the activities of supply and distribution.

<P>
The various rights and obligations in the old schedule do not apply uniformly to supply and distribution and must be distributed between the two separate activities. In general, the changes provide that distributors have rights of entry in relation to electric line and plant because plant and line are part of distribution. Suppliers have rights of entry in relation to non-payment of supply charges and to meters and metering, because metering is an adjunct of the activity of supply and not of distribution, even if, as may be the case, distributors own much of the existing stock of meters.

<P>
Some changes are not simply consequential. A supplier may install a pre-payment meter as an alternative to disconnection where a customer has not paid his or her charges. That is a consumer-friendly change, which gives suppliers an alternative to leaving a customer with no supply. A supplier may disconnect premises for non-payment of supply charges only where those charges are owed for supply to those premises. Previously, if customers moved premises still owing the public electricity supplier money, he could disconnect the new premises, provided that they were in his authorised area. A distributor may not disconnect premises for non-payment of the costs of connecting them to his distribution system. Distributors' interests are sufficiently safeguarded by clause 30, which allows a distibutor to ask for reasonable security in relation to the payment of the costs of providing the connection.

<P>
New clause 20 is simply the paving clause for new schedule 2, which introduces changes to schedule 7 of the Electricity Act 1989, which deals with metering. The changes are mainly consequential and result from the disappearance of the public electricity supplier and the separation of electicity supply and distribution. Public electricity suppliers' statutory rights and obligations in repect of meters must in future fall to suppliers generally, because metering is an adjunct of supply, not distribution.

<P>
One change is, however, not consequential. Once again, a pre-payment meter may be used to recover charges for the supply of electricity only to the premises where the meter is installed. Previously, a public electricity supplier could set a pre-payment meter to recover his debts relating to supply from any premises.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
New clause 21 amends schedule 2B of the Gas Act 1986 to align it with the revised provisions on pre-payment meters for electricity. It amends provisions in paragraph 7 of the schedule, which provide for a gas supplier to require a customer to pay a deposit as security for gas charges of to accept the installaion of a pre-payment meter. Failing that, the installer may disconnect the premises. Those provisions are replaced by measures that are the same as those introduced by new schedules 1 and 2 for electricity. Under the new provisions, a supplier may disconnect premises for non-payment of supply charges, but only where the charges are owed for supply for those premises. He may install a pre-payment meter as an alternative to disconnection where a customer has not paid his supply charges. A pre-payment meter may be used to recover charges for the supply of gas only to the premises where the meter is installed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> We should be clear about what new clause 21 and new schedule 1 do. At present, if a customer fails to pay his bill and it is clear to the supplier that he is a problem, the customer often faces the clear choice between disconnection and accepting a pre-payment meter in his premises. If he does not want the pre-payment meter, he faces disconnection-that is an issue for him. However, the new clause and the new schedule give the supplier the power to enter premises by force and insist on installing a pre-payment meter. That is a move in the wrong direction, and it is not in consumers' interests to have the choice taken away from them.

<P>
 We should not forget that pre-payment meters are a throwback to the old days, when such industries were under state control. It is significantly more expensive for customers to pay their electricity or gas bills through pre-payment meters than by quarterly payments or direct debit. In some areas, meters are 25 or more a year more expensive; in others, the difference is less, but still significant-we are talking about poorer customers who are likely to face payment difficulties. It is shocking to insist that that group should pay more for its electricity and gas. That approach goes back to the time when the industries were monopolies, and customers could take it or leave it. We should not move back to that era, when customers could be forced to pay their electricity or gas bills in the way determined by the suppplier. The choice should be for the customer and, indeed, it still is.

<P>
We are not saying that the new clause will result in customers having no electricity or gas, because suppliers can still offer pre-payment meters. However, they should not have the right to impose meters on customers against their will. That is a retrograde step, and I am surprised that the Government have tabled the new clause and the new schedule. That contradicts all their rhetoric about pre-payment meters, choice, reducing gas and electricity bills and alleviating fuel poverty.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> My concerns centre on the new schedules, which are at the heart of this group of provisions. There are two issues, and the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton raised one obliquely: what obligations will be placed on suppliers in relation to people who cannot or do not pay their bills? The Minister said quite fairly that there is an additional provision on the installation of pre-payment meters. Disconnections should be the last resort, and everything should be done beforehand to ensure continuity of supply wherever possible. The pre-payment meter option could provide a way out that is not otherwise available.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman's main point was that that is the existing policy of electricity suppliers. My point, on which I shall expand in relation to another concern, is that the diversity of suppliers will increase; indeed, the Government very much hope that it will. It is important to ensure that we place in the Bill and in the regulator's hands a requirement that makes disconnection the rare event that is should be, whoever the supplier is. I am concerned about whether the provisions contain as many safeguards as the Government think.


<P>
 There is a notification requirement, but its terms are not precise enoough. There are also interesting differences between the provisions. Paragraph (5) of new schedule 1 and paragraph 7(2) of new schedule 2 contain different notice periods-two days in the first case, and five in the second. That raises two important issues. First, where the customer's premises are to be entered, it is necessary to ensure that proper notice is given. It should be given to an adult, not to a child who answers the door; nor should a postcard simply be stuck through the letterbox. There should be consistency between the different schedules. Why is the notice period two days in paragraph (5)(1) of new schedule 1 and five days in paragraph 7(2) of new schedule 2? There appears to be no reason for that.

<P>
Why has the Minister not seen fit to introduce provisions on the identification of those who call to exercise the power of entry? In the old days, when someone from the Electricity Board turned up, people recognised his van, uniform and name. The issue of false entry was restricted to those who deliberately sought to bamboozle the public. It is my experience that nowadays electricity companies often do not know to which houses they supply electricity. I daresay that every member of the Committee has had billing queries to sort out. My favourite relates to a block of Wimpey houses that look like a single house, but are in fact two houses supplied by different electricity companies. The inspectors read the wrong meters and the billing is carried out accordingly.

<P>
Such matters can be sorted out and we hope that the regulator will move quickly to ensure that they are. I submit, however, to the Minister that the production of valid documentary authority for entry is a matter that should be included in new schedule 1. As he properly said, the new schedule is required because of the changing market. He should take it into account that, even on one housing estate, five, six, 10 or a dozen electricity suppliers turn up at doors trying to effect entry-and, possibly, disconnection. That part of the Bill in not tight enough.

<P>
I understand what the Minister is trying to do, but with the depth of reading that I have been able to give to this group of amendments, I am not convinced that he has achieved what he seeks or what the consumer needs.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, a member of the party that-quite properly-privatised these sectors feels that the Government are responsible for the yawning gap that he highlighted between the amount that some companies harvest from pre-payment meters and what they get from other forms of payment. That is nothing new. One of the central aims of the legislation that we have been wrestling with is to try to reduce that gap, where possible, by a number of measures-most importantly, by the promotion and facilitation of greater competition.

<P>
Ofgem has produced a licence condition requiring companies to adopt a code of practice on access to consumers' premises that requires Ofgem's approval. Ofgem is willing to consider amending the condition to make specific mention of rights of entry-the point that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove sought to make. I will ensure that Ofgem understands the force with which he made that point. It is a proper concern.

<P>
Disconnection should be covered by clear codes and procedures that give consumers every opportunity to take preventive action and help them as much as possible. Disconnection is a legitimate last resort for gas and electricity suppliers in dealing with consistent bad debtors. Poverty usually causes people to fall into debt, but not always: there are bad customers-people who can, but will not, pay. We must take them into account in promoting fair play for companies and consumers.

<P>
Although the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton suggested that it may be a backward step, the alternative to a pre-payment meter is no electricity. In practice, according to our consultations, suppliers wishing to disconnect often find that the premises are unoccupied. It is better to have alternatives that leave a supply available.

<P>
Paragraph 8 of new shedule 1 makes general provisions about rights of entry. It declares that the Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954 applies to all rights of entry in the schedule. The 1954 Act provides certain constraints on suppliers and distributors in exercising their rights of entry: most significantly, that entry may be made only with the consent of the occupier or under the authority of a magistrate's warrant.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The paragraph also continues the requirement to
 re-secure premises after entry and to compensate for any damage caused. It specifies that entry may be made only on production of documentary authority. It allows the person making entry to be accompanied by others as necessary for the purpose of the entry. It continues the offence of obstructing a person exercising powers of entry. It makes clear that a supplier may authorise an agent, such as a meter services company, to authorise on his behalf persons who are acting for the agent to enter premises for a supplier's purpose under the schedule.

<P>
That means that a supplier will not have to authorise separately each person who enters the premises where that person is deployed by a meter services provider rather than directly. A supplier will nevertheless remain responsible for all persons entering premises on his behalf. I hope that that deals with the questions raised.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.

<P>
<B>The Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe (Mrs Helen Liddell):</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
The new clause empowers the authority to publish information and advice that it thinks will promote the interests of consumers. It replaces the more narrowly drawn powers in the gas and electricity legislation to publish information that the director general thinks it expedient to give to customers. The significance is twofold: first, it increases the range of information that the authority can publish. For example, information that would promote consumers' interests by stimulating competition is not necessarily publishable under the existing power. In new clause 11, there is no question that the power would, for example, cover the publication of information that facilitates entry to the market by new participants. The explanatory notes signalled that we would introduce the new clause.

<P>
New clause 11 aligns the scope of the authority's publication powers with those of the consumer council in clause 19. That means that there is no information that the council can publish that the authority could not publish. As a result, if the council cannot publish something because serious and prejudicial effects would result, but it nevertheless believes that such publication is merited, it can try to persuade the authority to publish instead.

<P>
Like the existing provisions, the new clause does not prohibit publication of information that will have serious and prejudicial effects, or that obliges the authority to have regard to the desirability of avoiding them. The authority is allowed to publish informaiton that has that result if the interest in publication is strong enough.

<P>
In addition, new clause 11 places the authority under a duty to consult any individual or body to whom advice or information relates before it decides to publish that advice or information. That will ensure that the authority will take the final decision on whether to publish in full possession of the facts about the degree of harm that may be caused by publication.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Minister for that explanation of the new clause; she knows that we are anxious about information and publication. The core of the proposal is information that would help consumers. However, in earlier debates, the Government seemed reluctant to concede that the Consumer Council would be able to publish material, and the evident conflict between commercial sensitivity and confidentiality and the interests of the consumer has not been fully resolved. We are anxious that the interests of an individual supplier or distributor of gas or electricity may be put ahead of the wider interests of consumers. The director and the authority may hide behind confidentiality to avoid full transparency as far as the Consumer Council is concerned, or be forced to keep back material that should more properly be in the public domain or in the hands of the Consumer Council.

<P>
Despite the Minister's explanation, the impact of the new clause is not clear and our dilemma is not resolved. Does the Minister think that it allays the concerns of consumer organisations, which still have a genuine and legitimate concern, that when push comes to shove, the industry will come first and consumers second in matters of information and transparency?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> Let me take up some of the hon. Gentleman's points. A balance must be struck between getting as much information as possible into the public domain and the danger of fishing expeditions-not necessarily prompted by consumers-that could damage companies. Such information could be supplied by competitors in the business. I appreciate the difficulty of striking that balance. The problem has had to be addressed not only in this country, but internationally.

<P>
It may help the hon. Gentleman if I outline the sort of information that the authority might be expected to publish. It could include the relative performance and efficiency of companies and reports on the state of competition. If activities in the marketplace could depress competition, it would be important to have such information in the public domain. Publication of information useful to those considering entering the market or switching suppliers is one of the most effective ways of stimulating competition, regulating the utilities and driving down prices.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Does that include the performance of individual companies and suppliers? That is the most likely area for conflict between the consumer and the company. The company may not want it to be known that it has a poor maintenance scheme or that it cannot read its meters in the right houses. The comparative performance of those in the market may be absolutely crucial to consumers, but it may be commercially sensitive. Will the new clause resolve that conflict?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> Let me give the hon. Gentleman additional confidence on that. As I said at the beginning, information on the relative performance and efficiency of any company could be published under the terms of the new clause. That would cover his point.

<P>
One critical problem with which every member of the Committee will have had to deal-unless they have been extremely lucky-is that of mis-selling. Every right hon. and hon. Member has had similar difficulties in relation to relative performance on maintenance, and information relevant to that could be published under this clause.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<H4><center>Consolidation of Acts</center></H4>

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
New clause 4 seeks to have the Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989 reprinted with all the amendments that have been made since they became law by the Bill and other legislation. For example, the Gas Act 1995 made substantial amendments to the Gas Act 1986, and there have been a number of changes because of statutory instruments. Unless there is a reprint, the only way to see the legislation will be to look at Halsbury's Laws of England. It would be better to consolidate or reprint the Acts to incorporate the many changes that have been made.

<P>
In addition to the substantial changes to the Acts in the Bill as drafted, there have been 359 Government amendments to it, all of which need to be incorporated. That will be confusing for those who read the legislation, and the public would appreciate a reprint or consolidation.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> In these closing stages, the hon. Gentleman may be amused to know that I have sympathy with the new clause. However, it carefully refrains from avoiding naming those whom it instructs. It is for Parliament to agree any consolidation of Acts amended by the Bill, and the Committee can neither commit parliamentary agreement nor time to considering that. Consolidation may seem simple, but, as with most things connected with this place, nine times out of 10 it opens up provision for scrutiny.

<P>
However, the function of consolidation has been entrusted to the law Commission, which has a duty to prepare and underake a programme of consolidation and statute law revision. In the spirit of seeking to help the hon. Gentleman, I am prepared to write to the Law Commission to ask it to consider consolidating the Gas and Electricity Acts.

<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
The new clause deals with the situation that has arisen as a result of the Bill. Ofgen has powers under the Competition Act, the Electricity and Gas Acts and this Bill to take action against licence holders. It therefore has a choice of powers, and the new clause seeks to set out a procedure for making that choice. Basically, the new clause says that, if the authority wishes to take action against licence holders in respect of behaviour that is considered anti-competitive, it should use its powers under the Competition Act rather than those in the Bill.

<P>
If, for some reason, the authority determines that it wishes to use not the powers of the Competition Act but those in the Bill, it should set out a determination. That determination will then be subject to appeal by licence holders, who can refer it to the Competition Commission. The new clause seeks to set out step-by-step procedures and clear appeals methods so that there is transparency and licence holders may know precisely what powers are exercised by the authority and when.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> As the hon. Gentleman pointed out,
 the new clause addresses a situation in which the regulator deals with anti-competitive behaviour in its sector and chooses enforcement either by use of the Competition Act of licence conditions. I would not expect that situation to arise regularly. Most enforcement matters for the regulator will clearly be Competition Act cases or licence enforcement cases, if not necessarily both. We must bear it in mind that in any case in which the regulator can exercise Competition Act functions, so can the Director General of Fair Trading. They are concurrent powers.

<P>
This subject was debated extensively during the passage of the Competition Act. My hon. Friend the Minister for Consumer and Corporate Affairs explained at out 13th sitting that the Government responded to those concerns by making amendments to the Competition Act and in the Competition Act 1998 (Concurrency) Regulations 2000. Those regulations require the director general and any regulator who may have concurrent jurisdiction in a Competitive Act case to make a decision about which of them would exercise the main Competition Act functions in respect of that case. That decision should obviously be made in the process, not just before remedies can be imposed, but before formal investigation powers can be exercised.

<P>
It follows that if the regulator believes that such a matter can be dealt with by the sector-specific enforcement powers held by the regulator, and would be better dealt with by those powers than by the Competition Act enforcement powers, he should be able to feed that view into the discussions under the concurrency regulations at an early stage. That process rightly gives the regulator flexibility to decide whether to use Competition Act or sector-specific enforcement powers, and which rightly requires a decision about whether the Director General of Fair Trading or the regulator will exercise the Competition Act powers.

<P>
New clause 5 would be unworkable. It would require the regulator to decide that the Competition Act prohibitions had been infringed before he could decide to use regulatory powers instead. The procedures in new clause 5 would, at the very least, create an awkward interaction with the concurrency regulations, which were specifically intended to ensure efficient co-ordination between the Director General of Fair Trading and the regulator. Sensible discussion between them at an early stage would require the regulator to be able to reach a view that the matter would be best dealt with under the authority's licence enforcement powers. New clause 5 would allow the authority to reach a decision only at the end of a process involving a Competition Act investigation, once it had already been established that the Competition Act prohibitions had been infringed. The new clause would complicate matters and be unworkable. It would greatly limit the flexibility of the regulator to decide how a matter should be dealt with. The Government firmly believe that the regulator is best placed to make the decision and should have the freedom to do so.

<P>
Earlier, we discussed in some detail the requirement for the regulator to be open and to consult on the investigations and decisions that he is taking. I hope that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will not press the new clause to a vote. It would not enhance the bill, but would impede its proper operation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Minister is right to say that the purpose of the new clause is to limit the flexibility of the regulator and to make him use the Competition Act powers rather than the regulatory powers in the Bill for competitive issues. The appeal procedures under the Competition Act powers are fairer and more substantial than those in the Bill, but as a number of these issues were debated earlier, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I should like to thank you, Mr. McWilliam, for stepping in to chair the final sitting. It is a pity that we did not see you in the previous 23 sittings, which would have been delightful, as always. I should also like to add the thanks of the Conservative Opposition to Mr. Hood and Mrs Roe, who also chaired our sittings extremely well. We have all enjoyed working with them. I would like to thank the Clerk for his help during our difficult 24 sittings.

<P>
It has been an extraordinary Committee in many ways, with the removal of half the Bill a quarter of the way through our proceedings. Interestingly, we have had fewer sittings than were budgeted for initially when the Bill was at its full capacity. The tabling of 359 Government amendments, including a vast number of redrafting amendments, is also extraordinary.

<P>
I thank all the officials for their work; they must have burned the midnight oil to get the new clauses down to Bognor Regis on a Friday afternoon. We are grateful. I thank the parliamentary draftsmen, and hope that the draftsman who had flu early in the year has fully recovered.

<P>
I thank Ministers for their good-humoured approach to the Bill. I have enjoyed working in Committee with them, as no doubt have many of my colleagues. I look forward to further consideration on Report. Finally, I thank colleagues on my own Benches-and particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mrs Laing), the Whip-for their help and support.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> May I also take this opportunity to thank you, Mr. McWilliam, for stepping in today? At the start of the Committee, I told Mr. Hood and Mrs Roe-both known for their keen gardening-that we would try to finish proceedings in time for the planting season. The weather has conspired to ensure that the planting season is a little delayed this year.

<P>
The Committee has provided the opportunity to explore in detail many of the issues surrounding utilities. Much work has been done on both sides of the Committee, for which I thank hon. Members. The Bill leaves Committee in a better state. Further opportunities for debate will keep right hon. and hon. Members busy.

<P>
The full resources of the DTI have been used to establish how long we have worked on the Bill. We have sat for 46 hours over 24 sittings and debated 96 clauses, six schedules and 730 amendments-including new clauses and new schedules-of which around 260 were tabled by the Government. In a spirit of friendship and co-operation, I thank the Opposition for their contribution.

<P>
I pay tribute to the hard work done by my officials in the DTI and offer particular thanks to my hon. Friend, the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs, who has carried a heavy part of the Bill with consistent good humour, which is amazing in view of the volume of his work.

<P>
We have received exceptional assistance from Hansard, the police, Doorkeepers and the Clerk. The Committee has provided an opportunity for us all to work together and prove to the electorate that much hard work goes into producing legislation. The people outside who have followed the Committee's proceedings are to be commended for their dedication-especially when we got into more technical aspects. The Bill has been unusual for all sorts of reasons and serving on the Committee has been an interesting experience. I look forward to Report and Third Reading.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I should like to be associated with the thanks offered by the Minister and the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, which were well deserved in all quarters. The Bill is important and will play a vital part in shaping the country's energy industry. It has been improved during its passage so far, not simply by being made shorter but because its provisions have been changed notably for the better in some respects. I am thinking especially of amendment No. 745, but other members of the Committee will call to mind other improvements. I assure Ministers that we shall not take our eyes off the Bill as it continues through the House because we see opportunities for further improvement. I hope that I am not trespassing on the Committee's hospitality if I take time to say that we want to return to such issues as information, net metering and the regulator's duty in relation to environmental matters. I thank the ministerial team for their courtesy and work in bringing us material, sometimes at the last minute, but always with the best intentions.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe, and the hon. Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and for Hazel Grove for their kind remarks and their co-operation throughout the Committee stage of an extremely challenging and complex Bill. Perhaps the reason that memebrs of the Committee did not see me earlier is that, until a large chunk of the Bill had been removed, it would have been improper for me to chair the Committee-But that is beside the point.

<P>
It is always a pleasure to be in the Minister's company. I remember well the happy hours that I spent at Kirk o' Shotts radio station when I was a lad. It was an interesting place.

<P>
On behalf of my colleagues, I thank all who have helped the Committee so much-the Clerks and the Hansard staff, including the transcribers upstairs, who run in and out occasionally to pick up notes. Everyone forgets the transcribers, but they are people who actually produce the written word for Members to consider. I thank also the policemen and the Doorkeepers.

<P>
Bill, as amended, to be reported.
