Theresa Villiers</b> (Chipping Barnet) (Con): With your
indulgence, Mr. O&#146;Hara, I shall spend a couple of minutes
responding to a question that I was asked this morning by the hon.
Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris), but which
unfortunately I was unable to answer. It relates to the tax
consequences of removing the use of trusts in divorce cases and
shifting to other mechanisms, such as a charge or
alternatives.</div><a name="06061541000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061541000497"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Iain Wright</b> (Hartlepool) (Lab): On a point of order, Mr.
O&#146;Hara. I raised a point of order during the morning sitting,
when Sir John was chairing the Committee, about the exchange of
information between Opposition Members and people in the Public
Gallery. Between the sittings, I did some research and I have realised
that the individual in the Public Gallery who was passing information
to the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) was a Mr.
Tim Galloway. Mr. Galloway is a partner in Charles Russell, a City of
London legal firm. The firm&#146;s website
says:</div><a name="06061541000410"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Tim
specialises in all aspects of succession and capital tax planning for
UK and foreign domiciled individuals, their trusts and companies in
relation to assets both within the UK and
offshore.&#148;</div><a name="06061541000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the direct exchange of information between that member of the public
and the hon. Gentleman, and the fact that that person and his firm
would have a direct commercial interest, should that not have been
raised in the interests of transparency and accountability both to you
and to the Committee?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column669" />Column number: 670</div><a name="06061541000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000498"></a>The
Chairman:</b> As I understand it, it has been openly
acknowledged on numerous occasions in the Committee that members of the
Committee are speaking to briefs that they have been given by stated
advisers and stated lobbyists. As long as that does not happen within
the Committee, if a member of the Committee goes outside the Committee,
which is beyond the Bar, to receive information&#151;I would rather
that it was outside of the Room&#151;I do not see what difference
there is in principle between receiving information in the post and
receiving information outside the Committee by
hand.</div><a name="06061541000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000499"></a>Vice-Chamberlain
of Her Majesty's Household (Mr. John Heppell):</b>
Further to that point of order, Mr. O&#146;Hara. Is not the
usual practice, though, for the member of the Committee to acknowledge
when raising a point which organisation it has come from? That is what
we were missing in this
instance.</div><a name="06061541000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000500"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I would accept that, because I was not here when
the incident happened. I said in my previous remarks that hon. Members
have acknowledged numerous times in my presence which advice from which
lobbyists and advisers they are speaking to, and that is good
practice.</div><a name="06061541000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061541000501"></a><b class="B">Andrew
Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): Further to that
point of order, Mr. O&#146;Hara. It is up to any member of the
Committee to seek any advice that they want from any party whatever.
Provided that they have no registrable interest with the organisation
involved, presumably it is up to the member whether they choose to
reveal the source of their advice before
speaking.</div><a name="06061541000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000502"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Yes, I cannot take responsibility for that;
members of the Committee must take responsibility for their own
practice. It would be good practice to make an acknowledgement, but I
have to accept that if the member speaking to advice has no registrable
interest, he does not have to make such an announcement. There is a
difference between good practice and legal
responsibility.</div><a name="06061541000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000503"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I appreciate that clarification, Mr.
O&#146;Hara. Throughout our proceedings, I have referred to numerous
points made by the professional organisations. They are experts in this
area and have every right to have their point of view heard. I am happy
to own up to the Committee that I have talked at length to many of
those organisations about how schedule 20 works. Perhaps it would have
been a positive move had some Ministers listened to them as well. I am
delighted that in a number of cases the Paymaster General has indeed
listened to those representations. I believe that the influence of the
people to whom the hon. Gentleman refers can also be seen in some of
the Government amendments that have made a positive contribution to the
debate.</div><a name="06061541000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000504"></a>The
Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</b> I am sure that the
hon. Lady would acknowledge that it is not always possible for a
Minister to say exactly what has been said in private on anything, as
it is a matter of confidentiality. The only point is that if one
receives advice, it is declarable. We received advice in opposition
from PricewaterhouseCoopers and it was declared in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column670" />Column number: 671</div>the register of interests. As I understand it, the
hon. Lady is following the same practice. As long as it is all
transparent, there is not an issue.</div>
<a name="06061541000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000505"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> Thank
you.</div><a name="06061541000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to the point that I was discussing before the point of order was made,
the better way to consider the tax consequences of relationship
breakdown in this context is to consider an example: H and W, a couple
who have split up. Their home is valued when the split takes place, the
house is worth &#163;400,000 and the court decides that H and W
should be entitled to equal shares, but the valuation is followed by a
period of occupation by one spouse and not the other. At that point the
property is sold and the proceeds distributed between the ex-spouses.
The property is now worth &#163;440,000.</div>
<a name="06061541000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two options outside
the standard trust set up that we discussed earlier. In the first, the
husband retains part-ownership of the property. When it is sold he gets
back not the &#163;200,000 that his share was originally worth but
the &#163;220,000 that reflects the increase in value when the house
was sold. He has to pay capital gains tax on the increase at that point
because it is no longer his principal private residence and he will no
longer receive CGT relief. In the second the property is placed solely
in the legal ownership of the wife. She agrees to pay the husband the
value of his original half share when the house is sold. That is
treated for tax purposes as a loan from the husband to the wife. When
the house is sold she pays him back the &#163;220,000 that his share
is now worth and in that case the uplift from the original
&#163;200,000 is treated as interest on a loan and, I understand, is
subject to income tax. Further guidance can be found in the
&#147;Capital Gains
Manual&#148;.</div><a name="06061541000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061541000506"></a><b class="B">Rob
Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): I am grateful to
the hon. Lady for that example. Will the tax paid not be the same or
less if it is capital gains rather than income tax, depending on the
rate at which the husband in the second example who receives the
repayment of the loan, pays income tax? In fact, he might be better off
paying the capital gains
tax.</div><a name="06061541000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000507"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I am not sure exactly how the level of the tax
will vary between the income tax and the capital gains tax choice. That
will, I think, depend on the individual concerned and their personal
allowances. I do not want to delay the Committee on this point, because
we have moved on, but in essence the ruling out of the trust option in
divorce cases means that an extra tax charge will be payable. In this
case, either they have a trust and pay the new charges for that trust,
which are 6 per cent. on capital, or they take the ownership route and
pay capital gains tax, or they take the income tax route with a charge
and the husband ends up paying income tax. Either way, where there was
no tax on the arrangements there will now be tax.</div>
<a name="06061541000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to the point at which
I left off shortly before the break in our proceedings, I was referring
to the problems caused by section 32 of the Trustee Act, which
introduces flexibility into trusts sufficient to take them outside the
limitations placed by condition 4. Of course, the deletion of condition
4 will remove the risk of problems caused by section 32 and it is
another reason that I hope that the Committee will support my amendment
or that tabled by the Paymaster General.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column671" />Column number: 672</div><a name="06061541000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I
initially raised my concerns about those issues and about condition 4
in particular, the Paymaster General dismissed them on the grounds that
people could change their wills to comply with the requirements set out
so that they could comply with an immediate post-death interest,
presumably by deleting the flexibility that was deemed offensive under
conditions 3 and 4. Given her amendment, I understand that she no
longer believes that that is the right response.</div>
<a name="06061541000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">For various
reasons, I do not believe that variation was going to be the answer to
the problems. First, flexibility is built into trusts for good
reasons&#151;to allow the trust to adapt to unforeseen circumstances
and help people deal with the complexity of family life and an
uncertain and often unpredictable future. A rule that required people
to vary their wills to remove all such flexibility would not be good
from a public policy perspective.</div>
<a name="06061541000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
cost of reviewing the millions of wills affected would far outweigh the
&#163;15 million that the Red Book tells us schedule 20 would raise
in extra revenue. I do not think that the Government ever engaged
sufficiently with the figures produced by the Society of Trust and
Estate Practitioners on the number of people affected. In a survey,
STEP found that at least 1 million wills would have to be reviewed or
rewritten; in fact, that much quoted figure is probably an
underestimate of the numbers affected. It is based on the response to a
survey by their members, but that figure represents only the wills
affected that were held by the 11 per cent. of STEP members who
responded to the survey. Taking into account the thousands of wills
held by other firms that did not respond, the actual figure may well
have been much
higher.</div><a name="06061541000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Edward Nugee
QC wrote to a national newspaper
saying:</div><a name="06061541000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
effect of the new measure is that virtually every will in the country
that has been prepared on legal advice will need to be rewritten, and
trusts of virtually every settlement for the benefit of children and
grandchildren which has been drafted to comply with fiscal statutes
which have been in existence for the past 30 years or more will need to
be altered, if its terms allow such alteration.&#148;</div>
<a name="06061541000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Remember that with the best
will in the world, very few people review their wills regularly. Wills
are therefore drafted so that they can provide for changing
circumstances over a long period. A point well made by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants is that even if an estate is under the IHT
threshold, even if the property it comprises is fairly modest, it would
be a high-risk strategy for the majority of middle-income families to
assume that it would never exceed the IHT nil rate band. They would
therefore have to write a will that took into account the IHT
consequences should their property exceed that nil rate band at any
point.</div><a name="06061541000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">When they
drafted schedule 20, the Government did not seem to grasp that the
number of wills using trusts will far outstrip the number of trusts
that ultimately come into being. That is because wills frequently
deploy the trust concept to provide for events that may never
occur&#151;for example, a parent dying before her children have grown
up. Trusts are included in virtually every will drafted, with
professional advice, by people who have children. In many cases, the
testator may not even realise that she is setting up a trust; the will
may simply say, &#147;I wish my husband to be able to live in the
house until his death, and then it goes to our
children.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column672" />Column number: 673</div><a name="06061541000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">A further STEP
survey finding concluded that the estimated average cost of reviewing
each will would be about &#163;341. Compliance costs of &#163;341
million make no sense for a tax measure predicted to raise
only &#163;15 million.</div>
<a name="06061541000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third reason why variation
of wills is not a sufficient answer is that for many it will be too
late to do it. Many people may be so old as to have lost capacity,
leaving the grim and very expensive prospect of a visit to the Court of
Protection to make any necessary changes. If the testator has died
since Budget day, the only way to amend the will is via a deed of
variation, but that can be executed only if all those who stand to
benefit under the will consent to it. If there are any children, a
court hearing will be required and permission for the variation may not
be granted. Even if all the beneficiaries are adult, it may not be
possible to secure an agreement, particularly in the typical case, to
which I have adverted, in which trusts balance the interests of
step-parents and step-children.</div>
<a name="06061541000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similar problems apply in
respect of existing trusts that would be hit by the harshness of
schedule 20 as originally drafted. Again, in many cases, court hearings
will be needed to vary a trust. Let me make it clear that a hearing in
the chancery division of the High Court does not come cheap. Questions
would also arise about how well equipped the courts would be to hear a
significant number of cases under schedule
20.</div><a name="06061541000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">To conclude on the
spouse exemption, I refer to a Southampton solicitor, who dealt with
wills regularly over a protracted period. He wrote to his local Member
of Parliament, the hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne),
saying:</div><a name="06061541000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
almost impossible to create an immediate post death
interest.</div><a name="06061541000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">However who
drafted the provisions about it in the Finance Bill did not know enough
about trust law or about provisions that individuals want to put in
their wills when they create trusts of this kind...If the immediate

David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): It is a
great pleasure to return to draft section 49A of the Inheritance Tax
Act 1984 to which I referred when we discussed matters in Committee of
the whole House, and to deal with amendment No. 226 and Government
amendment No. 359. Widespread anxiety has been expressed that the
amendments in respect of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column673" />Column number: 674</div>trust law under the original Finance Bill would cause problems in those
areas when trusts are used not for taxation purposes, but non-taxation
purposes. The classic case is that of someone who is divorced but has
remarried. On his death, for argument&#146;s sake, the husband wants
the second wife to continue to live in the house, but would like the
children of the first marriage ultimately to receive the benefit of the
capital. It is a common circumstance and I should declare an interest
in that it could relate to the circumstances of my parents. I know that
there is a temptation to think that inheritance tax applies only to
venture capitalists living in Belgravia, but it could relate to a
retired police officer living in
Lincolnshire.</div><a name="06061541000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difficulty is that the Government tried to address the matter within
proposed section 49A, but it did not work because the conditions set
out were far too prescriptive and inflexible. As a consequence, there
was a welter of professional advice&#151;Labour Members might have
resented it&#151;saying that, in reality, most trusts created in such
circumstances will have more flexibility than is allowed under the
Finance Bill. I asked the precise question on the Floor of the House,
when I said,</div><a name="06061541000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the advice
provided by professional after professional is that what the Government

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000509"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> That is a statement of fact. When I speak to
the amendments, I shall be making my intention clear. If anything, the
hon. Gentleman challenged me personally about that point and he also
challenged the legislation. As the presence of the amendments before us
makes clear, my intention as a Minister was not delivered&#151;I
concede that, and I said it clearly on Second Reading and in Committee
of the whole House&#151;but the amendments will secure that
intention.</div><a name="06061541000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000510"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> May I put the exchange in context? Like the shadow
Chief Secretary to the Treasury, my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping
Barnet (Mrs. Villiers), I was addressing conditions 3 and 4. I said
that the conditions were so drafted that the vast majority of wills
created in such circumstances would create trusts in breach of them. It
is correct that I challenged the legislation&#151;that is precisely
what I did, although I do not doubt that the Paymaster General&#146;s
intention was to allow
it.</div><a name="06061541000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000511"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> What is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point? Is
he saying that my interpretation at the time of Committee of the whole
House was incorrect? If so, why does he not just say that and then sit
down and let me move the Government
amendments?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column674" />Column number: 675</div><a name="06061541000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000512"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Will the Paymaster General be patient, given that
she was very gracious to my hon. Friend the shadow Chief Secretary this
morning? I shall proceed as appropriate, because the Government may
well have had a certain intention, but the reality was that they
produced draft legislation that woefully failed to achieve it. The
draft legislation did not allow the flexibility that exists in the vast
majority of
wills.</div><a name="06061541000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000513"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Would the hon. Gentleman like me to list all
the occasions on which the same thing happened under the previous
Government and up to 1997, because unfortunately they are not unknown?
Shall I start with loan
relationships?</div><a name="06061541000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000514"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> May I just make my simple point without further
interruption, because we want to proceed. <i class="I">[I</i><i class="I">nterruption.]</i>
The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) says that he
is willing to bet that I do not speak to Mrs. Gauke like that, and he
is absolutely right. Never a truer word has been said in the Committee.
Nevertheless, the point that I am trying to make is that the Government
produced legislation that was defective: it did not achieve what we
understood to be the Government&#146;s aims. The Paymaster General
has said that the intention was to allow flexibility to cover the
circumstances that I addressed. The point on which we disagreed is that
I said it would not work, and she said it would&#151;and I was right
and she was wrong. That is the essence of it.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i></div><a name="06061541000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000515"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I know that some hon. Members are getting
worked up about exciting events at 5 o&#146;clock, but could we have
more order in the debate? Although the Minister deferred her right to
speak when I called her, I invite her, once the hon. Gentleman has
finished, to move her amendments. That might facilitate further
debate.</div><a name="06061541000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000516"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Thank you, Mr. O&#146;Hara. The question for the
Committee is why the Government got it wrong, which comes back to the
fundamental point about this trust legislation. On Tuesday, the
Paymaster General said that there was a lot of confusion about the
provisions. Sometimes, when she says that there is confusion, she
actually means that there is disagreement with and opposition to her
ideas, and there was a lot of disagreement with this idea, because the
Government failed to realise that professionals would advise
individuals to set up trusts in a practical way, and that there would
be that flexibility. The reason why they failed to realise that was
that they had not consulted; they rushed into the legislation for
reasons that even now remain unclear, although I suspect that the
Government were driven as much by political objectives as by trying to
deter tax evasion. None the less, they made a
mistake.</div><a name="06061541000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Paymaster
General was perhaps more gracious this morning than she has been this
afternoon, but she has acknowledged that a mistake was made. However,
in future legislation we should bear in mind the difficulties that are
caused when something is rushed through in a technical area without the
expertise of outside professionals who know how this works in practice.
That is a serious mistake that the Government have made and they should
not do so again.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column675" />Column number: 676</div><a name="06061541000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000517"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The outside advisers are not too far away. Some
of them are sitting in the Public Gallery. In tabling the amendments,
as I made clear to the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet this morning in
an intervention, I have not changed my approach. Nor has the
Government&#146;s intention changed. I well remember when such
amendments had to be tabled in the past by Conservative
Ministers&#151;I see that the ex-Financial Secretary is leaving the
room now. In accordance with what I explained to the House on Second
Reading and in Committee of the whole House, what I require in terms of
spouse relief is now provided in the amendments.</div>
<a name="06061541000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would I have
preferred not to have tabled the amendments? Yes. Could I have not
tabled them? Did I really have a dastardly plan to get rid of spouse
relief or to severely restrict it, as the Opposition suggested? I shall
not be so ungracious as to quote back to the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) or his hon. Friend the Member for Chipping
Barnet the number of times in Committee that the previous Government,
or current members of the Committee, might have advanced something that
was not accurate. It
happens.</div><a name="06061541000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendments provide for the intentions that I explained to
the Committee of the whole House. Even so, let us remind ourselves that
very few estates pay inheritance tax. Some 94 per cent. do not. They do
not come into the equation. The number of IHT-paying estates was 34,000
last year. The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Lady argued that millions of
people would be dragged into the IHT net and would consequently have to
revisit their wills, even though they know from their legal
qualifications that solicitors and professionals advise people
regularly to return to their wills. They were, let us be generous,
rather overstating the
case.</div><a name="06061541000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
existing wills make outright bequests to the surviving spouse or are
set up to ensure that both the husband and wife use the full IHT
threshold with the so-called nil-rate band trust. These wills are quite
unaffected by schedule 20. But where wills provide for a trust that is
large enough to be potentially caught they will often either satisfy
the conditions in schedule 20 or be brought into compliance after the
testator&#146;s death using the long-standing IHT provisions. The
suggestion that millions needed to rewrite their wills might not have
been as accurate as it could have been and might even have been an
inflated number. However, as the hon. Lady said, the Government
amendments will remove some of the conditions required to set up an
immediate post-death interest. That will ensure that trusts set up on
death to provide for a surviving spouse or civil partner will
automatically qualify for the spouse relief.</div>
<a name="06061541000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">If, at a later date, such an
interest is terminated and followed by further trusts, IHT will be
charged accordingly by reference to the facts at the time. That
approach will accommodate the sort of flexible powers used in the more
sophisticated arrangements. That flexibility will also make it easier
for people thinking about providing for a trust in their will to be
happy that those arrangements will be suited to a range of different
circumstances.</div><a name="06061541000446"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="06061541000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Opposition
finance spokespersons, and others, often do not express their views
directly to the Minister concerned, but via circuitous routes such as
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column676" />Column number: 677</div>newspapers. The hon. Lady has also acknowledged that
her amendments and those of the Government have the same intention. I
acknowledge that in return. Her intention is clear, and if her
amendments worked, I would be in a slightly different position and
hopefully would be able to say to the Committee, &#147;They work, and
that is our intention.&#148;</div>
<a name="06061541000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said to the hon. Lady that
although the consequential amendments cover broadly similar areas, they
will not always work in practice. I do not advance that as a criticism;
it is a difficult issue, and I acknowledge that the Government have
access to parliamentary counsel, which is crucial in such
circumstances. So there is a difficulty, particularly for the
Opposition, but I hope that she will accept&#151;I think that she
already has&#151;that the Government amendments cover the same
territory. She was good enough to acknowledge this morning on a point
of order that I said that on reflection I might have used slightly
different language when approaching some of the subjects before
us.</div> <a name="06061541000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion to
my remarks on the Government amendments, I would like to make it clear
to the Opposition, who might wish to criticise the initial drafting,
that I have not changed my mind and have delivered what I thought and
was advised was in the Bill. That will be in the Bill if the amendments
are carried, and it is better for that. I commend the amendments to the
Committee.</div><a name="06061541000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061541000518"></a><b class="B">Mr.

that I shall be brief. I too commend the Paymaster General for her

<a name="06061541000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could not sleep last night so
I did what most people do who cannot sleep&#151;I went on the

<a name="06061541000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also received a press release

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000521"></a>Mrs.

shadow Chief Secretary&#151;and not quite such an excellent speech by
me. I do not recall the hon. Gentleman contributing to the debate. The
reaction of the Paymaster General to Opposition Members who made
precisely those points on conditions 3 and 4 was generally to abuse
them. I do not remember the hon. Gentleman joining

intervention? Some of us ex-lawyers have spent the last year finding
out about the procedures of Parliament, and I understand that on Second
Reading and during the Standing Committee stage things often change.
Indeed, it is possible that a constructive and sensible Paymaster
General might listen to the discussions while the legislation is going
through the House rather than making cheap points. During the past 13
months, rather than boasting of the fact that I am a lawyer with a
practice certificate, I have come to understand how the parliamentary
process works. When the Paymaster General and the Treasury are willing
to listen to the concerns of ordinary residents and, dare I say it, of
hon. Members on the Government Benches&#151;that is the way to
achieve progress.</div>

with children they are likely to contain a trust. We discussed at
length, and it was disputed, that anyone with a house in the south-east
of England is likely to have to take into account the possibility that
their estate will be liable to inheritance tax. A huge number of people

<a name="06061541000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue to which this probing
amendment relates has been resolved by the amendments that the
Committee has just accepted. I tabled the amendment to highlight sharia
law, to which the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan) has already
adverted, a matter which is sufficiently important for the Committee to
spend at least a few minutes of its time
discussing.</div><a name="06061541000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment proposed that condition 3 be adapted so that it would not
prove to be a bar to the creation of an immediate post-death interest
when condition 3 was not met purely as a result of the observance of
religious principles. I was in two minds whether to table the amendment
because of the extreme difficulty of drafting anything that worked in
this context. The deletion that has just taken place is by far the
preferable option, getting rid of condition 3
altogether.</div><a name="06061541000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
outline the problem that has now been solved. Many in the Muslim
community were concerned that, because of condition 3, sharia-compliant
trust arrangements would be penalised by the new IHT charge. Sharia law
lays down principles as to how property should pass on death. I
understand that, in most cases, widows are entitled to only one eighth
of the assets, and widowers to a quarter. The balance has to be split
between children and surviving parents. Those rules create two serious
problems in relation to outright gifts: they might leave the widow with
insufficient property on which to live, and the spouse exemption will
apply to only one eighth of the property. If most of the estate
consisted of the family home, the IHT charge could necessitate its
sale, leaving the widow, possibly with children, without a
home.</div> <a name="06061541000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">To deal with
that problem, and enable Muslim families to comply with sharia law
while ensuring that the spouse is properly looked
after&#151;</div><a name="06061541000103"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000536"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The Government amendments relate to instances
in which people put life assurance policies into trust before Budget
day. After the Budget, there was a lot of speculation in the media
about the fact that people who had such policies in trust would be
affected by the rules in schedule 20. The Committee will recall that
the Government clarified the position when the Finance Bill was
published. There is, dare I say it, an acknowledgment on the website of
Charles Russell solicitors that those fears were not justified, and
that the explanatory notes made that clear. An HMRC guidance note
issued alongside the Bill made it clear that existing life assurance
policies written into trust before Budget day were either not
affected&#151;because they used so-called bare trusts, whose
treatment has not changed&#151;or were effectively grandfathered by
the legislation.</div>
<a name="06061541000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since then,
officials have held discussions with representatives of the insurance
industry. One area of concern was that although they understood and
accepted HMRC&#146;s view that schedule 20 had not affected
pre-Budget trusts holding life policies, they felt that they would
still 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column681" />Column number: 682</div>like it to be explicitly mentioned in the Bill. They agreed that it was
not necessary, but wanted it in the Bill because that would help them
to give reassurance to their clients who had, presumably, seen all the
press speculation and needed such reassurance.</div>
<a name="06061541000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have given the matter
considerable thought. It is not normally my practice to amend a Bill
unnecessarily. However, in a spirit of generosity, even though it was
not my press speculation, I thought that it was appropriate for the
Government to respond, because people were worried about that and
needed reassurance. The amendments would mean that schedule 20 made
explicit provision for life insurance policies in pre-Budget trusts. I
understand and appreciate why those who are making representations
thought that that was now the best way forward. I thought that that was
the right way to
proceed.</div><a name="06061541000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of
the policies, the amendments would create a new class of case eligible
to be treated as a transitional serial interest for life insurance
policies placed into trust before Budget day. Government amendments
Nos. 385 to 387 would insert a new section 49D to extend the scope for
interest in trusts holding pre-Budget life policies to qualify as a
transitional serial interest. In such cases, the life insurance
policies held by the trust will be treated as being owned by the person
having the interest in possession in trust, whereas for someone holding
an interest in possession where the trust asset at the time the
interest commenced was, or included, a pre-Budget life insurance
policy, the interest will be treated as a transitional serial interest,
so far as the life policy is concerned if specified conditions are
satisfied.</div><a name="06061541000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
condition is that the policy was already held in the settlement on
Budget day and was subject to an interest in possession at that date.
The second condition is that the current interest in possession either
arose on the death of the person who held the interest on Budget day,
arose on the death of someone holding a transitional serial interest in
succession to them, or on the death of someone holding a transitional
serial interest by virtue of a previous application of section 49D.
That means that where a person has the interest in possession in a
pre-Budget trust holding a life insurance policy, but dies before the
person whose life is insured, they can be replaced as the person
without an impact in the transitional treatment will
continue.</div><a name="06061541000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
condition is that the life policy has been held in trust in question
throughout the period from Budget day to the start of the current
interest in possession. The fourth condition will mean that
transitional serial interest treatment is only due where the interest
in question would not also qualify as a trust for a bereaved minor or
as a disabled person&#146;s interest. That is because it is clear
that such trusts are eligible for the same IHT treatment as a
transitional serial
interest.</div><a name="06061541000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 391, the final Government amendment in the group, would insert a
new paragraph 10A into schedule 20, thereby making it clear that an
interest in possession that existed before 22 March 2006 in a life
policy placed into a trust before that time is to be treated wholly as
a pre-Budget interest in possession. It also confirms that the policy
is wholly an asset settled on the trust before the Budget, even if some
premiums are paid after Budget day. The new 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column682" />Column number: 683</div>section 46A also provides for the situation where a right inherent in
the life insurance policy is exercised after Budget day. In that case,
where the life insurance policy continues to be held in the trust after
the exercise of that right, the trust continues to
qualify.</div><a name="06061541000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, new
section 46A clarifies that premiums paid post-Budget in relation to a
life insurance policy as originally placed into the trust pre-Budget,
or following the exercise of a right, will continue to be treated as a
potentially exempt transfer if they are made by an individual. Proposed
new section 46B provides for treatment equivalent to that under new
section 46A for a life policy that was held in accumulation and
maintenance trusts on Budget day and premiums are paid on or after that
date.</div><a name="06061541000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary, our
amendments will clarify that the pre-Budget position for life insurance
policies placed in trust before Budget day is preserved and how
post-Budget premiums on such policies will be treated.
</div><a name="06061541000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
contrast, the Opposition amendments in this group would have a much
wider result and would make an existing or future insurance policy held
in trust totally IHT exempt. Some IHT avoidance has used trusts and
life insurance and if the amendments were accepted, there is a risk
that they could lead to more tax avoidance than under the pre-Budget
laws. Everyone agreed that the Government amendments provide the
necessary clarification of how schedule 20 will work. They will make
clear, for example, that the position of payments made after Budget day
under a pre-Budget date contract will not be changed. I do not see any
reason to make further comments on the matter.</div>
<a name="06061541000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Opposition&#146;s
amendment No. 268 would treat as excluded property policies put into
trust on Budget day. Under our proposals, the new rules will apply to
such arrangements. The amendment would make any insurance policy held
in trust on Budget day totally exempt, which would go too far and
regrettably could be exploited. Pre-Budget policies would remain
permanently exempt even when given or sold to succeeding owners, which
I cannot
accept.</div><a name="06061541000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Opposition
amendments Nos. 379 and 380 would define protection policies held in
trust and exempt them from the periodic exit charges on trust property.
They would also exempt the proceeds of such policies for two years
after the pay-out. The Opposition would argue that that is justified on
the basis that there is no tax avoidance motive and that keeping the
policies chargeable would involve excessive compliance costs. Again, I
disagree. Protection policies can be valuable property, particularly
under the generous definitions adopted in the amendments. Exempting
them could encourage avoidance and further distortions, particularly of
competition. In most cases the impact of IHT will be small, arising
only on amounts over the nil band. It will catch only the largest
cases, and even then the tax will be at the lower rate of the periodic
charge in proportion to the length of time for which insurance proceeds
remain in trust.</div>
<a name="06061541000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, there is ample
scope for protection policies to be employed as part of the unfair IHT
avoidance schemes that the provision is designed to counter. Somebody
might, for example, take out a protection policy that would pay off
their mortgage if they were to die unexpectedly. By putting that policy
into trust at an early stage, the proceeds would be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column683" />Column number: 684</div>exempt from IHT on their death and any amount
outstanding on the mortgage would be deducted from that person&#146;s
estate for IHT purposes. Their beneficiaries would get their money but
not have to pay off the mortgage. As hon. Members will be able to see,
there is therefore no reason why such activities should fall within the
new laws.</div><a name="06061541000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite its
having been agreed that the guidance notes made it clear that insurance
policies were outside the scope of the schedule, because of the
persistent view to the contrary and therefore the need to reassure
holders of such policies, the Government have included wording in the
Bill. In the end, the ABI decided that that would be the best way
forward, even though it accepted that insurance policies were outside
the Bill.</div><a name="06061541000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are making the position clear and are responding in a
sensible, precautionary way. I therefore commend the Government
amendments to the Committee but, for the reasons I have given, I will
ask my hon. Friends to oppose the hon. Lady&#146;s amendments should
she put them to the
vote.</div><a name="06061541000448"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000537"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> As we heard, all the amendments in this group
seek to address concerns about the impact of schedule 20 on insurance
policies written in trust. I have put forward various options for
dealing with the matter. I acknowledge that amendments Nos. 267 and 268
are wide-ranging. They are probing amendments to enable the Committee
to explore the issues surrounding the problems that have been outlined
by the Paymaster General. Amendments Nos. 378 to 380 are more narrowly
focused and are not intended to be mere probing amendments. I hope that
the Committee will consider them
seriously.</div><a name="06061541000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
turning to the amendments, I want to set out the problem that they are
designed to address. The Committee should be in no doubt that it is
serious. The Paymaster General believes that the anxieties caused in
this instance were unnecessary and based on scare stories, but I repeat
that they were caused by genuine anxiety that the legislation would
catch and penalise several large insurance policies in a way that has
never been the case
before.</div><a name="06061541000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that
the Paymaster General is aware that Prudential and Standard Life have
suspended selling life products under trust because of the uncertainty
caused by the schedule, and, as we heard, the ABI has also expressed
serious concerns about its impact. I hope that she might consider
meeting them and other representatives of the insurance industry to
discuss the matter
further.</div><a name="06061541000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000538"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way.
On this point, I shall say what has been said by organisations. On the
Finance Bill, the ABI
stated:</div><a name="06061541000422"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
welcome the Guidance Note produced by HMRC today. It now appears,
subject to further discussion, that the Government&#146;s proposals
will not affect large numbers of people with existing life policies in
trust. This is a positive
outcome&#148;.</div><a name="06061541000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was on 7
April. At that point, with some further clarification on wording, it
was acknowledged by the ABI that the points about large numbers had in
fact been clarified and were no longer a concern. I could take that
further. There may be some disagreement, but it is not coming from the
entire ABI.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column684" />Column number: 685</div><a name="06061541000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000539"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I draw the Paymaster General&#146;s attention
to a letter that I believe the ABI sent to all members of the Committee
in support of my amendments. It states that the Government have laid
amendments specifically on life assurance issues that are helpful but
limited, in that they clarify that certain although not all pre-22
March arrangements will not be brought into the new regime, but the
Government do not have new arrangements involving insurance policies
going forward.</div><a name="06061541000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Paymaster General is concerned about the views of the ABI, I hope that
she will consider my amendments
seriously.</div><a name="06061541000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000540"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> May I inform the Committee that I have just stepped
outside the Room and spoken to representatives from the ABI? Contrary
to what the Paymaster General has just said, although the ABI believes
that the guidance notes are helpful, it is not satisfied with the
drafting of the Bill. I received representations in the past minutes to
that
effect.</div><a name="06061541000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000541"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that
intervention.</div><a name="06061541000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000542"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> On a point of order, Mr. O&#146;Hara. I want
to give notice to the Committee that the ABI made direct
representations to the Government, specifically on whether or not my
policies were in case, and then responded directly to the Government,
following clarification. I cannot account at this time for the point
from anybody who is at the back of the Room, but I undertake to get to
the bottom of it, and will inform the
Committee.</div><a name="06061541000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000543"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I understand what the right hon. Lady is saying,
but it is not a point of order for the Chairman. It is a matter of
debate between the two sides of the
Committee.</div><a name="06061541000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000544"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I am sure that representatives of the insurance
industry will welcome the opportunity to discuss the matter with the
Paymaster General. The problem here is that the new proposals, as we
have heard, would impose IHT charges on life policies other than trust.
The Government do not appear to have appreciated when the Bill was
published that very large numbers of life insurance policies are
already in trust to family members. Almost invariably, such trusts are
set up during the settlor&#146;s lifetime, so schedule 20 could
inflict the new IHT charges on millions of people across the country
who hold life insurance policies. Skandia Life estimated that 4.5
million people would have to renew their policies as a
result.</div>
<a name="06061541000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
heard, the Government initially asserted that those fears were
groundless, but in the wake of the deep concern that greeted the
announcement of the Government&#146;s proposals on schedule 20, an
attempt to reassure on this point was rushed into the electronic copy
of the explanatory notes. It came too late for the hard copy, but no
specific provisions were included in the Bill. It seems that the
Government&#146;s view that schedule 20 would not cause problems was
based on the legal interpretation that premium payments were not
additions to the trust because they were made pursuant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column685" />Column number: 686</div>to the terms of the policy contract. That legal interpretation is
certainly contested and, even if it is valid, did not provide the
answer where insurance polices were settled on accumulation and
maintenance trusts. It was clearly necessary at an early stage to
clarify the issue in the Bill, and I welcome the moves that the
Government have made towards doing that. Even though the Paymaster
General seems to think that the amendments are not necessary, I welcome
her decision to table them. It is vital to lift the threat of the new
IHT charges on life insurance for the following reasons.</div>
<a name="06061541000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, because after imposing
new IHT charges on such policies&#151;they are new, because, as far
as I am aware, they are not imposed at present&#151;in order to
discourage imprudent behaviour, as with many other aspects of schedule
20, it would be perverse to try to penalise those trying to plan and
provide responsibly for their family&#146;s financial future. As the
ABI points out in the notes circulated to the Committee, from which I
have quoted
already:</div><a name="06061541000423"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Life
insurance provides a vitally important financial protection for
individuals and their families in the event of early death or serious
ill health. As well as causing obvious emotional distress, such events
often cause severe financial pressure if the victim is the main income
provider. Most families are probably seriously under-insured and it
would be foolish to provide a real tax disincentive to responsible
behaviour. Where people provide for unforeseen setbacks with life
policy insurance, they are actually less likely to find themselves
resorting to the state and the benefit system for help when these risks
materialise.&#148;</div><a name="06061541000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">In support
of the amendments that I have tabled, the ABI
stated:</div><a name="06061541000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
consider there is an overwhelming case that the use of life insurance
to protect against financial hardship should be promoted by the
government. This is because life insurance provides the means for those
on even modest incomes to be self reliant and not dependent on the
state for hand-outs... As drafted, this current legislation
penalises prudence and therefore should be
amended.&#148;</div><a name="06061541000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second reason why it is desirable and necessary to amend schedule 20 is
that so many millions of life insurance policies were written in trust.
Such trusts are set up for a number of reasons. First, setting up a
trust means that they fall outside the estate of the insured person and
the pay-out could be made straightaway, rather than having to wait for
probate. Secondly, a trust structure gives the insured life much more
flexibility regarding who benefits from the policy, whereas an outright
assignment is inflexible and difficult to do. Thirdly, a trust
structure can be particularly useful in giving trustees flexibility to
provide for children who are under 18 when the settlor dies. Preventing
trusts from being used in this context by imposing new IHT charges
would close off access to important and much-needed flexibility to the
way in which such policies work, would push up costs, and would deter
people from taking the prudent step of insuring themselves against the
risks that I have
described.</div><a name="06061541000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
reason why the amendments are necessary is that there are significant
practical problems with the way in which schedule 20 charges would
apply to life insurance. They give rise to arbitrary distinctions.
These flow from the fact that the value of the policy will fluctuate
according to the likelihood that a claim will be made. Put simply, the
value depends on the health of the person insured. Such policies have
no market value unless the insured person is terminally ill. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column686" />Column number: 687</div></div><a name="06061541000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the 10-year anniversary of the trust occurs when the insured person is
fit and healthy, its value will be minimal and no inheritance tax will
be payable because the value of the policy will be below the nil rate
band. If, however, someone is seriously ill or has recently died just
before the 10-year anniversary, that would push up the value of the
policy, the threshold of the IHT charge would be breached and
inheritance tax would be payable.</div>
<a name="06061541000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proceeds generated by such
policies have to be considerable to provide bereaved families with
sufficient income on which to live. Therefore, the value of the policy
pending imminent death, could easily be above the threshold where the
insured life is seriously ill. The best way to make the point is via
examples. They demonstrate some of schedule 20&#146;s potentially
harsh consequences in that context.</div>
<a name="06061541000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will take an example of Mr.
A who has a 20-year term policy in trust for his wife and children. It
will pay out half a million pounds on his death. That will provide the
modest income of &#163;25,000 a year for his family to live off,
based on a 5 per cent. return. In scenario one, Mr. A dies after 8
years. All the proceeds of the policy are paid out before the 10-year
anniversary, and there is no IHT charge.</div>
<a name="06061541000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">In scenario
two, Mr. A dies after nine and a half years. However, the trustees were
not able to pay out the proceeds by the 10th anniversary. The proceeds
from the policy are still in the trust and they are taxable.</div>
<a name="06061541000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">In scenario three, Mr. A dies
in year 11. At the 10th anniversary, he was not ill or not aware that
he was ill and put no value on his term policy. Therefore, the policy
was not considered valuable and no IHT was payable at all.</div>
<a name="06061541000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">In scenario four, Mr. A finds
that he is diagnosed with terminal cancer after nine and a half years
of the trust. His policy is considered to be worth &#163;390,000 at
the 10th anniversary. Inheritance tax will be payable. At that stage,
he has no funds and cannot work, so he has to borrow the money to pay
the IHT. Technically, the trustees should pay the tax but they do not
have any assets in the trust from which to pay. Therefore, it would be
down to the insured life. When Mr. A dies, the loan can be repaid.
However, it reduces the amount of money available for the
family.</div> <a name="06061541000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">In scenario
five, Mr. A finds that he is diagnosed with terminal cancer after nine
and a half years of the trust. His policy is again considered to be
&#163;390,000 at the 10th anniversary. He therefore uses a loan to
pay inheritance tax at 6 per cent., as discussed in the previous
example. He goes into remission and survives for another 15 years. The
policy comes to an end without paying a claim. Therefore, he has paid
IHT using a loan that never received any payment from the policy and
has to find the money to repay the debt that he incurred to pay the
tax.</div><a name="06061541000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to the various options presented by the amendments, amendments Nos. 267
and 268 are alternatives to one another. Both seek to insert a new
paragraph 7A into part 3 of schedule 20 on related amendments to
Inheritance Tax Act 1984. They are probing amendments, designed to give
the Committee the chance to explore the options. Amendment No. 267 is
the most radical on the table. It proposes to treat insurance policies
as excluded property and as permanently outside the IHT regime. It
would achieve this by adding a new paragraph 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column687" />Column number: 688</div>3A to section 6 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984. Section 6 contains the
excluded property regime that determines what type of property is
considered to be part of an estate for IHT purposes.</div>
<a name="06061541000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 268 is less
radical and gives assistance to those who hold existing insurance
policies. It puts forward the simple option that all insurance policies
should, as a transitional measure, be outside the Inheritance Tax Act,
if they were already on trust before 22 March
2006.</div>
<a name="06061541000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was willing
to listen to what the Paymaster General said. I acknowledge that there
could be avoidance problems with those amendments. Therefore, I will
not be pressing them to a Division. However, I will be asking the
Committee to consider amendments Nos. 379 and 380. They are much more
tightly focused. Instead of amending the excluded property principles
in section 6, they seek to amend the relevant property regime set out
in section 58. Unlike amendments Nos. 267 and 268, which would apply to
all insurance policies, amendments Nos. 379 and 380 would distinguish
between different types of insurance. They would take policies out of
the framework for the new charges where those policies are designed to
provide for future uncertain events such as the death of a wage earner,
critical illness in the family, funeral expenses or something of that
nature. In this context, life insurance is very much like insuring a
car or a home. It provides a pool of money in the event that an
unfortunate risk materialises.</div>
<a name="06061541000449"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="06061541000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most people
would take the common-sense view that such an insurance policy may
never pay out&#151;not as a valuable asset, but as a cost against a
future uncertain event. The amendments are intended to leave inside the
scope of the schedule 20 charges policies that are primarily savings
and investment vehicles. Again I rely on the ABI to draw that
distinction. It states that it is</div>
<a name="06061541000425"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;concerned about the impact of
Clause 157 and Schedule 20 on individuals buying life insurance
policies to protect their dependants following death or serious
illness. The Government's aim is to ensure that tax is paid on the
transfer of wealth out of an estate. We believe that insurance policies
that protect against uncertain unfortunate events can be clearly
distinguished from wealth generating assets such as cash, real estate
or investments. These policies are not generally wealth generating
assets and the individuals who take out such policies are not the rich
elite that the Government has indicated that it is targeting. The
insurance policies concerned allow prudent policy holders to provide
for their dependents thus removing the need for the family to be a
burden on the
state&#148;.</div><a name="06061541000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
types of policies that it is intended will fall within the carve-out
and therefore not be subject to the new charges under schedule 20 are
term insurance, whole life insurance and critical illness cover. Term
insurance gives protection if the insured party dies within a
particular period. Such policies are often taken out to cover periods
of higher family expenses, such as when children are growing up. If the
insured survives the specified term, there is no
pay-out.</div><a name="06061541000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
type of insurance is known as whole life insurance. Those policies pay
up whenever the relevant death occurs. Unlike the previous category,
there is no specified term. The third type of insurance is critical
illness cover. Those policies provide cash assistance for families in
the event that such illness hits the main breadwinner.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column688" />Column number: 689</div><a name="06061541000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
difficult to draft an amendment that draws a clear distinction between
savings products and risk-based products. This set of amendments would
probably embrace some of the smaller savings plans, but the larger ones
would be excluded by the limitation in amendment No. 380 that the
benefit arising on any death or disability is at all times no less than
a number equal to 10 multiplied by the highest premium paid in any
period of 12 months. For a savings product, where there is no
significant risk that has to materialise before it pays out, the
premiums are likely to be closer to the benefit paid. There would not
be such a large disparity between the level of the premiums and the
benefit that is paid out. In that way, the amendment targets the
risk-based insurance
products.</div><a name="06061541000158"></a>

Marris:</b> Would not amendment No. 380 be susceptible to
manipulation by somebody deciding whether to pay 12 monthly instalments
in a year in contradistinction to paying one premium per year, because
the multiplicand would be different in both
cases?</div><a name="06061541000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000546"></a>Mrs.

does not matter if one manipulates the premiums in different ways. The
provision would bite on the highest premium, so that would prevent
avoidance of that nature taking
place.</div><a name="06061541000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000547"></a>Rob

an annual premium of &#163;365? One would end up with &#163;10. I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000548"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> The figure cannot be distorted, because the
highest premium will be the longest.</div>
<a name="06061541000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge that there are
concerns about an approach that provides special treatment to one
particular type of property, but we are left having to draw that
distinction, as do the Government amendments, as a result of the
problems with the structure of the original draft of schedule 20. It is
not ideal to treat different types of properties differently for the
purposes of inheritance tax in this context, but I feel that we have no
alternative.</div><a name="06061541000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to the Government&#146;s amendments, I welcome the fact that the
Government have sought to respond to the concerns that I raised on
Second Reading and in Committee of the whole House, and that Liberal
Democrat Members and those professional groups to which we have
repeatedly referred during this Committee have also raised. However,
the changes to life interest trusts and IPDIs do not assist in this
context, because they relate to changed trusts set-up on death and, as
I said, insurance-based trusts are set up on life. Amendments Nos. 385,
386, 387 and 391, which focus specifically on insurance, are a step in
the right direction, but only a timid step. Skandia Life issued a
statement on Monday on the proposed
changes:</div><a name="06061541000426"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
latest amendments do not go far enough to reduce the number of life
policies trusts or wills that need to be reviewed...Contrary to recent
reports of a U-turn by the government, the government's changes
announced last week are only a small, albeit welcome, step in the right
direction. The introduction of the budget changes (even as now amended)
should be postponed to allow time for the proper consultation that is
needed to ensure all issues are properly
considered.&#148;</div><a name="06061541000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">It supports
the amendments, as I indicated in response to the Paymaster
General&#146;s intervention. As I said, it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column689" />Column number: 690</div>supports my amendments Nos. 371 and 380, because it believes that the
Government amendments do not go far
enough.</div><a name="06061541000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problems
with the Government&#146;s amendments are as follows. If I am
incorrect in my understanding on any of these points, I should be
pleased if the Minister would correct me. First, obviously, the
amendments do not cover policies written in trust on or after 22 March
2006, so all future policies could be potentially hit with the new
charges. Thus the deterrent effect on people&#146;s decision to
provide for their future occurs in relation to all trusts of life
insurance policies that were entered into after 22
March.</div><a name="06061541000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
Government amendments are not completely effective in delivering on the
Paymaster General&#146;s understanding that no pre-22 March policies
would be hit with the new charges. I understand that the new charges
will still apply where there is a change of beneficiary, unless that
change is the result of a death. Therefore, if the insured life has a
new baby, for example, and changes are then made to the entitlements
under the policy, that would count as a new settlement and the new
rules would apply. That results from the wording of condition 2 in
subsection (3) of the proposed new section 49D set out in Government
amendment No.
387.</div><a name="06061541000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, I am
told that there is a problem where a beneficiary with a life interest
has it removed, perhaps because he has fallen out with the insured
life, but remains a potential beneficiary. That could be so if the
trust has the children of the insured life as potential beneficiaries,
so the life tenant remains part of that class although the life
interest has been removed. Once the child has the interest in
possession removed, but the class of beneficiaries is not amended to
exclude him forever, I have been advised that because of the operation
of the new section 102ZA, which paragraph 33 of schedule 20 would
insert into the Finance Bill 1986, the loss of the interest in
possession will be treated as a gift within schedule 20 and will
trigger the reservation of benefit rules. Thus the policy is still
treated as part of the estate of the former life tenant and when he
dies, possibly years later, the trust will have to pay out a 40 per
cent. IHT charge in respect of his estate. I should welcome the
Paymaster General&#146;s reassurance on either of those two
points.</div><a name="06061541000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly, the
uncertainty about and continuing threat of new charges still casts a
shadow over existing policies that may have to be reviewed. The
Government amendments are complex and opaque and provide that the life
insurance policies that provide help in the event of death or critical
illness are potentially subject to additional IHT
charges.</div><a name="06061541000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the
Government to look again at this matter. I am delighted that they have
chosen to respond to the concerns that have been expressed, but
continued concerns remain as to the effectiveness of the Government
amendments in delivering the objectives that the Paymaster General set
out in her presentation to the
Committee.</div><a name="06061541000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000549"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> The Association of British Insurers said that
the current legislation should be amended to remove unfair taxation and
to provide clarity. As the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet said, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column690" />Column number: 691</div>in its covering letter it refers to the Government amendments as
&#147;helpful but limited&#148; in what they clarify. That is a
polite way of putting it, because the briefings that I have had from
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales were
slightly less polite, describing the amendments as
incomprehensible.</div><a name="06061541000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand what the Government amendments seek to do. They respond to
pleas from the industry to put in the Bill many of the remarks in the
explanatory notes. However, in addition, is the Treasury prepared to
make public the legal advice that it took on this issue that led to its
conclusion?</div>
<a name="06061541000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendments make efforts to ensure that life insurance
policies taken up before the Budget are not affected, but why have the
Government not applied that principle in other cases that we have
debated? As has been said, life insurance policies are not set up to
avoid inheritance tax. They insure against death or ill health, so that
if someone unexpectedly dies, the value that materialises replaces the
income that would have been earned or helps to cover mortgage
loans.</div><a name="06061541000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should
declare an interest, because I was in the process of buying a house
around the period of the Budget, and I have taken out a life insurance
policy to cover that purchase. I have no idea whether it falls before
or after the change, and I will have to go back to the policy to see
how it applies and how I will be covered&#151;although I will not be
over the inheritance tax threshold. Presumably at some point I may do
so and some of the changes may
apply.</div><a name="06061541000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
proposals stand, they create a kind of lottery about whether there is
liability to tax. For example, someone who dies just before the 10th
anniversary will pay tax but someone who dies just after it will not.
Obviously, it is not possible to plan for death; people will not be
seeking to avoid paying tax by bringing forward or trying to delay
their death. I hope that the Minister will be able to respond to those
two issues.</div>
<a name="06061541000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000550"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I can answer the last question immediately: no,
I will not make the legal advice available. The hon. Lady has asked me
that a number of times on different issues. The Government are entitled
to legal privilege, just as anybody else is. As we are always being
pressed to make sure that we do not breach privilege, I am sure she
will understand that the same applies to Government
advice.</div><a name="06061541000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have made
clear why I think that the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for
Chipping Barnet would open up avoidance. The ABI was clear on 7 April;
that is where the quote came from about the millions who would be
caught by the provision. The Government amendments will ensure that
policies held before the Budget&#151;those were the ones that were
criticised because they would be caught by the provision&#151;will
not be caught. Even though that was made clear and accepted with the
guidance, the ABI nevertheless took the view that reassurance was
necessary. Presumably there had been so much speculation that there
would be problems and that it would be easier if such provisions were
in the Bill. Unusually, although I am beginning to wonder why, I saw
some merit in that proposition, and that is what the Government
amendments do.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column691" />Column number: 692</div><a name="06061541000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">What the
Government amendments do not do, but the hon. Lady&#146;s amendments
would, which is why I will not accept them, is include new policies
taken out after Budget day, because they are different. As I set out in
my opening remarks, one particular reason for that is that this is an
area of avoidance. As some companies have been quoted, perhaps I will
quote comments from their websites about the purpose of the
policies.</div><a name="06061541000450"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="06061541000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us start
with Skandia. On 17 June 2005 a press release was issued about the
large growth in that company&#146;s business and profits, which
identified the source of the growth. It said that
matters</div><a name="06061541000427"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;driven by UK
capital appreciation and lower real tax thresholds, continue to drive
demand for inheritance tax solutions, boosting this segment of Royal
Skandia business.&#148;</div><a name="06061541000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
Skandia is quite clear what its policy is
for.</div><a name="06061541000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">On life policies,
let us consider the &#147;Secure Estate Plan&#148;, which says that
it offers a solution to minimise IHT liability whilst still maintaining
lifestyle, and that it immediately reduces the value of the estate for
IHT purposes. Alternatively, we could examine the &#147;Discounted
Gift Plan&#148;. That suggests that one could reduce the value of
one&#146;s estate for inheritance tax purposes by paying a lump
sum&#151;anything from &#163;50,000 or more&#151;into that
vehicle. You will be relieved to hear, Mr. O&#146;Hara, that I have
only a small sample of websites. The final one that I shall mention is
that of Westerby Investment Management Ltd, which refers to three
practical methods of avoiding inheritance tax. One of them is a joint
whole-of-life insurance policy written into trust for the benefit of
the heirs to the estate. The document then sets out the necessary
steps.</div><a name="06061541000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why
there are new demands to include new policies, even though, for the
reasons that I have identified, the Government believe that such
policies are designed for specific purposes. The schedule is designed
to prevent such avoidance, so the Government have adopted the original
position of the ABI, which covered policies that were already in
existence. When the ABI came back and asked that new policies be
covered, the Government declined amendments to that effect, and they
still decline them today in the form moved by the hon. Member for
Chipping
Barnet.</div><a name="06061541000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000551"></a>Mrs.

be subject to charges. As I have said, I shall not press my initial two
amendments to a Division, but I should be grateful if the Committee
were prepared to vote on amendment No. 379, because it deals with an
important issue. Life insurance policies that focus on mitigation of

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000555"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> These amendments can be divided into three
groups. Amendment No. 229 concerns life interests that are given to a
spouse under an existing trust rather than under a will.</div>
<a name="06061541000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 295 and 296
concern the retrospective impact of schedule 20 on accumulation and
maintenance trusts, which we have discussed. With the
Committee&#146;s permission, I shall not press them to a vote,
because we have already voted twice on that matter. Amendments Nos. 298
and 299 seek to improve the transitional provisions for A and M trusts.
That is a different point, and I shall take the Committee through it
briefly. They seek to add a new section 49D, which would provide for an
additional form of transitional serial interest.</div>
<a name="06061541000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have heard, transitional
serial interests are those under trust that will continue to be
governed by the old rules until that interest comes to an end. These
two amendments would bring the treatment of existing A and Ms into line
with the transitional provisions for life interest trusts. The rules
governing life interest trusts are set out in new section 49C. That
section provides that the case of somebody who becomes entitled to a
life interest in an existing trust between Budget day and 6 April 2008
will fall within the transitional provisions, and the old rules will
apply until his life interest terminates.</div>
<a name="06061541000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">When considering these
amendments, it makes sense to analyse how accumulation and maintenance
trusts generally operate. They give the beneficiaries an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column693" />Column number: 694</div>unqualified right to the income from the trust when they reach 25. In
effect, they turn into a life interest when the beneficiary reaches
that age. It makes sense, therefore, to treat the creation of a life
interest in that context in the same way as new section 49C treats the
vesting of life interests in other trusts, that is to say that if it
vests before 6 April 2008, it is governed by the old rules and it is a
transitional serial interest. Applying the IIP rule to the context of
an A and M trust, if the beneficiary turns 25 before 6 April 2008 his
resulting life interest should be a transitional serial interest and
therefore governed by the old rules. Just as new section 49C has that
result in relation to IIPs, my amendments would provide that result in
relation to A and Ms, which are identical in legal terms. Thus the
amendment proposes to align the treatment of the two types of trust in
relation to the transitional provisions.</div>
<a name="06061541000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 229 raises a
different point. It concerns cases in which there is an existing life
interest with a power to appoint a spouse to that interest and would
provide that, where that appointment is made, the successive life
interest should still be a transitional serial interest and fall within
the old rules. A number of older family trusts contain successive life
interests, and it would be unfair to penalise them long after they were
set up. As we discussed extensively in relation to the general points
on the spouse exemption, variation simply might not be
possible&#151;the terms of the trust might forbid it&#151;and a
court hearing would be expensive and might not succeed in achieving a
variation. The effect of the amendment would be to ensure that where a
life interest was appointed in the trust, it would operate in a similar
way to the life interest taking effect as the result of a will, because
it would operate on the death of a spouse. It would simply apply the
same rule, which will now apply to will trusts, in the context of a
pre-existing family trust.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000556"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> Amendment No. 229 refers to the spouse or civil
partner. What does the hon. Lady mean by civil partner? Does she mean
someone who is in a registered civil partnership or a civil partner in
the other legal sense, such as under the Fatal Accidents Act
1976?</div><a name="06061541000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000557"></a>Mrs.

section 103 of the Finance Act 2005, which gives civil partners the

spouses.</div><a name="06061541000198"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000559"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s word for the
term, but that was the section to which I was
referring.</div><a name="06061541000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the
classic situation of a will where the Government have chosen to save
the spouse exemption, the life interest in this case is set up on death
for a surviving spouse. For all the reasons why it would be unfair to
penalise trusts set up by will, it would also be unfair to impose these
new charges on a life interest which just happens to be set up in a
trust. Just as in the will context, it will be harsh to force a spouse
to sell her home to pay inheritance tax because the spouse exemption is
lost.</div><a name="06061541000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">These two
situations are not qualitatively different. In both cases a life
interest is being passed to a spouse. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column694" />Column number: 695</div>Just as the Treasury has relented in the will situation, I hope that we
might see a similar change of heart in this situation which will have a
significant practical impact on a number of pre-existing trusts, albeit
they are of the type that would no longer be drafted these days. It is
therefore a measure simply to deal with the older, more inflexible
trusts and give them parallel treatment to that which the Government
have chosen to provide to appointments to a life interest made under a
will.</div><a name="06061541000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000560"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The Government have made special provision for
trusts where the assets go to a bereaved minor. The Government have
also provided a generous two-year transitional period in which A and M
trusts can be modified to provide absolute entitlement at 18 where they
do not already do so. As we have already debated at length, Government
amendment No. 358 means that existing A and M trusts will receive the
new treatment for aged 18 to25 trusts if they satisfy the
relevant conditions from6 April 2008.</div>
<a name="06061541000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 298 and 299 are
very technical and allow A and Ms to turn into qualifying IIP trusts
during the transitional period. If the Government were to accept those
amendments, which we will not, privileged treatment would continue
where the trust does not pay out even at 25. The assets would continue
to be held on trust, subject to the trustees&#146; powers into the
indefinite future. That is exactly how A and Ms have been exploited for
long-term tax avoidance, which schedule 20 is designed to stop. I have
already set out for the Committee how rolling one type of trust into
another in this way can put assets outside the IHT net for generations.
I have absolutely no intention of repeating those points yet
again.</div><a name="06061541000451"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="06061541000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Opposition
also propose changes to the transitional rules for interest in
possession. As I have said, the Government have provided in schedule 20
a generous two-year transitional period for IIP trusts. We accept that
some IIP trusts will have the wrong person in place on Budget day. If
the beneficiary of such a trust is changed in transition that will not
affect the trust entitlement to pre-Budget treatment from April 2008
onwards. Trustees are getting a once and for all opportunity to get the
benefit to the right people. We are not trying to give existing trusts
permanent rights to special treatment.</div>
<a name="06061541000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because there is a two-year
transitional period for people to decide whether any changes should be
made to the person who held the IIP trust at Budget day, the trust can
then go on receiving special treatment until the interest is charged
after April 2008 or the trust is wound up. That provides a degree of
grandfathering, which the Government think is reasonable. It gives
people the opportunity to make changes should they not be happy with
the beneficiary that was in place on Budget day and balances it with
the need to counter the avoidance opportunities provided by an
open-ended ability to switch beneficiaries without charge. It is not
appropriate to go further; I shall therefore ask my hon. Friends to
oppose the amendment if the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet decides to
put it to the vote.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000561"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I shall not put the amendment to a vote,
although I continue to be concerned about the extent of the
grandfathering provisions available under the measure. The two-year
period to which the Paymaster General referred provides some
assistance, but as has been discussed at length, it does not remove the
retrospective effect of the Bill because in many instances it may not
be possible to change the trust and even if it were, it is not possible
for the settlor to go back and take the decision again as to which type
of trusts are set up and which gifts to
make.</div><a name="06061541000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge the
Paymaster General to consider the possibility of making special
provision for the one-off instance of an old-fashioned type of trust
that provides provision for a successive life interest. The answer is
not variation because the problem with the trusts is that they cannot
be varied because they are old-fashioned in nature and do not have
sufficient powers to enable them to be amended back into the framework
set out in schedule
20.</div><a name="06061541000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful for
the Paymaster General&#146;s remarks and I am sorry that she is not

exempt, and completely exempt if they survive seven years. For example,
that could apply when one spouse has created an IIP in their
will&#151;we have referred to this a number of times&#151;for a
surviving spouse with remainders to their child or children. For IIP

This section shall not apply if the occasion first referred to in

</div><a name="06061541000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000594"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendment No.
373</div><a name="06061541000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000595"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> In calculating entry and exit charges for trusts
subject to the relevant property regime, it is necessary to aggregate
the value of the trust and any related settlement. A related settlement
is one made by the same settlor that commenced on the same day. Under
the pre-Budget rules, a settlement in which the settlor or the
settlor&#146;s spouse had an interest in possession at the outset was
disregarded for those purposes until the interest of the settlor or the
spouse came to an
end.</div><a name="06061541000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under a standard
form will for married couples, the nil rate band passes on a
discretionary trust to the surviving spouse and the children, and the
residue of the estate is held on a life interest trust for the
surviving spouse. Section 80 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984
disregarded the life interest trust in the residuary estate in such
situations and did not treat it as a related settlement.</div>
<a name="06061541000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because the residuary life
interest trust was disregarded as a result of the operation of section
80, the nil rate band trust would suffer only 10-yearly entry and exit
charges if its value at that point exceeded the nil rate band. The
value of the residuary estate did not taint the nil rate band trust.
That greatly simplified the calculation of charges and presumably made
things simpler for the Revenue. Without the protection of section 80,
complex calculations would need to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column703" />Column number: 704</div>performed every time a distribution was made from
the nil rate band trust. The tax payable might have been small, but the
professional fees resulting from the time spent on calculation could be
considerable.</div><a name="06061541000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
changes proposed in paragraph 23 will disapply the benefits of the
section 80 exemption to all settlements, even ones that fall within the
definition of &#147;immediate post-death interests&#148;. The
overall effect of amendment No. 269 would be to carry forward into the
new regime a benefit for IPDI-compliant trusts that was previously
available to all life interest trusts set up for the settlor or the
settlor&#146;s spouse. I am delighted to see that the Government seem
to have followed a similar line in addressing the problem and that
Government amendment No. 373 has the same goal as my own. I await the
Paymaster General&#146;s explanation of her amendment. Either her
amendment or mine would be sufficient to deal with the
problem.</div><a name="06061541000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000596"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Government amendment No. 373 will preserve that
treatment where the trust for the surviving spouse or civil partner
meets the condition of creating an immediate post-death interest.
Although the Opposition amendment is designed to do the same thing, I
prefer the Government&#146;s drafting, which neatly preserves the
treatment. I commend the amendment to the Committee, and I hope that
the hon. Lady will withdraw
hers.</div><a name="06061541000274"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000600"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I shall be brief. A long-standing arrangement
allows wills to be amended after a person&#146;s death as if the
amendments had been provided for in the will. That includes
appointments made out of trusts created via wills. Technical changes to
the Bill are required to ensure that the arrangements continue to
function as
intended.</div><a name="06061541000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 340 is also relevant, but I hope that the Opposition will allow
Government amendments Nos. 398 to 400 to prevail, as they will ensure
that the backdated treatment will be available for appointments or
terms that would qualify if they had been established by the
testator&#146;s will as an immediate post-death interest, a trust for
bereaved minors or a new 18-to-25 trust introduced by Government
amendment No. 358. I hope that the Opposition will not press their
amendment to a vote. I commend the Government amendments to the
Committee.</div><a name="06061541000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000601"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> My amendments have the same goal as the
Government amendments, so the outbreak of consensus continues briefly.
It is ironic that the Government&#146;s initial reaction to the
concerns expressed by the Opposition about the retrospective impact of
schedule 20 and the problems it would cause was to say that people
could simply vary the arrangements that they have made under their
wills to amend them back into the new framework. Yet the mechanism that
they provided for doing that was defective, as the Paymaster General
has acknowledged in relation to section 144, which is an enormously
important provision used to make flexible appointments under a
will.</div><a name="06061541000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not go
over what the amendments are designed to achieve, because the Paymaster
General has already outlined them. I have to acknowledge, though, that
there is a defect in both my amendment and hers. Both our amendments
refer to people who have died after 22 March 2006. However, the reality
is that this is a problem in respect of people who died in the previous
two years, because the way in which the discretionary wills operates is
essentially as follows: the property is left on trusts that are
discretionary and accompanied by a letter of wishes and the trust must
then have two years under section 144 to make the relevant appointments
that are suitable to the family&#146;s circumstances at the time and
match the letter of wishes. Hence trustees under such wills might not
yet have made an appointment prior to 22 March
2006.</div><a name="06061541000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am happy not to press my amendment, but perhaps the Paymaster General
might be minded on Report to look at possibly deleting the reference to
deaths after 22 March, so that we could ensure that the
welcome relief provided for deaths after that point could also 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column705" />Column number: 706</div>apply to deaths occurring in the previous two years, where the same
problem occurs. On that basis, I will not press my
amendments.</div><a name="06061541000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000602"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Lady and I had a brief conversation
about this point before this afternoon&#146;s sitting, which covered
her starred amendments. I am prepared to put on the record that I will
consider what she has said. I am not guaranteeing that I will return
with an amendment on Report, but I will consider the matter, just to be
certain, because of the points that she is making. I undertake to
inform her in good time if I do not consider that an amendment is
necessary, because she, too, may want to reflect on the matter before
Report. I am prepared to give an undertaking on that basis, and I hope
that I am able to give her a fuller answer in good time before
Report.</div><a name="06061541000287"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000604"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I promise that I will be brief, because I want
this to be over much more than anyone else in the
Committee.</div>
<a name="06061541000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall close by referring to
what the experts said right at the beginning&#151;that schedule 20 as
then drafted would have amounted to a tax on prudent families. It would
have affected millions of ordinary families, not only the super-rich as
the Government have asserted. A number of problems have been mitigated
by the amendments accepted this afternoon, but severe problems remain.
The Government&#146;s approach has been coloured by a combination of
prejudice, mistrust and misunderstanding of what trusts do and how they
are used.</div>
<a name="06061541000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">The trust
concept has rightly been described as an act of genius by the English
court system and culture. Since the middle ages, when petitioners first
asked the Lord Chancellor for special help when the inflexibility of
the common law produced injustice, since Coke and Ellesmere in the
courts of equity and common law battled it out for supremacy in the
16th century and ever since the great law reformers cleared away the
cobwebs in the chancery division with the historic 1925 reforms, the
English court system has permitted the owners of property to divide it
between different people using a trust. The schedule as originally
drafted would have placed a number of penal charges on ordinary family
arrangements that have nothing to do with the avoidance of tax and
everything to do with the wish to provide responsibly and prudently for
a family&#146;s future.</div>
<a name="06061541000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Paymaster General has
continued to fail to respond to the direct requests of the Treasury
Select Committee that the Government
provide</div><a name="06061541000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;detailed
information about how it has arrived at its estimate that the new rules
on the tax treatment of certain trusts will affect only &#145;a
minority of a minority&#146; of the 100,000 discretionary
trusts&#148;</div><a name="06061541000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">that they were
aware of. She has continued to make assertions about the use of trusts
for tax avoidance purposes but has provided no evidence other than a
couple of theoretical examples and, as I recall, a reference to the
<i class="I">Daily Mail</i> in Committee of the whole House. The hon. Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West weighed in with the weighty authority of the
Channel 4 website. We still do not have hard evidence of what avoidance
schedule 20 is designed to hit.</div>
<a name="06061541000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The process has been a
back-of-an-envelope job. The proposals were flawed at the start and as
a result the Government have had to table highly complex and
difficult-to-understand amendments. Complexity has been piled on
complexity, and the Chancellor failed to mention even the most
controversial changes in his Budget speech. Anxiety has been inflicted
on thousands of people not by scare stories from the Opposition and
professional groups but by the uncertainty of the provisions in the
schedule. The anxiety was a result of the fact that the Government did
not consult on their proposals or think them through properly. Frankly,
they got them wrong.</div>
<a name="06061541000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge the Committee to think
closely about the remaining problems on divorce, the vulnerable,
self-settlement and insurance, and I hope that we will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column708" />Column number: 709</div>return to many of those issues on Report. The problems with the schedule
are far from being resolved, and the Opposition will continue to press
the issue until we see a rational, comprehensive and fair method for
the taxation of
trusts.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000605"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> What a long schedule, and I think that we got
through the technical parts. I congratulate the Paymaster General on
listening to Members and for clarifying matters even when they did not
need it. However, it is politically revealing when we have such a
technical debate, as it shows the divisions between the two main
parties in the House. That is demonstrated when we discuss matters such
as trusts and inheritance tax, or when the hon. Member for Chipping
Barnet will not define what she regards as middle income, but
nevertheless lets slip that she considers modest income to be about
&#163;25,000 a year. That is above the average level of earnings in
this country; it is probably above average earnings in my
constituency.</div> <a name="06061541000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
flavour of the hon. Lady&#146;s remarks and of her proposed
amendments, though not the totality, has in many cases been to protect
the rich. The rich should of course be treated fairly under tax.
However, when we get down to it, what is regarded as fair tax in
society, and the extent to which we allow people legally to avoid tax,
are political matters.</div>
<a name="06061541000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill and the schedule have
attempted to narrow the ways out for people. However, technical
amendments and discussions about protecting the vulnerable appear to be
designed to protect individuals such as the Marquess of
Bristol&#151;I do not know whether he is, or was, a constituent of
the Paymaster General. Vulnerable people need protecting and those who
have a disability are protected under schedule 20 and the other
legislation. However, when the official Opposition champion vulnerable
people who are drug addicts with &#163;40 million a year, I believe
that that clearly reveals the class nature of their approach, as well
as who is standing up for the rich and who is standing up for average
working
people.</div><a name="06061541000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000606"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West
has sought to characterise the situation as one in which there is one
party supporting the poor and another supporting the rich. My
party&#146;s point of view is that, as the Bill stood before
amendment, the schedule would have affected huge numbers of people.
However, a series of Government amendments have clarified the position
and have limited the number of affected people. It is regrettable that
the amendments were not incorporated into the main text of the Bill as
published. The process was evidently
rushed.</div><a name="06061541000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000607"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Perhaps the hon. Lady would like to explain who
would pay the capital gains tax from which she expects to obtain
&#163;14
billion.</div><a name="06061541000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000608"></a>Julia

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000610"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> To stay in order then, the fundamental
problem with the Bill, as it stood before amendment, was the matter of
spouse exemptions. Had the schedule gone forward unamended, there would
have been a great deal of concern that it would have impacted on a
large number of wills and on many people. On that basis, we will not be
opposing the schedule. However, it needs considerable improvement and
the rough edges will continue to need smoothing out over many years. We
will continue to keep a close eye on
matters.</div><a name="06061541000309"></a>

be under no illusion about schedule 21. It represents a climbdown by
the Government. It is the reversal of a policy that was defended
doughtily through the 2004 and 2005 Finance Bills by the Economic
Secretary&#146;s predecessor but one; the policy was defended until
the eleventh hour, December last year, when the pre-Budget report
announced the climbdown that self-invested personal pensions would no

property.</div>

say that the debate about residential property came as a surprise to

posed by relaxing the rules on pension scheme investments. He said very

venture schemes investing in the housing market forced the Government
to make their U-turn in the pre-Budget report.</div>
<a name="06061541000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">The quite
lengthy schedule that is in front of us today&#151;it is more than 40
pages&#151;replaces some very straightforward regulations. The
regulations that drove what SIPPs could invest in prior to A-day were
set out in the Retirement Benefits Schemes (Restriction on Discretion
to Approve) (Small Self-Administered Schemes) Regulations 1991.
Paragraph (5) specified that schemes could not hold directly or
indirectly as investment, personal chattels, other than choses in
action, or, in Scotland, moveable property other than incorporeal
moveable property and residential property other than that specified in
paragraph (2). It went on to talk about shares in listed companies.
Those were quite straightforward rules and regulations that people
seemed to understand and they seemed to work quite well.</div>
<a name="06061541000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">To ensure that the people
advising on those schemes were fully aware of the type of property that
was incorporated in those descriptions, Inland Revenue document IM8006
defined them more closely. It set out clearly what could and could not
be invested in by SIPPs. It stated:</div>
<a name="06061541000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Choses in action are
permitted investments and include: Company shares, copyrights, deposit

warnings that were given, the Government pursued that course. As I said

that could be invested until they got to the pre-Budget report last

climbdown.</div><a name="06061541000367"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000649"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the
previous regime, do I take it that he is saying that it was better, and
that we should return to the definitions in that previous
regime?</div><a name="06061541000368"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000650"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> We will have the opportunity today and perhaps on
Tuesday morning to explore what the Government want to achieve by
changing to the current regime. I may be more able to answer the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question when I have had a fuller explanation from
him about what the Government are seeking to do. It is interesting that
what were relatively straightforward rules a few years ago now are
42-pages long. They include a regime of penalties, complicated rules on
property and, to show their breadth, include the second-ever mention of
&#147;beach hut&#148; in primary legislation.</div>
<a name="06061541000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendments
answer the Economic Secretary&#146;s intervention; they are probing
amendments designed to discover what the Government want to achieve in
introducing such complex regulations. If I may, Mr.
O&#146;Hara, when we have debated the amendments, I would like to
raise other issues in the stand part
debate.</div><a name="06061541000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">The thrust of
the schedule to which amendments Nos. 120 and 121 relate is to restrict
the investments that SIPPs can make, but part 1 of what will become new
schedule 29A provides that there may be other pension schemes that fall
outside the definition of SIPPs where these rules will also apply. Part
1 will bring within the scope of the prohibitions on investment certain
schemes that are not SIPPs. In paragraph 2 of new schedule 20A, there
are rules that will bring occupational pension schemes that meet
certain criteria within the rules&#151;for example, small
occupational pension schemes.</div>
<a name="06061541000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that occupational pension
schemes can, in principle, invest in residential property, a point that
the then Economic Secretary made in 2004, can the current Economic
Secretary explain why he believes the other schemes should be
incorporated as part of the regime that goes beyond the SIPPs, which is
the initial cause of concern, to a wider range of schemes?</div>
<a name="06061541000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 121 refers to the
rule relating to occupational pension schemes, which may well fall
within the rule
if</div><a name="06061541000440"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there are
50 or fewer members of the pension
scheme.&#148;</div><a name="06061541000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why 50? The
amendment proposes that it should be 10, but it is designed to probe
the Government&#146;s thinking on the matter. A different amendment
could have raised that threshold to 100 or 200. The amendment seeks to
identify the type of schemes the Government are trying to capture in
the proposal.</div> <a name="06061541000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
consider the Government actuary&#146;s figures about the number of
open occupational pension schemes. There are now more than 54,000 of
them, 47,000 of which have 11 or fewer members. Just under 4,000
schemes have between 12 and 99 members and larger schemes have between
100 and 999 members. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column713" />Column number: 714</div>The bulk of the smaller occupational pensions would be caught by my
amendment.</div><a name="06061541000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be
that, when it comes to occupational pension schemes, size does not
matter. What might matter is the influence that members have over the
disposition of assets under the scheme, which I can understand. If that
were so, why do the Government set limits on the number of members that
can have influence in those schemes and determine whether they fall
inside or outside the provisions of schedule 21? The schedule states
that</div><a name="06061541000441"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;at least 10 per
cent. of the members of the pension scheme meet that
condition&#148;</div><a name="06061541000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">whereby they
can</div><a name="06061541000442"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;direct, influence or
advise on the manner of investment of any of the sums and assets held
for the purpose of the pension
scheme.&#148;</div><a name="06061541000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government are concerned about the ability of members of the pension
scheme to direct how those investments are dealt with, why say that,
when fewer than 10 per cent. of members have that power, the scheme
does not fall within the
rules?</div><a name="06061541000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
complicated interactions are trying to establish the types of scheme
that may not fall within the ambit of the scope of schedule 21. It
would be helpful to understand from the Economic Secretary the thinking
that lies behind such provisions. I thought that, in principle, if we
were worried about the ability of members to influence a scheme, the
fact that one member could influence it is perhaps sufficient to bring
it within the scope of the schedule. I seek clarification from him,
first, about why schemes such as occupational pension schemes have been
brought into the Bill and, secondly, why the Government have set the
number of members at 50 or fewer rather than at any other level and
require interaction with the ability of other members to influence the
scheme.</div><a name="06061541000379"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000651"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I join the hon. Member for Fareham in welcoming you
to the Committee this afternoon, Mr. O&#146;Hara. We need
to make progress, given that there are pressing engagements ahead. I am
grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making clear that he was introducing
probing amendments. Taken at face value, they are odd amendments and I
would have been surprised if he were intending to press them to a
Division for reasons that I shall
explain.</div><a name="06061541000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
context of the schedule is the whole reform to personal pensions that
was put in place under the Finance Act 2004 and which came into effect
on 6 April&#151;A day. The reforms were designed to
simplify substantially the taxation of pensions to provide benefits for
all taxpayers by improving choice and flexibility for providers and to
give greater encouragement for individuals to save for retirement. Many
supportive statements have been made about the A-day regime from
throughout the industry. Mr. Tom McPhail from Hargreaves Lansdown said
that A-day</div><a name="06061541000443"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will make it
much easier for people to engage with pensions...Too much of the
time we have to tell people what they can&#146;t do, in future people
will be free to do far more with
pensions.&#148;</div><a name="06061541000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
result of all the different reforms that are being
introduced.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column714" />Column number: 715</div><a name="06061541000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are covering a small aspect
of the wider pension reform, which, as the hon. Gentleman said, was
debated when we discussed last year&#146;s Finance Bill and then
during the following months on the Floor of the House. Earlier in the
Committee, I spoke at length about the contributions from the hon.
Member for Eastleigh on those matters. Tempting as it is, I shall not
return to the events of last summer, but that is an issue that he and
others raised.</div> <a name="06061541000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a consultative and listening Government. My predecessor was not only
robust in debate, but a listening Economic Secretary. He looked in
detail at those matters and concluded that potential risks to the
taxpayer were involved in that aspect of the regime. Those risks could
potentially run into hundreds of millions of pounds, not least because
of the possibility that people might choose for tax purposes suddenly
to find ways in which they could use their pension fund, and therefore
tax advantages, to invest in, for example, beach huts. The hon. Member
for Fareham raised that issue earlier.</div>
<a name="06061541000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
fascinating as all that might be for the Committee&#151;it is
potentially a diversion though&#151;I shall be brief. I looked into
the issue of beach huts to see the kind of prices they go for. This
year, in Mudeford, which after investigation I confirmed is in Dorset,
a beach hut was sold for &#163;165,000. There are 354 beach huts in
Mudeford, so one can imagine that if people chose to go down the route
of using their pension fund to buy their beach hut, there could be an
expensive cost to the Exchequer, simply for residents of
Mudeford.</div> <a name="06061541000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that
and wider reasons, the Government have taken the view that to allow
tax-advantage, beach-hut buying would be the wrong road to go down.
That was one of the many and broader points put to the Government
during the consultations, to which the Economic Secretary listened
carefully.</div><a name="06061541000386"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061541000652"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000654"></a>Rob

beach hut is&#151;a person is not allowed to live in one so it cannot
be one&#146;s primary residence, and therefore it is eligible for
capital gains

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000655"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> As on many matters during the course of
deliberations on the Finance Bill, I bow to the superior knowledge of
my hon. Friend, including on the issue of beach huts. However, I would
say that if one was to fork out &#163;165,000 on a beach hut, one
might be tempted to make sure that one got value for money.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> After the &#163;14 billion that the Liberal
Democrats would swipe from the rich via capital gains and other capital
taxes, I guess that one might see the price of beach huts drop in
Mudeford and elsewhere&#151;only time will tell. People might be
interested to know that it will still be possible to invest in a
monastery for those purposes, but not a beach hut, for arcane reasons
that might need to be probed later&#151;we will not go into that
now.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column715" />Column number: 716</div><a name="06061541000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">Suffice to say that the issue
was looked at in detail, and in order to protect the revenue and ensure
that the more general benefits of flexibility and openness that are
behind the wider pension reforms which came into effect on A day, the
then Economic Secretary announced that it was necessary to act, and the
Chancellor made an announcement at the time of the pre-Budget report.
The schedule makes it clear that we are not seeking to allow tax
revenues to support, through pension funds, investments for individual
and personal use. Pension funds should be used to make provision for an
income flow in retirement. The schedule does
that.</div><a name="06061541000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
120 seeks to delete from the new schedule the basic definition of an
investment-regulated pension scheme. As hon. Members might be aware,
the legislation seeks to apply tax charges to investment-regulated
pension schemes invested in residential property and tangible, moveable
assets. Investment-regulated pension schemes are those in which members
can influence the way in which the schemes make investments. The
purpose of the schedule is, by identifying those investments, to
prevent generous tax reliefs from being abused in that
way.</div> <a name="06061541000455"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="06061541000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, the
amendment seeks to remove the definition from the schedule. In so
doing, it would render the schedule moot and would leave us open to the
kinds of tax avoidance risk that were identified during the
consultation and which have caused the Government to act. That is why
it would be wrong to accept the amendment.</div>
<a name="06061541000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman asked why we
needed to come up with a new series of definitions. The reason is that
this is part of a wider attempt to move the taxation of pensions into a
more modern, more carefully defined environment in which, for example,
we replace discussion of chattels with discussion of property. In order
to give pension investors greater certainty, we should update
definitions in other ways to be more state of the art, while shifting
the wide range of HMRC discretionary powers to interpret previous
legislation, in order to make it clearer in this schedule&#151;and
more widely in the pensions tax regime&#151;how the framework will
operate legislatively. We should move, in fact, from a piecemeal and
rather fragmented approach to something that is more coherent and
thought through.
</div><a name="06061541000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 120
would take us backwards. Neither HMRC nor the Treasury has had
representations from any of the industry bodies or from representatives
of the pensions industry to suggest that we have got the definitions
wrong. By removing the definition of an investment-regulated pension
scheme, the amendment would prevent tax charges from applying to any
pension scheme. That would encourage the very abuse that hon. Members
of all parties, including my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting,
privately as well as publicly, pressed the Government on in recent
months.</div> <a name="06061541000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
121 is more serious in that it changes the numbers within the regime
that we are trying to establish. I can understand why we chose the
numbers that we did, but the number of 50 or 10 is a matter or judgment
and I am happy to use the debate to explain the thinking behind it. The
amendment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column716" />Column number: 717</div>targets a detailed part of the definition of an investment-regulated
pension scheme. Under the Bill as drafted, an occupational pension
scheme may be an investment-regulated pension scheme if one or more of
its members can influence the way in which the scheme makes
investments.</div> <a name="06061541000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are different tests as to the number of members capable of influencing
investments, depending on how large the scheme is. Where there are 50
or fewer members, having one member with influence over investment is
enough to bring it within the provisions of the schedule and,
therefore, for the taxing powers to apply. However, schemes of more
than 50 members will not be investment-regulated schemes unless at
least 10 per cent. of members are, or have been, capable of influencing
investment decisions. The amendment would apply the 10 per cent. of
members test to schemes of more than 10 but fewer than 50 members.
Therefore, a scheme with as few as 11 members could qualify, so a
scheme with 21 members would need at least three members capable of
influencing investment decisions instead of just one.</div>
<a name="06061541000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason for having a
stricter test for occupational pension schemes with 50 or fewer members
is to prevent schemes from avoiding charges by packing them with stooge
members. It would not be difficult to set up a bespoke pension scheme
with 11 members, 10 of whom are stooge members with a pension fund of a
nominal &#163;1 each. That would enable an individual to circumvent
the ban on using these generous pension reliefs to invest in beach huts
and other types of residential property, fine wines, fast cars and the
kind of things with which the hon. Member for Tatton is probably far
more familiar than I
am.</div><a name="06061541000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no magic
about the choice of 50 members to relax the test, but we think it
strikes the right balance between preventing those who seek to abuse
the rules from doing so and drawing in larger schemes. A member can be
active or deferred, or even a pensioner. Most occupational schemes will
therefore not be caught by the rule. It will make avoidance by small
schemes expensive and impracticable without limiting the activities of
large occupational schemes run by professional trustees.</div>
<a name="06061541000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would create the
possibility for schemes to manipulate membership in order to get around
the new charges while in reality retaining complete control over what
investments the scheme makes. In our judgment, that would mean that the
abuse of pension scheme funds would not be effectively stopped. As I
said, that could cost many millionsand encourage schemes to
indulge in artificial manipulation. I am sure that that is not the road
that hon. Members want to go down, including the hon. Members for
Eastleigh and for Tatton and certainly all 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column717" />Column number: 718</div>Members from my party. I urge the hon. Member to withdraw his
amendments, or we will vote against them.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000656"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Economic Secretary made a revealing speech. It
is interesting that it sought to clarify and remove discretion. I would
have thought that 42 pages were quite sufficient to do so, but there
are 28 pages of draft explanatory notes on the internet as well, just
in case the 42 pages before us did not provide enough clarity. Perhaps
we shall return to some of those notes
later.</div><a name="06061541000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Economic
Secretary said that most occupational pension schemes would not be
picked up by the rules. The reality is that the vast majority of
occupational pension schemes include 11 or fewer members, so they will
be picked up. They will fall within the scope of paragraph 2 anyway,
according to the figures produced by the Government&#146;s actuary
department, to which I referred
earlier.</div><a name="06061541000402"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000657"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div>
<a name="06061541000403"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000658"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I will give way, but I am conscious that there are
other
matters.</div><a name="06061541000404"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000659"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> Is it not the usual question&#151;the majority
of scheme members will not be caught by the measures, although because
they are smaller, the majority of schemes might
be?</div><a name="06061541000405"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061541000660"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right, particularly about the
figures of members per scheme. However, we are looking not so much at
the number of people covered by schemes as at the number of schemes.
There is a risk that schemes, rather than their members, will invest in
residential property, fine wines, Picassos and such things. The problem
is that proposed new paragraph 2(b) requires at least 10 per cent. A
51-member scheme in which one person controlled the disposition of
assets would fall outside the measures. That shows the problem of
setting limits, because the limits could be breached relatively easily
by artificial
means.</div><a name="06061541000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Economic
Secretary has done quite a lot during debate on this group of
amendments to elaborate the Government&#146;s thinking in that area.
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
