<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000301"></a>The
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform (Mr. Jim
Murphy):</b> Welcome back, Mr. Amess.
Mr. Hood was here for the shorter sitting this morning. If
our proceedings do last for three hours I hope that you do not develop
that Scottish dialect that seems to be so common in the
Committee.</div>
<a name="06101967000014"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101967000302"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Hunt</b> (South-West Surrey) (Con): With a bit of
Surrey thrown
in.</div><a name="06101967000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000303"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Well, in passing the baton to you, Mr.
Hood will have confirmed that we had a really constructive debate. I
see no reason why that should not continue this afternoon. He allowed
us some latitude in our debate on clause 8 to wander on to related
aspects of clause 9. I understand that you, quite rightly, will rule it
out of order if we stray too far in that direction. The clauses are
closely connected. Mr. Hood also allowed the hon. Member for
South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt) to refer to the fact that I was
the only Member of Parliament who at some point in the past could name
the five Spice Girls. I do not know whether it is because I am getting
older but I am unable to name the four members of the Arctic Monkeys or
the four members of The
Killers.</div><a name="06101967000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101967000304"></a><b class="B">Gordon

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000305"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Well, perhaps I am a little more in touch than my
hon. Friend. Let me make some progress, as that is not what we are here
to talk about.</div> <a name="06101967000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of points have been raised. I share in the enjoyment of the
comments of the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon.
Friend the Member for Stirling (Mrs. McGuire). We heard from
her this morning and we will hear from her in much greater detail as we
deal with various clauses. Not only did she manage to secure that
constituency in Stirling, but she inadvertently created the
Conservative party&#146;s current problem. The gentleman she defeated
is the author of their tax report, which they are both for and against
today.</div><a name="06101967000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101967000306"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): Consensus,
please.</div><a name="06101967000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000307"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Okay. I will move on.</div>
<a name="06101967000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000308"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Does the Minister welcome the economic prosperity
that the low-tax climate of the 1980s engendered? We have been able to
be much more generous in disability benefits since then than we might
have been had we followed the policies advocated up to
1979.</div><a name="06101967000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000309"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We will not go down that
road.</div><a name="06101967000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000310"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Of course we should not go further down that road.
We will at various points in our proceedings allude to the levels of
child poverty and workless households and the trebling of people on
incapacity benefit and the fact that the first act of any Conservative
Government when they came to power was to cut
benefits.</div>
<a name="06101967000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000311"></a>Mr.
Hunt</b>
<i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div><a name="06101967000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000312"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I will not give way. We will try to make some
progress on the basis of consensus. The hon. Gentleman quite fairly
reminded the Committee of the prevalence of poverty in households where
there is one or more disabled adult or one or more disabled child. He
is aware that there is a Treasury-led review of some of these issues.
Like me, he attended some of the hearings, chaired very ably and
eloquently by my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston
and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke) and my hon. Friend the Member for
Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble).</div>
<a name="06101967000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman is
absolutely right to identify that prevalence: 26 per cent. of children
in poverty in the UK today live in a household with one or more
disabled adult. There is a clear connection, which is why the hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)
reminded us that one of the key aims of the Bill is to make a
contribution to eradicating that relative child poverty. Our assessment
is that they number around 100,000 when one considers that about one in
six of the people on incapacity benefit have a dependent
child.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 115</div><a name="06101967000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now to the specific
points that have been raised. One point was raised slightly
tangentially by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West (John
Robertson) and others about the level of confusion and the need for
continuous and repeat assessments. Of course we should seek to minimise
the need for repeat assessments, which should be a key element of our
business design processes, with one important caveat: we seek
continually to measure and assess fluctuating physical and mental
health conditions, so it would be entirely appropriate to set up a
system of regular assessments; indeed, we would be criticised if we did
not do so. As we discussed in an earlier sitting, the personal
capability assessment review is not a snapshot in time but a
measurement of a citizen&#146;s or customer&#146;s experience of
their disability or limitation over a
period.</div>
<a name="06101967000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101967000313"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): Does the Minister agree that
the golden thread running through the decision making should be whether
the assessment process is genuinely intended to be supportive of the
claimant rather than punitive? If the Minister, with his greater
eloquence than mine, can persuade people that it is in their interests
to undergo multiple assessments, which are something of an ordeal, in
order to get a picture of their situation, that is one thing, but
constantly nagging them in the interests of a bureaucratic system would
be seen as another.</div>
<a name="06101967000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000314"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point that relates
to the issue of confusion, particularly over the linking rules, which
was raised earlier. As hon. Members know, constituents often say,
&#147;I think I might want to come off incapacity benefit and try the
world of work but I would lose all my benefits. I am worried about what
will happen to me if it doesn&#146;t work out.&#148; That is why
the linking rules exist and why this month we implemented the extension
of those rules from one year to two. I confirm that the linking rules
will also apply in respect of employment and support allowance. If
someone tries the world of work and it turns out not to be appropriate,
for whatever reason, the improved linking rules from this month will be
carried over on to
ESA.</div><a name="06101967000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101967000315"></a><b class="B">Kali
Mountford</b> (Colne Valley) (Lab): On the matter of the
linking rules, which are very important in encouraging people to try
the world of work, can the Minister confirm that it is also important
that people take the advice of their personal adviser and find out what
applies in their case, rather than listening to Doris next door and the
gossip on the
street?</div><a name="06101967000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000316"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> That is a fair point, although I am not sure that
the Government can legislate on
it&#151;</div><a name="06101967000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000317"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> But they can give
guidance.</div><a name="06101967000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000318"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> We cannot stop people passing on gossip on the
street. However, the availability of strong and clear advice is
important.</div><a name="06101967000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I visited
the Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty's Treasury, my hon. Friend the
Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Mr. Roy), recently and met
a lady who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 116</div>had extensive experience as a paramedic&#151;I will not name her as I
have not asked her permission to do so. She had to undergo a brain
operation and it had been suggested that she would make a full recovery
and return to being a paramedic. That was not the case and members of
her family said that she would lose her benefit if she tried to work.
Informal advice can useful, but it must be accurate. That is why
citizens advice bureaux, the voluntary sector and non-governmental
organisations are crucial. When, with Parliament&#146;s approval, we
implement this Bill and the employment and support allowance, we will
need to make a sustained effort to ensure that the voluntary sector and
others can pass on accurate and objective
advice.</div><a name="06101967000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101967000319"></a><b class="B">Danny
Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): I agree with the Minister&#146;s point, but is it not
also important to ensure that staff at Jobcentre Plus give accurate
advice? In particular, when someone is applying for one benefit they
should also be given advice on their entitlement to other benefits, if
any, so that people get what they need in full. Is the Minister
concerned about cases in my constituency in which someone has turned up
to claim benefit and the security guard at the door of Jobcentre Plus
has said, &#147;Oh no, you&#146;re not entitled&#148;? That has
been a barrier to people, which should not have been
there.</div>
<a name="06101967000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000320"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> In general, I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but
if he is seriously suggesting that a security guard in a jobcentre in
his constituency is making assessments of benefit entitlement then that
is a very serious allegation, and he should bring it to my attention
and I shall investigate it. He has said it on the record today, so I
look forward to the evidence being
provided.</div><a name="06101967000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000321"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> While we are on the same general thought, and
without allegations being entered into against our own company, will
the Minister also consider the possibility of a public information
campaign through MPs to their constituents? Understanding should not be
confined to the anoraks who grace the Committee&#151;even
partially&#151;with their comprehension of matters; the general body
of MPs who are trying to advise their constituents and point them in
the right direction should understand the changes and be able to
explain that they are not intended to be
penal.</div><a name="06101967000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000322"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> That is another fair point, in response to which I
have two comments. First, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point has
importance even while the Bill is passing through Parliament, because
we all know the diversity of the conditions experienced by our
constituents&#151;the frustrations and worries that some of them may
have when they hear a conversation in Parliament about welfare reform.
Thus far, the debate at a political level has been entirely
appropriate, and there has not been the type of scaremongering that has
sometimes occurred in the past, fairly or unfairly. We all have a
responsibility to consider the tone and content of our conversation on
welfare reform, so that those who pick up newspapers or who hear a clip
on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 117</div>Radio Five Live or Radio 4, or wherever, do not inadvertently take the
wrong message from our
deliberations.</div><a name="06101967000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000323"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> On that point, will the Minister join me in
deprecating the use in certain newspapers of banner headlines that
refer to scroungers and cheats? On a glance from the general reader,
such headlines imply that anyone who claims benefits may potentially
want to work the system, as such newspapers suggest. All of us here
should be extremely careful to ensure that the debate is conducted in
the terms that the Minister just
described.</div><a name="06101967000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000324"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> That point is entirely fair. The hon. Gentleman
may wish to put on the record the newspapers that he considers to be
most
culpable.</div><a name="06101967000041"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000325"></a>Mr.

<a name="06101967000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000326"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s partial
bravery.</div><a name="06101967000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
point that I wanted to make may seem small. It is not an issue for
Government, or for the Committee&#151;it is a matter for the House
authorities. One of the issues for Members of Parliament who wish to
provide objective information to their constituents is connected to the
fact that we were lobbied yesterday by the
sub-postmasters&#151;entirely appropriately, given the genuine
concerns that they feel. One of the things that has surprised me in the
past is that our own post office in this building does not always carry
the type of leaflets that our own constituents are encouraged to pick
up and to rely on, respond to and fill in. If the post office here had
such forms available, so that Members could see them in the course of
their daily business in the Commons, that would be a small step in our
own education in our constituents&#146; experience, and may also
enable us to pass such information on in our constituency
surgeries.</div> <a name="06101967000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
specifics of the amendments, at the moment we use the term personal
capability assessment. Incidentally, I do not think that that is the
appropriate term, but that is something that we can consider as the
Bill passes through the House and through the other place. In many
people&#146;s minds it is a term that is connected to incapacity
benefit, and one of the weaknesses of incapacity benefit has been that
it has labelled people as incapacitated or incapable. The personal
capability assessment has been seen as an intrinsic part of IB. In
terms of how we describe this new assessment phase, it will be
important to move away from that as well.</div>
<a name="06101967000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently, we use the term PCA
to describe the medical assessment of entitlement to incapacity
benefit. With ESA, we will use&#151;at the moment&#151;the personal
capability assessment to describe a wider process. First, it will
assess a person&#146;s capability for work&#151;and with it, their
eligibility for ESA, and secondly, their capability for work-related
activity&#151;and with it, whether they should be a member of the
support group. Thirdly, it will assess the health-related support that
a person needs to improve their capability 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 118</div>and move closer to appropriate work. I will add some detail to those
comments and then, if hon. Members wish, I will give
way.</div><a name="06101967000272"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="06101967000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members of the
Committee have suggested that the first two tests should be determined
by the same assessment. That is the crux of the amendment before us.
Although they are part of a single assessment process, they are
assessing different concepts&#151;work, and the ability to undertake
work-related activity. Therefore, I want to talk through what happens
when a customer applies for ESA.</div>
<a name="06101967000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where it is clear from written
evidence supplied by a customer claiming ESA that he or she has limited
capability for work-related activity and should therefore be a member
of the support group, we will not require that person to come in for a
face to face medical examination. I am sure that hon. Members would
agree that it would be wrong to ask customers with the most severe
problems or conditions to attend a medical examination of that nature.
Where it is not apparent from the written evidence that a customer
should be in the support group, they will be asked to attend a medical
examination at which the assessments for both limited capability for
work and work-related activity will be carried out.</div>
<a name="06101967000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The eligibility criteria for
limited capability for work will involve a similar process to that
which we use to determine eligibility for incapacity benefit. We will
use a benefit entitlement threshold that is satisfied when a person
scores 15 points by satisfying one or more physical or mental
descriptors. This 15-point threshold represents a level at which it is
unreasonable to expect a person to work. It does not identify the level
of functional limitation at which it would be unreasonable to require
someone to engage in work-related activity. There is no direct
relationship between someone having a high score in the test for
limited capability for work and that person being an appropriate
candidate for membership of the support group.</div>
<a name="06101967000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The assessment of limited
capability for work deals with the threshold to entitlement to
employment and support allowance and makes no determination about the
capability for work-related activity. The descriptors used are designed
to look at a wider and less severe level of functional limitation and
do not involve the degree of sophistication that we are using for
limited capability for work-related activity. I appreciate that this is
to some extent detailed, but I will add more
detail.</div><a name="06101967000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The points
raised by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee before the
interruption were similar to those that I, the Under-Secretary and
others teased out through the process. We sought reassurances on the
process and asked similar questions to those that were asked in our
proceedings earlier today.</div>

<a name="06101967000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000329"></a>Mr.

Caerphilly (Mr. David).</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 119</div><a name="06101967000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000330"></a>Mr.
David:</b> I wonder whether my hon. Friend would clarify that
the PCA is not the provision that combines the scores in the mental and
physical health assessments. Are they separate and distinct and if so,
why is
that?</div><a name="06101967000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000331"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I give way to the hon. Member for Daventry
(Mr.
Boswell).</div><a name="06101967000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000332"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am not sure to what extent this will widen the
population of people who will understand the point, but it might,
particularly with people who are computer or digitally related. From
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s description, it seems that the test in
clause 8 is a digital one. A person either has a capability for work or
does not&#151;up to a certain threshold&#151;it is either on or
off. The test under clause 9 is more of an analogue test in which
certain other capabilities can be applied and judgment made
accordingly. It is a progressive rather than an absolute type of
decision.</div>
<a name="06101967000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000333"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I would describe the difference between the two
tests in various ways, whether it is digital or analogue. However, I
would not seek to differentiate the way in which we will apply this
test.</div> <a name="06101967000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the
point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly. Given that we
have changed the mental health scoring system to better reflect
learning disabilities and fluctuating mental health conditions and that
descriptors score six, nine or 15 points toward the 15-point threshold,
we do not consider it appropriate to maintain our old practice of
weighting the combined mental health and physical descriptor score so
that a score below 15 points will still satisfy the PCA. The 15 points
will entitle someone to the employment and support allowance. A group
of 46 other descriptors, to which I will come in a moment, will assess
them to be considered as part of a support group.</div>
<a name="06101967000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">When evaluating the revised PCA
and assessing its effectiveness, we will consider what approach should
generally be taken to combining physical and mental health scores. I
hope that my hon. Friend will acknowledge that that is a key point. As
we test the new PCA, we will test whether the revised methodology is
right. We are doing that by testing it alongside the current PCA to
ensure the right
outcomes.</div><a name="06101967000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come to
the point raised in an earlier conversation on this amendment. The hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey asked how we would
validate the process under the revised PCAs. It is our intention to run
both systems alongside one another to ensure the outcome that we
anticipate from the new PCA&#151;not writing anyone off. If, however,
having compared the two systems, we see faults and experience
weaknesses in the new design, we will refine that design and test it
again. There will be two runs, and we will of course share that
information with others, including those with close interests in the
issue such as disability lobby organisations and others.</div>
<a name="06101967000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that reassures the
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey on the
important point that he raised. We will first run a pilot alongside the
current PCA, refine it if necessary, run a further pilot and share the
information with others 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 120</div>throughout the process. We have settled that that will be the most
effective way of testing the new PCA so that it is up and running in
time for the national roll-out of pathways and, we hope, for the
implementation, with Parliament&#146;s permission, of the Welfare
Reform Bill in 2008. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Gentleman
about the rigorous process that we intend to undertake for the revised
PCA.</div><a name="06101967000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come to the
wider points raised about the amendment by the hon. Member for
Daventry. The levels of functional limitation used in the descriptors
for determining limited capability for work-related activity are
greater because we intend to place in the support group only the
minority of customers who are so severely impaired that it would not be
reasonable to require them to undertake work-related activity. The
Government feel that assessing support group status by the number of
points awarded in the assessment of limited capability for work would
create a number of important inequalities, although I know that that is
not the amendment&#146;s intention. It would reinvent in some ways
the sense of a condition creating an automatic entitlement to be in the
support group. People with less severe functional limitations across a
range of descriptors might score highly and be inappropriately included
in the support group when they might benefit from work-related
activity.</div><a name="06101967000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give
two examples. A number of case studies were provided in the background
information, which hon. Members will find helpful. Under the revised
PCA, someone with a moderate learning disability would score 50 points.
They would be significantly above the 15-point threshold, but we
clearly would not wish to put even someone with 50 points into the
support group automatically, because we are determined to ensure that
the new system does not write off people with learning disabilities.
The technical groups considered all the options. A crude points-based
system would have unintended consequences, and I accept that that is
not what the hon. Member for South-West Surrey
intended.</div><a name="06101967000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000334"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am grateful for those clarifications in general,
but I ask the Minister to address the following points. My suggestion
was not that the same question be applied in relation to both elements
of the employment and support allowance. I was requesting that we
streamline the administration of the tests so that claimants take only
one, with the additional questions necessary to determine their
eligibility for the support allowance being part of the same process.
That would avoid the bureaucracy of somebody undergoing a test and then
being told, &#147;Now you&#146;ve got to come back two weeks later
to see whether you are eligible for the second test.&#148;</div>
<a name="06101967000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second question, to kill two
birds with one stone, is whether I am correct that the main criteria
for eligibility for the support component of the benefit will be the
capability to do full-time
work.</div><a name="06101967000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000335"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I shall respond to those questions when I have
finished what is, by necessity, a rather technical explanation. I shall
illustrate how the system will operate, and the hon. Gentleman may
intervene at that point if he wishes.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 121</div><a name="06101967000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">A second example of the problems
of a crude points-based system, which is a weakness in the current
system and would be a real weakness in any newly designed welfare
system aiming to give people the opportunity to get back into the
labour market, is that of someone who is deaf and has a back condition
that prevents them from kneeling or bending. Under the revised PCA,
that person will get 30 points, entitling them to employment and
support allowance. We are not in the business of saying to someone in
that position that they should automatically be in the support group. I
accept that that is not the point that the hon. Member for Daventry is
making, but it is important to clarify our
intentions.</div><a name="06101967000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under a
crude points-based system, people with severe limitation of functions
who score above the threshold in only one descriptor would be
inappropriately excluded from the support group. We intend to structure
entitlement to being in that group through the use of the 46
descriptors on page 18 of the draft regulations. I know that hon.
Members have found the provision of those regulations helpful. Access
to the support group will be based on entitlement to ESA, requiring 15
points, and being covered by just one of the 46 descriptors. They fall
under 11 headings, and an awful lot of careful consideration has gone
into compiling the list; it will not be a crude points-based system.
The only exception will be terminal illness, to which we have indicated
there will be a different approach.</div>
<a name="06101967000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can happily clarify the
matter raised by the hon. Member for South-West Surrey about whether
there should be one interview or two. The process is set out in clauses
8, 9 and 10. They cover the legal aspects of the entitlement and the
appeals processes and have been carefully crafted. Clauses 8 and 9
describe one process, which will take place at one time, with the same
medical expert in the same room as the customer, face to face. When the
Atos Origin medical expert assesses whether someone reaches the 15
points needed for entitlement to employment and support allowance, they
will also assess whether that person meets any of the 46 descriptors to
entitle them to be in the support group. Clauses 8 and 9 were separated
in the Bill for legal and appeal reasons on the advice of those who
craft Bills. Our policy intention is, as the hon. Gentleman hoped, that
the processes in those two clauses will take place at the same
time.</div><a name="06101967000273"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="06101967000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101967000336"></a><b class="B">John
Robertson</b> (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab): I think I follow my
hon. Friend, but where will somebody with a degenerative disease fit
in? Initially, they would be tested and they would be eligible for
support, and as the disease became more degenerative they would remain
in the system. However, they would reach the stage where they were
unable to work.</div>
<a name="06101967000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000337"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point, for which
the revised assessment structure will cater. An individual could be
reassessed because of a changing medical condition. If there were an
improvement, they could be reassessed out of a support group, and vice
versa. If the individual were 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 122</div>already on ESA, the circumstance and experience that my hon. Friend
describes would mean an assessment into the support group from the
work-related activity group. It is important that people have the
opportunity of further assessment based on their condition. A GP or
another medical expert in the field will be able to request
it.</div>
<a name="06101967000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000338"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> For tidiness of mind, the Minister has explained
cogently why the clauses are separate. They will represent two separate
decisions, albeit decisions that are carried out in the same format and
simultaneously. There will be a decision about whether the person has
limited capability for work, and a decision about whether their limited
capability for work-related activity is such that it draws them into
the support group under the 46 descriptors that the Minister has
mentioned. I take it that the decision letter would be explicit about
that, and that under whatever process available in social security law,
one could appeal separately against both
decisions.</div>
<a name="06101967000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000339"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Yes. I am happy to answer other technical or
specific questions that hon. Members may have, because this issue is
important.</div>
<a name="06101967000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000340"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I have a couple of questions that follow on
from the Minister&#146;s point. I agree with the hon. Member for
Daventry that the explanation for the different clauses and different
purposes of the two assessments is clear and cogent. However, the
Minister alluded to a three-stage process, because there is also the
work-focused health-related assessment, as described in clause
10.</div> <a name="06101967000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister
clarify a couple of points? First, if someone is determined
not to be part of the support group, would the work-focused
health-related assessment follow on directly? Secondly, it is important
to clarify who takes the decision. Currently, the medical assessors,
Atos Origin, make the assessment and provide details to a decision
maker, a Department for Work and Pensions employee, who then formally
decides. Under the Bill, however, it sounds like the medical
assessor&#151;presumably, Atos Origin&#151;will have to make a
decision there and then about whether somebody goes into the support
group in order to decide whether they should be called back into the
room for the work-focused health-related assessment. Will the Minister
clarify that point?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000341"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I shall happily clarify that important point. The
hon. Gentleman is right that in a legal sense, Jobcentre Plus will
remain as the decision maker on behalf of the Secretary of State. It
will make the formal legal decision. On the point that the hon. Member
for Daventry made about the decision to send an individual to the
support group, Jobcentre Plus will have two decisions to make: first,
the individual&#146;s entitlement to ESA; and secondly, their
entitlement to benefit from the support group.</div>
<a name="06101967000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the customer has their
single assessment, as set out in clauses 8 and 9, if the medical expert
carrying it out decides that the person is likely to qualify for the
support group, they will have the power to defer any work-focused
health-related assessment, pending a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 123</div>decision by Jobcentre Plus, the decision maker. However, the customer
would be able to say to the assessor, &#147;Thank you for the
assessment; I acknowledge that it has been done in good faith, but
actually I want to volunteer for a work-focused, health-related
assessment because I do not want to be written off&#148;. They would
then be able to undergo that
assessment.</div><a name="06101967000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey raised a good
point and I hope that I have reassured him, although I am happy to
respond to further
queries.</div><a name="06101967000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000342"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
clarification. However, if someone is assessed as having limited
capability for work, they might not have limited capability for
work-related activity and therefore would be part of the work-related
activity group. Would they be obliged to go straight into the
work-focused health-related assessment, or would they have the option
of waiting for the formal decision by Jobcentre Plus before moving on
to the next
stage?</div><a name="06101967000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000343"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> It would be our intention that that person should
attend a work-focused health-related assessment interview at the same
time. Of course, all decisions that carry any formal sanction will be
appealable, but we will debate that
later.</div><a name="06101967000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000344"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am not trying to make difficulties for the
Minister&#151;I am beyond the limit of my own capability&#151;but
we must remember that the Department for Work and Pensions&#146;
decision makers can never fetter their discretion and that only one
decision can be taken at a time. It would not help the process, or
rather the Minister would be in hot water in judicial review, if he
allowed somebody to be compelled or even steered into the work-focused
health-related assessment, unless or until they actually had a piece of
paper establishing the audit trail. The Minister might need to give a
little more thought to how that could be done. Perhaps somebody could
say, &#147;Until I get that piece of paper, I am not prepared to
consider the matter any further&#148;. It should be made clear to
them that that is their
right.</div><a name="06101967000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000345"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Of course, that would be a decision for the
customer to make, but we will set out the intended structure in
regulations and operational guidance, and explain the entitlement to
benefit and the conditionality. Refusal to participate in the process
could lead to a sanction down the road, although that would of course
be appealable. We set out the safeguards on page six, I think, of the
document provided&#151;nine safeguards, plus the right of appeal.
That is
important.</div><a name="06101967000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000346"></a>Mr.
David:</b> Following on from the question raised by the hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, I have a more
general point. The Minister has mentioned a number of times in passing
that the PCA will be subject to piloting and evaluation, but he also
mentioned that that will be conducted by Atos Origin. Is there not a
difficulty because that company cannot be described as an independent
organisation? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 124</div>Certainly, it has an extremely impressive track record, but is there not
a danger that, if it is involved in the evaluation process, it would,
in a sense, be evaluating itself? Would it not be better to have an
organisation that is entirely separate and
independent?</div><a name="06101967000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000347"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> That is another issue that Ministers considered. I
hope that my responses today have shown that, in constructing the Bill,
I, the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend
the Member for Stirling, and the Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions looked at that matter in great
detail.</div><a name="06101967000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
specific point about the assessment of the PCA by Atos Origin, we
intend to share the findings from the dual running of the old and new
PCAs with a number of others, such as, I suspect, disability
organisations. We will not be short of comment on the operation of the
current and revised PCAs, the possible difference in outcomes and on
whether the revised PCA meets our objectives of not writing anyone off
and of being much more supportive of those with learning disabilities
and fluctuating mental health conditions. As I mentioned earlier, if
necessary, we will then refine the revised PCA and test it a second
time against the existing
PCA.</div><a name="06101967000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">On top of
everything else, I seek to reassure the Committee that we intend as far
as possible to ensure that access to a support group is paper-based,
through medical advice and medical certificates. For someone who may be
entitled to a support group, Jobcentre Plus would initially receive the
paperwork and if, in its opinion, they may be entitled to be in a
support group, the paperwork would be sent direct to Atos Origin, which
would seek to ascertain whether they had 15 points and met just one of
the 46 descriptors. We anticipate that, in most cases, the entitlement
to a support group would be
paper-based.</div><a name="06101967000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000348"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> The Minister has given way generously. Just before
he concludes his remarks and we decide whether to withdraw the
amendment, I should like to mention something. He has been helpful on
the details of the amendments, but will he talk about some of the
broader points that I raised this morning, particularly the
desirability of moving towards a single assessment process? Will the
Minister, with your generosity, Mr. Amess, say whether he or
the Government are considering the possibility of making the
information gleaned through the assessment process available for use in
other benefits assessments, so that disabled people do not have to
supply the same information constantly when applying for different
benefits under the current
structure?</div><a name="06101967000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000349"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> With your indulgence, Mr. Amess, we
will discuss that in debates on other amendments as we
proceed.</div><a name="06101967000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, we
want to maximise information sharing, but information gathered for
disability living allowance, for example, is intended for a different
purpose and for different outcomes and entitlements. We seek to share
information and minimise the number of times that people are asked for
the same 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 125</div>information, but it is not as straightforward as the hon. Gentleman
suggests and I think that everyone acknowledges
that.</div><a name="06101967000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000350"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> Will the Minister and his officials reflect
further, outside the Committee, on developing some sort of core
assessment to which elements relating to individual benefits could be
added to make the process
easier?</div><a name="06101967000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
the important point made by the hon. Member for Caerphilly, I should
like to probe a little further on the nature of the testing. The lack
of independence in the testing could be a worry and, given the high
number of appeals that take place under the current system, it seems
that only by following the new PCA through the appeals process could it
be properly tested and assessed. This view is shared by Citizens
Advice. Does the idea of following cases through to appeal and seeing
what happens through the process feature in the Minister&#146;s
thinking about how the new PCA will be evaluated? I appreciate that
that process will take longer and therefore it may not satisfy his
desire to move things forward as efficaciously as possible, but it may
also result in a system that is more robust and less open to challenge
in
future.</div><a name="06101967000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000351"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> There are three outstanding questions asked by
hon. Members and with their agreement I shall answer them and
then&#151;</div><a name="06101967000093"></a>

<a name="06101967000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000353"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Of course, I will give way if there are pressing
issues to discuss. However, other hon. Members want to move amendments,
and we can, of course, continue some of the detailed discussion in
relation to those.</div><a name="06101967000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
intend that the work-focused health-related assessments should happen
at the same time. However, we are happy to reflect, as the process
evolves, as to whether that continues to be the most effective way to
do things. The point about a core assessment is fair, but relates to a
wider point about the move towards a single working-age benefit and
having a core assessment for entitlement to it. That is the context in
which core assessment may be more
attractive.</div><a name="06101967000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
appeals, again, the information is based on constituency casework and
the analysis of the nature and reasons for appeal. The single most
common reason for appeals being successful is the provision of
additional information at a later stage after an initial decision. In
the context of ESA, clauses 8 and 9 and the design of the revised PCA
process, we are considering already how to improve the requests for
information, including for medical information, so that at the appeals
stage new information is not provided that could have been asked for or
provided at an earlier point. I think that about half of the appeals
are successful for that reason. Designing it now inside the IB, while
we are still within that system, will help us to ensure that we have a
better approach to reducing the number of appeals.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 126</div><a name="06101967000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not our objective, of
course. It is about not a target for reducing appeals but a target for
getting decisions right. In a way, the number of appeals is a measure
of whether decisions are right. With regard to appeals being
overturned, the single biggest contributing factor is information not
being available to the decision maker when the decision is made. That
is the important point we will take through to the PCA and the new
ESA.</div><a name="06101967000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope hon.
Members will feel that they have tested the Government&#146;s logic.
We tested the logic ourselves as we went through the process of
constructing the clauses and regulations. I confirm again to Opposition
Members that we would anticipate the provisions under clauses 8 and 9
being carried out at the same time, in the same room, by the same
person in one interview, against a threshold of 15 points for
entitlement to ESA. At the same time, there will be an assessment of
whether the customer meets one of the 46 descriptors identified in the
draft regulations. Meeting one of those descriptors would entitle
someone to be considered for the support group. They could of course
volunteer to undertake a work-focused health-related assessment and
some of the other support pathways on offer at that time.</div>
<a name="06101967000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">In view of that, I invite the
hon. Member for South-West Surrey to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="06101967000274"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="06101967000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000354"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I thank the Minister for the care with which he
has answered our technical queries and indeed the queries of members of
all sides. Before asking the hon. Member for South-West Surrey to sum
up this extremely interesting debate, I would like to tease out a bit
more from the Minister on clause 8 with regard to the length of
assessment, in other words, the amount of time that will be taken in
the hypothetical examination room that we have been talking about
today.</div> <a name="06101967000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to give a couple of examples of concerns that have been expressed
throughout the Green Paper consultation and by the Opposition. I should
like to say parenthetically that in the Netherlands, which I have
visited, equivalent medical assessments are conducted by doctors and
also involve labour market specialists. Such examinations are quite
lengthy&#151;over an hour in some cases. I know that Citizens Advice
has done some number crunching on the average length of medical
assessments and its conclusion is that, compared with other western
European countries, who have similar regimes, the UK experience falls a
bit short.</div> <a name="06101967000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do know
that there are a lot of appeals, and we are going to discuss that when
we reach the next series of amendments. I do not want to anticipate
that debate, but in the context of large numbers of appeals, Citizens
Advice has collected evidence from a review of 96 cases that failed a
PCA and found that the average assessment time was 25 minutes, with a
range of between 15 minutes and 69 minutes. A separate source of
information on this is a parliamentary answer that the Under-Secretary
gave me earlier this year when I asked the average time taken for
completion of a personal capability assessment for incapacity benefit 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 127</div>claimants. She replied that the average examination time taken to
complete a PCA was 37.8 minutes in 2000 and 37.1 minutes in 2001. She
explained the position all the way to 2005, when it was 37.7 minutes.
The table to which she referred is set out at column 291W of the
<i class="I">Official Report </i>of 30 January
2006.</div>
<a name="06101967000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I give those statistics to
prompt the Minister to talk about the length of time. I do not wish to
pin him to a fraction of a minute, but there will be a new regime. I
shall not try the Committee&#146;s patience by talking about clause
9, but let us consider the new test under clause 8. Will it be longer,
shorter or about the same time as the times set out in the
table?</div><a name="06101967000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000355"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I thank all members of the Committee for a
constructive discussion on the amendments and for the generosity of
Mr. Hood this morning and Mr. Amess this
afternoon in allowing our discussion to range towards fundamental
principles, not only the specifics of the amendments. Opposition
Members would like to see more evidence from the Government of tangible
steps towards more integrated assessment processes throughout the range
of benefits, but we must understand that in this specific case there
are good reasons for the assessment being covered by two clauses even
though, in practice, the customers will be undergoing what they
perceive to be one
assessment.</div><a name="06101967000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000356"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds has asked me
some specific questions. I will not delay our proceedings and test my
Whip&#146;s patience because I can hear his pen clicking. When I and
my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary were Whips, that was a sure sign of
telling others to get on with it. Obviously, we hope that the support
group would take no minutes as we anticipate the majority of support
group assessments not to take place face to face at all. I know that
the hon. Gentleman will not consider me churlish when I say that the
new assessment will take as long as it takes. It is a new approach.
Assessors will be assessing, interviewing and listening to people to
whom, in truth, they were not listening in the past, such as those with
learning disabilities and fluctuating mental health conditions. They
will be looked at with a new set of physical and mental health
descriptors and thus as a Government we shall not set a target for how
many minutes the assessment should take. If the process evolves and we
learn from best practice, that could be our territory, but it would be
wrong now to set such a
target.</div><a name="06101967000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000357"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000360"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I tabled amendment No. 10 because
&#147;specific disease&#148; is a narrow term. It could be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 128</div>interpreted as focusing only on recognised medical conditions,
suggesting that a diagnosis of a medical condition must have already
been made. There will always be examples of people who have a chronic
health condition, while the implications of the condition might not be
subject to a specific medical diagnosis. That may be due to the fact
that symptoms present themselves atypically or they may be affected by
a disease that is not yet fully recognised or understood by the medical
community. Some people may have been diagnosed with a specific disease.
They also might have other symptoms, the cause of which could be
unclear, but which should be taken into account in their
assessment.</div><a name="06101967000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
danger with the current terminology in the clause that doctors will be
pressured into making a diagnosis to assist in meeting statutory
requirements to qualify for employment and support allowance. I do not
think that that is the Minister&#146;s or the Government&#146;s
intention. A situation where a diagnosis is always required, even if
doctors remain uncertain, is the current practice in relation to death
certificates. But research published in June suggested that around half
of death certificates are inaccurate because of pressure on doctors to
diagnose a specific disease. That may result in a higher level of
misdiagnosis, which could be very damaging for individuals if the
practice were to be applied in this
case.</div><a name="06101967000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather than a
specific disease, I would argue that illness would be a much better
term to use in this part of the Bill, as it offers the opportunity to
consider what is described as the patient&#146;s narrative. The value
of doing that has become an important topic in the medical profession.
It allows not just the treatment of the disease but consideration of a
person&#146;s individual experience of that disease, which can vary
greatly symptomatically and in severity. Specifying the word
&#147;illness&#148; in the Bill as opposed to a specific disease
will therefore tie in much better with therapeutic approaches, such as
the condition management programme and indeed the expert patient
programme, which has been rolled out by the Department of Health and
relies on the patient&#146;s narrative. It will also prevent the Bill
from being out of kilter with the direction in which the medical sector
is heading as it makes greater use of narrative
approaches.</div><a name="06101967000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tabled
amendment No. 11 because I am a bit confused about what the Government
mean by &#147;bodily or mental disablement&#148;. That phrase is
too confused for primary legislation. The term
&#147;disablement&#148; has some advantages in that it potentially
allows the relationship between the impairment and the environment to
be taken into account. Is it the Minister&#146; intention to
allow the relationship between impairment and the environment to be
taken into account in this part of the Bill? The way that the term is
used here locates disablement as being bodily or mental, which is
completely at odds with the definition that the Government have
effectively adopted with their acceptance of the strategy unit&#146;s
report, &#147;Improving the life chances of disabled people.&#148;
That report
states:</div><a name="06101967000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Disability
is defined for this project as the disadvantage experienced by an
individual as a result of barriers (attitudinal, physical, etc.) that
impact on people with impairments and /or ill health.&#148;</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 129</div><a name="06101967000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would strongly support the
Government&#146;s moves towards defining disability in this way but I
think that this clause needs to make it clear whether it means
disablement or the Government intend it to mean impairment. If the
Minister does not wish to accept these amendments at the moment, I
should be grateful if he would explain why not. Will he also consider
whether the language in this part of the Bill could be improved and
whether the Government might table amendments on this in due
course?</div><a name="06101967000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000361"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I speak very much along the same lines as the hon.
Gentleman. He makes important points. The language of this part of the
Bill is antiquated. It is not used elsewhere in the Bill and it is only
used in current legislation with respect to previous legislation such
as that relating to the war disablement pension and severe disablement
allowance. Disablement is not a term that we commonly use and it is not
widely understood. I certainly would not have the confidence to venture
an explanation on the difference between a disablement and an
impairment.</div><a name="06101967000275"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.29

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000362"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I think that the Committee had moved into one of its
more arcane discussions. We were debating the differences between
disablement, disability and impairment. I put it to you, Mr.
Amess, that if understanding the differences had been a qualification
for joining this Committee, it might not have had very many
members.</div><a name="06101967000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000363"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Who is he talking
about?</div><a name="06101967000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000364"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> On this side, it would have been very full, but I do
not wish to
speculate.</div><a name="06101967000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment does not need a huge amount of discussion. Its point is to
probe whether there is a significant legal reason why we must use such
archaic wording or whether we could follow George Orwell&#146;s
dictum that where a simple piece of language can be used instead of a
more complicated one, that is the piece of language that we should
use.</div><a name="06101967000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000365"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I will try to respond to all the points that have
been raised, and to do so more briefly than we did earlier. By
necessity, the earlier debate was pretty technical in
structure.</div><a name="06101967000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 11 was tabled by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey. In clause 8, we used specific terminology with clear
definitions. Disease, disablement and impairment are specific terms
that have been clearly defined by the World Health Organisation.
Disease&#151;if the hon. Member for South-West Surrey will bear with
me for a moment&#151;is an objective, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 130</div>medically diagnosed condition. Impairment is defined as the loss or
abnormality of a bodily structure or function. Disablement&#151;I
personally do not enjoy the phrase, but nevertheless it has a
recognised definition&#151;is a restriction of ability that results
from an impairment. I hope that he is reassured that an impairment
causes a disablement according to the World Health
Organisation&#146;s definition. It is not a medical explanation; it
is a definitional explanation. The terms are clearly defined and
internationally recognised and ensure that the legislation can be
easily interpreted and properly
applied.</div><a name="06101967000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000366"></a>Mr.
David:</b> I would not question the Minister&#146;s
definitions for one moment&#151;I have no intention of doing
so&#151;but does that mean that the definitions employed in the Bill
make it consistent with earlier
legislation?</div><a name="06101967000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000367"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The Bill is of course consistent with previous
legislation. It is the Government&#146;s intention, through the
Bill&#146;s reference to other legislation, to be able to revise the
legislation continually to take account of trends in the insurance
industry and in society and of the changing nature of the customer base
for the employment and support allowance.</div>
<a name="06101967000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Assessing impairment alone
could mean that some customers who were not disabled by their
impairments would receive benefits while other customers with more
minimal impairments but suffering from severe disability would not
receive it. That is not our policy intention, and I know that it is not
the intention of those who have proposed amendments today.</div>
<a name="06101967000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">An example might help hon.
Members to understand the distinction. Someone with multiple sclerosis
might have a period of many years&#146; remission and thus no
disablement. Eligibility based on a condition alone would ensure that
someone who is fit for work and wishes to work would be placed on ESA.
</div><a name="06101967000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also want to
include individuals with medically unexplained conditions such as
chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. We recognise that people
with such conditions might have minimal impairment but suffer from
functional limitations because of the pain and fatigue that they
experience.</div><a name="06101967000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 10 was also moved by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch
and Strathspey. The definition of illness is an individual&#146;s
subjective perception of feeling unwell. It is much less specific than
&#147;disease&#148;. Not everyone with a function-limiting
disabling condition feels ill as a result. For example, people with
learning disabilities have a medically diagnosed condition, but they do
not have an illness. That is an important distinction, and I know that
it is not the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intention to suggest even
implicitly that a learning disability is an illness.</div>
<a name="06101967000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">To adopt the terminology urged
by the amendment would fail to cover many whose conditions leave them
functionally limited and needing the assistance of the employment and
support allowance and the support available through it and the national
roll-out of pathways. It would have the opposite effect to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s stated intentions&#151;it would exclude people,
not include them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 131</div><a name="06101967000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 226 was tabled by
the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds and others. The wording</div>
<a name="06101967000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;disease or bodily or mental
disablement&#148;</div> <a name="06101967000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">is very
similar to the wording in section 171C(2)(a) of the Social
Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, which deals
with the existing personal capability assessment. The wording relates
to the activities that are tested by the PCA. We want to ensure that we
are looking at restrictions on a claimant&#146;s abilities correctly
and to do so we tie whether someone can manage those activities to a
person-specific disease or bodily or mental disablement. It is a
claimant&#146;s restricted ability resulting from a condition that
makes it harder for him or her to walk or to undertake other
activities, not the condition itself. The phrase &#147;physical or
mental condition&#148; is too broad to be applied in this context for
determining eligibility.</div>
<a name="06101967000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example&#151;again I say
it gently&#151;pregnancy is a physical condition and I know that it
is not the intention of Opposition Members for it to be a considered as
an entitlement to ESA. However, in respect of the amendments, the
physical condition could, and would, be interpreted legally as possibly
including pregnancy and other
circumstances.</div><a name="06101967000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
danger of accepting the amendments as drafted is that they would
reinvent some unfortunate aspects of the incapacity benefit system
whereby it is the condition that places someone on an inactive benefit
rather than the limits that that condition has imposed on their
everyday life and their ability to be in the labour
market.</div><a name="06101967000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise
the importance of identifying an individual&#146;s perception of and
attitude to their condition, as that can influence how they feel and
their attitude to the labour market. That will be done as part of the
work-focused health-related assessment which we will discuss
later.</div><a name="06101967000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The specific
words and phrases have an important and internationally recognised
legal purpose, and my explanation was, by necessity, slightly
technical, but I encourage the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey to reflect on it and to consider withdrawing
the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000368"></a>Danny

<a name="06101967000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000369"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I do not propose to press my amendment to a Division
but I want to put it on the record that it is not helpful for a
Government to use wording in earlier legislation, which may be
extremely unclear and difficult to understand, as a basis for new
measures.</div> <a name="06101967000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I give as
an example the Minister&#146;s description of the difference between
the words &#147;bodily&#148; and &#147;physical&#148;.
&#147;Bodily&#148; sounds like the kind of word one would read in
the Bible, but &#147;physical&#148; is a word that most people
would understand. In respect of the common use of English, I am not
sure that I agree with the Minister that pregnancy is a physical
condition but not a bodily condition; it seems to me that they are two
words describing exactly the same thing. It would be much more helpful
if the Bills were drafted so that people without medical expertise
could understand them. However, I accept the Minister&#146;s broader
points.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 132</div><a name="06101967000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000370"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I welcome the fact that the hon. Gentleman has
offered to withdraw the amendment, but he knows that these Bills have
to be legally and technically competent. We are not writing an essay or
poetic prose when we draft a Bill and we seek to ensure absolute and
consistent clarity. That is the reason for using those
phrases.</div> <a name="06101967000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
earlier, I do not like the word &#147;disablement&#148; but it has
a clearly defined legal and technical understanding which is recognised
here and internationally. The phrases were included for reasons of
clarity and consistency. To do as the hon. Gentleman suggests&#151;I
am trying to be comradely and gentle towards him&#151;would create
the type of uncertainty that he claims to want to
avoid.</div>

Alexander:</b> The amendments propose a reference to a right
of appeal in clauses 8 to 12. Their purpose is to probe the
Government&#146;s intention and to ensure that there will be a full
appeal process for each assessment and under each clause. Given the new
assessments introduced by the Bill, and the new levels of
conditionality that will be introduced by later clauses in the Bill and
which are dealt with by amendments Nos. 27, 33 and 35&#151;no doubt
we shall debate them fully in due course&#151;it is important that
claimants understand clearly that a proper right of appeal exists in
each case.</div><a name="06101967000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister make it clear for the record that the Government intend such a
right of appeal to exist, and will he clarify in general terms how the
appeals will work? The Minister quite rightly made the point earlier
that there is a problem with the current medical assessment in getting
GPs to submit information in a timely manner, and the Minister referred
to the need to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 133</div>get that additional information up front&#151;that is also the subject
of one of the later amendment groups. However, it should be clear that
appeals would allow the admission of new medical evidence even if the
evidence had not been submitted by the time of the initial decision.
Appeals should also allow for discussion on the appropriateness of
work-related activity in which individuals are asked to take part and
of the activity for which their capability is being assessed, as well
as discussion on the standards of service provision of work-related
activity and on the support that claimants should receive for
compliance, bearing in mind that compliance will be a condition of
their receiving benefit. Variations in the health condition of
individuals could prevent them from continuing with work-related
activity requirements, and that may also be the basis for a valid
appeal.</div><a name="06101967000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier, we
discussed the relatively high appeal rate under the current system and
the relatively high proportion of successful appeals. It is likely that
more appeals will be made on introduction of the new allowance, so it
is important that appeals procedures are clear and that they are in
place from the outset. Will the Minister therefore put on record the
Government&#146;s position on rights of
appeal?</div><a name="06101967000153"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000375"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I should like to say a few words about appeals
and about the importance of getting these clauses right. If we do not,
we may face the same high number of appeals that we have seen under the
current regime&#151;not just the regime since 1997 but the one that
was operated by the Conservative Administration before 1997. I should
like to share some figures, for which I do not apportion blame to the
current Government&#151;excessive numbers of appeals appear to have
been endemic in the system for a long time. Having too many appeals is
bad for two reasons. First, and most importantly, they are bad for
claimants. By definition, if claimants are seeking to go on to some
form of support or welfare, they are in need. People in need are quite
often stressed and vulnerable, and the last thing they need is the
strain and uncertainty that comes with what can be long-drawn-out
appeal procedures. The second reason why we need to ensure that the
legislation and regulations are tightly drafted, and to reduce the
number of appeals below their historic levels, is that an excessive
number of appeals is bad value for the taxpayer. More time spent by
Government officials administering long-drawn-out procedures is more of
the DWP&#146;s budget spent on that process and administration and
less going to the front line. Therefore, I would hope that we all agree
that too many appeals are a bad thing. I guess one of the tests of the
proposals throughout this Bill is how we can do better in the
future.</div>
<a name="06101967000277"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="06101967000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The report by
the president of appeal tribunals in 2004-5 found that 50 per cent. of
incapacity benefit appeal cases surveyed were overturned and found in
favour of the claimant. Interestingly, that compares with 28 per cent.
of cases overturned for JSA claimants, 35 per cent. for income support
claimants and 48 per cent. in the case of disability living 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 134</div>allowance cases. With reference to IB cases, the main reasons given by
the report were that the tribunal was given additional evidence not
available to the decision maker&#151;I think the Minister referred to
that in an earlier debate today. That occurred in 70 per cent. of
relevant cases. The report also found that tribunal chairmen commonly
commented that the presence of the appellant at the tribunal either
produced new evidence or shed light on existing evidence. That was
particularly the case when dealing with mental health issues.</div>
<a name="06101967000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second most reported reason
for IB cases being overturned was that the medical report
underestimated the severity of the disability, a point raised earlier
by the hon. Lady the Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford). That
occurred in 50 per cent. of overturned cases, an increase from 37 per
cent. in the previous year. Tribunal chairmen expressed concern that
the length of time taken to complete medical examinations was
inadequate&#151;a point that we have also touched on
today&#151;resulting in incomplete histories being taken of a
claimant.</div><a name="06101967000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also know
the Public Accounts Committee has the same perspective. Its 2003-04
report, &#147;Progress on improving the medical assessments for
incapacity benefit and disability living allowance&#148; concluded
that the number of successful appeals continued to suggest that the
performance of doctors and DWP decision makers had to improve. The
report recommended that the Department should provide regular feedback
on appeal tribunal cases to the doctors and decision makers involved so
that they knew the outcomes of the cases that they had
examined.</div><a name="06101967000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">In November
2005, the DWP issued new guidance which emphasised the role of
reconsideration in the decision-making and appeal process. I do not
know whether the current Ministers were then in post; I have lost
track. Actually, there has been continuity among the Ministers of State
and Under-Secretaries who do the real work, but there has been a bit
more change at the top. I wish to make no party political point there.
[<i class="I">Interruption</i>] Well, that is all the Minister and
Under-Secretary are going to get out of me today. The hon. Gentleman
has been tempting me all day and earlier in the week, and I have not
gone down the party political
route.</div><a name="06101967000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000376"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Despite severe
provocation.</div><a name="06101967000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000377"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> As my hon. Friend said, despite severe
provocation.</div><a name="06101967000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000378"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Does my hon. Friend consider that the party
political diatribes, in so far as they have emerged in this Committee,
usually tend to be preceded by the word &#147;gently&#148; from the
Minister?</div><a name="06101967000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000379"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I will not try your patience, Mr.
Amess. </div><a name="06101967000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Suffice to say
that the advice given in November 2005&#151;issued by the
DWP&#151;emphasised the role of reconsideration in the
decision-making appeal process. In January, the Green Paper itself
acknowledged that further improvements to the decision-making appeal
process were needed. If I may quote&#151;Ministers have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 135</div>obviously come across this, but I do have a point following
on&#151;the Green Paper
said:</div><a name="06101967000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
recognise that a robust and independent appeals process is an integral
part of any fair system of assessment. The current system generates a
very high number of appeals, many of which are successful. We believe
that improvements can be made so the need for appeals is
minimised.&#148;</div><a name="06101967000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are all on
the same page here and the Ministers are already on to this.</div>
<a name="06101967000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the DWP proposes to reduce the number of appeals by
ensuring that claimants have a clear understanding of the basis for the
initial decision. We will touch on that in Committee, and it will also
incorporate a comprehensive reconsideration process before an appeal
moves in to the tribunal phase. Finally, it will ensure that new
evidence is included in the reconsideration process rather than at the
tribunal. That is my understanding.</div>
<a name="06101967000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a simple question for
Minister. Could he give us an update on how they see these good ideas
that proceed from the Green Paper proposals operating and where might
we discover more about that in this
Bill?</div><a name="06101967000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final point
relates to an argument made by the TUC and Mr. Excell, who I
should say has been a
great&#151;</div><a name="06101967000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000380"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Supporter of the
Conservatives.</div><a name="06101967000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000381"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> A great witness, I was going to say, and
particularly in the Work and Pensions Committee inquiry into pathways
to work in the spring. Mr. Excell has come up with some
telling points. He has experienced mental health issues at close
quarters, and to show that I am not an aggressively modern
Conservative, I am happy to quote a point from official TUC policy,
because it is a good one. He has
said:</div><a name="06101967000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Are
there contingency plans in place to deal with the predicted rise in
appeals as a result of the new
test?&#148;</div><a name="06101967000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">It struck me as
interesting that he is predicting already that there will be a rise in
appeals as a result of the new test. It is not because he is a
pessimist. He explains his logic as
follows:</div><a name="06101967000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
there is going to be a new test then there are going to be masses of
appeals. You can guarantee that. The effect of the new test will be the
same as it always is. This would be true under any Government regime
that wanted new tests. Initially you get a bit reduction in the numbers
coming on to the benefit and then advice workers and so on find their
way round the new system and the numbers start creeping up again and a
big load of appeals will almost certainly be part of
that.&#148;</div><a name="06101967000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the view
of Mr.
Excell.</div><a name="06101967000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000382"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman is making a very important
point, so does he agree with the point I made earlier about the
importance of evaluating the new test to ensure that it works properly
and that the evaluation is carried through to the appeals stage and not
just done quickly over a couple of
months?</div><a name="06101967000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000383"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman and we will no
doubt return to this issue when we get to the clauses relating to
piloting. We must not lose sight of that and I am sure we will be able
to tease out some further thoughts from the
Minister.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 136</div><a name="06101967000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not wish to be pessimistic
and do not wish to talk down this new test before it is even put in
place. That is not the point of my remarks. The point of my remarks is
to ask whether any contingency planning has been done in case the
circumstances that Mr. Excell predicts come to pass. It will
be useful to hear whether there is any budgetary allowance being made
for contingency planning if there is the cascade of further appeals
that we hope will not occur. This is not because the test is a bad one,
or faulty, or that we have not being doing our work in tightening it up
in Committee, but simply because of the nature of the beast. When there
is a new test, initially it can tighten the gateway but, after time,
when people get used to how it works, it might lead to more appeals.
None of us here want to get back to square one.</div>
<a name="06101967000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is clearly already an
issue that Ministers have flagged up in their earlier guidance and have
talked about in the Green Paper. I am just looking for some kind of
progress report and, in particular, I would like to know whether there
is a contingency plan.</div>
<a name="06101967000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000384"></a>John
Robertson:</b> In my experience as an MP, problems with the
appeals procedure occur at the first interview when the person is
brought in to be assessed. Will the Minister allay my fears? Part of
the problem is that nobody takes responsibility for ensuring that all
the information that must be gathered&#151;from GPs, hospitals,
social workers or anyone else concerned with the person being
interviewed&#151;is with the assessor at the time of the assessment.
Yet, even though the assessor knows that the medical information is not
there, they still go ahead with the assessment, which, as we have heard
today, is done on a points-based
system.</div><a name="06101967000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
individual in question will know the impact of their illness on their
everyday life, they will not understand the fine details, which have to
be given to the assessor. My great fear is that we will go down the
same road as we always do and have the same problem and number of
appeals&#151;who knows with a new system, we might even have
more.</div> <a name="06101967000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister allay my fears and confirm that at the first point of the
assessment, the assessor will take full responsibility for ensuring
that all the medical documentation has been received and that they
converse with the necessary people, whether the GP, consultant or
social worker, to ensure that they have all the information at their
fingertips? That would prevent more than half the appeals that go
through, such as those about which people come to see me in
surgery.</div><a name="06101967000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000385"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> In the spirit of this consensus, I pay tribute to
Richard Excell from the TUC, and his colleagues. Obviously, Richard is
the person with whom we talk most regularly, but the entire TUC is
committed and determined to ensure that no one is written off. As we
all know, the historical Labour party and trade union demand for the
right to work regardless of circumstance or background finds a strong
echo in what we are setting out today.</div>
<a name="06101967000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unless we achieve some of the
objectives being discussed today, we cannot meet our commitment to
providing full employment for everyone regardless of circumstance or
ability and ensuring that they have the chance to enter the
labour market if they so 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 137</div>wish. I happily add a tribute from Government Members to Mr.
Richard Excell; he has worked on welfare reform as well as important
work on child poverty with the Department and I know that all my hon.
Friends endorse very strongly the work that the TUC does on that
agenda.</div><a name="06101967000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">On appeals, I
say to the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey,
as with many of his other amendments, that he has given us the
opportunity to put on the record our intention: customers will have a
right of appeal over every decision that attracts a sanction. We have
spoken about non-attendance at work-focused interviews and
work-focused, health-related assessments, and other aspects of
conditionality, and I can say that there will be an appeal against any
decision that attracts a financial sanction. I hope that that reassures
him.</div><a name="06101967000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
Government&#146;s approach to reducing the number of appeals, it
would be ridiculous for us to say how many appeals we think that there
might be. An individual may take the right to appeal if they so wish.
We have set out on page 6 of the draft regulations on the support of
appeal the other protections for those who need or wish to appeal a
sanction. Hon. Members may know that people will have the right to be
accompanied by an advocate to speak on their behalf on such occasions.
The key to reducing the number of appeals, including successful
appeals, is getting decisions
right.</div><a name="06101967000278"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="06101967000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000386"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I want to ensure that the Committee understands
this point precisely. The Minister used a specific form of words: he
said that customers will have a right to appeal against every decision
that attracts a sanction. What about decisions that do not attract a
sanction, such as a decision whether to grant benefit or a decision as
to which component of benefit someone will be entitled to? Those
decisions do not carry a sanction, yet people would expect a right of
appeal against them, and I certainly hope that they would have that
right.</div><a name="06101967000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000387"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I can reassure the hon. Gentleman on that point.
An assessment about which component of ESA someone is entitled to will
have a financial impact&#151;whether it is a support group or a
work-related activity group&#151;and therefore there would be a right
of appeal. Whether someone is entitled to ESA at all is a financial
issue as well, so that would also come under the new ESA
arrangements.</div><a name="06101967000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
labouring the point too much, getting the decision right in the first
place is obviously a way to reduce the number of successful appeals.
That is one of the most important aspects. Hon. Members have compared
the number of appeals relating to jobseeker&#146;s allowance with
those relating to incapacity benefit, but the assessment for JSA is
relatively straightforward, whereas the assessments for IB and ESA are,
by their nature, a good deal more
complicated.</div><a name="06101967000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
move towards a system of reconsideration of decisions, rather than
fully blown appeals, so that when someone presents new evidence the
decision 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 138</div>maker looks at it and reconsiders the decision, rather than putting the
customer through the difficulty of the appeal process and taking the
advocates to the appeal and then presenting the evidence, at which
point the decision may be overturned. It would be much better to
increasingly rely on reconsideration by decision makers. That is an
important part of reducing the number of appeals, including successful
appeals.</div><a name="06101967000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are working with the appeal tribunal, the Department for Constitutional
Affairs and others, and having conversations about how we can get the
detail exactly right now and in the future in terms of ESA. My hon.
Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West is right about the assessor
taking responsibility for what is going on and the fact that the
decision maker should have a sense of responsibility and initiative,
because although that already happens in many instances, that sense has
not, perhaps, been strong enough in other instances. It is about
ensuring that we have a system whereby the decision maker can ask for
more information, so that a reconsideration takes place rather than
people having to go through the whole
journey.</div><a name="06101967000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000388"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for setting out
in his customarily clear way how this would work. In terms of the
reconsideration, which I understand is a mechanism to speed up the
process&#151;I take on board the point made by the hon. Member for
Glasgow, North-West&#151;if a claimant is unsatisfied with the result
of a reconsideration, will the Minister just clarify that there would
still be a formal power of appeal? The purpose of the amendments was to
make it explicit that powers to make regulations in relation to the
rights to appeal are in the Bill. If the Minister does not intend to
accept the amendments, will he make it clear where the powers come from
to make those
regulations?</div><a name="06101967000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000389"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I shall happily do so&#151;but relatively
briefly. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern can be allayed by the fact
that a reconsideration is not an alternative to an appeal. Someone can
go through the reconsideration process and still go through the appeal
process. The answer to his relatively technical question is that we
have absolutely no intention of advancing regulations in these clauses
without ensuring that there is a right of appeal against a decision to
disallow a benefit or one that could lead to the sanction of a
customer&#146;s benefit, as I have already
said.</div><a name="06101967000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill already
provides for rights of appeal in relation to ESA in schedule 3(6)(3),
which amends section 8 of the Social Security Act 1998, so that the ESA
will be deemed a &#147;relevant benefit&#148; and part 1 of the
Bill will be a &#147;relevant enactment&#148; for the purposes of
that section. Social security appeals are dealt with in the 1998 Act
and legislation supporting it. We are ensuring that the employment and
support allowance fits into that structure. For the technical reason
that I have outlined, the amendment tabled by the hon. Gentleman is
unnecessary. With that reassurance, I encourage him to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06101967000192"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000393"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> These amendments relate to a point that has
already been a matter of some discussion in this Committee. That is the
question to which the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West referred: the
need for outside organisations, particularly GPs, hospitals or doctors,
to supply information in a timely fashion for the initial assessment.
As a number of hon. Members have said, such information is often not
supplied in time for the initial assessment to take place. The
information that could have been supplied in time for the assessment is
then brought forward at the appeal stage, leading to a greater number
of appeals. I understand that in some parts of the country, around 50
per cent. of requests to GPs for information for disability benefits
are not responded to. That varies in different parts of the country,
but most members of the Committee would consider such a lack of
provision of information unacceptable. The lack of such information is
one of the main reasons why appeals are made.</div>
<a name="06101967000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason for tabling the
amendments is that, to prevent a similar situation arising for
employment and support allowance assessments, it may be necessary for
the Secretary of State to have a power to make regulations to ensure
that relevant health professionals provide the necessary information in
a timely manner. Of course, that power may not need to be used, but I
submit to the Committee that the Bill should allow for the possibility
of such a requirement. If the Committee and the Government were to
support the amendments, that is what they would be doing. I encourage
the Minister to accept them, or at least to indicate whether he would
be minded to table Government amendments on the matter at a later
stage.</div>
<a name="06101967000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000394"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> In response to amendments No. 13 and 24, across
the country responses from some GPs are unacceptably slow. Many GPs see
the importance of such work and are actively engaged in ensuring that
they provide the information in an accurate and timely way. I hope that
I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. Legislation already places duties on
GPs to ensure that they participate in the process that we are
discussing today. Although the obligations of GPs to provide
information are contained in their contracts, we have set out the
content of such contracts in legislation, in the National Health
Service (General Medical Services Contracts) Regulations 2004. We shall
amend those regulations appropriately to deal with employment and
support allowance. Meanwhile, we shall amend section 130 of the Social
Security Administration Act 1992 to include employment and support
allowance, placing a duty on employers to provide us with the
information 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 140</div>that we request. I shall happily go into more detail if the hon.
Gentleman wishes, but I hope that that explanation reassures
him.</div><a name="06101967000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000395"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
explanation. I would only note in passing that, at a later stage of the
Bill, we shall discuss sanctions on claimants for not participating in
activities that they are required to participate in by law. Does the
Minister think it appropriate, given the emphasis that he put on the
importance of responsibility, about which I agree, that in some parts
of the country 50 per cent. of GPs are not submitting information that
they are required by law to submit? Should they be sanctioned in some
way?</div><a name="06101967000201"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000400"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> By replacing the term &#147;medical
examination&#148; with &#147;assessment relating to his physical or
mental condition&#148;, as suggested in amendments Nos. 191 and 192,
we would introduce a broader concept allowing the inclusion of a range
of evidence rather than simply a face to face examination. Instead of
the process being excessively medicalised, as it were, that would allow
other matters such as psycho-social factors to be taken into account.
That might mean using non-medical as well as medical evidence, which
returns us to our debate on Tuesday on labour market
disadvantage. It would allow, for example, consideration of a
patient&#146;s own account of the severity of their illness and the
way in which their impairment affects them and limits how they can live
their life.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 141</div><a name="06101967000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The impact of a person&#146;s
environment on their illness could also be taken into account; for
example, a lack of mobility could be more of an impairment and barrier
to a person who lives in an area that is poor for accessible transport,
such as a remote village in the highlands and islands of Scotland. The
lack of any form of accessible public transport could be more of a
barrier to someone with a mobility problem than to someone in a city.
The amendments would also allow account to be taken of the
psychological impact of an illness or impairment and symptoms for which
there is not a clear medical
explanation.</div><a name="06101967000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
point out to the Minister that the Disability Rights Commission has
argued that the amendments would be consistent with moves to make the
personal capability assessment more inclusive of mental health
problems. I urge him to consider carefully the proposed change in
wording which, while enabling the process that has been described to
take place, would allow a broader range of factors to be taken into
account, more closely reflecting not only the medical components of
someone&#146;s impairment or condition but its consequences on their
ability to engage in society in the way that we have
discussed.</div><a name="06101967000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000401"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 246 and 247,
which stand in my name. They are probing amendments, and I do not wish
to repeat our discussions of this morning about the importance of
simplifying the assessment processes. If it were possible to share
information that applicants have already supplied in the limited
capability for work assessment process when filling in forms for the
disability living allowance, that would reduce the burden of complying
with the assessment
process.</div><a name="06101967000279"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="06101967000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am aware,
particularly after the Minister&#146;s explanation, that the two
tests will be fundamentally different in structure. It is a challenge,
but I put it to Ministers that a lot of the things that they are trying
to identify through the limited capability for work assessment and the
DLA assessment have common ground. The hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey suggested that we should consider having
a core assessment that could be used across both tests. If the Minister
cannot accept our amendments, is he willing to undertake to examine
whether it would be possible to combine elements of the assessments as
a small step towards simplifying the assessment procedures?</div>
<a name="06101967000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must say that I do not think
that the amendments are worded as well as they might be. Clearly, some
people who apply for this new benefit will not be on DLA, so perhaps it
would be advantageous to proceed with these amendments using slightly
clearer wording. What the Conservatives had in mind when we tabled the
amendments was that the assessment process might include a series of
questions, in which those currently receiving DLA could proceed to
question 7 without having to deal with questions 1 to 6 because those
grounds would already have been covered.</div>
<a name="06101967000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was the kind of thing that
we had in mind&#151;simplifying the process to make the transition
between being on benefit and off benefit as smooth as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 142</div>possible, so that people on benefit are not frightened to leave benefit
and engage in the world of work, because they feel that it will be
relatively easy to go back on benefit should they need to do
so.</div><a name="06101967000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000402"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Again, I will try to respond as briefly as detail
allows to the specific points that have been raised. We cannot enter
into designing new forms by Committee today. I shall not be tempted
down the road of discussing which questions should be on which form,
whether it is questions 1 to 7 on a DLA form or any other form. The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s principle is a fair one and one that the
Government are already committed to&#151;greater information sharing
and the removal where possible of unnecessary repetition of requests
for information. We also want to ensure where we can that we use
information that already exists within
government.</div><a name="06101967000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
the specific suggestion in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment. As I
said, DLA and ESA both consider the functional effects of diseases or
disabling conditions, but they are designed for completely different
purposes. As a result, their entitlement criteria are completely
different. DLA identifies when a claimant needs help with personal
care, mobility or supervision or needs to be supervised to avoid
danger. ESA is an entirely different benefit for a different purpose.
It will identify when a claimant has limited capability for work.
Someone may claim DLA while working and be eligible despite that fact.
Because the purposes of the two benefits are so different, it is
difficult to imagine how we could use core information collected for
DLA in any meaningful way for
ESA.</div><a name="06101967000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
principles underlying DLA is that it is a benefit based on
customers&#146; self-assessment of their needs. Many customers
claiming DLA do not have a medical examination before their entitlement
is determined. Of 95,800 new DLA claims between April and June this
year, only 14,000 claimants had a medical examination. I know that the
hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that placing the DLA process on top of
or alongside the ESA process would unintentionally reinvent some of the
worst aspects of incapacity benefit. Therefore, it is not something
that we are attracted to. However, the general
direction&#151;information sharing and reducing the burden on the
customer&#151;is one to which the Government are totally committed. I
remind the Committee that the only caveat in terms of repeat requests
for information is that, with fluctuating conditions, we will seek to
ensure that we have the most up-to-date
information.</div>
<a name="06101967000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000403"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I appreciate that the Minister is as committed as I
am to the principle of trying to simplify the assessment processes as
far as possible. Are there any things going on in his Department that
he could describe to the Committee to reassure us that this is not just
a worthy ideal and that the Department is taking practical steps to see
whether the assessment processes can be
simplified?</div><a name="06101967000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000404"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman will be aware that when we get
to clause 38 we can have the debate on information sharing in much more
detail. He could also table amendments if he felt it
appropriate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 143</div><a name="06101967000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to amendments Nos. 190,
191 and 192. The personal capability assessment is a process of
gathering and evaluating information from a number of sources so that
we can assess whether an individual has limited capability for work or
limited capability for work-related activity based on the 15 points
threshold or the 46 descriptors. We request information from health
care professionals and other relevant people. Customers who are not
placed in a support group are asked to complete a self-assessment form
to help us to assess their
condition.</div><a name="06101967000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the
evidence-gathering process is the face-to-face medical assessment with
an Atos Origin health care professional. The references in clauses 8
and 9 to medical examination are to that specific element of the PCA
process. Replacing &#147;examination&#148; with
&#147;assessment&#148; would not make it clear that these
references relate to a specific part of the process. The hon. Member
for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey rightly tabled his
amendment in order to clarify our intention. Replacing that word, which
has a specific meaning in this context, would lead to confusion about
assessment and examination. As we explained earlier, this assessment
process is related to three clauses and it would be unhelpful to
confuse matters, as his amendment would unintentionally do. I ask him
to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06101967000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000405"></a>Danny

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000408"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The purpose of the amendment is to ensure
through debate that the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 will apply
to assessments for the employment and support allowance. I hope that
the Minister can provide for that. The amendment has the support of a
number of organisations working in this area: Rethink, the National
Autistic Society, Mind, Together: Working for Wellbeing, the Royal
College of Psychiatrists, Mencap, Citizens Advice, the Sainsbury 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 144</div>Centre for Mental Health, Skill, the Disability Alliance and the
Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society. I will not list all the supporters
for every amendment, but in this case it is a significant
list.</div><a name="06101967000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a
number of reasons behind the amendment. One thing that the current high
level of appeals suggests, other than the factors we discussed earlier,
is that the assessment process is failing a significant number of
claimants. The assessment process itself needs to be more sensitive to
ensure that all claimants, regardless of the nature of their impairment
or condition, are able to participate fully and provide relevant
information during the assessment process itself. That would contribute
to better decision making and a reduction in the number of
appeals.</div> <a name="06101967000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
claimants, or potential claimants, who may come for assessment have a
right to reasonable adjustments under the Disability Discrimination
Act. However, the purpose of the amendment is to embed the right
explicitly in the assessment process to ensure that, as part of the
preliminaries to the assessment process, assessors ensure that possible
or reasonable adjustments are considered. From December 2006 the
Disability Discrimination Act will cover all functions of public
authorities and the public sector will be under a duty to promote
disability equality.</div>
<a name="06101967000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response to the welfare
reform Green Paper, the Disability Rights Commission recommended that
the Department for Work and Pensions should work with its medical
services contractor Atos Origin&#151;the company that conducts the
assessments&#151;and other stakeholders to improve the process of
examinations and to anticipate and meet the disability equality duty
obligations, especially in relation to mental health. I understand that
the DWP have taken that up and there is some thinking that the contract
with Atos Origin should be reworded or reformulated so as to make that
clear. In addition to spelling out for the Committee that he considers
that appropriate, I hope the Minister will state what progress has been
made with Atos Origin in reviewing the existing contracts to ensure
that they meet disability equality duty
requirements.</div>
<a name="06101967000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000409"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b><b class="B"> </b>The Government and the Department for Work
and Pensions are proud of our record in advancing the interests of
disabled people and other groups whose rights should be championed in
legislation.</div> <a name="06101967000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many
cases it will be necessary to ask the customer to attend a medical
examination, especially at the start of a new claim for employment and
support allowance. The Committee has already discussed why that may be
necessary, even though we want the support group to ensure that in as
many instances as possible there will be no need to attend the medical
assessment.</div> <a name="06101967000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
attendance at these examinations is vital, we are aware that people
receiving employment and support allowance will have health conditions
or disabilities. We need to be flexible in how we arrange and carry out
the examinations, especially when we consider the diversity of
experience of customers on ESA. We are actively supporting those with
learning disabilities and mental health difficulties to give them a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 145</div>chance to get back into the labour market. Where possible, we will put
the emphasis on flexibility and sensitivity, which includes making the
appropriate reasonable adjustments. Although I agree with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s sentiments, the amendments are unnecessary and I
will spell out why.</div><a name="06101967000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
hon. Members will be aware, section 21B of the Disability
Discrimination Act will come into force on 4 December. That
provision, which was inserted by the Disability Discrimination Act
2005, will make it unlawful for a public authority to discriminate
against a disabled person in carrying out its functions. In addition,
section 21E of the Act will also come fully into force on that day,
ensuring that public authorities will be under a duty to make
reasonable adjustments in carrying out their functions. The Secretary
of State's functions in relation to deciding or dealing with any claim
for employment and support allowance will be covered by these
provisions.</div> <a name="06101967000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that the hon. Gentleman may be concerned that medical
examinations and health-related assessments are likely to be undertaken
by a contractor on behalf of the Secretary of State, as they are at
present. The process in the contract, or subcontract will be similar to
the national roll-out of pathways to the private and voluntary sector.
However, let me make it clear that the Secretary of State will not be
avoiding his duties under the DDA by contracting with a private or
voluntary sector provider in relation to the
ESA.</div><a name="06101967000280"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div><a name="06101967000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The functions
of the Secretary of State in relation to ESA will remain his functions
even if he contracts with a third party to undertake them. Section
58(2) of the DDA provides
that</div><a name="06101967000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Anything
done by a person as agent for another person with the authority of that
other person shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as also done
by that other
person.&#148;</div><a name="06101967000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">This means that
the Secretary of State will still be subject to all his duties and
obligations under the DDA. For the purposes of the DDA, anything done
by a contractor would be regarded as being done by the Secretary of
State. Because of that, the Secretary of State will want to ensure that
any contractor delivering services on his behalf supports his
compliance with his duties in the
Act.</div><a name="06101967000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fully
appreciate the importance of ensuring that all reasonable adjustments
are made in relation to customers attending for assessment in
connection with their claim for ESA and ensuring that that is done in
compliance with the duties placed on the Secretary of State by the DDA.
I reassure the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members, who will be
interested in this point as a matter of principle and detail, that we
will ensure that any contractor undertaking such assessments on behalf
of the Secretary of State will be required to make all reasonable
adjustments, and that they will have to support such compliance, and
that these requirements will be fully reflected in the contractual
agreements with those contractors.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 146</div><a name="06101967000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">This has of necessity been a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000416"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000417"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am grateful to Committee members for their
forbearance.</div>
<a name="06101967000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment has the support of a large number of charities in the
disability lobby. It seeks to protect customers from having their
limited capability for work, and therefore their entitlement to
benefit, called into question because of incapacity or impairment. We
are concerned that claimants may not turn up to an interview if, for
example, they suffer from a mental illness or anxiety, have difficulty
in understanding procedures, or have learning disabilities. Such mental
conditions may cause them to fail not only to turn up for an
interview&#151;something for which the Bill contains
sanctions&#151;but to inform the assessor that they will not be
turning up. I am sure that the Government do not intend such people to
be penalised for the very impairment that the Bill seeks to help them
address so that they are able to get into the labour market or to
return to
it.</div><a name="06101967000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000418"></a>John
Robertson:</b> I realise that the amendment is important,
which is why the hon. Gentleman had to prepare for it. Will he tell me
how he stands in relation to those offenders who constantly fail to
turn up for interviews and who still use the exact excuse that he has
mentioned?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 147</div><a name="06101967000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000419"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. That is
why the amendment would insert the words &#147;good cause,&#148; so
that flexibility would be given to the assessors, and so that they
could distinguish people who fail to turn up
deliberately&#151;without good cause&#151;thereby exploiting and
discrediting the process. We do not want any truck with such people.
However, there may be some who can participate in the process only with
assistance. For example, those who may be entitled to the support
element of the benefit may be able to participate only with the help of
a personal assistant or carer. They may not receive that help if the
carer does not turn up on the day or if the personal assistant is ill,
and that may prevent them from participating. I know that it is not the
Government&#146;s intention that anyone in that category be
penalised. The amendment is therefore intended to probe the Government
to see whether safeguards will be in place to ensure that people are
not penalised in that
way.</div><a name="06101967000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000420"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for South-West
Surrey on finding his amendment, and on moving it; or on moving it and
then finding it&#151;I am not sure which. Perhaps I should
congratulate the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey for trying to move it on his behalf. I also congratulate
you, Mr. Amess: I have been here for nearly a decade but it
is the first time that I have seen a Chairman encourage a point of
order. I have never before seen a filibuster from a Chairman. The Bill
is unusual in many
ways.</div><a name="06101967000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The way in which
the hon. Member for South-West Surrey moved his amendment suggested
that he anticipates being reassured, and I know that I can reassure
him. The PCA is, of course, an evidence-gathering process. Clause 8(4)
allows us to determine whether a customer who has without good cause
failed to provide the information requested or failed to take part in a
medical examination does or does not have limited capability for work.
Paragraphs (b) and (c) of that subsection permit regulations to
identify the matters that should be taken into account when considering
whether someone has shown good cause for a failure to provide
information or attend a medical examination. It also allows
identification of circumstances in which someone would be treated as
having, or not having, good
cause.</div><a name="06101967000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
intend to set out in regulations pursuant to clause 8 the matters that
will be taken into account in determining whether a customer has shown
good cause. We shall have discussions with all interested parties on
what should constitute good cause, because it is certainly not our
intention to adopt a sanctions-first approach in any aspect of the
Bill. The ethos that has run right through the pathways 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 148</div>programme, and that has made it so successful, is a sanctions-last
approach. That will permeate what we are seeking to do in this part of
the Bill.</div><a name="06101967000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">We shall
seek to ensure that no one is unfairly penalised. Regulations will
ensure that the matters that have been mentioned are included in the
factors to be taken into account. We shall not set out an exhaustive
list, because of the need to respond to the situations of individual
customers. Much will be set out in operational guidance, but we want to
ensure that those who are face to face with individual customers have
flexibility at a local level&#151;flexibility that could not be
afforded by including all potential circumstances of good cause in a
central set of regulations. We shall list some of the more significant
circumstances, but we shall allow a sense of flexibility to determine
at a local level what is good cause. The intention is to allow people
to be able to argue what is and is not good cause, and my recollection
is that five days should be allowed in which to provide information.
The regulations already list as factors that we will take into account
the state of health of a claimant at the relevant time and the nature
of any disability from which he
suffers.</div><a name="06101967000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
that response reassures the hon. Gentleman that we shall not seek to
penalise unnecessarily. Sanctions will be the last resort, and the
circumstances that constitute good cause will not only be set out in a
list but will be the subject of flexibility at a local level, so that
the circumstances that are known to exist around the country can be
taken into account.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000421"></a>The
Chairman:</b><b class="B"> </b>For the sake of clarity, I
remind the Committee that Mr. Jeremy Hunt moved the
amendment.</div>
<a name="06101967000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101967000422"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Before I respond to the Minister, may I thank you,
Mr. Amess, for your generosity and for encouraging an
appropriate point of order? May I also thank the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey for being willing to move his
amendment first.</div>
<a name="06101967000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I lost my place in my
notes, that was not because I believed the amendment to be unimportant,
and I am pleased that we have been able to bring the issue to the
Committee&#146;s attention. Nevertheless, the Minister&#146;s
comments have reassured me, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

withdrawn.</i></div><a name="06101967000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further
consideration adjourned.<i class="I">&#151;[Mr.
Heppell.]</i></div><a name="06101967000265"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Adjourned
accordingly at three minutes to Four o&#146;clock until Tuesday 24
October at half-past Ten
