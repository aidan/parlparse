<H4><center>Cases in which the Treasury may arrange independent inquiries</center></H4>

<P>
Amendment proposed  [this day]: No. 74, in page 5, line 35, leave out `serious'. [
Mr. Flight.]


<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 75, in page 6, line 1, leaveout `serious'.

<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> It was my belief that the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) was about to get to his feet but, alas, it seems that the Committee will not have the joy, privilege or opportunity of hearing him speak to the amendments. It is a great sadness for everyone. I shall not tempt fate, but for me it was his one bite at the cherry.

<P>
The power for the Treasury to commission independent public interest inquiries into regulatory matters is another of the Bill's innovations. It is an important element in the Financial Services Authority's accountability framework. I said that the power is an innovation. I accept that public interest inquiries have been held before on an ad hoc basis, but this is the first time that statutory provision has been made for them in a specific sector. I remind the Committee of the inquiry into the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International by the then Lord Justice Bingham and, more recently, the inquiry by the Board of Banking Supervision into the Barings failure.

<P>
Members of the Committee will agree that those inquiries were both concerned with serious regulatory failures. We want to ensure that there is a proper statutory basis on which to set up an independent inquiry, were there a serious regulatory failure. That is an important step. The Bingham inquiry was important and produced a very authoritative report. However, it was conducted in the absence of any formal powers under which, for example, witnesses could be called. It is inherently unsatisfactory that such a vital inquiry should have had to rely on witnesses coming forward voluntarily.

<P>
The Bill provides for an inquiry to be conducted with the full range of powers to gather evidence, as in the High Court. The fact that we have aligned the powers of the inquiry with those of the High Court is itself an eloquent statement of the type of inquiry we intend should be held. Such power will enable us to set up inquiries into serious regulatory failures, which is not what the Opposition envisage under their amendments.

<P>
The amendments may look slight, but they would have a significant effect on the character of the inquiries provided for by the group of clauses. The inquiries will be formal; they will be funded by the taxpayer and have powers akin to those of the High Court in respect of the attendance and examination of witnesses. Setting up an independent inquiry is certainly not something that we would want to do lightly. Such procedure is a serious step to take.

<P>
It is only right that the Bill should state clearly that the purpose of such inquiries is to investigate serious regulatory failures. Nothing would be gained by removing the adjective ``serious''. The effect would be to create an unhealthy expectation that such inquiries would be common-or-garden events. There would inevitably be pressure to have a full, independent inquiry into all sorts of regulatory decisions.

<P>
By their nature, regulatory decisions will often not suit everyone and may be viewed as failure on the part of the regulator, but the proper recourse should be to the tribunal or the complaints investigator. The response should not be a full inquiry along the lines of Bingham. That is why the triggers in the Bill have been deliberately set high. We do not want such inquiries to become commonplace.

<P>
I hope that I have explained why the word ``serious'' has been used. I am minded to believe that Opposition Members have tabled this as a probing amendment, and I encourage them to withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): A lifeboat was used in the grave circumstances of 1974, when mistakes were made in the Bank of England's regulation. It would have been wrong to have described those mistakes as serious, but the systemic problem that arose was serious. We are genuinely trying to make the point that grave problems, as described in the Bill, can be caused by regulatory failures that may not be serious in themselves.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Financial Secretary had finished her speech. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could tell us what he intends to do with the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Financial Secretary has not satisfied us about the balance between the graveness of the financial failing and the seriousness of the regulatory failure. For example, some authorities in the United Kingdom jurisdiction did not grant BCCI licences, because they had good intelligence networks; others did, and wrought the problem of BCCI. I think that the Bank of England would have said that BCCI did not constitute a serious regulatory failure because the Bank was adhering to the rules and doing its duty as it saw it
--others may have argued differently.

<P>
We do not doubt the intention of holding such expensive inquiries only when matters of grave severity clearly need to be investigated, but we continue to question whether the serious regulatory failure qualification is appropriate; it is the gravity of the risk, the seriousness of the financial problems and their interaction with the regulatory role that will need special investigation from time to time. Indeed, such a problem might involve not a serious failure but an omission
--perhaps the regulatory machine cannot address something new that happens after the enactment of the Bill. There is nothing sinister in our proposal. We are making the genuine point that the inclusion of the word ``serious' means that financial problems that merit special investigation could not be considered according to the Bill. That must be wrong.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): I am conscious that I am speaking for a second time. I do not like doing so, but it has just occurred to me that, if the Treasury wants to set up an inquiry and to spend public money, it must satisfied not only that events

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``which posed or could have posed a grave risk to the financial system or caused . . . significant damage to the interests of consumers''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
have occurred, but that they might not have a occurred but for

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a serious failure in . . . the system established by this Act for the regulation of such schemes.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I can conceive that the Treasury might set up an inquiry when it does not think that things have gone wrong in its system or in employees' regulatory efforts, but when it is satisfied that something grave needs consideration. The insistence on making the condition a ``serious failure'' on the part of either the regulatory system or the regulator will inhibit the Treasury from having an inquiry when it might otherwise think one necessary. A brief explanation of that would be welcome.

<P>

<P>
</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.

<P>
Question proposed. That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The clause gives the Treasury the sole right to trigger an inquiry. We believe that that right should be shared more widely. If it appeared to the Bank of England or the practitioners panel that serious events had occurred, it would be wise to allow them to stimulate an inquiry, or for the Treasury to trigger an inquiry in the same way as it would do itself if it thought that such events had occurred. One is conscious that the Treasury will be jealous of its right to control inquiries; I shall not trespass on the detailed clauses about how it can say exactly what the inquiries shall and shall not do.

<P>
We would like an explanation of why only the Treasury can trigger such inquiries. The answer may be that if the Bank of England thinks that there should be an inquiry, it should knock on the Treasury's door; the Bank should be reasonably influential with the Treasury. The practitioners panel can send letters to newspapers such as The Times and stir up enough public concern to make the Treasury take action. Such a statutory structure gives the Treasury all the cards, and we are not happy about that. Why is it so strictly confined?

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): It is worth while explaining why the Bank of England will be the institution most likely to call for an inquiry. From my experience at the Treasury, I can envisage circumstances in which the Treasury would not want an inquiry, and would do its best to avoid one, but in which the Bank might be deeply unhappy. Such circumstances arose
--although, luckily, the problem was resolved
--for a brief period of 24 hours during the BP crisis that came in the wake of the stock market crash of 1987, which temporarily had systemic risk implications.

<P>
We have an independent Bank, which now has the power to set short-term interest rates entirely independently of the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Government. Any risk to the financial system has interest rate implications. It may require action on the part of the Bank to adjust for systemic risk, or risk to the financial system, as it is described in the clause. A sharp reduction, for example, might be required. In such circumstances, the Bank is by far the best-placed institution to judge whether an inquiry should be called. Leaving that power entirely in the hands of the Treasury is a mistake. Why will the Government not consider granting that power to the Bank of England, too?

<P>
I have discussed the question of who should call an inquiry in the event of systemic risk, or

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``grave risk to the financial system'',
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
as it is described in subsection (2)(a). Some people have argued that there is a difference between risk to the financial system and systemic risk. I have used the phrase ``systemic risk'' loosely, and refer the Committee to what the Financial Secretary is reported to have said on the matter in her evidence. She said that

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``responsibilities relating to systemic risk were `embedded' in the proposed objectives''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That can mean only that one of the proposed objectives is to avoid risk to the financial system. The two phrases therefore amount to much the same thing.

<P>
I shall allude briefly to another aspect of the question of who should call an inquiry. Subsection (3) deals with market problems in the listed securities market. In that case, too, the Treasury might not be the only competent authority, and it might be reasonable to allow the practitioner panel, for example, to call for an inquiry if it considered that the market had been very seriously disrupted. Will the Minister consider that proposal?

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As matters stand, I assume that the Treasury may call for such an independent inquiry whenever it sees fit. We are advised of the apparent benefits of putting such powers on a statutory basis. However, I remain worried that the Treasury has shot itself in the foot by limiting the basis on which it may call inquiries to circumstances that involve the combination of financial gravity and serious regulatory failure. The Treasury will retain the option under subsection (4) of holding an inquiry if it considers it to be in the public interest.

<P>
Nobody wants to waste money on unnecessary and expensive professional inquiries. However, given the changes that happen within the financial system, many of them inevitably unexpected
--Barings was not a serious regulatory failure but a serious management failure
--threats to the system will always justify an inquiry being held, to try to stop such things happening again. I am not sure whether a benefit can be gained from putting such things on a statutory basis, especially if it limits the Treasury's manoeuvrability to do what is sensible whenever a financial crisis or major problem arises.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) seemed to suggest that the Treasury could call an inquiry whenever it wanted to. That clearly is not the case. Indeed, it would turn on its head the argument that we had in our debate on the amendments to the clause. For the power to be exercisable, the Treasury must believe that something had happened to pose a risk or cause damage, and that a serious failure in the regulatory system or its operation had contributed to that risk or damage.

<P>
The hon. Member for Chichester questioned the Treasury's role. It is a serious power: during the previous debate, I said that the scale of inquiry that we envisaged would be on a par with the powers that can be exercised by a High Court judge. The decision to hold an inquiry is not to be taken lightly. It is therefore right that Treasury Ministers should have decide whether to exercise that power.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The Minister said that the decision on whether to call for an inquiry should not be taken lightly. Does she believe that the responsibility for taking such a decision would lie more lightly on the shoulders of the Treasury than of the Bank of England?

<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will give me a moment, I shall say why that is so.

<P>
Our aim is to provide a transparent mechanism for responding to such serious concerns. Ministers will have to weigh the public interest of having a full, independent inquiry against the public interest of not disrupting the normal regulatory process. That is a heavy responsibility, and Ministers will rightly be accountable to Parliament for their decisions. The power provides a transparent mechanism for when things seem to have gone seriously wrong. It is not meant to enable the Treasury to rerun every regulatory decision. I commend the clause to the Committee.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 12 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 13</center></H4>

<P>
Power to appoint person to hold an inquiry

<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 6, leave outline 30.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 26 and 57.

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Subsection (3)(e) gives the Treasury the power to direct the person holding an inquiry not to make a report. It is not our intention to set up an inquiry and then direct the person appointed to conduct it not to produce a report We would not wish an inquiry to be conducted on the basis that no report of its findings would be made. The whole point of an inquiry is to enable the Government, Parliament and the wider public to ascertain exactly what happened and why, and to learn lessons for the regulatory system. Amendment No. 25 makes our intention clear by removing the power to direct the inquiry not to report. Amendments Nos. 26 and 57 make consequential changes to clause 15(1).

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> We welcome the Government amendments. It would be foolish to go to expense, which may be considerable, as explained by the Financial Secretary, to find that there was not going to be a report. It would be helpful if the Minister could explain what will happen to reports. Will they simply go to the Treasury, or will they be published? We may cover the matter in clause 15, but the Minister might give us a little trailer of what will happen to reports in these circumstances.

<P>
It is not clear whether the object is always to publish a report so that everyone can see it. It may be that it will have to be published under clause 15(5) and laid before each House of Parliament. A little extra notion of the approach would be helpful. A little extra notion, although not a great deal, would also be helpful about how clause 13(3)(e) slipped into the Bill in the first place. Presumably, somebody of wisdom thought at some stage that there was merit in subsection (3)(e). An explanation of the background thought processes would be illuminating.

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am not sure that I can illuminate the background thought processes. [Interruption.] As I suspected, although I know better than to say what I suspect without having official confirmation, the provisions were modelled on an existing statute-one that we inherited from the previous Administration. We do not intend to set up inquiries that are then not allowed to report. We therefore decided
--a little late perhaps
--to remove that power from the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton (East Worthing and Shoreham):</B> The Minister has not addressed entirely the points raised by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell) about what will happen to reports.

<P>
The explanatory notes say that the Treasury may or may not publish all or part of a report, with the obvious proviso, unless it would play a part in any subsequent disciplinary proceedings. On what basis will the Government publish all or part of a report? Does the Minister anticipate that most of them will be kept under wraps in any case?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is asking the Minister to answer questions that properly lie in clause 15(2). I should be grateful if he will wait until we reach that point.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Clause 13, as amended. ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 14</center></H4>

<P>
Powers of appointed person and procedure

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 92  in page 7, line 3, at end insert--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4A) If a person (``A'') offers to produce a document for the purposes of an inquiry under section 13 which he could not be compelled to produce or disclose in civil proceedings before the court the person appointed to hold the inquiry may agree with A that such document and its contents shall not be disclosed by him to any person without A's consent; and, if so, the person appointed to hold the inquiry shall not produce or disclose, and shall not be compelled to produce or disclose, to any person such document or its contents.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 93, in page 7, line 6, at end add--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) No information provided, document produced or evidence given for the purposes of an inquiry under section 13 shall be used by the Authority in connection with, or in the exercise of, any disciplinary powers or measures or powers of enforcement conferred on the Authority by or under this Act.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We have already touched on this territory in relation to clause 11 and a similar amendment that we tabled to it. Amendment No. 92 would add to the protection of individuals, so that they are not compelled to give evidence or produce documentation that would not be required in civil proceedings. It would also provide that if individuals agreed to produce such documentation on the basis of it not being disclosed to anybody else, the person holding the inquiry would be bound by that. It seems to us, as to much of the law profession, that without that additional qualification, the holder of an inquiry could not give such an undertaking to someone who agreed to give information voluntarily.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment No. 93 covers new territory and is designed to assist the person holding an inquiry by ensuring that if someone gives evidence voluntarily, it cannot be used against him or her in the enforcement of subsequent disciplinary measures by the FSA. That potentially tricky territory could arise in the event of an inquiry; as we have heard, such inquiries would be held only where grave problems had arisen. People would doubtless look for individuals to blame, while the FSA would doubtless look to protect its position. If the holder of an inquiry is to get at the truth, he or she must be able to receive voluntarily given information
--information that people might withhold if they feared that it would subsequently be used against them. I hope that the Government will see fit to accept the amendments. The Minister said this morning that she might have more to say on the subject.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> We had a helpful debate on this broad topic under the previous clause and we were grateful for what the Minister said. However, the amendments go a bit wider and it is worth exploring them more deeply. Again, we are indebted to the Law Society for its suggestions on the amendments.

<P>
Amendment No. 92 is comparatively simple in that it protects documents that are the subject of legal professional privilege. People reading the Bill with such an amendment included
--the Minister has given us reason to hope that the Government will introduce a clause that embodies the substance of the amendment
--should not be lulled into a false sense of security. In civil proceedings, one can be compelled to produce documents that are adverse to one's case. It is part of the object of discovery in civil proceedings that parties should have to disclose documents relevant to the transactions under scrutiny by the court, so that the court can get at the true situation. The only kind of document that does not have to be disclosed is one that has the benefit of legal professional privilege
--in other words, a document that has come into being so that the citizen in question can obtain legal or specialist guidance or advice for the purposes of discovering, with the assistance of lawyers, his or her legal position.

<P>
I do not anticipate much difficulty over amendment No. 92, but amendment No. 93 goes further. It provides that a document produced under clause 13 cannot be used in regard to subsequent disciplinary proceedings or powers of enforcement conferred on the authority by or under the Act. It is a probing amendment. I do not want the authority to be unduly handicapped, but I want the citizen to be properly protected. At present, I am uncertain whether the balance is right.

<P>
Documentation relating to inquiries may be submitted under clause 13. Such documentation would have to be disclosed by an individual in civil proceedings and it could include information that might be contrary to that citizen's interests. The public policy reasons for disclosure are that it should enable the inquirer, as it would the court, to get to the bottom of the matter. If it leads to disciplinary proceedings, one wonders whether it should be prevented from doing so. In criminal proceedings, documentation would be available only if it could be obtained as a result of a proper search or a subpoena to a third party; but here we are considering the wider categories of documents that would normally be available in civil court proceedings.

<P>
Documents subject to legal professional privilege should not be used in disciplinary proceedings. That part of the amendment is forceful. As to whether its wider provisions are necessary and proper, I invite the Minister's views before taking it further. Tricky and important issues are raised and the probing amendment is concomitant to the other amendment, which has at least been accepted in principle for further study. Amendment No. 92 has obvious merit; we await the Minister's response to amendment No. 93 and whether she spots any difficulties with it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Let me deal first with amendment No. 92. As the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire and the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs both said, it raises the same issue as amendment No. 91
--legal professional privilege. As my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said about the earlier amendment, there is no disagreement in the Committee on policy terms. Clause 14(4) already provides that a person cannot be compelled to disclose privileged documents.

<P>
As with amendment No. 91, the need for explicit protection for privilege in the Bill needs to be considered in a wider context. As I did in respect of that amendment, I readily give Opposition Members the assurance that we will return to the matter on Report with our conclusions from discussions with the British Bankers Association. In the light of that assurance, I hope that they will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
I am puzzled by amendment No. 93, which would rule out any use by the FSA for enforcement purposes of information obtained in the course of an inquiry, regardless of the circumstances. Amendment No. 93 is not confined to the use of evidence given by an individual in proceedings against that same individual. In other words, we are faced with the bizarre proposition that the FSA could not use any information that was included in a published report. That is very odd. If the person conducting the inquiry were given evidence of serious wrong-doing
--insider-dealing, money laundering or any other offence for which the FSA was the prosecuting authority
--there would be no point in passing that information on to the FSAC. Indeed, it might damage the prospect of law enforcement by throwing doubt on the FSA's ability to act on the same information that it had gathered for itself. Knowing the ingenuity of lawyers, I suspect that the amendment would create a perverse incentive to give damaging information voluntarily to an inquiry in order to prevent its use in subsequent enforcement proceedings. That is not just odd; it is downright unacceptable.

<P>
The FSA should not have free or automatic access to any information obtained by an inquiry. The purpose of an inquiry is not to do the FSA's investigatory work for it, but to find out what happened and to identify the lessons for the regulatory regime. However, an inquiry must be free to pass on information to other bodies with important prosecuting and enforcement powers in exactly the same way that we would expect of any other public body or conscientious citizen. I am sure that Conservative Members, on reflection, would not want to see a constraint placed on an inquiry's ability to pursue its proper public duty.

<P>
As I have said, I am very willing to consider the purpose behind amendment No. 92 and to return to that issue.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I would be grateful if the Economic Secretary would clarify the protections that are probably subsumed in amendment No. 92 and in what she has agreed to consider. They relate to privileged documentation for which the privilege has been waived for the purposes of the inquiry, but might not be waived for the purposes of subsequent disciplinary proceedings. I hope that she will say that the limited waiver of privilege will not be overborne and that documentation will not be used in disciplinary proceedings unless a citizen says that he is content for that to happen.

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> That is precisely the issue that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary and I have undertaken to consider further. If necessary, we shall return to it on Report with amendments that deal with privileged documentation.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> That we understand, but there is a wrinkle in that it should not be possible to use privileged documents in disciplinary proceedings unless the waiver clearly covers that. That point may be subsumed in what the Economic Secretary agreed to, but I would like the matter clarified.

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> As I said, that forms part of the issue that we have undertaken to consider. Amendment No. 93 is quite different. It would prohibit the FSA from using against any person any information or evidence that is supplied to the court of any inquiry. That would clearly be unacceptable. In the light of my assurance on amendment No. 92, I hope that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs will not press amendment No. 93. If the amendment is put to a vote, I shall ask my hon. Friends to vote against it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As I hope was apparent from my brief words, the intent behind amendment No. 93 was to create a provision for privilege of information, but it did not come out right.

<P>
On the basis of the undertakings given that privileged information will not be used in disciplinary proceedings without proper consent and that the matter will be considered on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

The clause, like most of the Bill, contains a number of not exactly weasel words, but temporising words, which give the Treasury quite a lot of flexibility. Subsection (2) states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Treasury may publish the whole, or any part, of the report and may do so in such manner as they consider appropriate.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Subsection (3) gives the Treasury flexibility in relation to its consideration of such material.

<P>
None the less, it is worth reflecting on whether the Treasury must remove before publication material which relates to the affairs of a particular person whose interests would be seriously prejudiced. For example, there is little doubt that a report on an inquiry into the affairs of someone such as Robert Maxwell would contain substantial passages that would seriously prejudice that person.

<P>
Is bowdlerising the report to remove such material because of such a prejudice the clause's intention? It is hard to believe that that is the case. Indeed, I wonder whether I have misread the clause. Certainly, the matter warrants ministerial clarification, which will benefit those who are carefully following the Bill.

<P>
Stating that the Treasury ``shall be entitled'' to remove material instead of requiring that it ``must ensure'' that such material is removed would not necessarily damage citizens' interests. However, if, as I expect is the intention, the circumstances are of an innocent person whose interests could be seriously damaged by certain passages in the report, the Treasury should obviously reflect long and hard before causing that person to suffer such damage.

<P>
If the public are trying to find out about criminality and if the publication of the report is not likely to impede criminal proceedings, which would be another reason for not publishing the whole or part of a report pending those proceedings, I do not see why the Treasury should be obliged to ensure that the material is removed before publication. I may not have spotted something, but the amendment probes that question and we are looking forward to hearing what the probe reveals.

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> As the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs and the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire have said, this is a probing amendment and it enables me to explain the Government's intentions regarding the publication of inquiry reports. The amendment would give the Treasury discretion to publish material even where it believed it might be prejudicial to a person's interests or incompatible with our international obligations.

<P>
It is our wish to see as much as possible of any report published. That has clear benefits in terms of openness and transparency and, above all, in enhancing the accountability of the FSA to Parliament, to practitioners and to consumers. An inquiry might be set up in relation to a matter of serious public concern
--indeed, that will almost always be the case
--and clearly we would want the public to be aware of its findings. At the same time, as everyone would recognise, such a report might include sensitive material. The clause therefore gives the Treasury discretion to publish all or only part of a report. It requires the Treasury to exercise judgment on where the public interest lies in the light of particular circumstances. Treasury Ministers will, of course, be answerable to Parliament for those decisions.

<P>
Subsections (3) and (4) go further in restricting the discretion of the Treasury. They expressly prevent publication of material that would be prejudicial to a particular person or would be incompatible with an international obligation of the UK. The first restriction is important given our determination, which I believe is shared by Opposition Members, to provide for fairness throughout the legislation. For instance, we would not want to see material published which might prejudice a person's ability to defend himself against charges brought in connection with the events described in the report.

<P>
The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire indicated that he agreed with that judgment. When we talk about protecting the human rights of individuals
--the Opposition expressed great concern about that earlier in our proceedings
--we must recognise that some of the individuals whose human rights we are protecting will not be individuals of whose conduct we necessarily approve. The proper place for dealing with the evidence against them is through the appropriate proceedings, whether disciplinary or criminal, rather than through the publication of prejudicial material.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Of course there is force in what the Minister says. I presaged that in my remarks. However, sometimes the wrongdoer or the person criticised may have put himself in a position where criminal proceedings are virtually impossible to bring: the Cameron-Webb affair in relation to Lloyd's comes to mind. There may be other cases when something seriously damaging to the financial system has arisen but criminal proceedings would not be appropriate. Will the Minister please explain why the report and its publication should have to be
--not be able to be
--bowdlerised in those circumstances?

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> It goes back to the matter of establishing a regulatory system that is effective but not unnecessarily burdensome and fair to all those whom it affects. If one takes seriously the obligations of fairness and our obligations under the Human Rights Act 1998, it is unwise to say that the Treasury, even with its accountability through Ministers to Parliament, should have the power to pick and choose. Opposition Members will not be surprised that this provision, like the one that we discussed a moment ago, is inherited from some existing provisions on the publication of the inquiry report.

<P>
I shall come in a moment to our international obligation. Our main concern
--it was the purpose of the original provision
--is to deal with the circumstances in which material could be published that would prejudice the ability of an individual to defend himself in relation to criminal charges or to disciplinary procedures. I take the right hon. Gentleman's point that there may be circumstances in which there is no question of criminal proceedings arising and in such circumstances it might be appropriate for the Treasury to be given the discretion that the right hon. and learned Gentleman suggests; publication may be appropriate in some limited circumstances. I do not wish that discretion to be extended to circumstances in which the disclosure of material in the inquiry report would be incompatible with an international obligation. Under European Union law or because of our obligations under the European convention on human rights, there may be circumstances in which publication should properly be restricted and it would not be appropriate to give the Treasury discretion, but I am prepared further to consider narrower circumstances in relation to individuals--

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I refer particularly to what happens when criminal proceedings are pending; for example, a detailed Investment Management Regulatory Organisation report on the Maxwell affair was not published because criminal procedures were pending. Three secret copies of that report are still lurking somewhere, but it has never been published. It may not be suitable to publish prior to criminal proceedings in order to defend people's rights, but it may be extremely desirable to publish after the proceedings so that everyone knows the truth about what has gone on.

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am delighted to hear that the hon. Gentleman is a convert to freedom of information. This Government are doing rather more on the cause freedom of information than the previous Administration.

<P>
There is, however, a real tension between transparency and freedom of information and protecting the legitimate rights of an individual; clause 15 seeks to strike a balance in respect of inquiry reports. I shall consider whether clause 15(3)(a) coupled with subsection (4) is too narrowly drawn; we may wish to return to the matter on Report. I hope that in the light of my assurances the Opposition will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I had better speak before my hon. Friend finishes. I am grateful for the Minister's agreement further to consider the proposal. I am intrigued, and reflect upon the fact this seems to be another potential imperfection which may have been inherited. I do not feel so jealous of our record in government as to suggest that we got everything absolutely right. It would be interesting to look back at the Committee stage of the Financial Services Act 1986 to see how many potential imperfections were spotted by the then Opposition. We may be spotting things that the Opposition should spot, albeit we should have spotted them when in office.

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The key point, which I think that the Economic Secretary accepts, is that the public should be entitled to know what is going on unless there is some cogent reason for keeping it secret. The hon. Lady emphasised the cogent reason of potential criminal proceedings, but nothing in the amendment would damage that in the slightest. One does not need a prohibition on publication to enable the Treasury not to publish information that would be damaging to a prosecution and prejudicial to a fair trial.

<P>
The amendment would leave the Treasury plenty of discretion not to publish prior to criminal proceedings, and I think that it would do no damage in that respect. I am grateful for the Minister's agreement to look further at what I accept is a tricky balance which requires careful consideration and shall be content with that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> On the basis of the promise to consider this matter further, we shall be happy to withdraw the amendment. Although this may be out of order, I should like to ask the Minister whether, having considered further, she might arrange for publication of the Maxwell report in due course so that everyone can know what really happened. In any event, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 77, in page 8, line 4, leave out

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`a regulated activity in the United Kingdom'
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
and insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`one or more regulated activities in the United Kingdom as a business'.
<P>

<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 107, in clause 20, page 9, line 11, after `which' insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`is carried on as a business and'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We now move on to a new and important part of the Bill, of which clause 19 is particularly important. Amendments Nos. 77 and 107 relating to clauses 17 and 20 are what I would describe as common sense proposals. Amendment No. 77 makes the point that as drafted, the wording of subsection (1) could be read not to apply to a person who is carrying on more than one regulated business. The amendment would make it absolutely clear that the general prohibition applied no matter how many regulated businesses one was carrying on.

<P>
Amendment No. 107 to clause 20 in essence picks up the same point; it would make subsection (1) read:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``An activity is a regulated activity for the purposes of this Act if it is an activity of a specified kind which is carried on as a business''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That makes a related but separate point which I think we shall deal with at some length in clause 19. It is necessary for regulation to apply to business, but not personal, activities.

<P>
I am slightly embarrassed that the amendments have been grouped together because although they are related, they are different. Amendment No. 107 has more to do with the debate yet to come on clause 19. The issue here is, for instance, how I might discuss with my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) what securities we had been buying or selling. Such a conversation should not be regulated, because it would not constitute a business activity. That is crucial to both financial promotion and a clear understanding of what should or should not be regulated.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I apologise for my hesitation, Mr. Atkinson, but I hope that it will be justified because it will avoid deviation.

<P>
Amendment No.77 would leave out the words

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a regulated activity in the United Kingdom''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
and would insert the slightly wider expression

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``one or more regulated activities in the United Kingdom as a business.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We are here dealing with the general prohibition. We shall encounter similar problems when we reach clause 19. We have been encouraged to see from the Amendment Paper that the Government may have realised that the original provisions were far too wide. We consider that the general prohibition should apply only to business activities. I shall be able to expand more freely on that subject if we have a short clause stand part debate, but that is the purpose of the amendment, and of amendment No. 107, with which it has been grouped. I am waiting to hear the preliminary thoughts of the Economic Secretary; we may expand our discussion during the clause stand part debate.

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> As the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs said when moving the amendment, we have now moved to a fresh part of the Bill, and to a crucial clause. Clause 17 will create the general prohibition against carrying on, or purporting to carry on, regulated activity in the United Kingdom without authorisation or an appropriate exemption. It is perhaps the most vital clause in the Bill. Without it, there would be no basis for requiring persons to be authorised to carry on regulated activities, nor any mechanism to punish those who did so without authorisation or an appropriate exemption. Similarly, there would be no basis for making credential or conduct of business rules.

<P>
The concept of the general prohibition in clause 17 is not new; similar prohibitions in existing legislation cover insurance business, deposit taking and investment activity. However, clause 17 will simplify the existing structure, so that there will be a single perimeter around regulated activities, rather than the series of perimeters provided by existing legislation, which sometimes overlap or leave undesirable gaps. The clause is at the heart of our efforts to modernise the regulatory system so that it is in tune with modern financial services and markets. It is indeed wide-ranging, but, with the exception of occupational pension scheme trustees, it is limited by the draft order to catch only those who engage in regulated activity.

<P>
Amendment No. 77 recognises that, and would write the business test into the Bill.

<P>
Currently, that test is set out at article 37 of the draft regulated activities order under clause 20 and, as with the general prohibition under clause 17, the business test that is set out in the order broadly replicates the position under the existing Financial Services Act.

<P>
I hope that I have made it obvious why I am puzzled about the need for amendment No. 77 and why the Bill should make provision for the business test. We believe that the test sits naturally and logically in the regulated activities order, which is where we propose that a complete and up-to-date statement of which activities are, or are not, regulated under the Bill should appear.

<P>
Although I do not wish to anticipate our debates on clause 20 or schedule 2, it would be for the convenience of members of the Committee if I announced that the Government are today issuing a consultation document that will form the basis of our review to determine whether there is a case for statutory regulation of advice on, and the marketing of, mortgages
--a matter that we touched on earlier. We intend to conclude that review before the end of the year.

<P>
We fully appreciate the importance of the business test to the scope of regulation under the Bill. It is a vital feature of our current legislation and we are firmly committed to ensuring that it remains so under the Bill. We placed the business test in secondary, not primary, legislation for good reasons. As I said, the regulated activities order to be made under clause 20 is intended to form a complete a statement of what is, or is not, to be regulated under the Bill.

<P>
Given the business test's central role in delimiting the scope of regulated activities generally, the most logical place to find it is probably in the regulated activities order. There are other advantages in it being there. There is, of course, the benefit of flexibility if the business test ever needs to be refined or amended over time. That is not inconceivable because we are now applying the same business test
--as that under the Financial Services Act
--to the various different activities to be regulated under the Bill, including insurance and deposit taking. Under the present legislation, although the substance of the business test applies in some shape or form to most of the various regulated activities, it is currently expressed in different ways.

<P>
As for accountability, if we were ever to need to amend in some way the business test as set out in the regulated activities order or to apply it in different ways from those that are now anticipated, clause 363 and paragraph 26 in schedule 2 may apply. In other words, amendments could not be made that would extend the scope of the general prohibition without first having been laid in draft before Parliament and approved. For other amendments, the draft order would need to be laid after having been made, and it would continue in force unless it were annulled by a resolution of either House.

<P>
As Members of the Committee are only too well aware, the Bill now stands at 367 clauses and 17 schedules. We have tried very hard to keep its size down to the minimum and, where appropriate, to deal with certain matters under secondary legislation. I reassure the Committee that when we reach the clause that deals with repeals, we shall see that, as a result of our labours in Committee, we will have replaced even more legislation with the slimmed-down and modernised version created in the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I have a simple question. Can something be a regulated activity if it is not in the course of a business?

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The Bill deals with regulated activity that is carried out in the course of a business. There is no policy disagreement about the need for a business test. The issue is about whether that test appears in the Bill. By using secondary legislation when appropriate, and with the necessary safeguards to ensure that Parliament has its proper say, we are trying to ensure that primary legislation is kept to the necessary, albeit substantial, minimum, and that secondary legislation is used when appropriate in a way that will give us the flexibility to change the scope of the Bill, should that be felt necessary in the future.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I hope that that reassures Opposition Members. We are not at odds on the substance of the issues and on the key point of the principle of whether business tests should apply. I should qualify that statement in one respect. I referred to acting as a trustee of an occupational pension scheme, which would not necessarily be done as a business. That is a technical but important point.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 77 and 107 together would impose some kind of double business test. They propose that people will be caught by the general prohibition only if they are carrying out regulated activities as a business, and then state that regulated activities would be only those carried out as a business. That is otiose but, that aside, I do not believe that we are far apart on the subject. In the light of that, and in the spirit in which we have conducted, and will continue to conduct, the passage of the Bill, I am prepared to consider again whether the business test should fit into the Bill. I shall, therefore, return with a suitable amendment on Report.

<P>
Amendment No. 77 proposes to change the current wording from ``a regulated activity'' to the alternative wording of ``one or more''. That is unnecessary. The general prohibition on carrying out a regulated activity clearly prohibits carrying out one or more. Section 6(c) of the Interpretation Act 1978 has the effect that the singular includes the plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires, and I do not think that it does in this case. No amendment is needed on that technical point.

<P>
Given my assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman feels able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary for her comments. On the basis that the Government will consider further whether the business test should be in the Bill or a schedule to it, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful for a short stand part debate in which I can ask an important question that we have given some notice of in the starred, but properly uncalled, amendment No. 128. I refer to the amendment because it is sometimes helpful to have something in writing when answering such questions.

<P>
Those who understand the subject better than I do sometimes call it the ``foreign business carve-out''. I want to try to capture the Economic Secretary's close attention as I seek to explain it.

<P>
We think that it would be wise to add to the clause the words,

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Authority shall not regulate the conduct of business of authorised persons at or from a branch outside the United Kingdom except to the extent that it is carried on with or for a consumer in the United Kingdom.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That would restrict the general prohibition to some extent, but why is it necessary to do that? The reason that we have been given, which has some merit, is that a large number of businesses from overseas have set up branches in the United Kingdom and will be regulated in the UK. They may also have branches in other parts of the world
--in other European Union member states or further afield. It is not only acceptable but desirable that they should be regulated by our fairly sophisticated system in the United Kingdom or, indeed, for business that is carried on with UK consumers, albeit outside the UK.

<P>
It is not desirable, however, that businesses that set up one of their main branches outside the United States in the City of London should then have to carry the burden of regulations that are appropriate to the UK to all the business that they carry out for anybody else worldwide. That is what is meant by the foreign business carve-out. We want a first-class system of regulation in the UK, and we should be happy to see a first-class system of regulation overseas, so long as it is not unduly onerous. We do not want top-quality foreign businesses to be frightened off from bringing their business to the City of London and setting up major offices here because they find that, as a result of our regulatory system, they have to carry out much more extensive regulation than if they set up their main branch in Paris, Frankfurt or some other part of the world. We must ensure that we do not burden businesses from overseas unfairly and unnecessarily by such a wide prohibition and the system that we are setting up for ourselves.

<P>
I should like an answer from the Minister before we agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The right hon. and learned Gentleman has raised an extremely interesting issue. A detailed discussion on the issue of territoriality and inward and outward businesses will sit more properly in our discussion on part IX, but I am happy to say a few words now in response to amendment No. 128. The right hon. and learned Gentleman is concerned that the FSA should not be able to impose certain business rules on branches of overseas firms when the branch is dealing with UK customers.

<P>
The amendment proposes quite a shift away from the position under the Financial Services Act 1986 and the Bill. I stress that, because, in theory, the Bill allows the FSA to regulate the conduct of business of overseas branches, that is not to say that the FSA should or will do so in all cases
--far from it.

<P>
The effect of the investment services directive is broadly that if, for example, a branch of an English stockbroker is set up in France, the French authorities will be responsible for the conduct of business rules of that branch. The English regulator will be responsible for the branch's prudential supervision
--for example, the stockbrokers capital requirements
--but not, on the whole, for the conduct of its business. That is sensible.

<P>
The idea behind the European legislation is to have certain common minimum standards to which European regulators should adhere. Therefore, UK regulators can be satisfied that the branches of regulated firms set up in other states in the European Economic Area will be properly supervised in the conduct of business and that similar standards of conduct of business supervision will apply to the home-grown firms as well as to those that passport in.

<P>
The position is a little different in non-EEA countries. The FSA cannot necessarily rely on the host state applying the same standard of conduct of business rules that it considers appropriate for the United Kingdom. Internationally agreed minimum standards will not necessarily exist. In theory, the authority must be able to impose its own conduct of business rules on UK firms that have branches in overseas jurisdictions. Although the foreign branch of such a firm might do business solely with foreign customers, it is still important that it conducts its business appropriately to ensure that high standards of fair dealing are maintained. In other words, we do not want UK firms to tarnish their reputations, or those of the London markets, by acting inappropriately; nor should they be able to conduct their business in a way that might jeopardise the integrity or the solvency of the firms generally.

<P>
``Conduct of business'' is not always an exact term of art. No doubt, we shall return to that point later. Issues such as client money and asset rules can have a real impact on a firm's solvency and may occasionally need to be subject to UK regulation. At the same time, the conduct of business rules that might be appropriate to the UK offices of an investment firm will not always be appropriate to its overseas branches. In other words, what is required for the London headquarters of a British stockbroker is not necessarily right for its local branch office in, for example, Bogota, especially if that branch deals solely with Colombian investors, who are used to the different conduct of business rules and protections applied to local firms.

<P>
It is important to ensure that UK firms are not disadvantaged when competing abroad compared with local firms in their local markets. Therefore, to apply higher or overlapping conduct of business rules to branches of UK firms that do not deal with UK customers should generally be avoided, unless a very good reason exists for doing so. That essentially happens already.

<P>
In many cases, UK regulators have arrangements with overseas authorities. In general, overseas branches are subject to the overseas conduct of business rules, rather than to those that apply in the UK. The FSA rules allow a much tailored chapter 5 conduct of business regime to apply to certain overseas branches of UK investment firms, essentially to recognise the point about competitiveness. However, we cannot conclude that the FSA should never have such a locus
--whoops, we have been enjoined not to use latin, so I shall use another word. That is not to say that the FSA should never have standing over those firms in appropriate cases.

<P>
There are likely to be instances in which the UK regulator should have a legitimate say in how an overseas branch carries on its business in the circumstances that I have mentioned, and it would be wrong to stop it having that say when necessary. That is why I cannot accept the amendment. In the light of that explanation, both of our intention and of how essentially the same provision works now, I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I think that I have understood what the Economic Secretary has said. I do not want to misstate it, but I understand that she is reflecting further on this important issue, and is anxious to ensure that the anxieties that I described are satisfactorily dealt with. If she will assent to that understanding, I shall advise my right hon. and hon. Friends not to press the matter to a Division. However, the matter is central to the proper delimitation of regulation under the Bill.

<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I understand that the right hon. and learned Gentleman's anxieties in relation to amendment No. 128 relate to the overseas branch of a UK firm dealing only with overseas customers. I have tried to respond to that anxiety and to explain the current position.

<P>
A series of issues is involved. UK firms dealing in the UK with UK customers constitute the core case, which is relatively simple. UK firms with their headquarters in the UK, and with overseas branches dealing with overseas firms, constitute what might be described as the ``outward case''. The third example is a foreign-based firm selling to the UK. We shall return to those matters in relation to clause 353
--in a few weeks' time, probably
--and the regulated activities order that will be made under clause 20, which we shall reach rather sooner in our deliberations.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Is there not a fourth case of a foreign-based firm with an office in the UK, doing business not with UK customers but with foreign customers? That is what my right hon. and learned Friend meant in this context.

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I suspect that we shall return to the matter in much greater detail in relation to both clause 20, because of the regulated activities order, and clause 353, which deals specifically with territoriality. Those are complex issues, and I am not sure that they are best dealt with in relation to clause 17.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am anxious that the Economic Secretary undertakes to consider the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs is absolutely correct: I am worried that foreign firms with a London branch that have business outside Britain with people who are not consumers in Britain should not carry the burden of UK regulation in that foreign business. That is the foreign business carve-out. I am worried that, if we withdraw the amendment--

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are not discussing an amendment. We are discussing whether clause 17 should stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I apologise, Mr. Atkinson. If we allow the clause to stand part of the Bill at this stage, I am worried that we shall be inhibited from re-opening this important and central issue on Report. Provided that we shall not be, we are happy with the clause and the Economic Secretary's assurances.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not think that the right hon. and learned Gentleman was making a point of order, but what is selected on Report is for Madam Speaker to decide.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Exactly. We know that, and we know that how we behave now can affect that. I do not want to cause difficulty.

<P>
I think that the matter is so central and important that we shall not be inhibited.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Whether the issue is voted on will make no difference to whether Madam Speaker selects an issue. It relates to the debate and matters that were raised at the time.

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I should like to add a few words in response to the right hon. and learned Gentleman's anxieties. As I said, it will be appropriate to discuss those concerns under clauses 20 and 353, in the broader context of how we deal with the inward and outward cases that I have described.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I went outside the Room and need to ask my right hon. and learned Friend whether he has already raised a particular point.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> If it concerns the foreign business carve-out, then I probably have.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> It does concern that; if it has already been covered, I shall sit down.

<P>
As the Minister said, prohibitions similar to those already set out in the clause exist in other legislation. The clause codifies and modernises. The concern is that the clause implies that the FSA can henceforth regulate the conduct of business of a non-UK branch, even where the business is carried on with a consumer outside the UK and where the business has nothing to do with the UK. Have we covered that point and had an answer from the Minister on it? I would like an answer on one other point--

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are having a stand part debate on clause 17. I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman whether the Minister will have anything more to say on it, although I understood her to say that she had finished.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I add for the record that the London Investment Bankers Association is concerned that what is known as the ``foreign business carve-out'' will effectively be destroyed by the clause and that that will be of great concern to large sections of the City. It could cost the City a great deal of money.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 78, in page 8, line 17, after `But', insert

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 79, in page 8, line 19, after `of', insert `or results from,'.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendments relate specifically to subsection (2) and deal with the extent to which commercial transactions could be struck down or interfered with as a result of the clause, when one party is not conducting properly regulated activities or is not a regulated person. The clause seems to state that that will have no effect on any such commercial transactions, and the amendment would give the regulator the flexibility to determine whether that should be the case. Situations could arise in which someone seeks to exploit the clause to his commercial benefit
--in other words, to do business on terms that are clearly not commercially correct and where one party has the suspicion or knowledge that the person with whom he is doing business is not properly regulated or where the situation is potentially a business sham on both sides. Although the clause is designed to protect, it could serve to support the bad and ill-intended. Logically, the regulator should have scope to determine that.

<P>
Amendment No. 79 seeks to make a drafting clarification. Adding the words ``or results from'' would qualify the rights and obligations of parties to such transactions. It is, in part, a probing amendment: we want to know what is intended. However, we believe that subsection (2) is too inflexible, given that there can be rights and wrongs on both sides when people do business with those who are not properly regulated.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I wish to reinforce the probing aspects of amendment No. 78. The Committee will know that I am doubtful about discipline by non-enforcement, which is why I lent my name to the amendment. However, I do so in a spirit of inquiry.

<P>
I can see some difficulties with the amendment's drafting. Obviously, the regulator cannot start interfering in specific business activities after the event. Whatever he were to do under the suggested provision,

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``unless the Authority directs otherwise in any particular case'',
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
he would have to refer to generic cases that arose before business transactions were carried out, rather than specific business transactions that had already been carried out. I can understand the puzzlement of those who advise the Minister about what the amendment might mean in practice. However, it is helpful to probe the width of subsection (2). It may be right that is so wide, but, in a probing spirit, I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Before I deal with the detail of the amendment, I shall say a little about the background to clause 18. In contrast to the general prohibition of clause 17 on the activities of unauthorised persons, it deals with the regulated activities carried out by authorised persons who do not have permission to carry out those activities.

<P>
A central feature of our reforms is that they bring financial regulation together under one regulator. More significant, the reforms bring it together under one body of legislation. One important consequence is that we can create a single authorisation regime. That will eliminate some of the existing artificial boundaries.

<P>
For instance, under the Banking Act 1987, it is a criminal offence for an authorised person to transact investment business covered by the Financial Services Act 1986 without having separate authorisation under that Act; yet it is not criminal for an investment adviser authorised under the Financial Services Act to branch out into broking and handling clients' money without the agreement of his regulator. That is treated as a disciplinary matter, and the regulator is regarded as having the necessary power without recourse to the criminal courts.

<P>
It is not really clear why a banker who offers unauthorised investment advice should be regarded as being more guilty than an investment adviser who takes clients' funds and invests them without the sanction of his regulator. It simply reflects the fact that former sectoral boundaries are enshrined in law. In the interests of modernisation, the Bill takes a fresh approach.

<P>
As we saw in the context of clause 17, an unauthorised person who carries on regulated activities commits an offence under clause 21. However, the position of an authorised person who breaches that permission is quite different. We start from the proposition that it is reasonable that regulated activities undertaken by an authorised person without the approval or knowledge of the regulator should be dealt with as a disciplinary rather than a criminal matter. The Bill gives the authority the power to take appropriate and proportionate action to safeguard consumers' interests. Changes can be made to the permission, or disciplinary action can be taken, depending on what the circumstances justify. The ESA will also have power to require redress to be made. Of course, such regulatory actions will be subject to rights enshrined elsewhere in the Bill to make representations and to refer the matter in question to the tribunal.

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
No value will be served in terms either of consumer protection or of the efficient dispatch of regulatory business by taking such cases through the criminal justice system. It is a deliberate feature of the single authorisation regime, which has been widely welcomed by the industry, that the limits on the regulated activity in which an authorised person may engage are enforced in a disciplinary rather than a criminal manner. That approach decriminalises some of the old boundaries between regulated activities, and it is the basis of the distinction drawn in the Bill between authorisation and permission.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I have tried to follow the Economic Secretary's remarks, and I have managed to get as far as reminding myself that clause 28(2) states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In this Act `authorised person' means a person who is authorised for the purposes of this Act.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That is the highly illuminating definition in the Bill, but how do I find out whether I am an authorised person?

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I was just coming to that. Authorisation is what people have once they have gained admission to the regulated fold and have been authorised by the authority. Such people are, therefore, no longer liable to breach the general prohibition and hence to commit a criminal offence under clause 21. Authorisation is an either/or concept: one is either authorised or one is not. No distinction is drawn between the various regulated activities, but a distinction is drawn for the purposes of permission, which defines the range of activities in which an authorised person is entitled to engage. By virtue of the clause, any breach of the limits on a person's permission, such as the taking of client money by an investment adviser, is a disciplinary matter.

<P>
I turn to the substance of the amendments. Another consequence of a breach by an unauthorised person of the general prohibition is that any contracts that he enters into in such breach may be unenforceable against his customer, subject to some discretion for the courts to decide otherwise. That aspect of the Bill reproduces the regime that applies under the Financial Services Act 1986, and was commented on by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire on Second Reading. If I understood the right hon. and learned Gentleman correctly, he expressed the view that the courts should have greater discretion than that which they possess under existing legislation. I look forward to hearing his views in more detail when the Committee debates clauses 24 to 27.

<P>
Clause 18, however, deals with authorised persons who breach their permission. By contrast to the position that I have just described in respect of unauthorised persons, clause 18 ensures that an authorised person who carries on regulated activities for which he has not been granted permission will not commit an offence. Although such a person would be more than likely to run the risk of the FSA taking disciplinary action against him, he would not run the risk of making any contracts entered into in breach of his permission becoming unenforceable or void.

<P>
The amendment would change that point, as it would give the FSA discretion to provide, in any particular case, that it could alter the rights of the parties to a transaction that is entered into by an authorised person but is outside the scope of his permission. For example, it would give the FSA discretion to decide that a contract is unenforceable. It would allow the FSA to direct an authorised person to hand back any money that he had received for a transaction that was entered into in breach of the scope of his basic permission.

<P>
I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for raising this important question. Unenforceability is a powerful deterrent to wrongdoing, but it could also act as a disincentive to transacting legitimate business at the margin. Indeed, that was the thrust of the right hon. and learned Gentleman's remarks on Second Reading, when he said that there were sharks on both sides of the fence. That is true.

<P>
There is a balance to be drawn. The unenforceability provisions of the Bill and of existing legislation are aimed at deterring illegal behaviour by unauthorised persons. By definition, those are people who fall outside the regulators' disciplinary powers and whose customers have correspondingly less protection. The courts still have a role as regards enforcing the contract in cases where that is just and equitable, and where they are satisfied that the provider was acting reasonably.

<P>
The position of an authorised person is different. The fact that a person is authorised means that the authority already has the range of powers that is available to protect the consumer from harm, make good any harm that has been done and take action against the firm in question. The appropriate course of action will depend on the circumstances of the case. From the consumer's point of view, authorised persons will, by obtaining authorisation, have signed up to the ombudsman and compensation schemes in relation to any of their regulated activities, even if those are outside the scope of the FSA's permission.

<P>
It is also relevant that we intend private persons to have a right of action if they suffer loss as a result of regulated activity that was carried on in breach of an authorised person's permission. That is effectively the case under sections 62 and 62A of the 1986 Act, because the SROs apply the equivalent of permission through their rule books. It would assist members of the Committee if I made it clear that we will table an amendment at the appropriate point to make the provision explicit.

<P>
Together, the provisions provide adequate protection for consumers rights and entitlements. The factors that I have described tip the balance. It would be wrong to put firms at unnecessary risk of finding their contracts void in cases where they might inadvertently have strayed over a line and other suitable remedies are available. There is, therefore, no case for giving the FSA the additional power proposed in amendment No. 78.

<P>
I shall say a little about amendment No. 79. It is not clear to me whether it has been proposed to buttress amendment No. 78 or whether it is designed to be free standing. Either way, it is inappropriate, and I shall explain why.

<P>
As a supplement to amendment No. 78, amendment No. 79 proposes that contracts that are entered into as a result of a person breaching his permission can be unenforceable. That could be quite dangerous. For example, a bank might not have permission to give customers investment advice, but might do so none the less. As a result of such investment advice, a customer of the bank might enter into an investment management contract with a third party. The effect of amendment No. 79 would be that the third-party investment management agreement could be challenged. That is not in the interests of market certainty, given all the other protections in respect of authorised persons, such as banks, which I have just described.

<P>
If we consider amendment No. 79 on a solo basis, it is again unnecessary. If an authorised person breaches the terms of his permission, and that does not affect the enforceability of the contract or the transaction in question, I do not see how such action would affect any other contract or transaction that resulted from it. The clause provides that contracts that are entered into in the course of breaching a permission are not affected by the fact that that is a contravention under the Bill and could be a disciplinary matter.

<P>
I apologise for that somewhat lengthy response to two apparently innocent amendments, but the matter and the distinction between authorised and non-authorised persons are important. In the light of that explanation, I hope that the Opposition will not press the amendments; if they do, I will urge my hon. Friends to vote against them.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> No apology is needed from the Minister. Her comments were extremely helpful
--certainly to me
--in explaining the Government's whole approach. I was interested by her use of the expression ``within the fold''. That illuminated for me the structure of the Bill
--although other members of the Committee were probably already well aware of it. Once someone is in the fold as an authorised person, the authority knows who he is because he has explained the business that he seeks to carry out and asked for permission to do so. That person may be disciplined if he errs, but he will not incur the fairly dreadful effects of being wholly unauthorised. That has a great deal of good sense attached to it. I said that the amendment was of a probing nature, and should not wish to dismantle the degree of protection that is provided by clause 18(2)
--not, at least, on my present understanding of the Bill. I suspect that my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs may share my feelings in that respect.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I, too, thank the Minister for her full and learned coverage of the territory. The thought that has been in our minds is of the sharks on both sides of the fence. For example, I can envisage a situation in which a bank that was not permitted to carry out investment management as a regulated activity was doing so, making money by lending on margin and other slightly questionable activities, while the clients concerned were well aware of what was going on and the benefits that they were gaining. If the bank was faced with the threat that the whole basis of its contracts could at least be challenged, that would act as a disincentive. Having said that, I fully appreciate the Minister's point that overturning contracts should be approached with great caution.

<P>
I am satisfied that we are going to thrash out some of the issues in more detail later, and we shall therefore be happy to withdraw both amendments. However, I am not sure that I am happy with the bottom line principle of saying, in effect, ``As long as you are members of the masonic club, you will be all right''
--although I see that, to some extent, it would fall outside central regulation by one regulator. I am afraid that that approach may take us further towards saying that the regulation of banking and investment management activities will perforce remain two entirely separate functions with separate experts. It is unrealistic to think that a single regulator means single regulation, because there are bound to be different functions.

<P>
Suffice it to say that we have raised the issue and noted that the Government will return to it when we reach clause 353. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> As well as speaking to the Government amendments, I shall say a little about the clause. The regulation of financial promotion is an important part of the Bill. We shall no doubt return to the larger issue of the effect of clause 19, but the amendments, both Government and Opposition, deal with issues of territoriality, technology, the nature of the process of approval of communications by authorised persons and the restriction of the regime to clearly promotional communications made in the course of the business.

<P>
Together, amendments Nos. 80, 83, 84 and 85 would define the scope of the financial promotion prohibition and the interaction of new technologies such as the internet. As right hon. and hon. Members will be aware, earlier this year we published a consultation paper on financial promotion, which discussed the issue in considerable depth. In the light of responses to that paper, we intend to publish draft regulations for further consultation while the Bill is still passing through its parliamentary stages. The structure of clause 19 is to set out a broad prohibition in primary legislation and then to narrow the scope of that prohibition in secondary legislation.

<P>
The clause 19 prohibition starts by applying to all communications originating inside the United Kingdom, and also to communications originating outside the United Kingdom that are capable of having an effect in the United Kingdom, but the territorial scope will be cut back in the exemptions order. We proposed in consultation that the prohibition should apply only to promotions directed at the United Kingdom. Promotions that are merely available in the UK
--for example, over the internet
--but are not directed at UK consumers should not be caught by the UK's financial promotion regime. That approach has been widely welcomed in the consultation process.

<P>
The question might then be asked
--I am sure that it will be
--why we do not wish to put a scope test directed at UK consumers in the Bill. The answer, which is equivalent to the answer that I have given in previous debates on what should be included in the Bill and what should be introduced under secondary legislation, is that clause 19 must not provided for a rigid system of financial promotion that cannot keep up with a time of extraordinary change. Technological changes, in particular, might soon challenge the rationale of any scope that is set out in primary legislation.

<P>
Even beyond the issue of technological change, the Bill must be capable of implementing a wide range of possible international agreements on the treatment of financial services offered across borders. For instance, the draft e-commerce directive that is under negotiation in Brussels would provide a home state regulation of some financial services offered over the internet
--that is, UK regulation, and only UK regulation, of financial services offered over the internet from the UK into, let us say, France.

<P>
The financial promotion regime needs to be sufficiently flexible to allow us to adopt this home state approach if necessary, as well as providing for home state regulation. Currently, advertisements and other promotions into the UK are subject to UK regulation. All that could change over time and we do not wish to be constantly trying to make time to rewrite the primary legislation when the situation regarding technology and international agreements could change quite radically.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The Minister mentions the draft European Commission directive on e-commerce. Is she aware that the director of enforcement at the FSA has criticised the directive for threatening to tie our hands? How does the Minister envisage the FSA interacting with the e-commerce directive? Can she give us some practical examples of how on earth the FSA or regulatory authorities on the continent could possibly regulate the internet across national borders?

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely important point. Happily, we are not discussing the substance of the e-commerce directive here; I am merely observing that it is under negotiation. We will, as always, seek not only to defend the interests of United Kingdom citizens and consumers, but to ensure that there is a sensible solution to the regulatory problems undoubtedly posed by sales over the internet and by other possible forms of technological change.

<P>
The effect of the group amendments would be twofold. First, they would provide that all promotions into the United Kingdom would be regulated, whether or not they were directed at this country. Secondly, promotions on the internet would not be regulated unless they were directed at the United Kingdom, or access to the communication had been solicited by communications specifically addressed to a United Kingdom resident. It is important that, as far as is possible, we adopt a technologically neutral method of regulation. We would prefer to regulate only promotions directed at the United Kingdom, regardless of whether they have been promoted over the internet. Given the speed of technical change, it would be foolish to create artificial distinctions between media, as that would undoubtedly mean that regulation swiftly became out of date.

<P>
Amendment No. 81 relates to exemptions from the financial promotion regime and amendment No. 82 to approval of the content of the communication. I understand that the Opposition seek to ensure, through amendment No. 81, that solicited communications would generally be exempt from the financial prohibition unless the Treasury set out otherwise. Of course, we intend to provide exemptions permitting unsolicited calls where appropriate. Certain solicited calls are regulated under the 1986 Act
--they are considered to be advertisements and so fall within the current advertisement regulations.

<P>
It is true that unsolicited calls are more associated with regulatory concerns than solicited calls. It is important to remember that the adverse consequences of a solicited call can be just as serious as those of an unsolicited call. Amendment No. 82 would require the Treasury to set out in an order what constituted approval of the content of a communication in particular circumstances. I understand the importance of there being a clear basis for authorised persons to approve the content of financial promotions, just as investment advertisements are currently approved under the 1986 Act.

<P>
I doubt whether the Treasury, rather than the FSA, should become involved with such detail. The FSA will make rules for how authorised persons should approve the content of promotional communications. The overriding concern is for promotional material to be fair and not misleading. The expertise to deal with individual circumstances and products resides in the FSA, not in the Treasury.

<P>
Government amendment No. 94 will narrow the scope of the financial promotion regime in two ways. To be caught, a promotional communication will need, first, to be made in the course of business and, secondly, to amount to an invitation or an inducement. The material will have to be clearly promotional, rather than simply informative. I hope that members of the Committee agree that that will be a welcome and helpful improvement.

<P>
Government amendment No. 96 will give power to the Treasury to define circumstances in which a person is to be considered as acting in the course of business. That will permit, for example, the Treasury to specify that an individual marketing large quantities of shares that he owned was acting in the course of business. Government amendment No. 98 is consequential to Government amendment No. 94; Government amendments Nos. 95 and 97 are drafting changes.

<P>
It is to be welcomed that we finally reach amendments Nos. 100 to 102. They also seek to limit the scope of the financial promotion regime to clearly promotional material and to promotions made in the course of business or in a business context in the United Kingdom. The group of amendments reflects a wide consensus on the matter. Many respondents to our consultation paper noted that the scope of the financial promotion regime potentially went too wide in catching private communications and materials that were not really promotional. The right hon. Member for Wells rightly drew the Committee's attention to the issue on Thursday of last week in connection to the discussion on clause 5. I wish to make it clear that it was never our intention to catch private communication. Our consultation document included proposals for the exemption of certain personal communications and for other exemptions.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am looking at the time
--it is possible that we will still be debating the clause by 7 o'clock. Will the Minister consider producing and circulating, perhaps tomorrow, a copy of the clause as redrafted by those substantial amendments? That would assist our consideration and debate, if we are still debating the clause on Thursday.

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I should be delighted to do that. I am sure that it would, indeed, assist us in our deliberations.

<P>
The point at issue, on which we agree, is that it would be highly desirable to narrow the scope of the financial promotion prohibition so as to reduce the need for a long and detailed list of exemptions, but without jeopardising investor protection. That is what we are seeking to do. The restriction of the financial promotion regime to communications in the course of business and to clearly promotional material will deal with the concerns that were expressed in response to the consultation.

<P>
There is also the issue of entrepreneurs looking for funding for new or growing companies and the business angels
--investors
--who back them. In the past, that group has expressed concern about the difficulties that it felt the investment regime under the 1986 Act had placed in the way of raising such capital. In response to those views, we proposed an exemption from the regime for promotions made to a defined category of private investors.

<P>
Other jurisdictions such as the United States of America and Australia have, or are planning to introduce, regulations that recognise that for certain private investors, the degree of investor protection provided by the normal regime may be quite disproportionate. On the other hand, the cost of obtaining regulatory approval for fund-raising documents may well be prohibitive, especially for smaller companies seeking relatively modest sums. Such an exemption might help growing companies to raise the risk capital that they need to succeed. We are considering carefully the responses to consultation on that point. At this stage, we are reasonably confident of being able to devise an exemption that will have a beneficial impact in that sector.

<P>
Amendment No. 101 would restrict the financial promotion regime to promotions made

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in a business context in the United Kingdom''
<P>
</UL></FONT>.

<P>
It may be desirable in some circumstances to regulate promotional communications both into and out of the United Kingdom
--for example, when the promotion is made elsewhere in the world but directed at the UK over the internet
--but I see no advantage in restricting ``the business context'' to a business context in the United Kingdom.

<P>
Amendment No. 106 goes somewhat beyond regulating only financial promotions made in the course of business. In effect, it would require a double business test
--only promotions that were made in the course of business which related to controlled activities carried on in a business would be caught.

<P>
It is not clear that such a double test would be appropriate. It seems reasonable to regulate people promoting investments or investment services in the course of their business, whether or not such services are carried on as a business. A company might, for instance, promote its own shares in the course of business, but it would not necessarily be carrying on the business of selling those shares. If the double business test were introduced, companies promoting their own shares might not be regulated. That is perhaps a rather small, technical point. Leaving it aside, hon. Members on both sides of the Committee agree on the issue of the business test on promotional content. I hope that in the light of my comments and the Government amendments, Opposition Members will feel able to withdraw their amendments.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we continue the debate, the debate on clause 19 has, of necessity, already been quite wide because so many amendments are attached to it. It may be for the convenience of the Committee to have a wider-ranging debate now and a smaller and more focused debate on clause stand part.

<P>
If there is a Division in the House, I propose to adjourn the Committee until 8.30 pm.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> To quite some extent, the Government's amendments seem to mirror our own, so there is the practical issue of which are better.

<P>
We take the Economic Secretary's point that we shall have to live with the Bill in the future when markets change. However, the drafting of the clause is too wide and it will act as a catch-all provision, Our amendments would make the territory easier in the future. 

<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
We are in broad agreement on the main issues. It is essential that the clause does not catch private communication between individuals and that it should relate to promotional activities of UK citizens in a business context. Subsection (2) relates to communication on the internet, but we do not know what the phrase

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``capable of having an effect in the United Kingdom''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
means. Amendment No. 80 would substitute that phrase with one about United Kingdom persons. Amendment No. 85 would also make it clear that internet communications will be covered only if they are directed specifically at ``United Kingdom persons''. If the communications merely provide general information on financial products and are from Berlin or Baghdad, the United Kingdom authorities will not protect people who have surfed the net and, through their own lack of wisdom, have sought information on them.

<P>
Our amendments seek to make it clear that the clause relates to business promotion and not private communications. The Government amendments are similar, but we might debate a little further which are better.

<P>
I have a question about business angels. The Economic Secretary said that the Government would provide clarification in due course, but I received a letter this morning from a venture capitalist who simply asked why
--and to use admittedly old-fashioned language
--a legally correct prospectus could be offered only by authorised persons. If I have understood the matter correctly, the Government will look at authorised categories of people to whom venture capital prospectuses may be marketed rather than how such prospectuses may be circulated. However, I am not clear on the issue.

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The issue is solicitation for investment that is directed to a narrow class of private individuals, the so-called business angels. They will be investors and they probably will not be authorised persons. In the context of investing in film or theatrical productions, there is no reason why they should be. However, we recognise that they are fairly experienced in business and probably do not require the full panoply of protection that we would give to an ordinary saver or investor. We wish to ensure that for that narrow category of people
--private investors in a particular class
--there will be a lighter-touch regime.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary for her response. Will there be a requirement that such prospectuses can be circulated only through an authorised, duly licensed person in the financial regime, rather than being sent out by the company or its promoter? The perception in the marketplace is that a business sending out such prospectuses will be committing an illegal act, unless it does so through the offices of a duly authorised person.

<P>
The matter is difficult to the extent that the Government and the country favour growth in venture capital, by, for example, encouraging enterprise investment scheme companies, which prospect. Therefore, there is no way of defining to whom such prospectuses are to be sent, as demonstrated by the accredited-investor theory set as a precedent in the United States.

<P>
When sending out prospectuses, one cannot know whether the recipients are accredited investors. Prospectuses may have a health warning to the effect that only accredited investors should take note of them, but one cannot pre-select people who are suitable to consider such investments. That is a separate category in the territory of promotion, which is not entirely satisfactory under the present regime and which remains uncertain under the new regime.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> We are discussing business angels in the context of films and plays. However, business angels also work with small start-up companies advertising for venture capital, such as hi-tech businesses in the Cambridge business park.

<P>
We must also consider Freeserve. The Economic Secretary spoke about companies promoting, but not selling, their own shares. However, one could order Freeserve's prospectus through Freeserve's web, even though Freeserve is a company, not an authorised person. How does that gel under the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for extending the points that I sought to make. My smallest point relates to the most genuine entrepreneurial circumstances, in which individuals approach their friends with an EIS matter, endeavouring to collect, say, £l00,000 from 30 investors in order to start a small business. People engaged in such activity cannot afford the costs of being involved with an authorised person.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Taking a belt-and-braces approach, I should point out that I applied for a Freeserve application form through the internet and subsequently applied for Freeserve shares. However, I am an authorised person and therefore, presumably, do not come under caveat emptor. I say that for the record.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I did not apply, but another authorised person is here.

<P>
The Economic Secretary's helpful comments did not address all the matters relating to venture capital. There may need to be a special provision for venture capital as it is almost impossible to include it in the general framework of financial promotion.

<P>
Under past regulation, the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation could do nothing about the open promotion of fraudulent business expansion schemes. Therefore, if possible, a degree of protection must be built in somewhere.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I was anticipating rising when my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs sat down. You will recall, Mr. Atkinson, that I asked the Minister whether she would circulate the redrafted clause when the Committee sits on Thursday, and she kindly agreed. My point of order seeks to engage the attention of the usual channels regarding the Committee's sitting. I have attempted to re-read the selected amendments. They include the thoroughly sensible Government amendments which, it will be recognised, overlap considerably with our amendments.

<P>
We want to make progress on the Bill and we have done so in today's sittings. However, the Bill has been substantially recast
--largely sensibly
--by the Government and it is a daunting prospect to have to debate it from 8.30 to 10 pm without seeing the provisions in their recast form. I have not yet had the opportunity of getting into my brain
--I do not know about other members of the Committee
--the nuances and differences between the Government's and our proposals.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hear what the right hon. and learned Gentleman says in his ingenious point or order. However, what he asks has nothing to do with the Chair. Whether and when the Committee sits is not for me, but for the usual channels, which are always present. I hope that they heard what the right hon. and learned Gentleman had to say.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank my right hon. and learned Friend, who was probably referring to the redrafting of the clause rather than the entire Bill. He is right that the Government amendments shadow our amendments, but not with respect to definitions and marketing over the net. Amendment No. 85 is clear, but the Government's somewhat opaque changes to the clause still leave me unclear about the basic ground rule
--irrespective of the Brussels e-commerce directive
--which, as drafted, could be interpreted in more than one way.

<P>
Do the Government accept the principle that we do not regulate internet communication from outside the United Kingdom? We intend to establish at least the principle in law that it is illegal to direct products at the UK that are not regulated here. In so doing, we accept that the law on the statute book may not be enforceable until such time as there is a general international convention on the matter. What does

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is capable of having an effect in the United Kingdom''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
mean in present circumstances?

<P>
Another possible source of difference between the amendments is that we sought to be slightly tighter in making it clear that promotion is concerned with business activity and in drawing a division between personal and business communication. I end by echoing the comments of my right hon. and learned Friend it would greatly assist the Committee to arrive at the right decisions if we had a draft of clause 19.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Before my hon. Friend sits down, could he try to summarise in a sentence or two our worries about the internet?

<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My first concern about the internet is having law on the statute book that is a complete waste of time, unenforceable and brings the law into disrepute. That is what I feel we have at present. My second point is that we must face the commercial realities of what is going on already. Investments products in particular, but banking products too, will be on the net from every part of the world. More and more citizens will be looking up the net and it is completely unrealistic to bury one's head in the sand about that. There has to be a basic principle but above all we must accept that unless there is specific solicitation of UK investors, we should in no way seek to regulate that territory.

<P>
We have had some talks with the FSA on the subject and I was slightly concerned by comments along the lines that leverage could be put on a product because a Lord was on the board of the bank or that attempts would be made to put leverage on European Union products. That is simply unrealistic.

Sitting suspended.

<P>
On resuming

<P>
<B>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Alan Milburn):</B> On a point of order, Mrs, Dunwoody. Prior to our adjournment for a Division in the House, the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire made a good point to which my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury was able to respond. The right hon. and learned Gentleman said that given the complexity of clause 19 and the symmetry of Opposition and Government amendments, it might be useful and would acknowledge the work of the Committee if the clause were redrafted.

<P>
As my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary said, the Government are sympathetic to that suggestion, although we would not want to create an unfortunate precedent. No Government would want to have to produce a revised clause every time there were a number of amendments, however similar or dissimilar, and I am sure that the Opposition would agree with that point of view. However, given the complexity of these matters, the importance of the clause, and the close relationship between Opposition and Government amendments, it is a sensible suggestion. We are happy to redraft the clause as requested by the right hon. and learned Gentleman with a view to making progress at our next sitting on Thursday. In particular, given the excellent work that the Committee has done today and the real progress that has been made in getting through some difficult and complex matters, it seems sensible to ask the Committee to consider adjourning with a view to returning to clause 19 on Thursday.

<P>
Further consideration adjourned.
--[Mr. Robert Ainsworth.]
