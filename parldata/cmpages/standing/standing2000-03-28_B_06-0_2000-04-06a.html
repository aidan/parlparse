<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I understand that on Tuesday there was a small debate on whether the plural of forum was forums or fora. The ``Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' says that either is acceptable.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, which shall not include agricultural land by reason only that it affords rough grazing for livestock or the planting, growing or encouragement of the growth of heather.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I am most grateful to those who carried out that research and discovered that either word could be used. However, it is not clear which would be preferable, and I have my prejudices.
<P>
The amendments are important. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) set out why it is crucial that the definitions are right. I support the tenor of what he said, but I have reservations about whether it is possible to define farmed—cultivated or cultivable—land in primary legislation. It will be difficult to provide a comprehensive and acceptable list that includes all of what we understand to be farmed land. I say to the Minister—not as a proposal but to engender a response—that a separate schedule or clear notes of guidance will have to be provided to the agencies that are involved in the mapping process to ensure that the intention of the terms is clear.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire did a good job in covering many serious concerns. He mentioned improved grassland. Those areas will cause more trouble than any other. What the walker perceives to be an extension of natural growth, but which, as the farmer knows, is the product of hard labour, will cause disputes unless the definition is clarified. That is the most important aspect to get right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicholas Soames </B>(Mid-Sussex): Does the hon. Gentleman also accept that many enlightened landowners in the uplands who want to improve the quality of the heather—which is, after all, what gives the uplands their beauty and attracts people to them—are replanting and doing their best to regenerate some of the more badly eroded and overgrown areas? Those areas need to be burned, and there are many new and sophisticated schemes for replanting and reseeding heather. Does he agree that it is important that those areas are also respected, quite apart from the in-bye land?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. We must think about how we undertake replanting and regeneration schemes. I have no idea whether burning back is now considered good or bad practice. When I was involved with Exmoor national park, it was considered good practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> It is good practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who has more expertise in the area than I do. We have discussed the difficulties in defining the edge of mountain areas, particularly in Wales, and we have discussed the coed cae and ffrydd land, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey) drew attention on Second Reading. We need to have clarity if farmers are to be able to do their job properly and if walkers are to have the certainty that what they are doing is within the law and will not cause confrontation.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire was right to table these amendments, and it is important that the Minister accepts them in the spirit in which they were moved. They are a genuine attempt to improve the Bill's clarity. If the Minister will not accept them, and does not want a list of the type proposed by them, he must tell us how the mapping process will be effected so that we know what is agricultural land and what is not. At the moment, there is a marginal area which is in doubt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice </B>(Pendle): Amendment No. 146 is in my name. I agree with almost everything that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) has said. Cultivated land needs to be defined. The Countryside Agency's briefing notes state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The term ``cultivated land'' needs to be defined so as to exclude areas which have been or are subject only to minor, transient or very temporary surface disturbance.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is concerned about this point. As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said on Tuesday, the present wording of the Bill seems to encourage anyone who owns down or moor land to go and cultivate it because that is the way to get it excepted. That is the problem, If landowners want to keep people off their land, they will do anything and everything, according to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
I am not sure why the Government strayed from the definition in section 60(5) of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, which created a category of excepted land which it defined as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Agricultural land, other than such land which is agricultural land by reason only that it affords rough grazing for livestock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I used that definition in clause 7(2) of my Right to Roam Bill. The definition of cultivated land in this Bill is far too wide. With access to pots of money it is possible to cultivate almost any piece of land. An economist, whose name escapes me, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If the subsidy is big enough you can grow bananas on Ben Nevis.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is true. We need to be more precise.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lepper </B>(Brighton, Pavilion) rose—
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice:</B> I do not want to start a debate about bananas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> Nothing was further from my mind than bananas.
<P>
Further to what my hon. Friend has just said about almost any tract of land being cultivable given the resources, it would not take enormous resources to cultivate the Firle and Ditchling beacons on the south downs. Therefore, does my hon. Friend agree that the Opposition's proposal could remove rights of access from large areas of land around the beacons where such rights currently exist?
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> That is a powerful point well made. It underlines what I said about the necessity of increased precision regarding cultivation. If the schedule is not amended, there will be nothing to stop a landowner from following the advice of the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire and claiming that reseeding land by sprinkling a few grass seeds on it is cultivation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) spends much of his time shooting and is an acknowledged expert on heathers, which I understand are subject to a burning regime that is intended to allow regeneration. Is such regeneration cultivation? At the very least, a determined landowner could argue that it was and initiate a dispute that could drag on for ages. Unless the legislation is tightened up, it will allow landowners to exclude the public.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): I do not dissent from much of what the hon. Gentleman is saying. I agree that the provision should be defined more tightly, although we might disagree about how that should be done. However, the hon. Gentleman implied that I had advised farmers on activities that would enable them to prevent access. I was not seeking to provide advice; I was merely being frank about the temptation to people who want to get round the legislation. I accept that avoidance in relation to extreme mountains might be possible in theory, but I am not planning to engage in activities such as those in question any more than anybody else is.
<P>
The hon. Gentlemen quoted the words that I used on Tuesday afternoon. I do not dissent from the accuracy of his remarks; I am merely puzzled about how he could quote me, as the Hansard report of that afternoon's proceedings is not yet available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> I have an astonishingly good memory, and one of my many secrets is that editions of Hansard are posted on the internet before they appear in paper form. The hon. Gentleman will have to get up to speed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Malins. If the hon. Gentleman's remarks are correct—I accept that they probably are—it seems odd that the Committee is discussing the Bill without access to Tuesday's Hansard when it is available on the internet.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Hansard in question has gone to the publishers and will be available by lunchtime.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> I do not want to mislead the Committee, but I am sure that the Hansard record is available on the internet. I accept that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire was not giving advice to landowners, but I must say that he is closer to the true feelings of landowners than I shall ever be, and they will probably give weight to his remarks.
<P>
The analysis of responses to the access consultation paper, which was published in February 1999, contains a section on the best way of describing agricultural land for which exclusion is appropriate. It contains a whole list of items, many of which the Government could have used. They settled, however, on the single term ``cultivation'', which gives me cause for concern.

<P>

<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): On Tuesday afternoon, the Minister for the Environment helpfully explained the Government's attitude to the description of seeking exemption from the overall general rule. He gave a clear and concise explanation, for which I am grateful. It assisted me in my understanding of the Bill and of the way in which the Government will view its workings.
<P>
I accept what the Minister for the Environment said about safeguards, but there will be tens of thousands of applications for exemption and, probably, thousands of appeals. We need clarity, which is the purpose of the raft of amendments, but if the matter is to be dealt with by the Countryside Council for Wales, English Nature or the local fora, we need expert local knowledge as well. Again, a balance needs to be struck.
<P>
If the mapping authorities consider the situation reasonably, there will not be a problem. Land will be studied carefully and decisions will be reached after due consultation and discussion; all sides of the argument will be listened to. Contrary to what one or two hon. Members said during the previous sitting, I have misgivings about leaving so much for another day. We must clarify as much as we can during the weeks that we are in Committee. There was meticulous and somewhat painstaking discussion on Tuesday, and such discussions might be of assistance should there be, for example, a need for reference to litigation or further elucidation. As I said the Minister's exposition was extremely helpful.
<P>
As we all know, the Bill states that cultivated land should not be the subject of a new right of access. Unfortunately, schedule 1 provides no guidance on the interpretation of the word ``cultivated.'' In an age of integrated administration and control system forms, when farmers are expected to map even the rocky outcrops in their fields in their submissions, it is surely possible to do better than merely using the word ``cultivated.'' There are many forms of cultivated land. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) referred to hay, silage and so on, as I have done. They are important crops in terms of the overall picture of any farm. The Minister has said that land used for those purposes would be exempted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> So that Labour Members who might not appreciate the matter can understand, I should say that hay and silage might make all the difference between survival and disaster for a farmer. If he does not have enough, or if something goes wrong with the crop, he will lose his stock completely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. He makes a telling point. We all recall the droughts of the 1980s when hay became extremely expensive. Many farmers went to the wall and had to sell their stock, principally because they could not feed the animals. The cultivation of those crops is a core activity on any farm. If we are asking farmers to define or to map out their land and to exclude rocky outcrops, we should surely be looking at a better definition of cultivated land because of the obvious points that have been made.
<P>
There is a potential problem with grassland because there is a difficulty in distinguishing between grassland that has never been cultivated for hay or silage, slightly improved grassland and other grades. The question is not easy. Those involved in agriculture, notably the National Farmers Union, would definitely favour a clearer statutory elucidation of what, is meant by cultivated land. Hopefully, the risk of cultivated land being mapped will be minimised if the countryside bodies give back-up guidance to the surveyors. That echoes what the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said.
<P>
Amendment No. 91 refers to coed cae or ffridd land in Wales. That is roughly equivalent to in-bye land and it is very important because it typically borders land that will undoubtedly be designated as open countryside. It is often middle range in terms of height above sea level and often borders lowland or the farmstead itself. It is extremely important because, over the years, farmers have been encouraged to improve such land. Liming was favoured during the past 20 years or so and extensive drainage and improvements to the land have taken place, including ploughing and reseeding. It might be only grazing land, but it is very valuable in any agricultural set-up.
<P>
Government policy subsequently changed and farmers were discouraged from intensifying stock numbers. As a result, frridd land was not actively improved, but even in its unimproved state, such land is vital to any farm. It is the land on which spring lambs are released and it is a vital integral part of any upland or medium lowland farm. If the fridd land is not in a good state on Welsh lowland farms where land is fertile, those farms will be worth considerably less because the ffridd land is considered to be as important as the fertile lowland. I ask the Minister to say something about that.
<P>
We had a lengthy and somewhat esoteric debate on Tuesday about the inclusion of the words ``wholly or predominantly'', which refer to land that does not strictly fall within the categories of mountain, moor, heath or down, and which, by a process of elimination, must refer to bordering land. That would include in-bye land, ffridd and coed cae. That point is important to thousands of farmers, so I hope that the Minister will refer to it in his closing remarks. I do not raise it in am effort to prevent access because my approach to the Bill is not wholly negative, but we want to improve the Bill to ensure that it will work and stand the test of time.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 56 and 120 relate to the same general point. ``Cultivable'' is an important word, as the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said on Tuesday. In many areas, land has become set-aside, but is still available for cultivation. No doubt, it would be cultivated if it were not included in the EU set-aside regime, and it might be brought back into production before long as a result of the current problems being experienced in agriculture because there is talk of reforming the common agriculture policy. To prevent that possibility would be a grave and foolish step. I ask the Minister to give the Committee an assurance that land included in set-aside schemes will be regarded as cultivated land, not open country. That land should be included in the definition.
<P>
Finally, I want to refer to amendment No. 32, which is of crucial importance. The amendment relates to animal pens or enclosures, which, on access land, are typically dry stone walls. If people climb over such walls, they can cause considerable damage, albeit unwittingly. I ask the Minister to respond on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Malins. I alluded on Tuesday afternoon to a letter from the Ramblers Association. Two ramblers, who are constituents of mine, have sent me a copy of that letter, which is signed by a man—or, for all I know, a woman—called Nicky Warden, who is the association's freedom to roam campaign co-ordinator. The letter suggests that members of the association should write to their Members of Parliament, urging them to support the Bill. The letter repeats the canard in an article in The Guardian by Kate Ashbrook, the chairman of the association's access committee. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is clear they—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the Conservative party—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>want to put a spanner in the works. If the committee debated all the amendments they would be there to Christmas.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The two constituents who sent me the copy of that letter have also written to complain about it. This morning, I sent the letter to Madam Speaker, to ask her to address it from the point of view of privilege. May I ask you, Mr. Malins—
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): On a point of order, Mr. Malins.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> The hon. Gentleman is a recent addition to the House; I am sure that he means well.
<P>
I have written to Madam Speaker to ask her to consider that letter from the privilege point of view. May I ask you, Mr. Malins, to confirm that nothing in the conduct of Opposition members of the Committee that is considering this important Bill has led to delay or prevented the orderly, sensible, correct, decent parliamentary progress of the Bill through its Committee stage? May I ask you to rule that that has been the case thus far?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that, as far as I am concerned—I speak also for Mr. Stevenson, my co-Chairman—the Committee has proceeded so far in an entirely orderly manner. The amendments that have been selected for debate are entirely proper amendments, and the Committee has debated them thoroughly and properly. Of course, as the hon. Gentleman knows, if procedures were adopted by any member of the Committee that were improper or out of order, the Chairman would, so to speak, have stamped on them immediately. As I say, the Committee has proceeded entirely in an orderly and proper manner. Neither I nor my co-Chairman have any complaints.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kevin Hughes </B>(Doncaster, North): Further to that point of order, Mr. Malins. Could I say, as Government Whip, that I am entirely happy with the progress that the Committee is making?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his observation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Malins. Being a fresh-faced and new hon. Member—new Labour, of course—I have had reason to take advice from Officers of the House about matters of privilege that are addressed to Madam Speaker. I understand that hon. Members who make such complaints should keep them private until Madam Speaker has considered them, and not to go about the place publicising them. Is it in order for the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) to allude to that matter during his point of order?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is entirely a matter for the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex. So far this morning, nothing improper has been said—indeed, the Chair can make no criticism whatever. I hope that we can now proceed with the debate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas </B>(Clwyd, West): I, too, agree that there should be greater clarification of the term ``cultivated land'' than is given in schedule 1(1). I accept much of what was said by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), whose constituency borders mine. Ffridd land is more easily recognised than defined. It is an area of transitional land between the open hill and improved grassland, which in certain circumstances and to some extent—but one cannot generalise about it—is used more intensively than the hill land. It is important in husbandry terms as a gathering area for sorting, dipping and marking sheep. Will the Minister let me know whether my understanding of the Bill's structure is correct in this respect? As I understand it, excepted land that is situated within a larger unit that can properly be described as predominantly mountain, heath, moorland or down will be mapped as open country unless it is specifically excepted. Other hon. Members may not need clarification on that point, but I should be grateful for an explanation.
<P>
I am concerned about the practical implementation of the legislation. Does the Minister envisage that when Ordnance Survey maps are eventually produced, after the mapping exercise conducted by the countryside bodies, they will show not only open country access land, but enclaves of excepted land within that open country? It is important for ramblers to know where excepted land begins and ends. Exceptions to the general principle should not be too widely drawn and should not allow the fundamental principle of the Bill to be frustrated. Ffridd land is a term of art; Welsh countryside bodies and the Countryside Council for Wales will need to consider individual areas closely and should not necessarily accept the self definition of an area that is given by a farmer. Close consideration will be needed before such classifications can be accepted.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Huw Edwards </B>(Monmouth): In respect of my hon. Friend's expertise in Welsh and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, will he accept that the phrase ``coed cae'' is not commonly used in Monmouthshire? However, the land to which it refers is recognised, and on behalf of the farmers of Monmouthshire, I support the contributions of my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West and the hon. Member for Meiriommydd Nant Conwy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> My hon. Friend's constituency does not border mine, as it is situated in south Wales, but I am grateful to him for his remarks. I am sure that he will agree that such land is a live issue in Wales and may present the Countryside Council for Wales with some practical difficulties unless further elucidation is provided. One cannot generalise in such matters.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> Let me start by confirming the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes). So far, our proceedings have gone rather slowly, but they have been thorough and there has been a proper and conscientious probing of the Government's intentions. I make no complaint about that. I thank my hon. Friend—I almost think that he is my hon. Friend, because I agreed with so much of what he said—the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy for his generous comments about the clarity of my remarks on Tuesday. I hope to provide an equally clear explanation today. I entirely accept the spirit in which the amendments were tabled, and I agree on the need for the Government to clarify the meaning of cultivated land. That is exactly what I intend to do. The purpose of the cultivated land category is crucial to our response to the amendments.
<P>
When the countryside bodies assess whether land is mountain, moor, heath or down, we expect them to interpret the terms to ensure that where such areas include agricultural land, it is land that is used for rough grazing. I made that clear on Second Reading. The involvement of landowners and farmers in the mapping process is very important. There are two processes: first, the mapping has to occur and then decisions must be made about excepting the land. It is important to realise that there are two stages. The involvement of landowners in the mapping process is important, especially for the mapping of agricultural land. They will be able to take the opportunity to ensure that more intensively managed land, which could include hay and silage crops, is excluded from the draft and provisional maps at the initial stage.
<P>
When land is shown on conclusive access maps—the second stage—it will be excepted from the right of access if it is cultivated, as set out in schedule 1(1). But let me be absolutely clear: the cultivated land exception is not intended to be the mechanism for excluding improved or semi-improved pastures and fields from a right of access. Such land will not qualify as open country and should not appear on the statutory maps in the first place.
<P>
Research by the Countryside Agency shows that it would not be reasonable or practical to expect the public to identify whether land is semi-improved or improved pasture. The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex made that point, which is generally agreed. Anyone in the Committee, including people who have expertise in agricultural management and lawyers—one of my few virtues is that I am not a lawyer—would find it difficult reliably to identify pasture that has been improved or semi-improved. It would be unreasonable to expect walkers to make such judgments. That is why both sides of the Committee have called for greater clarity, and I agree with that aim. We intend that ``cultivated'' should be interpreted as meaning disturbance of the soil within the past 12 months by ploughing, harrowing, drilling or other such agricultural operations for the purpose of growing crops.
<P>
It is reasonable to expect the public to be able to tell whether land is cultivated in the way that I have described. That is how we meet the concerns about clarity. In practice, we expect that open country will seldom be turned under the plough, so the need to make such distinctions will rarely arise. I accept that there needs to be greater clarity, and I intend to table an amendment to that effect at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> The Minister is making a helpful contribution. His definition uses the word ``crops''. Does a legal definition of crops include pasture? Will he respond specifically to our concerns about set-aside land, which would not qualify under his terms?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am coming to that—I have a lot to say—but before I deal with specific amendments, I want to set out our approach. As for pasture, it is better to deal with improved or semi-improved land in the logical course of my speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. He is making a heroic fist of trying to produce a sensible definition, but will he consider another aspect, which can be tied in with in-bye land? Will heather count as a crop? There are new methods of heather seeding and there is work to regenerate heather in many places from white land. Will it be possible to include such land within the definition? The Minister might find it difficult to do so, but will he see what he can do to that end?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am perfectly happy to ask my officials to study closely the full implications of what the hon. Gentleman said. My immediate reaction is that, as he noted, such an area is unlikely to fall within the interpretation of cultivated land. However, as I said on Tuesday, the owner or the sporting tenant may apply for exclusions or restrictions to facilitate planting and replanting if necessary. That point applies across the board to all such cases. I hope that that has fully and adequately covered the matter.
<P>
If cultivated land were given a broader definition, to include any improved grassland, for instance, that would result in considerable uncertainty and confusion as to whether such an area was excepted land or open country. That is why I distinguish between land excluded by the mapping process initially—I would expect owners and farmers to be aware of that and to act accordingly and as they saw fit—and land on approved maps. It would be extremely difficult to expect walkers to be able to make that distinction and so a broader definition could not be accepted.
<P>
It would be possible for any owner of land to challenge access to such broadly defined land on the grounds that the land was allegedly improved. Such improvements might mean no more than the application or sprinkling of a little fertiliser. As has been observed, there is no mechanism to challenge an assertion that land is excepted land, other than in the courts. We are right to restrict the definition of cultivated land in that way. That would certainly help to ensure a reasonable degree of certainty about the definition and identification of excepted land in general and of cultivated land in particular.
<P>
I am extremely well aware of the point about clarity. I hope that clarity can be achieved primarily through the mapping process. Once land has been included for access on approved maps, we must exercise definitions that will enable a reasonably thoughtful and intelligent walker to be clear about where he may and may not walk.
<P>
<B>Miss Anne McIntosh </B>(Vale of York): Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that one problem is that the Bill is being introduced before the mapping process is complete? That is why there is much unhappiness among farmers and landowners.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am not sure that the matter can be done in any other way because the mapping process will not take place unless there is a statutory requirement that it should. Even if I had the time, I could not instruct the Countryside Agency to carry out mapping across the country simply to prepare for legislation that had not been enacted. I am trying to make it clear that we must have a Bill first and that the mapping process is an important point at which not only landowners and farmers but all parties with an interest will be able to give their views about whether the right decisions have been taken by the statutory authorities undertaking the mapping.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Many people will study what the Minister has said and the definitions of cultivated land. I understood him to say that three criteria had to apply. There had to be disturbance of soil, harrowing operations—I am unsure whether they were inclusive or exclusive—and drilling operations. If my interpretation of what the Minister said is correct, will he comment on the way in which rotational leys, which can be farmed intensively, will be included in the definitions? In some years, none of those operations would be carried out in some of those leys.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman displays his expertise in those matters. Rather than giving an off-the-cuff reply, it would be better for me to receive advice on that point. As I have said, I intend to bring forward an amendment on Report. By then, possibly before—perhaps even now, having thought about it very carefully—I shall be able to inform the hon. Gentleman that I would not expect rotational leys to be mapped as open country. The hon. Gentleman will undoubtedly have other questions, and I shall try to respond to them in Committee, but we shall have another opportunity at a later stage.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I shall comment on the Minister's remarks later, but on the specific point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), the right hon. Gentleman may need to seek wider advice on the subject. He probably received the same briefing as I did from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In many areas downland is under arable cultivation or grass in rotation and it may be difficult to distinguish these from uncultivated downland.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The key point is that farmers may grow cereals for a year or two, put the land down to grass for two or three years, which will fall outside the definition, and will then use it again for cereals or other crops. Serious confusion will reign under the Minister's present definition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I entirely accept that downland, and to some extent moorland, present a real difficulty. I repeat that, in the first instance, it will be for the mapping authorities to make those determinations. Downland does not mean only grassland; typically, it is semi-natural grassland on a calcareous soil—in other words, chalk or limestone—although it will be for the countryside agencies to interpret the expression. In the first instance, it must be for them to decide, but those decisions can be challenged and there will undoubtedly be a great deal of discussion, to which all parties will have an opportunity to contribute.
<P>
The cultivated land exception will simply act as a reasonable longstop. Mountain, moor, heath, down or registered common land would become excepted from the right of access if it were cultivated after conclusive maps of access land had been issued, although I would not expect that to happen often. A small proportion of registered common land is already cultivated and will therefore fall immediately within the scope of the exception. If the land is not cultivated but it becomes used for more intensive forms of agriculture, the owner may apply to the relevant authorities for closures or restrictions in the interests of land management. Whatever the Committee may decide, and whatever form the Bill takes, owners will have the opportunity under clauses 22 to 24 to seek authority for restriction for stated reasons.
<P>
I repeat that we accept the need for greater clarity about the intentions behind paragraph 1 of schedule 1. I repeat that, having listened to all that has been said, we shall table an amendment on Report to clarify the meaning of cultivated land. I repeat also that we are minded to include a provision that refers specifically to disturbance of the soil within the past 12 months by ploughing, harrowing, drilling or other such agricultural operations for the purpose of growing crops.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I welcome the Minister's attitude, and the genuine way in which he is trying to address our concerns. However, will he please say something about set-aside land?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am about to come to that. The hon. Gentleman is not only insistent; he is also telepathic
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Minister give way on that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> On telepathy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> On the definition. May I suggest that, instead of 12 months, he makes it three years? The normal agricultural rotation lasts three years. It would avoid a lot of argument to make that change and, if the right hon. Gentleman were to consult on the matter, he would find that most farming experts would agree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am not prepared to give a commitment at this stage, but I am certainly willing to consider the point and to take advice on it. I would be surprised if that were generally agreed to be necessary, but, in good faith, I shall consult and find out what the relevant authorities believe is right in such a case.
<P>
The amendments would ensure that agricultural land that has been improved in some way, or which is used more intensively than rough grazing would allow, should be excepted from the right of access. I accept the spirit in which the amendments were moved, and the questions are perfectly proper, but I reiterate that it is important that such land should not be mapped as open country. If it were, we would look to landowners, farmers and the countryside bodies to review those maps and to consider whether the maps were drawn up correctly.
<P>
Amendment No. 30 seeks to except set-aside land. Set-aside takes arable land out of production. Clearly, set-aside land will not contain the features of semi-natural downland that the countryside bodies will be looking for, and I would not expect it to be mapped. Still less is it likely that it might be mistaken for heath, moor or mountain.
<P>
Amendment No. 31 would except land used for keeping horses. As a rule, land that it is intensively grazed by horses tends to deteriorate without careful management and such land is therefore unlikely to merit classification as open country. Of course, some traditional semi-natural downland may be grazed from time to time by horses, ponies or other livestock. Indeed, managed grazing can be essential to the maintenance of downland habitats. The failure to have managed grazing is often responsible for the deterioration of a number of SSSIs and other habitats. However, that in itself is no reason to exclude the land from public access.
<P>
If exclusions or restrictions are necessary to enable effective management of the land, owners and occupiers will be able to look to the relevant authorities for directions for that purpose. I hope that that will seldom be necessary. I am pleased to see that managed grazing regimes have lately returned to some of our most sensitive wildlife sites, including a number of fine downland reserves owned by the National Trust, where public access has been able to continue without interruption.
<P>
Amendment No. 31 would also exclude from public access vast areas of moor where the running of wild ponies is a traditional, if threatened, part of the local way of life. I hasten to add that it is threatened more by the low sale value of the ponies than by access. The public have had access to some such land for a very long time, whether by right or toleration, and generally without difficulty. Indeed, those problems that do arise are more likely to be caused by conflict with motor traffic or by the thoughtless feeding of the animals by visitors in the car parks than by walkers.
<P>
Amendment No. 32 would except land used for animal pens or enclosures. I assume that the amendment intends to exclude pens and other small or temporary enclosures, but it could also except all enclosed managed grazing. However, I want to deal with the amendment in the spirit in which it was moved. We believe that there may be some merit in specifically excepting the small pens used, for example, for the gathering of stock for the purposes of any temporary agricultural or veterinary operations on the stock.
<P>
I explained on Tuesday that our intention is that schedule 1 should not attempt to be all-inclusive. It lists only that land in open country on which activities occur that are incompatible with the right of access, such as golf courses, and land that is unlikely to be consistently excluded from maps of access land because of their relative size, such as some buildings. We accept the hon. Member's point that pens used for temporarily holding livestock may be situated in open country and that, theoretically, their use is inconsistent with a right of access. In practice, I do not feel that a sane walker would want to climb through a crush with a bull inside or a sheepfold at dipping time. However, we accept that the concern is real. In our view, amendment No. 32 is not in an acceptable form, but we are willing to take it away and consider it further with a view to responding on Report. I hope that that is satisfactory.
<P>
Amendment No. 52 excepts land covered by haystacks, silage or other stored agricultural products. We have to call for common sense to be exercised by those affected by the Bill. No doubt, when the Official Report is made available, it will record my speech as saying that this is a messy Bill. [Laughter.] What I mean is that the world, the countryside, the environment, is messy and it is difficult to establish a Bill that precisely fits an imprecise world. However, that is what we are trying to achieve. From time to time, access land will be used, legitimately, in such a way that the walker will find that there is some minor—and probably transient—interruption to the right of access. Perhaps, as the amendment envisages, hay or straw will be stored on the edge of the moor or equipment will be left in a field on the downs. No sensible person will see those objects as interfering with the public right, any more than any hon. Member will see a car parked at the side of the road as interfering with his or her right to use the highway in travelling from A to B. If farmers think that they must exclude the public for any reason, they will be able to exercise their discretion to close on up to 28 days a year or to apply for further closures and restrictions from the relevant authorities.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 56, 57 and 120 would give a broad effect to the exception of cultivated land in schedule 1. Amendment No. 56 would except land that is not just cultivated, but is in any way capable of being cultivated. Amendment No. 57 would except any grassland subject to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the normal processes of husband.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 120 would except any land that is used to produce hay or silage or is intensively grazed or has been cultivated at any time within the past 20 years.
<P>
I explained in the context of the first group of amendments that we see no need for the exception of such broad categories of land. We do not expect intensively or semi-intensively managed grassland to be identified as mountain, moor, heath or down at the mapping stage. I am not sure what the hon. Members seek to achieve in the reference to the ``normal processes of husbandry'', but I am afraid that I do find that an imprecise expression. It is also unlikely that land that has been recently cultivated would be mapped as open country. If it were, the owner might well have grounds for objection to its inclusion on the map. I would not go so far as to say that cultivable land could not also be open country. The second world war demonstrated that almost any land can be put under the plough if the need is great enough. Indeed, many traditional pastures and ancient common grazing lands were lost to arable use at that time. For the same reason, I hope that even the Opposition will concede that amendment No. 56 goes too far and may be interpreted as embracing even the most hopelessly unproductive ground.
<P>
I reiterate that our interpretation of cultivated land is as a long stop. Farmers will seldom seek radically to change the use of their land to prevent access, as the cost of cultivating poor-quality soils will be high and the owner will not be eligible for agricultural support payments under the arable area payments scheme. They will also need to continue to cultivate the soil each year to ensure that the status of cultivated land continues to apply. Such cultivation would be a costly exercise if its purpose were solely to evade the right of access.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am not sure whether the Minister's comments are correct. He said that, to be eligible for arable area payment schemes, farmers would have to cultivate the land each year. We have discussed set-aside land, which does not have to be cultivated in the years during which it is set aside and can be set aside for more than one year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I take the point, but that is not what I was saying. I pointed out that farmers would need to cultivate the soil each year to maintain the status of cultivated land as defined in the Bill, which is a different issue.
<P>
Farmers may make improvements to access land that stop short of cultivation. Such land will often remain compatible with the right of access, for the reasons that I have set out. If it does not—I have taken note of the points made by the hon. Members for Somerton and Frome and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy about grass grown for silage and hay—it will be open to farmers to apply for restrictions or closures necessary for the continued agricultural use of the land. As long as the land is not registered common land, they will be able to apply for its removal from access maps at the next review.
<P>
Amendment No. 91 would except land in Wales known as coed cae or ffridd. I hope that I have pronounced those words roughly correctly, bearing in mind that I am an Englishman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Yes, very well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Ffridd and coed cae land varies widely in character across Wales, as Welsh Members have made clear. We do not believe that it would be right to introduce a blanket exclusion for all such land. Instead, we intend that it should be considered on its merits. It will be for the Countryside Council for Wales to assess whether ffridd or coed cae land is mountain, moor, heath or down—I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Thomas) in that respect. Again, farmers and landowners will be able to object if they disagree with its classification as open country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas:</B> Does it not largely depend on how large the unit is for mapping purposes? If the countryside body determines that the unit under consideration is predominantly mountain, heath, downland or moorland, it will be access land unless specific exceptions are made. That is why exceptions are so important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I accept my hon. Friend's comments. The mapping authorities will consider the land in terms of that definition. I shall proceed in a moment, as it is difficult to respond when one is receiving such good advice at such short notice. When I have read it, I will be able to say whether it is helpful.
<P>
The mapping exercise will be focused, as has been clear in all my remarks. In some areas, it will take into account individual fields. It will be for the countryside bodies to make up their mind on the basis of a precise and careful examination.
<P>
I now turn to amendment No. 146, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) and also seeks to give greater clarity to the reference to cultivated land in the schedule. The amendment would define cultivated land as not including rough grazing or heather. I am slightly surprised by the amendment and I hope that this sitting will have convinced my hon. Friend that it does not go far enough. Surprisingly, for him, it is what his definition does not rule out that is important. For example, improved and semi-improved grassland is just as important to the effective delivery of the right of access as what it does rule out. If he considers the matter further, I hope that he will be satisfied with our commitment to table a Government amendment on Report, which I hope will provide the clarity that he seeks in a helpful manner.
<P>
The debate has been useful and the Government have been prompted to do what we should ideally have done at the outset. There is some confusion about our intentions, but I hope that my undertaking to table an amendment will assuage some of the concerns expressed. For the reasons that I have given, we do not think that amendments Nos. 30 to 32 and 52 would be helpful to the interpretation of the Bill.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 56, 57 and 120 would effectively allow landowners and farmers to revisit the criteria for mapping moor, heath and down. It would enable them to challenge the right of access even though they will have had ample opportunity to challenge classification at the mapping stage. In the last analysis, we all want clarity for walkers, but if the amendment were made, they would find it impossible to judge whether land was excepted or to challenge landowners' assertions about its status.
<P>
I regret to say that I cannot find any succour in amendment No. 146, although I appreciate its intended purpose and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle will be content with my remarks. I hope also that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire and other Opposition Members will be persuaded that they have achieved their purpose and that greater clarity will be secured on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I start by thanking the hon. Member for Doncaster, North for his point of order and the Minister for his remarks on the subject that it raised. I am not sure whether I entirely agree that we are proceeding slowly. Like the Minister, I have served on many Standing Committees and I have seen far slower progress in my time.
<P>
I appreciate the constructive way in which the Minister replied to concerns about the need for clarity, which, as he recognised, have been expressed by hon. Members from all parties. However, some of his remarks gave me cause for concern. I refer especially to his definition of cultivated land as land that has to be physically disturbed every 12 months. Although Labour Members gave a small murmur of dissent when my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold suggested a period of three years, the Minister will find that there are sensible reasons for proposing such an extension. It is important partly because of the set-„aside issue that has been mentioned, but also because of grass within a rotation, to which my hon. Friend and I referred. Land may be planted with grass for two or three years but remain within the cultivation rotation.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> The important thing about rotation is in the initial mapping process. If it recognises such land according to the hon. Gentleman's definition, there will be fewer problems with land that is cultivated subsequently and for which the one-year rule would be appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Of course, the hon. Gentleman is right about the role of the mapping process, as was the Minister. However, I was trying to make a point about clarity that was relevant to a number of the Minister's remarks. He commented on the need for the walker—the user of the rights—to know the situation. Although mapping may exclude land in the first place, we cannot assume that it will always do so. I do not want to repeat remarks that I have already read out, but I remind the Committee of the views of the RICS, to which I have already referred. It said that it can be difficult to distinguish these areas from uncultivated downland. That may cause problems.
<P>
On communicating to the walker, the Minister made a great deal about the right of the landowner or shooting tenant to seek closure of land for stated reasons. We debated how to transmit that information to the walker. The walker will—we hope—use the map as a basis, but, without revisiting the issue of access points, I remain concerned about how we will inform the walker of temporary closures if no clear mechanism is in place. Downland that is mapped as access land on the open country map could be partly cultivated—the hon. Member for Clwyd, West mentioned this principle in a different context—and grassland for some of the rotation. How would we inform the walker of that?
<P>
In response to the issue of cultivable land, the Minister suggested that amendments Nos. 56 and 120 would open up vast areas of land. What he said about land during the war was correct. I am not here to assert that our interpretations or definitions are necessarily right, but to create a debate and an opportunity for the Minister to clarify matters. He dismissed the provision for 20 years in amendment No. 120, but 12 months is inadequate. I was pleased to hear him say that hay and silage land would not be suitable for a right of access, but improved grassland and hay and silage land could be intensively farmed after years of not being disturbed, perhaps since it was reclaimed from the moor or hill. I hope that he reflects on that problem.
<P>
The Minister said that set-aside land would probably not be mapped because it would not look like semi-natural downland. As a general statement, that is right because it is usually part of arable land, which will not be classified as open land. But set aside does not have to be in place for one year only. The rules have changed. Farmers can leave a parcel of land in set aside for several years. Although it is true that in one year it will not look like semi-natural downland, it could if it was left for three or four years, when the flora and fauna of the area has re-established itself naturally.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): There is an example of what my hon. Friend describes. An extensive area of set aside on the Marlborough downs quickly becomes like the rest of the downs. It is difficult to tell the difference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for endorsing my comments.
<P>
Heather was mentioned, in particular by the hon. Member for Pendle. We do not intend to except all heather land from the right of access. It is usually rough grazing, and we will consider heather management in later debates. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex was right. The Minister might be correct in suggesting that a separate right of application to except could be invoked, but conservation bodies in some parts of the country are trying to re-establish heather moorland by reseeding areas that have been extinguished by over-grazing. There is a clear reason for keeping walkers off that land during that time. We are not suggesting that all heather should be excluded. That would clearly be absurd and would fly in the face of what the Government are trying to achieve.
<P>
<H5>11.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Finally, I want to refer to the storage of agricultural produce, hay and silage. The Minister said that no one with any sense would construe such items as a form of obstruction, and I am sure he is right, but I am more concerned about the risk of fire. As the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said, farmers' supply of hay or straw is essential to the viability of their business. It can be devastating if a stack of hay on the corner of a moor catches fire because it destroys all the forage for winter feed for livestock. It is necessary to exclude such land to minimise the risk of fire, which could be caused by someone dropping a cigarette end or leaving a piece of broken glass lying around, which can cause fire.
<P>
I am pleased that the Minister agreed that there is some substance in what we have said about the lack of clarity in the Bill, and I thank him for offering to return to the matter on Report. I hope that my remarks will be food for thought for the Minister and his officials because I have tried to be constructive. In the light of that, it would be churlish of me to pursue the amendments at this stage, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> First, I echo the thanks of my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire to the Minister, Under-Secretary and Government Whip for their confirmation that our deliberations may be thorough, but our attempts to improve the Bill are in no way unnecessary. However, I hope that those who have campaigned on these issues will reflect on the difficulties that they have caused by overstating their case. This group of amendments will not detain the Committee for as long as the previous group because they are largely practical and attempt to improve the safety of walkers by adding various categories of land to the list of exceptions. It is probably easiest if I mention each one individually. starting with amendment No. 47.
<P>
Amendment No. 47 raises a purely practical point. The amendment would afford greater safety to walkers by excluding land used for the deposit, storage, transfer or sorting of waste materials from the mapped access areas, which will attract groups of walkers. That would enable walkers to plan their routes more sensibly without the risk of encountering rubbish dumps, slurry pits and agro-chemical container storage areas, which are likely to be unsightly and may possibly offend other senses, and which might also be dangerous.
<P>
Amendment No. 48 is also on a point of public safety. Its purpose is to enable land managers legitimately to exclude access across areas that might be liable to land slip or unstable, or areas on which there might be heavy plant machinery operations. It concerns a practical safety point: Ministers would not wish to encourage anyone to walk across such land, so it would seem convenient to include such an exclusion. Amendment No. 60 would achieve the same end.
<P>
Amendments No. 203, tabled by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, and amendment No. 145, tabled by the hon. Member for Pendle, would achieve the same end. I suspect that the Minister might say that they will introduce more imprecision and thus go against the Government's intention, so I will leave them to him.
<P>
We have already had exchanges on the relative merits of the drafting of certain amendments. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, to whose drafting I have deferred previously in Committee, is attempting to refer to land that is currently used; the hon. Member for Pendle is trying to refer to land used currently.
<P>
The hon. Member for Pendle is grammatically right. I am shocked to find consensus between the hon. Gentleman and me. With his correct comments during our great debate on forums and fora, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome has already shown that it is not right to use referendum as an exemplar because of the difference between gerundives and nouns. He clearly has great command of grammar and syntax, but the hon. Member for Pendle has a more precise definition and has put the adverb after the verb that it seeks to qualify. Nevertheless, neither amendment is especially sensible or helpful, so, despite the hon. Gentleman's grammatical correctness, I would not urge the Government to accept his amendment.
<P>
The final cluster of amendments in the group—amendments Nos. 66 to 68—are consequential on earlier amendments and would apply the existing definition used in the Town and Country Planning Acts for mining operations and use. I hope that the amendments will be accepted; the Bill would then be consistent with existing Acts. The points are small and practical. The amendments would not affect large areas of land and do not seek to affect materially the amount of land to be excluded from access; rather, they deal with small but specific areas and problems that might arise, most of which would reduce or threaten the safety and comfort of walkers. I hope that the Minister will consider the amendments favourably.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I shall be extremely brief. The hon. Gentleman raises some interesting points, but I am not sure that there are instances of open land being used for the sort of waste disposal that has been discussed. I hope that there are not for planning reasons. We must wait for the Minister to respond. I prefer the positioning of the adverb by the hon. Member for Pendle to mine. I defend the right to put the adverb where I did—it is not wrong, just stylistically better.
<P>
I do not know why the hon. Gentleman proposed his amendment; I proposed mine because it worries me that the remains of mineral workings exist across much of the best land in the country. The lead workings across the Mendips go back to Roman times and beyond. I want to be absolutely sure that extinct mineral workings will not form exempt land and that we are considering land currently used for quarrying or mineral winning, rather than land that has been used for that purpose. Such land is frequently encountered in open areas around the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I will not take an intervention now, if the hon. Gentleman will forgive me; he might wish to enter the debate later.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There was a reference to Hansard on the internet. The matter has been troubling me slightly; I will have some inquiries made over the next few hours and hope to say something to the Committee later.
