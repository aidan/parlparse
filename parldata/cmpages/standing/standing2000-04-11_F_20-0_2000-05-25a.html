<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Michael Wills):</B> I shall be brief. We have carefully considered everything that was said before we adjourned. This is an importnt measure, but we recognise the importance of allowing all hon. Members more time than they have had so far to consider it. We therefore propose to resume discussion after the Whitsun recess.

<P>
I do not want hon. Members to be in any doubt about the importance that we attach to the measure and our determination to press ahead with it, because we believe that it is important to deal with the problems that I mentioned earlier. Equally, we recognise the importance of hon. Members to have that opportunity, so I do not propose to say any more this afternoon.

<P>
Debate adjourned.-[Mr. Betts.]
