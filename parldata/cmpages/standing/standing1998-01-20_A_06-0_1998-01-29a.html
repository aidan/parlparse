<P>
<B>Mrs. Angela Browning </B>(Tiverton and Honiton): I beg to move amendment No. 130, in page 8, line 12, after "form)", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"having due regard for the schools responsibilities under the provision of the Data Protection Act 1984 and subsequent Acts protecting both computerised and manual data.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I tabled the amendment because of our concern about the necessity for a member of the LEA or any other person directed by the Secretary of State to enter a school to access detailed records, either manual or computerised, and the way in which that information could be put into the public domain without the caveat of protection set out in the amendment. We know that when the Government take action, which may be appropriate, they do so with a flurry of publicity. The policy of naming, shaming and identifying schools and individuals should be protected under the Bill.
<P>
Under the current requirements, paragraph 7 of part II of schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act 1984 relates generally to each of the general principles that have the support of the European convention on human rights. It applies to personal data which
"are held for historical, statistical or research purposes and not used in such a way that damage or distress is, or is likely to be, caused to any data subject".<P>

<P>
I am glad that I was not a Member of Parliament when that provision was passed into law because it was so complicated.
<P>
The measure builds in protection for the individual. The Government may wish to make public the specific actions of the individual and the reasons why he or she had gone into a school and accessed information in line with the clause. Therefore, it is important that we receive reassurances from the Minister that the Data Protection Act and subsequent Acts would afford protection to the individual whose records may be accessed by another individual, who was authorised to do that by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> I can understand the worry expressed by the hon. Lady, but it is not the Government's intention to use and publicise personal data that might be disclosed under the clause. The measure is about allowing an officer who has been instructed to do so to find relevant information and to use it for the purposes that are outlined in the clause. It is not a question of publicly using any information that might be disclosed.
<P>
Section 34(5)(a) of the Data Protection Act 1984 allows someone to disclose information as part of another person's discharging of his statutory obligation. That power already exists and we think that it should be used in the circumstances outlined in the clause. It is not our intention to use information, which the person who has been identified will receive, to gain publicity.
<P>
We are prepared, as a separate measure, to have a broader organisational machine we do not refer to it as naming and shaming, but as public accountability. The public has a right to know what is going on in its schools and schools should be assertive and confident. I assure the hon. Lady that we do not intend to allow to be made public any personal information that may be disclosed as a result of the powers in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Under the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): I want to return to the theme that I spoke about on clause 7, just before we rose for lunch, namely, the effect of the Bill on the Secretary of State's powers. On several occasions I have made it clear to members of the Committee that the Bill over-centralises too much power too unconditionally in the hands of the Secretary of State. I hope that the Minister will specifically answer my questions which I ask in all seriousness about the clause. The powers accorded to the Secretary of State are extraordinarily sweeping and the circumstances in which he is empowered to use them are extraordinarily ill-defined.
<P>
I should like to take the Committee again through the powers that the clause gives the Secretary of State. New section 497A(1) states that
"This section applies to a local education authority's functions (of whatever nature) which relate to the provision of education."<P>

<P>
There is not much confining of discretion there the power relates to anything relevant to an LEA's discharge of its function for the provision of education. The teeth of the section is in subsection (2), which states:
"If the Secretary of State is satisfied ... that a local education authority are failing in any respect to perform any function to which this section applies" <P>

<P>
which, as we have seen, is every function for which it is responsible 
"he may exercise his powers under subsection (3) or (4)."<P>

<P>
The circumstance in which the powers can therefore be used, within the terms of the statute, is wherever the Secretary of State is satisfied that an LEA is failing,
"in any respect to perform any function to which this section applies".<P>

<P>
There are very few human institutions that perform perfectly all the functions for which they are responsible. It seems almost inconceivable that there would at any time be any LEA in the land that did not fall within the terms of the subsection. If one goes through every function for which an LEA, however well run, is responsible I am on record as not being a huge admirer of the LEA system and even assuming that it[Mr. Stephen Dorrell]
reached the highest ideal of perfection that the most starry-eyed enthusiast for the LEA on the Government Benches might hold, we will find somewhere in its function an element of it that falls short of perfection. That would be sufficient for the Secretary of State freely to use his powers under the subsection.
<P>
We have reached subsection (2) and there is so far no constraint whatever on the powers that the Secretary of State is given in the clause. What are those powers? They are set out in subsections (3) and (4). One of the questions that I hope the Minister will answer specifically is about the difference between the power accorded to the Secretary of State under subsection (3) and that accorded to him under subsection (4), because they are represented as being two separate powers. As I read them, they are both so sweeping that only one is necessary he can do anything under either of them.
<P>
Can the Minister explain the drafting? Subsection (3) states:
"The Secretary of State may under this subsection direct an officer to secure that that function" <P>

<P>
that is, the function that is failing 
"is performed in such a way as to achieve such objectives as are specified in the direction."<P>

<P>
The Secretary of State can give a direction over the head of the LEA to the LEA's staff, specifying what he wants to do. The Secretary of State has the right to require the officers of an elected LEA to do his bidding, rather than that of the LEA.
<P>
Subsection (4) goes even further. It states:
"The Secretary of State may under this subsection give an officer of the authority such directions as the Secretary of State thinks expedient for the purpose of securing that the function ... is performed" <P>

<P>
and 
"is so performed in such a way as to achieve objectives".<P>

<P>
The Secretary of State, in the defined circumstances that I have already described which seem to include almost all circumstances has under subsection (3) the power to give direct instructions to a member of staff of an LEA to do anything that the Secretary of State chooses, and under subsection (4) the power to direct an officer to do anything that the Secretary of State thinks expedient.
<P>
I want to know why the Secretary of State needs both those powers it is no obvious. I also want the Minister to tell us at what target this extraordinary scatter-gun power is aimed. Is the power like a cruise missile aimed at a specific target with radio guidance, or is it like the carpet bombing undertaken with the technology of the first world war?
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I share many of the right hon. Gentleman's concerns and we will listen with interest to the Minister's response. I am somewhat surprised that the right hon. Gentleman has stopped his analysis where he has. Only a few lines further on the Bill, an additional power is given to the Secretary of State to order the local education authority to vary the terms and conditions of employment of a specified officer. Does not the right hon. Gentleman agree that that goes far too far?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Indeed, I do. It would weary the Committee beyond endurance to read out every word in the clause, but the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) is absolutely right: that power is in the clause as well. I hope that the Minister will also explain to us why that power is needed.
<P>
Not only does the clause accord extraordinary powers to the Secretary of State, in its second half, which is a second new section written into the Education Act 1996, it states:
"Where the Secretary of State gives directions"<P>

<P>
the person who receives those directions has
"a right of entry to the premises of the authority"<P>

<P>
and
"a right to inspect, and take copies of, any records",<P>

<P>
and
"shall be entitled at any reasonable time to have access to .. any computer" <P>

<P>
and specifies a series of other powers and rights of access to buildings and information. Those are sweeping powers. I was once Financial Secretary of the Treasury. I can only imagine how Labour Members would have reacted if I had suggested that the Inland Revenue should have powers such as those in circumstances as badly defined as those in the clause.
<P>
I seek from the Minister an explanation of why the Secretary of State needs those sweeping powers; what is the purpose of the dual drafting that provides the Secretary of State with power to do almost anything, but without prejudice to his doing anything that he thinks of that is prevented by the previous clause; and in what circumstances the Secretary of State envisages using the powers. When he has answered those questions I am sure that he will seek to reassure us that the clause is nothing like as bad as I have painted it will he explain why the statute cannot be drafted so as to confine the powers to the limited circumstances that I hope will describe?

<P>

<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I am very much struck by the effective oratory of my right hon. Friend. I am reminded of what Queen Elizabeth I said that we should not make windows into men's souls. The clause is pernicious; it will give the Secretary of State a window into the soul of the education policy of every local authority with which he disagrees.
<P>
There is little that the Minister can do to comfort us. He told us the other day that not only did he admit the existence of the forces of darkness at Millbank tower, but he himself had inhabited the shadows before the election campaign. I fear that those shadows may descend on him again and, through his operatives, on local education authorities with which he disagrees.
<P>
I shall be specific. The law of contract applies in this land. I cannot see how it will be legal or viable for the Secretary of State to require two other parties an employee and an education authority to enter into a totally new form of contract. If they say, "We do not want your interference and we are not prepared to accept the contract that you are putting forward," how will the secretary of State cope? I can envisage a battle of minds, souls and principles, which will divert attention from children's needs.
<P>
We did not debate whether clause 6 should stand part of the Bill, so it would be helpful if the Minister explained how clause 8 interacts with the powers in clause 6. So that we understand where the powers are extended, will he confirm that clause 6(4)(a) refers only to the setting of targets and standards, as the Under-Secretary intimated? It says that the statement of proposals must
"deal with such matters, and relate to such period, as may be determined by or in accordance with regulations".<P>

<P>
In that context, does the Minister agree that it would be unreasonable to require EDPs to deal with anything other than targets and standards? So that we understand the limits of the powers in clause 8, will he confirm that those powers will be invoked only in cases where an education authority is manifestly failing to deliver agreed targets or the education service that we all want?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May </B>(Maidenhead): This clause, above all others, goes to the heart of our concerns about this part of the Bill indeed, about the Bill's overall tenor. It will dramatically change the balance of responsibility and power between LEAs, democratically elected local councillors and the Secretary of State.
<P>
The problem stems from the belief that the Labour party has always had that bureaucrats know best. This morning, when we were talking about earlier clauses, I asked a question that did not receive an answer. The assumption throughout has been that the Secretary of State will always be right about the education that should be provided.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): Will the hon. Lady tell the Committee who will take responsibility if the Government do not deliver on their pledge to improve standards, given that specific targets have been set? Is it not appropriate that, in dealing with councils Westminster, to name but one the Secretary of State should have proper authority and that there should be no argument about that authority?
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that extraordinary intervention. I ask him who will take responsibility when democratically elected local councillors have decided to put in place particular provisions and plans to deliver high-standard education in their area, only to be told that, by the Secretary of State's edict, they cannot do that. It is essential that we appreciate the fact that, although the Government say that the Bill is about raising standards and the need to intervene in failing schools, the clause as my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) said so eloquently is not only about the concept of failing schools as we understand it, but about giving the Secretary of State the power to intervene in an LEA and direct one of its officers to do what the Secretary of State decides should be done. It is not a matter of simply saying, "Oh dear, we have an LEA with a failing school."
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes </B>(Stretford and Urmston): What the hon. Lady says about giving the Secretary of State the power to change things by edict is not an accurate reflection of the wording of the clause, which states that the Secretary of State must be
"satisfied ... that a local education authority are failing ... to perform any function to which this section applies".<P>

<P>
The clause specifically deals with circumstances in which an LEA is failing to meet the targets specified in its education development plan. When such circumstances prevail and an LEA is failing, whom does the hon. Lady think parents will expect to intervene to ensure that their children receive the education to which they have a right? Does not she think that parents will welcome the Secretary of State's powers to intervene in such circumstances?
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> The hon. Lady's reading of the Bill is inaccurate, as was shown in the opening speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood. The clause does not state that the Secretary of State will intervene when a school is failing, but that he can do so when
"a local education authority are failing in any respect to perform any function"<P>

<P>
in education of whatever nature. The clause is not simply about whether LEAs are meeting their targets as defined in their education development plans.
<P>
I sincerely hope, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn), that the Minister will answer our questions. The definition of what EDPs will contain that the Under-Secretary gave during the previous sitting will be extremely important in the context of later clauses. Confirmation of that definition would be welcome.
<P>
The Bill does not state that if an authority fails to meet the targets in its EDP the Secretary of State can intervene, but that he can do so if an LEA is "failing in any respect". For example, he could intervene if he considered that a corridor had not been cleaned properly, or he could do so to implement any part of the curriculum with which local parents did not agree. He can intervene in anything to do with education that takes place within an LEA. That is why the clause is so important.
<P>
Together with clauses 6 and 7, the clause brings into question whether the Government believe that LEAs should have any role whatsoever. The Bill is, by a variety of back-door routes, paving the way for the Government to subvert the role of LEAs and, ultimately, to abolish them. It is important to bring that out into the open. Hon. Members might well have different opinions on the proper role of LEAs indeed, that has been shown in exchanges with the hon. Member for Bath. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) has raised this issue.
<P>
It would be entirely valid for us to have a proper debate about the role of LEAs. Sadly, that is not what the Committee is enabled to do under the Bill. The Bill brings into question the role of LEAs and gives the Government the power to abandon them by subverting their role using back-door routes. It is that change in the balance of power that leads to it being a pernicious clause the description used by my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford and one that should not be accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The clause is important and it is right that the Committee should spend time debating its principles. For the record, the Government believe that, when a local education authority works well, performs its functions to an adequate standard and supports and[Mr. Byers]
assists schools, it can add value to schools. However, when an LEA fails in its performance of those functions, the Government will not walk away and fail to discharge their responsibilities.
<P>
The previous Government did nothing about the chaos in the Hackney local education authority, for example. They did not raise a finger to try to remedy the chaotic situation that existed. We were prepared, through cajoling, publicity and naming, to put pressure on that LEA to ensure that its functions were performed adequately. I hope that Hackney will soon be able to do that. We believe that LEAs have a role, but if they begin to fail and not provide an adequate service, the Government have a responsibility to intervene and take steps to put the interests of children first.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will the Minister confirm that the Government's actions over Hackney in the middle to late part of last year were a continuation of a process that my right hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk (Mrs. Shephard), the previous Secretary of State, initiated? We have no problem with a future requirement to take action against a failing LEA, which has been defined as such following an Ofsted inspection. We support that. The problem is that the clause, as drafted, does not confine itself to those circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am someone who, in respect of one or two measures taken by the previous Government on education, is willing to continue such policies where they worked well although there were probably only two or three of them during those 18 years.
<P>
The previous Government did nothing about Hackney. No inspection was made. We had to ask the Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools to agree to carry out an inspection and then ask Hackney to volunteer to accept it. No legal powers were in place to require an inspection of a local education authority. A Government who had been in office for 18 years did not give themselves the power to intervene in the affairs of a local education authority such as Hackney, which was failing to discharge its legal duties. One of the main findings of Ofsted's inspection of Hackney was that it was not undertaking its statutory responsibilities.
<P>
The current powers were agreed on a cross-party basis, because people recognised that there had been a terrible omission by the previous Government and that there needed to be proper inspection of LEAs. It has been extremely difficult on occasions to get Hackney LEA to agree with some of the proposals of the improvement team that we have established.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Can the Minister remind the Committee which party was in control of Hackney during the 1970s and 1980s?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The party that has been in control for the past 18 months or two years is no party, which is part of the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Because the Labour party collapsed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The Labour party expelled some of its members because of their conduct. One reason they were expelled was because of the chaos in Hackney. That shows that we are a political party that takes action against its elected members when they fail to discharge their responsibilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The Minister has now explained that the clause is the result of the disastrous failure of the Labour party in Hackney over many years. Can he please explain why he has not clarified in clause 8 that such provisions will apply only when a local education authority has failed its Ofsted inspection under the new system?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> As I think I said on Tuesday, LEAs will be inspected by Ofsted every five years. I am not prepared, for any reason, to allow a local authority to begin failing in the discharge of its responsibilities three years after an Ofsted inspection. That is why, in clause 8(2), we talk about an interested person 
"a complaint by any person interested or otherwise".<P>

<P>
The "or otherwise" will probably cover an Ofsted inspection.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
However, if parents are concerned about the adequacy of the functions being performed by the LEA, they should be able to appeal and make representations to someone. They should not have to wait five years; that is the primary school life of a child, and we are not prepared to wait that long. We are prepared to intervene if interested parties have complained. We believe that most interested parties will be parents.
<P>
We have a combination of Ofsted inspections and complaints from individuals. In most cases, if we receive complaints from individuals about functions not being adequately performed, we will ask Ofsted to conduct an emergency inspection of the LEA. That is how I expect the system to operate. From that inspection, we can find out exactly what functions are being inadequately performed. That is wholly responsible, bearing in mind that if the Secretary of State were to exercise the powers contained in clause 8 unreasonably or prejudicially, his actions would be subject to judicial review, and the courts could hold them to be invalid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister has just offered a vital qualification of the circumstances in which he envisages the Secretary of State using those powers. He said that if representations were made by a parent, an emergency inspection would be made by Ofsted; and that if the Ofsted inspection was hostile, the Secretary of State could use the powers contained in clause 8. If those are the circumstances and the manner in which the Government are to use those powers, why not write that into the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It is not in the Bill for the simple reason that although it will apply in the majority of situations, sometimes more urgent action may be needed. If the LEA is failing in its duty, should we wait for an inspection to report it? Surely we should give a direction immediately.
<P>
One of the most worrying things about Ofsted's inspection at Hackney was that it found that some children were at risk because the LEA had failed to discharge its statutory duties. I am not prepared to wait one week for such matters to be discovered. If children are at risk, directions need to be given as soon as the Secretary of State is clear in his own mind that it is necessary. We cannot simply wait for an inspection to occur. That is why we need the flexibility provided in clause 8. We should not restrict ourselves to acting only in response to an adverse Ofsted inspection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister has illustrated our point. He is saying that if, in any school in the country, there was a failure of security something all hon. Members would deprecate it would be seen as a failure of the LEA. The Secretary of State could then immediately exercise the full panoply of powers given him under clause 8.
<P>
Is a local education authority a responsible body, or is it merely a cypher? If there is a failure of security, of course something must be done. However, I do not accept that it is right to solve the problem by making officials at the Department for Education and Employment responsible for identifying it and advising the Secretary of State to use his powers. [Interruption.] My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) said from a sedentary position that the power was sought by officials at the DFEE in order to establish a degree of centralised control over the education system and the Government fell for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Once the Bill has concluded its passage through the House, I may have a conversation with the right hon. Gentleman about the discussions held on clause 8 by the Department. His interpretation is totally inaccurate. It was not the civil servants who were asking for those powers; they were reluctant for us to have them. The Secretary of State and I wanted those powers because we were not prepared to stand to one side and see children's education put at risk. It is as simple as that.
<P>
<B>Ms Joan Ryan </B>(Enfield, North): I do not know whether my hon. Friend is as astonished as I am at Opposition Members' amazing U-turn. I was thinking about their party's 18 years in government it is very hard to call to mind a single measure that supported LEAs, gave them more power or was in any way beneficial to them and their role. Their present defence of LEAs therefore seems astonishing. I think that the measure will be particularly welcomed by schools, LEAs and parents. It is an honest measure that effectively says, "The buck stops here." There will be no need to intervene in an LEA where schools are performing and delivering to their children.
<P>
In Hammersmith and Fulham, where I used to teach, we had a failing school with grave problems. The LEA intervened 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must remind the hon. Lady that she is making an intervention, not a speech. If she wishes to make a speech, I am sure that she will be able to catch my eye.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> My hon. Friend has drawn attention to an important issue, which I was coming to the distinction between individual schools that may be failing, for which the Bill provides other means of intervention, and an LEA that may be failing. That is an important distinction and one that the previous Government finally recognised which is why they introduced, with our support, compulsory statutory inspection of LEAs. That measure was long awaited and there was cross-party agreement on it at the end of the last parliamentary session. It is important to differentiate between individual schools that are failing, where other measures relating to the security of individual children clearly need to be taken, and LEAs that are failing. However, there are wider issues that are rightly the responsibility of LEAs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I hope, Mr. Gale, that I may catch your eye in a few minutes to make a few brief points, but I should like now to ask the Minister a question. Following on from his argument, and given that he is saying that it is important that LEAs have responsibility for driving up standards in their schools, does he believe that it is appropriate for the LEA to be given similar powers in relation to individual schools? Should they have the same right of intervention into their schools? If not, why is the argument different?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The argument is different because the Government of the day, particularly the present Government, have an obligation to raise standards, and we believe that we will be able to do that through the powers of intervention. We will see later, when we discuss the relevant clauses, that the Bill gives powers in regard to intervention in schools. We believe that an LEA has a certain role to play, but not the role that the Liberal Democrats would like it to play, which we believe could be grossly intrusive. That is why we will have a code of practice to guide LEAs on how to discharge their responsibility. It will be in line with clause 5, which places a duty on LEAs to promote high standards, but do so in a way that works in partnership with the LEA and the individual school, rather than the LEA relying on the assertion of legal rights.
<P>
In terms of the relationship between the LEA and the individual school, I believe that it is far better to develop that in a way that is not based on statute or on legal duties, but on people working together. The relationship between the Government and the LEA is different because we hand down legal obligations and responsibilities to the LEAs, and by doing so we also say that we will monitor how they discharge those responsibilities. If they fail to do so adequately, we are prepared to intervene; the clause allows the Secretary of State to do precisely that. However, there are conditions on the way in which he can exercise those powers and if he is acting unreasonably, he will obviously be subject to judicial review in regard to his conduct.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> On that last point, can the Minister confirm unequivocally that he agrees that a Minister would be acting unreasonably if he or she tried to exercise the powers where the local authority could demonstrate that there was no reasonable cause to say that it might fail an Ofsted inspection? It should be a good defence against a Secretary of State who tried to exercise the powers against an LEA, for it to ask what evidence he had that it would currently fail an Ofsted[Mr. St. Aubyn]
inspection. If the Secretary of State could not provide such evidence, he would be acting unreasonably.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> There are so many possibilities. However, all Secretaries of State and Ministers, in exercising any powers, always have to show that they are acting in a proper and reasonable manner. If a Secretary of State cannot do that to the satisfaction of a court, a judicial review would be successful. The Secretary of State would need to prove that not to my satisfaction, or to that of the hon. Member for Guildford, but to the satisfaction of the judge who hears an application for judicial review.
<P>
Although the operation of education development plans may well be part of the powers of intervention, they go wider than that. They relate to any function that may be carried out by a local education authority not one that is just not perfect, but one that is failing and inadequate. The clause will give the Secretary of State powers.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood asked specific questions about the distinction between subsections (3) and (4). It may well be that in subsection (3) we have all the powers that the Secretary of State may need. However, that is open to debate, which is why subsection (4) goes into more detail. If it were just a question of requiring an officer of a local authority to ensure that a function was discharged, we could rely on subsection (3), and he or she could then ensure that the council workers or the schools performed adequately. However, subsection (4) gives greater flexibility to ensure that work could be carried out by an organisation other than the local authority concerned. A neighbouring local authority or a private sector organisation might carry out a function, hopefully to achieve an adequate standard.
<P>
It is debatable whether subsection (3) would provide that flexibility, so subsection (4) makes it clear. It is belt and braces, as it were. If it were felt necessary to give a direction that placed work with another local education authority or a private sector organisation, many local authorities would legally challenge that decision. We want the Bill's provision to be watertight to ensure that we would not face such legal difficulties.

<P>

<B>Mrs. May:</B> On a point of clarification, where a private sector organisation had been brought in to perform functions at the requirement of the Secretary of State, what powers would the Secretary of State have to intervene if that organisation failed to do the job that he had asked it to do? Would they be simply the powers of breach of contract?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The way it will operate is that the contract will remain with the council and whoever is the contractor, but the Secretary of State will give a direction. The contractual arrangements will remain with the local authority, which is wholly appropriate. Councillors should be responsible for public money and how the contract is discharged, but the Secretary of State will give the direction. The contract will be with the local authority and either a private sector organisation or another local authority, depending on who the direction names to carry out that function.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way again. I have a further point of clarification arising from his answer. Is he saying that where the Secretary of State finds it necessary to bring in an outside body be that a private sector organisation or another local education authority a contract will be drawn up between the local education authority in which the Secretary of State is intervening and that other body? There will be financial requirements relating to that contract, the Secretary of State will direct that local authority to spend a portion of its budget on that contract. In effect, he will hive off a portion of the budget from the local authority not simply the local education authority to employ that body. Is that provision mirrored elsewhere, in any of the powers that any Secretary of State has over a local authority's budget.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It is important to return to exactly what clause 8 deals with a function that a local education authority already has to discharge. There will be costs associated with discharging that function. If, for whatever reason, that function is not being discharged adequately and is failing, there will be a breach of contract, as the contract will place duties on the local authority and the other party to the contract.
<P>
In that situation, a new contract can be let. A direction will need to be given, and a private sector organisation or another local authority obviously, they cannot be compelled can move in and discharge the function within the cost originally budgeted for by the LEA. The function will then be discharged adequately, which would not have been the case otherwise. That is why the Secretary of State will need to use the powers of intervention in clause 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister's answers are raising in my mind a further question, which it is important he addresses. The question is, what happens next? The Secretary of State identifies a failing LEA and starts to give directions, but the LEA will remain the same body. It is likely that the problem has arisen because the LEA has one view of what should happen and the Secretary of State has another, but, under these powers, the Secretary of State will prevail. However, if there is no exit mechanism, the Secretary of State will have taken unto himself the responsibility, not merely the power, to continue to discharge that function indefinitely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We would hope that the local authority could learn from the experience of having a function adequately performed 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> It may disagree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The LEA may disagree, but what is important is that clause 8 gives the Secretary of State the power to ensure that the function is adequately discharged. The LEA may criticise and say, "We want to continue to have the power to provide failing services." If it does, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will join the Government in saying that that is unacceptable.
<P>
Clause 8 puts the Secretary of State in the front line for driving up standards. He will be held accountable for the directions that are issued under the power. We make no apology for that. We believe that the children's interests must be put first, and clause 8 will give the Secretary of State the power to ensure that that happens.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. His response was helpful, but it raises further questions. What if, before the Secretary of State intervenes, the LEA itself engages the services of a private sector organisation and enters into a contract to help it achieve the required objectives? What if the Secretary of State then takes the view that, unfortunately, the ends that everyone desired have not been achieved and he wants to intervene? How will he cope when there is a binding contract between the LEA and the private sector organisation, with penalties attached if he tries to dismiss the partnership and bring in his own troops?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to subsection (2), which deals with the function failing and not being of an adequate standard. That is the key test. It would be remarkable to enter into a contract whose terms allowed one of the parties to provide an inadequate standard of provision. Such circumstances would give us the opportunity to intervene and exercise the powers in clause 8.
<P>
I hope that I have addressed all the questions that have been raised 
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Obviously I have not. I give way first to my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard).
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Blizzard </B>(Waveney): Does my hon. Friend agree that Conservative members of the Committee are failing to see the point of the clause? Perhaps I can help. I wonder whether they have ever played cricket and, if so, whether they have ever played at long-stop. If the team is playing properly and the bowler and wicket keeper are doing their jobs, a player stands at long-stop all day and does absolutely nothing. If, however, the wicket keeper fails to stop the ball, the long-stop is alerted; if the wicket keeper starts to let every other delivery through, the long-stop will eventually get hold of the pads. I submit that the Government are the long-stop.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Clearly, my hon. Friend should have been speaking to the clause on behalf of the Government. The debate would have been much shorter. He has summed up the position extremely well. This is a the long-stop clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Where does the hon. Gentleman get his pads from?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Well, perhaps the hon. Gentleman may answer that question during his contribution to this exciting debate.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): I am not an admirer of cricket and I may fail the cricket test. Will my hon. Friend the Minister consider the clause in the context of raising standards for children rather than in a narrow context? Contracts could involve buying school rulers, which may not be the main objective of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. We are entering into nitpicking detail and are probably going round the circuit several times.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Perhaps we are about to go round the circuit again.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am a new Member of Parliament, but I thought that the point of a Committee stage was to nitpick and to understand the meaning of the clauses. Members of the Committee have acknowledged that the clause is wide ranging and the Minister has accepted that it relates to clause 6. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify what the Under-Secretary said before we broke for lunch when she said that EDPs will deal only with targets and standards. She also said that it would be unreasonable to require an LEA to come up with an EDP that went into the detail of how it would achieve the targets and standards and the type of education and procedures that it would undertake.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It is worth repeating that clause 8 refers to all local education authority functions. It is not limited to the provisions under clause 6 that relate specifically to education development plans. It ranges far wider than that.
<P>
EDPs will contain targets and will probably contain the school improvement plan for each local education authority and it will be that which will be approved by the Secretary of State. However, for the Secretary of State to be able to approve the plan, there will need to be supporting evidence to demonstrate how the local education authority will achieve those targets. Some of the issues that we discussed this morning, such as under-achieving boys and children with special educational needs, will be taken into account. They will not be part of the EDP that is to be approved by the Secretary of State, but part of the supporting evidence that will need to be disclosed and around which thought and debate will take place. After that, the Secretary of State can make a reasoned judgment on whether the targets contained within the EDP can be achieved in the light of those various proposals on special needs and underachievement.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I had hoped for some clarification from the Minister, but I am now more confused. I understood from the Under-Secretary that the EDP would be about targets and standards and that that was what the Secretary of State would be approving. Surely, therefore, it would be unreasonable for the Secretary of State to refuse to approve targets and standards that both he and the LEA agreed were the right ones on the grounds that the method by which they were to be achieved was not possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It is obviously the hon. Gentleman's view that I am failing in my instruction. I know a few people in my constituency who would be all too glad to do the job 
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Those at Millbank tower.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Not the forces of darkness on this occasion.
<P>
I have tried to help the Committee by explaining how the provisions of the clause will operate. I have clearly not explained it to the satisfaction of some members of the Committee. However, it contains a power that the Secretary of State needs and it is important that it is adopted. I commend it to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I shall be brief. I know the Minister to be a reasonable man who makes reasonable arguments about what is in the way that he puts it a reasonable case. He says that, at the end of the day, if a local education authority is failing the children in its area, it is perfectly right and proper for someone to act to ensure that those problems are overcome. In that broad approach, he has our full support, and probably that of the right hon. Member for Charnwood. There is no disagreement about the broad thrust of what the Minister is saying our concerns are about the vehicle that he is using to achieve his purpose. Sweeping powers will being given to the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Hope </B>(Corby) rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I want to make a little progress, then I will give way.
<P>
The Minister fails to accept that local education authorities are part of the democratically accountable structures of local government. The members of local education authorities have been elected by the people in their area no doubt on the basis of how they intend to develop education provision in the area. It is right that they have a degree of protection against unwarranted intrusion by the Secretary of State into their affairs. The powers place no effective limit on the opportunity for the Secretary of State to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hope:</B> Is it not the case that local education authorities successful and otherwise were abandoned by the previous Government? Even if the Government had wanted to intervene in an area of failure, they could not have done so. The purpose of the clause is to put the child at the centre. Every child matters. There must be a partnership between the parent, the school, the local education authority and the Government, with their desire to raise standards in education. We require the powers to achieve the goal that is shared by all members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's comments because he illustrates the point. He, too, makes a persuasive argument about the need in the ultimate, extreme case for powers of intervention. If the hon. Gentleman has discussed the matter with the Minister, he will know that I played a small part in trying to bring about improvements in Hackney. I felt that it was necessary to assist the Government to do that.
<P>
I am not opposed to the principle of what the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Hope) says or the principle of what the Minister proposes. However, while I cannot bring myself to vote against the clause, because I believe that the powers are necessary, given how it is drafted, nor can I bring myself to support it. For those reasons, we shall not be voting on the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do not find the Minister's response as reassuring as does the hon. Member for Bath, and we shall be opposing the clause.
<P>
The debate has further revealed the confusion that emerged this morning about who is responsible for what in the Government's vision of the future of the education service. The hon. Member for Waveney used a cricketing analogy; I thought that they had gone out of fashion recently, but I am happy to develop one. What we have behind this particular wicket is three potential wicket keepers elbowing each other out of the way and arguing about whose responsibility it is to catch the ball. The Minister began this morning by saying that it is the responsibility of the schools. We then had a long debate about the importance of the local education authority's role in delivering standards. Now we are told that the Secretary of State is the ultimate arbiter.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
What is unclear in the Government's thinking is exactly where responsibility should lie. The unanswered question was the one that I posed during the Minister's speech what happens if the LEA remains in disagreement with the Secretary of State about how best to secure improved standards should the Secretary of State have exercised his powers under clause 8? The problem is that the powers are presented as emergency powers to deal with weaknesses, but that is not what the clause actually says. The clause does not provide a reserve power and we will oppose its standing part of the Bill.

Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Member for Waveney's intervention has drawn my attention to the fact that although I do not propose to abandon the match because of the conditions of the wicket, the temperature in the Room has risen to West Indian proportions. If any hon. Gentlemen wish to remove their jackets, they may do so.
<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Education committees to include parent representatives</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 8, line 44, after "include", insert " (a)".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 12, in page 8, line 44, after "elected", insert "without voting rights".
<P>
No. 14, in page 8, line 47, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and
<P>
(b) one or more persons elected without voting rights in accordance with the regulations as representatives of teachers employed to work at maintained schools in the area for which the Committee or Sub-committee acts.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I suspect that we might now make rather more rapid progress. I want to make it absolutely clear that parents are important to the education of their children; indeed, parents are their children's prime educators. It therefore follows that parents should have a significant voice in the education of their children. Parents deserve to be given a wide range of information about their children's education, their views should be sought, and those views should influence how education is delivered. That, I think, will be agreed by both sides of the Committee.
<P>
However, as part of the delivery arm of those underpinning principles, the Government propose that education committees should include parents with voting rights. We do not believe that it is appropriate for parents with voting rights to serve on education committees. Local education committees should be representative of the democratically expressed wishes of local people and the only people with voting rights should be those elected for that purpose.
<P>
In an ideal world, we might prefer that no parents should serve on education committees, and that only elected representatives could serve. Nevertheless, some education committees believe that it is helpful if parents and representatives of other groups, including teachers, are allowed to attend committee meetings to express their views. We differ from the Government only on whether those people should have voting rights; we believe that they should not. The amendments therefore propose that the Government be allowed to continue with their notion of parents being able to attend committee meetings, but that those parent should not have voting rights. The amendments correpondingly suggest that parents on education committees should continue to sit on them, but without voting rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I ask the Committee to resist the amendment. We are breaking new ground by requiring education authorities to have parents' representatives as full members of the education committee. A group of Government amendments that will soon be moved will ensure that they are parent-governors rather than a general parent body and we shall discuss that issue. We feel it is very important that parents have voting rights because they are in a unique position they and their children are the consumers of the education service and in principle we should allow parents to have a voting right.
<P>
When I was first considering the measure, I was concerned that it may affect the political balance of an education committee, particularly where one party may have only a very narrow majority over the other political parties. However, I understand that the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 provides that rather than parents tipping over the balance, the majority political party will be able to nominate additional locally elected members to maintain their political majority. So it will give parents a say, in terms not just of rhetoric, but of giving them a vote. That is appropriate. It is important to give them the right not just to take part in the debates, but to cast a vote in the proceedings of the education committee. If local authorities are particularly concerned about decisions being taken, they will, through their own standing orders, be able to look at the powers of education committees. It is important that parents are there, not just to speak but to cast a vote. We resist the amendment so that parents can attend and can vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): Will the Minister extend those powers to matters of finance? At present, there are members of education committees who clearly have voting rights on everything but financial matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I had almost concluded my contribution, but I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman raised that point because it is important. The legal position of elected members, in terms of financial arrangements, is very important because they are personally liable for the way in which public money is spent. Parents will not necessarily be in that position. It would be inappropriate for them to vote on such matters because if they did it would create legal financial liabilities for which the elected local authority members would be personally responsible. Clearly, that would need to be covered in the standing orders and the regulations applying to each local education authority. That is why I made the point in my contribution about the need to review standing orders.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Could the Minister clarify from where he believes parents receive their mandate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> In the next group of amendments we will discuss parent-governors. Effectively, the mandate will come from other parent-governors in that LEA. We would envisage the ballot being held by parent-governors on governing bodies coming together and electing their own representatives on to a local education committee. They would then report back to those other parent-governors. We believe that that is the most appropriate way of dealing with the matter, rather than having a sort of mass meeting of parents, which would be difficult to arrange. We think that doing it through the parent-governor network is a proper form of representative democracy and accountability.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I want to press this a little further. Is not it the case that each governing body has corporate governance as a body? Whatever the voting pattern that puts those parents on to that LEA body, I cannot work out how they would be representative of a particular body. They certainly could not speak for the governing body that they sat on in their own school, because they would be breaking that rule of corporate governance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The parent-governors would not be there as representatives of any particular governing body; they would be there effectively as representatives of parent-governors as a discrete group they will[Mr. Byers]
represent their interests. When people stand in elections to become parent-governors they are elected by parents whose children attend the particular school it will become clear that they can go on to serve on a local education committee. That allows parents who are elected by parents to be governors on individual governing bodies to stand for election by the broader group of parent-governors to serve on an education committee. The group of Government amendments that we shall debate next will allow that to happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am not surprised by the Minister's response. I did not think for a minute that he would change his mind, although I think that that is a pity. This short debate has revealed several complications that will arise if the Government implement the proposal.
<P>
I ask the Minister to contemplate his reply to the point on financial decisions made by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis). I hope that the Minister, with his long experience of an LEA, will acknowledge that nearly every one of the significant decisions that LEAs take will involve a financial implication. He appeared to say that those parent representatives will be debarred from voting on such significant education matters. Therefore, what is the point of the Government's proposal?
<P>
The proper form of representative democracy a phrase that the Minister used is an education committee comprised of those who have been elected in local elections to serve on it. I ask all members of the Committee to consider, when deciding how to vote, that the Committee has been taking many major decisions that will affect the future education of young people in this country. I wonder how they would react to the suggestion that parents with voting rights should have served on this Committee, taking the decisions that we are taking. In effect, that is what the Government are proposing should happen in local authorities.

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 103, in page 8, line 45, leave out "parents of registered pupils" and insert "parent governors".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 104 to 107.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> This group of amendments clarifies which parents will serve on education committees. We dealt with some of these matters in the previous debate. The Bill as drafted refers to representatives of parents serving on education committees. The Government now think it more appropriate to restrict those who can serve on education committees to those who serve as parent governors on individual school governing bodies.
<P>
The reason for that decision involves the practicalities of how the ballots of parents will be held if there is much interest among parents in many areas, we think that there will be. We have considered the experience of one or two authorities which already have parents on their education committees; they have been able to organise the nomination and balloting processes to allow that to occur.
<P>
We are breaking new ground in the clause's provisions, so it is appropriate that we have a clear system that people can understand. The amendments will enable parent-governors to be involved, which we believe will be a better way in which to carry forward this exciting initiative.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> My point is simply a matter of clarification as the Minister knows, I support the view that the parental voice should be heard. I am concerned about representation. I fully accept the practical difficulties in obtaining a mandate for the people who will sit on the education committees. The amendment will restrict the category to parent-governors, as opposed to parents, but there is a difference between a parent-governor who has an understanding of and interest in the issues as a governor on the governing body and a parent-governor who feels that he or she is representing parents. I am not trying to be too nitpicking, but the interests of parent-governors will be partly those of the governing bodies of the schools.
<P>
The representatives will consist of parent-governors who are members of governing bodies that will be the electorate from which they are drawn. Does the Minister agree that those parent-governors should sit on the education committees as parents, with the interests of parents, rather than of governors, at heart?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The hon. Lady is absolutely right. That is a helpful peg on which to hang the point: parent-governors will see a clear distinction between their roles as parent-governors on a particular governing body in a local authority area and as people who were elected albeit by other parent-governors to represent parents on the education committee. I am confident that they will make that distinction between their role in looking after the interests of their own school, which their child may attend, and their role on the education committee, where they will have the wider interests of parents at heart.
<P>
Earlier, we touched on the subject of budgets. Although parent representatives on an education committee will not be able to vote on budget matters, they will be able to vote on priorities in the allocation of resources, for example. That gives rise to a potential conflict of interests, especially if parent-governors are protecting their own governing bodies. The distinction needs to be clear, and the rules on conflict of interest will ensure that the problem can be overcome. Although the representatives are elected by parent-governors, the voice of parents will be heard on education committees.
<P>
With those brief comments, I hope that the Committee will agree to this group of Government amendments.
