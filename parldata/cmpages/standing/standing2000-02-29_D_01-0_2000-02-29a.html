<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis Moonie </B>(Kirkcaldy): I beg to move, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Armed Forces Discipline Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past Nine o'clock and at Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a great pleasure to serve on my first Committee as an Under-Secretary, although I have served on many Committees as an Opposition Member. I have not served under your chairmanship before, Mr. Benton, and it is a special pleasure to do so. I am sure that we shall spend several interesting weeks discussing the details of this important Bill.
<P>
I do not envisage that the Committee will sit this afternoon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Key </B>(Salisbury): This is the first time in almost 17 years that I have sat under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton, and may I say what a pleasure it is. I look forward to debating the Bill and to the double whammy of two Ministers representing the Government. In principle, we have no objection to the sittings motion. However, for the sake of our diaries, it would be helpful if the Under-Secretary would say whether, in the next week or two, exceptions may be made to it
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Keetch </B>(Hereford): On behalf of the Liberal Democrats, I agree with the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Bell </B>(Tatton): As the solitary independent, I thank the Liberal Democrats for letting me take a seat that they do not need because of overstretch. I shall find it difficult to attend the Committee on Tuesday mornings, when the Select Committee on Standards and Privileges also meets. However, I fully agree with the timetable.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I do not intend that the Committee should sit on the afternoon of 9 March, as I have a commitment to attend the unveiling of a memorial to Falklands veterans at Pangbourne in the presence of the Queen. Let me correct myself: the Queen is unveiling the memorial.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind Committee members that copies of the financial resolution accompanying the Bill are available in this Room. I also remind them to give adequate notice of amendments. As a general rule, my co-chairman, Mr. Malins, and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.
<P>
Motion made, and Question proposed,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Bill be considered in the following order: Clauses 1 to 10, Schedule 1, Clauses 11 to 13, Schedule 2, Clauses 14 to 25, Schedule 3, Clauses 26 and 27, Schedule 4, Clause 28, new Clauses, new Schedules.--[Dr. Moonie.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> We have little difficulty with the order of consideration. However, will the Under-Secretary explain how labour will be divided between him and the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department? That would help us to understand the relationship between the legal points--which, doubtless, the hon. Lady will seek to clarify--and the defence aspects, with which the Under-Secretary will deal.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Obvious differences will be allocated as logically as possible. However, my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary and I are in Committee as generalists. In general, we shall divide the work according to fair and, presumably, socialist division of labour principles.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 1<p5>Custody without charge<p5>Mr. Key: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 2, line 5, at end insert--</center></H4>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(5) As soon as a person is treated as charged in accordance with subsection (4) hereof, he will immediately become eligible for legal aid in accordance with the Queen's Regulations for the Army, and the terms of such legal aid will be the same whether the Service person is in England and Wales or elsewhere.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take new clause 1--Legal Aid--
{**<p8**}.--(1) After section 75K of the Army Act 1955 there is inserted--  <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``75L Legal aid for advice, assistance and representation, shall be available for anyone in military custody or being interviewed by Services Police outside England and Wales as it is for anyone in England and Wales and section 47(6) of the Legal Aid Act 1988 shall be construed accordingly''.
<P>
(2) After section 75K of the Air Force Act 1955 there is inserted--
<P>
``75L Legal aid for advice, assistance and representation, shall be available for anyone in air force custody or being interviewed by Services Police outside England and Wales as it is for anyone in England and Wales and section 47(6) of the Legal Aid Act 1988 shall be construed accordingly''.
<P>
(3) After section 47L of the 1957 Act there is inserted--
<P>
``47M Legal aid for advice, assistance and representation, shall be available for anyone in Naval custody or being interviewed by Services Police outside England and Wales as it is for anyone in England and Wales and section 47(6) of the Legal Aid Act 1988 shall be construed accordingly''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> The Bill is of fundamental importance to the discipline system of the armed forces and will have a substantial impact on the chain of command, affecting not only senior officers, but non-commissioned officers and, of course, the vast law-abiding majority of service men and women. Far from being a tidying-up measure, the Bill is, in fact, of fundamental importance to the ethos and discipline of the military, and we heard much about that from all parts of the House on Second Reading.
<P>
I want to explore the reasons why we have a separate military system. The amendment brings us to the heart of the discrepancies between the systems of civilian and military law. That is important, because there is a body of opinion that suggests that there is no need for separate military law. We know that the British military has operated under systems of military law for good reasons over many centuries. That law was almost entirely derived from the practicalities created by the fact that the British military--two services for many centuries and, latterly, the Royal Air Force as well--served in all corners of the Earth. Clearly, it would have been unsatisfactory to have either no system of law or a British common law system, which would have been impossible to operate on, shall we say, the river Ganges in the 19th century. A system of military law was necessary. We accept that and reject the notion embraced by other countries in the European Union that there is no need for a body of military law.
<P>
The practical benefits of a system of military law are obvious in the heat of battle or in the theatre of war, where there must be a system of rules and regulations to ensure the maintenance of the discipline that has, as many hon. Members on both sides of the House have said in recent debates, been the foundation of the British Army's success down the centuries. We reject the idea that there should not be a military legal system, but we are concerned that, if we are to tinker with the system, we should do so in a holistic way. We should be concerned not only about the consequences of implementing the Human Rights Act 1998 in relation to the service discipline Acts, but about the Government's decision to omit from the Bill a significant number of areas in which we might have expected that they would wish to improve the lot of service men and women. That is the purpose of the amendment.
<P>
In the civilian world, we expect the police to operate within strict rules and guidelines, which have existed for many years. We consider it just, for example, that someone who is arrested by the police, taken off the street and placed in custody will have immediate access to a solicitor, and that a solicitor will be provided at the taxpayer's expense, for a long time and in complex cases, if appropriate. The purpose of the amendment is to discover why that is not the case in the military system.
<P>
It is important that the Committee should understand the reality of the situation. I will illustrate my point by referring to a case that sums up our concerns, although several outstanding cases would fall into that category. For example, nine RAF personnel at RAF Bruggen in Germany who are under investigation have chosen to be represented by civilian solicitors. There may be many reasons for that choice, and apparently there is nothing in the military regulations that precludes it, but the fact is that the Army criminal legal aid system is not universally seen as fair and unbiased. Many people want to have independent representation by civilian lawyers because they think that officers must be beholden in some way to the chain of command and are incapable of being independent.
<P>
There are many reasons why solicitors who assist military personnel are doubtful about the Bill. They are concerned about the terms of legal aid and about whether service personnel in England and Wales or elsewhere are getting a fair deal. There is also the question of a fair deal for the civilian solicitors involved. Army legal aid is capped, and answers that I have received to parliamentary questions confirm that the Government do not intend to increase it. I was told last week of one firm of solicitors that has an unpaid bill for £50,000 for four months work, and there are similar examples throughout the country.
<P>
The case with which I want to start occurred some time ago. An officer was arrested on 27 February 1997 and interviewed by the Royal Military Police five months later, on 2 July. He was charged on 22 December 1997, 11 months after his arrest, and it was not until then that he qualified for Army legal aid. Most citizens of this country would regard that as not only unacceptable but incredible--they would not believe it could happen.
<P>
What sort of man are we talking about? A brigadier described him, saying:
<P>
I am quite clear that he is without exception the best staff officer I have ever met in the Army. This assessment is based on the following characteristics: he is extremely intelligent and able; he is energetic and industrious. In short, I cannot speak too highly of his effectiveness and achievements as a member of my staff. From my own point of view, I trust him and he retains my confidence.
<P>
After the court martial, another officer wrote:
<P>
When he was acquitted we were all delighted at the outcome and we looked forward to seeing him back at work, not only because he clearly wanted to come back but also because we are a busy branch and there was much to do.
The accused officer was suspended and, subsequently, administratively dismissed from the Army, having had a glitteringly bright career. That officer at no point had recourse to criminal legal aid from the Army, and it cost him almost £100,000 to seek his own representation.
<P>
The code of military honour must be consistent with the British way of behaving. The change that is occurring in the ethos of the service was highlighted by General de la Billiere in a Daily Mail article on Monday. I shall not bore the Committee by repeating it. This case, however, says it all and shows that there are real problems. Whatever else service law does, it must reflect the way in which the British do things: it must be demonstrably fair and proportionate; it must be applied sensitively and with common sense. Was it common sense and proportionate to court martial a colonel amidst a media frenzy of prurient reporting about his affair?
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Was it sensible to subject the colonel, the Army, the Navy, the chiefs of staff, the naval officer with whom he had an affair and innumerable others to the embarrassment of a criminal trial for an offence that is not a criminal offence in civilian law? Was it sensitive to allow the forces to suffer the spectacle of a four star admiral giving defence evidence at a court martial for an army officer who was being prosecuted under military law for an affair conducted while the soldier and his naval lover were both serving under that admiral's command? Of course not. Was it fair to discharge the colonel--an officer with a fine and distinguished record--for the reasons for which he was tried, while the female naval officer's career prospered? Of course not.
<P>
If the services are seeking to justify and retain service law in the face of rapidly changing opinions, they must behave like sensible custodians of a code of jurisprudence that grants them far-reaching and, some would argue, anachronistic powers. The case that I have described illustrates why it is unfair that the officer did not receive criminal legal aid and why he should have been granted it. I shall explain the process that led to the enormous delay, which the amendment seeks to address.
<P>
One of the witnesses at the court martial was told to be the soldier's friend. He has described what happened during the enormous delay. He was a colonel and the accused man was an officer commanding. The soldier's friend was called to the general officer commanding's conference room and was informed that a female Royal Navy officer had lodged a complaint of harassment. There was an initial investigation: the colonel had clearly been a fool and behaved badly, and a serious sexual allegation had been made.
<P>
Everyone had the benefit of an official report, so the soldier's friend asked whether the colonel's side of the story had been given. He was told that it had not been considered at any point. The soldier's friend commented that the colonel and his wife were a good commanding officer team and that the Army should be careful to ensure that the colonel was treated properly and not condemned before the whole story was known.
<P>
As a result of the meeting, the soldier's friend went to Brize Norton to be present when the colonel was intercepted on arrival by the Royal Military Police. The soldier's friend later met the Royal Military Police in the arrival hall at Brize Norton, where he was shown into a side office and told that the colonel would be called to the reception desk on arrival and given a reason for going to the office where he would be interviewed with the soldier's friend present. Eventually, having been summoned over the public address system, the colonel--a commanding officer--was shown into the office where he was introduced to another officer who informed the colonel that he had spent seven hours with the naval officer who made the official complaint.
<P>
A discussion took place, after which the colonel's demeanour was pretty shattered. The impression was given that this was an unfortunate situation, but that it was not too extraordinary. It was explained that the procedures and rules had to be complied with. The colonel had to be escorted at all times and was not to be left alone.
<P>
He was not allowed to make telephone calls. That is not what happens on a Saturday night when someone has been arrested in my constituency. He had to travel by car from the office at Brize Norton to his station but was accompanied and a special investigation branch sergeant followed in another car. The colonel's liberty was, therefore, immediately constrained despite the fact that no charge had been made, and none would be for another 11 months. The interviewing officer said that the reason for that was that he believed that the colonel might try to contact his wife, or someone else, to have evidence removed before arrival at his station. They stopped at a service station on the M25, simply because they wanted to visit the loo.
<P>
Between arrival in the country and arrival at the station, the colonel's married quarters was searched without his wife's knowledge, who was out at a social function. His computer and several floppy discs were removed. On completion of the search, the colonel asked why the search record had not been signed by an authorising officer, or signed to show that verbal authority had been given for the search. That is not like the civil system of justice that we are used to in this country. The interviewing officer said that the search was duly authorised, but did not say by whom. The soldier's friend was required to sign a form and saw that the authorisation had not been completed.
<P>
The colonel was then released into the custody of the interviewing officer. A series of meetings was held, but the soldier's friend thought that the civil police should have dealt with the allegations included in Pearce's statement and that, if the Royal Military Police were to deal with the complaint, the information presented should have been confined to that which the naval officer was prepared to complain about and should not have included sensational and supplementary material. That view was subsequently supported at the court martial and clearly showed that the investigation and prosecution of the colonel was flawed from the outset.
<P>
The information that the interviewing officer presented to the decision makers was selective. If the information held by that officer and subsequently by the prosecution had been made available much earlier as required by law, the flaws and discrepancies in the investigation would have been exposed to those deciding on the course of action to be taken. For example, copies of all the letters that the colonel is purported to have sent to the naval officer, the true chronology of visits to her house in the run-up to the colonel's termination of the relationship and other visits that they had made were not made available. The inclusion in the general court martial charge sheet of the allegation that the colonel contacted the Navy was flawed. The evidence from the Royal Navy vetting officer is specific about date and time. Solid evidence is available to show that Pople was interviewing an officer throughout the period in question and could not have made telephone calls. That evidence was readily available, but it was not used.
<P>
If military legal aid had been available at that stage and the various parties had had access to legal advice from the start, much of that nonsense would not have happened. The investigation was handled in an extraordinary way from the start. The impression given to the soldier's friend was either that the civil police should have handled the investigation or that it should have been confined to those matters about which the naval officer complained. The investigation moved into an area between those two safe positions, and became unsafe as a result, which led to the fiasco that I have described.
<P>
It is therefore extremely important to consider whether, and to what extent, the fault in this and in other cases lies in the huge discrepancy between civil and military law. The amendment would help, first to secure justice by enabling any person charged to start the preparation of his or her defence with the assistance of a solicitor at an early stage when evidence and witnesses are more likely to be available than they are if the preparation has to be delayed for several months.
<P>
Secondly, the amendment would enable the preparation of the prosecution and the defence to proceed in parallel rather than in sequence. In the case that I described, the colonel who had not been charged was left in limbo for 11 months, while the military authorities were busy investigating and making their case.
<P>
Thirdly, the amendment would help ensure that a level playing field in the preparation of the prosecution and defence; and, fourthly, it would ensure that those facing court martial or trial at a standing civilian court overseas had the same resources for the preparation of their defence as those in England and Wales.
<P>
The current processes from the alleged commission of an offence to trial within the services operate unnecessarily to the detriment of the accused and in that respect they are different from the civilian process. The problem is that legal aid is not available to service personnel until much later in the process than in the civilian system. Typically, a civilian offence will occur and be investigated probably within days and at the end of the investigation, any charge is formulated. At that point, which marks the start of the judicial process, the accused can obtain immediate legal aid, advice and assistance, and the preparation of the defence, which may include the tracing and interviewing of essential witnesses while events are fresh in their minds, can start immediately.
<P>
In the case of the colonel, which I described, his defence could not interview anyone for 11 months. That is bizarre. A service person is simply told that the matter will be reported; there then follows a long wait while the Army prosecuting authority considers the matter and engages in various consultations. Papers are often served on the accused months later, and only at that point can he apply for legal aid, which frequently takes weeks to process. It is increasingly common for a court martial date to be fixed before any granting of legla aid is complete and it is by no means unusual for an accused to be left with a period of three months or less, for example, to prepare a defence of what may be a serious allegation. The police and prosecution may have had a good year in which to prepare.
<P>
It is interesting to note that the Bill, perhaps for the first time, identifies the moment at which service personnel are told that they are to be reported for an offence as equating to being charged at a civilian police station. Another anachronism is that the service police do not have the power to charge anyone; in the services system, that comes much later. The relevant measures are section 75(4) of the Army Act 1955 and the corresponding sections of the other discipline provisions.
<P>
Service personnel overseas are to be denied the opportunity to have a civil lawyer to help at the investigation stage; they are also at a further disadvantage as against their counterparts in England and Wales, in that the remuneration of the lawyer is capped, and not at a very high level. The fee would be more or less the same, irrespective of the seriousness of the allegation or the difficulty of the case. Preparation of the defence should be provided at an hourly rate, as it is in England and Wales, and not on the basis of a lump sum.
<P>
Codes of practice and the notification of rights of suspects at interviews are also important. The Ministry of Defence code of practice is perfectly reasonable from the service point of view. On the right to legal advice, section 3 on page 917 of the code of practice states clearly:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Any suspect being interviewed by the Service Police in connection with a Serious Service Offence may consult or communicate privately, whether in person, in writing or on the telephone, with a Legal Adviser who may be a Legal Adviser of his own choice; the duty solicitor ; or a Legal Adviser selected by him from a list of Legal Advisers who have indicated that they are available for the purpose of providing legal advice; in certain overseas theatres, a Service Legal Adviser.<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
It is perfectly clear in the Army's own code of practice that that is desirable. There has never been any question of the military suggesting to service men and women that they may not have access to civilian lawyers. There is just one problem: last December, the Lord Chancellor's Department decided that that was no longer to apply. The rules were changed and the Legal Aid Board issued a directive stating that in future it would not meet legal aid bills for civilian solicitors who assisted in military cases overseas. That is of grave importance for service personnel, especially in Germany and Cyprus, because suddenly civilian lawyers are not to be able to take on such cases. The lawyers have never expected travel costs to be included; that was always part of a separate deal with their clients. It has always been important that when they get there they should be properly remunerated for providing legal advice, but this new Government diktat has thrown all that into disarray.
<P>
It is important that we probe the Government and get them to explain themselves on the matter. The amendment makes our position clear. We consider that service men and women should be eligible for legal aid in accordance with Queen's regulations and that the terms for legal aid should be the same whether the service person is in England, Wales or elsewhere.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Keetch:</B> I welcome the conciliatory and caring Conservative speech of the hon. Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key). If his intention is to improve the Bill with technical changes, I shall not oppose him. I have to say that his tone differs from that of his colleagues. In the Chamber yesterday, the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames), a former Defence Minister, said that Ministers must not
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>drag the Army into being a mirror image of the society it serves.--[Official Report, 28 February 2000; Vol. 345, c. 79.]
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Norwood (Mr. Wilkinson) went even further. He said:
<P>
The very idea of human rights for our armed forces is, per se, a delusion. They do not have a human rights.--[Official Report, 17 February 2000; Vol. 344, c. 1172.]
We believe that they should have human rights and if the Conservatives seek to improve the Bill, we shall support them.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It has been suggested that the Government are making these changes because they fear the consequences of not doing so and that they are being dragged into it by the European convention on human rights. I hope that that is not so and that the Minister will make it clear that the Government are doing this because they belive in the words that they have used in the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Salisbury referred to an article in the press yesterday by General Sir Peter de la Billiere, who is not only a highly decorated officer and an extremely good author but happens to be a constituent of mine. I should like the Minister to comment specifically on one point in the article, which stated that if the Bill goes through--of course, clause 1 may be altered slightly--soldiers will be able to sue their officers over decisions that might be considered to be wrong. It is important that we consider that carefully. Conservative Members' approach in Committee differs from their approach on the Floor of the House and in the other place but if their aim is to improve the Bill we will support them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bell:</B> All my interventions will be extremely brief and non-partisan, but in this case I support the hon. Member for Salisbury. The more we can do to protect the rights of serving men and women, the more the legislation will come into line with the European convention. That must be one of the Committee's objectives.
<P>
As it happens, I am familiar with the case to which the hon. Member for Salisbury referred because the colonel wrote to me shortly after his arrest--and I could not believe the circumstances. It was a living nightmare for him, as it has been for others. The denial of due process and of legal aid--I referred to another case on the Floor of the House of Commons yesterday--is Kafkaesque in its implications. Some soldiers have spent £100,000 and more--money that they do not have--trying to defend themselves against charges that may not even have been made, while their careers lie in tatters. The amendment will strengthen the position of serving men and women, which is why I support it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Crispin Blunt </B>(Reigate): I am grateful to the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Bell), who has shown during his two and a half years in the House of Commons that he is a great champion of the interests of service men. My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury moved an interesting amendment and I should like the Government to clarify their position on it. I shall illustrate my argument by drawing on my own military experience.
<P>
When I served in Germany, I was appointed assistant defending officer to a young soldier who had been charged with rape. He was remanded in open arrest in his barracks before court martial. It was not thought that he would reoffend, but another lady came forward to make an accusation of rape against him. As his appointed assistant defending officer, I was one of the first people to see him after those allegations had been made and he found himself under close arrest.
<P>
When I spoke to him, he told me that he had had sex, but that it was consensual. That was effectively his defence against the allegation of rape. He had been interviewed by the military police, but he had not been asked whether he had buggered the girl as well--a separate allegation. I had to point out to him that consent was not a defence to the charge of buggery: it was an offence whether consensual or not. As his assistant defending officer, though I had no legal training, I advised him that if an allegation had not been presented to him by the investigating officers, he had a perfect right to remain silent.
<P>
Subsequently, following medical evidence, the soldier confessed. I then found myself, as his assistant defending officer, on the receiving end of an investigation, which could have ended up with my being charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice--a very serious charge. I am happy to say that that did not arise--I found out only later that that course of action had been considered. It illustrates, however, the importance of soldiers, sailors and airmen who face serious charges being able to access proper legal advice at an early stage. Perhaps the legal advice that I sought to give as assistant defending officer was correct: I do not know, but I thought that I should provide my best advice to the accused man whom I was defending.
<P>
There is considerable merit in the amendment. The accused should be able to seek legal aid at the earliest opportunity. The Government face a difficulty, on which I seek the Minister's clarification. Serious charges will almost inevitably be dealt with by a general or district court martial, but the summary justice system must also be taken into account. We do not want to trigger an application for legal aid during the summary justice process for non-serious offences. My hon. Friend's amendment allows for some difficulty in relation to that. However, if the amendment does not suit the serious cases that it seeks address, there should be a formal way of changing it during our proceedings so as to give soldiers faced with serious criminal charges an opportunity to trigger legal aid at an early stage.
<P>
Without taking legal advice, I do not pretent to know exactly what that trigger should be and how the amendment should be phrased. However, the issue must be tackled and my hon. Friend may be able to help me if he feels that the amendment meets that criteria and addresses the problem.
<P>
My hon. Friend raised the Lord Chancellor's extraordinary recommendation and the Legal Aid Board's subsequent decision not to meet legal aid expenses for soldiers, sailors and airmen serving overseas. That is wrong, and we look forward to the Under-Secretary's reassurance that that decision will be reversed at an early stage. Otherwise, we shall deny soldiers, sailors and airmen in an especially exposed position access to justice. The Bill has been introduced because the summary justice system is not compliant with the European convention on human rights. The armed services and chiefs of staff are attempting to defend that system.
<P>
Liberal Democrat Members say that they are in favour of human rights, as if trying to sweep away the whole system of military justice. It is not possible to have a summary justice system under the European convention on human rights because such a system is administered by a chain of command and is not independent. One cannot have one's cake and eat it. As summary justice breaches articles 5 and 6 of the ECHR, soldiers, sailors and airmen in such circumstances do not have human rights as expressed in the convention.
<P>
We are trying to protect the summary justice system. Some of the Bill's provisions--although not the clause--are seriously deficient in that regard, as they over egg the pudding and undermine reasonable authority. We shall discuss those matters later. However, I hope that the Government will examine the issue of legal aid so that soldiers, sailors and airmen facing serious charges have a proper chance to get early advice. Such people are in the service of the Crown and in an exposed position, so it is only right that the state should provide them with legal advice through the legal aid system. In circumstances described by my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury and the hon. Member for Tatton, they ought not to find themselves having to pay a bill of £100,000 or more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I, too echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury, as I am delighted to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton and am sure that our debates will be constructive. In line with my hon. Friend's comments, we shall approach the Bill constructively in order to improve it.
<P>
Our amendment encapsulates a highly significant aspect of clause 1, which is the most important clause in the Bill. I am anxious about the difference between processes in civilian and service investigations. In civilian investigations, offences are investigated and, within a matter of days, a charge is brought. At that point, the person under investigation is entitled to legal aid. However, in the services, reasons of practicality apply. An offence is investigated and the accused service man is told that the offence will be reported, but it can be many months before he is told whether or not a charge will be brought. It is only then that he is entitled to legal aid.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
As in the case cited by my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury, the accused service man is under a cloud for all that time, during which he cannot obtain proper legal advice to discover how he may have to proceed in future. Indeed, it is possible that a date for a court martial may be fixed before legal aid is available. If the Bill is intended to improve the human rights of our service personnel, it is totally wrong that legal aid is not available when the service man is told that his offence will be reported.
<P>
The idea of the Lord Chancellor's Department saying that legal aid should not be granted to those people who are overseas is even worse. There should be consistency between service personnel cases and civilian cases. Unless we get that aspect right, I envisage that we shall have to introduce changes to the legislation in a year or two. Let us try to get it right now. If we are to comply fully with the European convention on human rights, let us do so, and let us get it right this time.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the hon. Member for Salisbury that we are taking new clause 1 with the amendment. I do not recall him referring to the new clause. Perhaps he would like to take this opportunity to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I am grafeful to you, Mr. Benton. It was most thoughtful of you to give me the opportunity to speak further to new clause 1. I intend to have dealt with it by my reference to the discrepancy between service men and women who may have need of legal advice outside the United Kingdom as well as inside. That is the purpose of new clause 1, which I covered in my speech, so I shall not repeat what I said. Thank you, for giving me the opportunity to ensure that new clause 1 is properly addressed.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> The essence of these amendments is threefold: first, legal aid provisions should be changed; secondly, the present system is unsatisfactory; and thirdly, that is shown by specific cases. Although I am familiar with the lurid details, which prompted much of the press coverage, the charge in one of the specific cases was, in fact, nothing to do those involved having an affair but with their having indulged in conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline. One may ask whether that case is relevant to the debate, although it might be a general indication of deficiencies in the military system of justice and, therefore, we might have to consider extending natural rights to people in those circumstances.
<P>
The problem is that this is a limited measure. It gives the Ministry of Defence no particular pleasure to have to put an extra Bill before Parliament. The quinquennial review Bills are generally considered sufficient, especially as we are now on track to unify the three Acts at some stage in the future. Previous Ministers have said that things are on track for some stage in the future, but the future is coming a little closer now. As there is to be another quinquennial review Bill next year, it is incumbent on us to restrict the Bill's provisions to the absolute essentials. There are deficiencies in the present system, but it is the purpose of the quinquennial review to identify them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I listened carefully to the Second Reading debate, but I could not divine from it why the Bill is being introduced now, rather than after the quinquennial review next year. What is the hurry? Why not deal with the entire matter next year, in a tidy and logical manner?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> That is a reasonable point. Our advice is that the present position is untenable. One argument against the Bill is that it will be a barrack-room lawyer's charter, although that has not been advanced by any member of the Committee. However, not to introduce the Bill would leave us open to just such legal action by individuals. The Bill is essential to avoid such actions.
<P>
Although it gives us no pleasure to do so, we have introduced a measure that is consistent with our obligations, which incorporates Eurpoean convention on human rights into British law, and which provides a reasonable framework within which to proceed. It would be more logical to deal with matters such a legal aid in next year's Bill rather than adding them to this Bill, which will have a relatively limited effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Bell:</B> As the Minister accepts that there are injustices in the present system, does he agree that now is the time to correct them, rather waiting until next year?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> No, I do not accept that. That is the purpose of the quinquennial Bill. I have not had the pleasure of serving on that Committee, but I may do so next year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> It is a treat in store.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> No doubt. It is possible that every member of this Committee may have to serve, although they will not necessarily be forced to do so. None of us has served on such a Committee--
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I have.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Lucky man.
<P>
The Acts are updated on a quinquennial basis because problems, such as those that we are discussing, occur. Unlike other measures, the Bills do not come before the House in the usual way, with a Second Reading, a Committee stage, a Third Reading and so on. They go before a special Committee, and are considered, as far as possible, in a non-partisan way in order to obtain the best changes possible. I am not suggesting that the Opposition are partisan about this Bill, but I believe that the changes in the proposal should be strictly limited to those that we consider essential. All other considerations should be deferred until the quinquennial review next year.
<P>
I am happy to consider how legal aid was applied in the case raised by the hon. Member for Salisbury, and to write to him about it. All the cases raised would worry me, as a non-lawyer, when considering whether natural justice was applied, although such a common-sense attitude to the law would probably be strongly deprecated by my legal friends. It is however, a natural attitude for many of us, especially politicians, to hold.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way; he shows a great deal of indulgence. However, he seems to be trying to have his cake and eat it. After an earlier intervention, he told me that it was necessary, for legal purposes, to introduce the Bill as soon as possible to comply with the European convention on human rights, yet in answer to the hon. Member for Tatton, he said that it was not necessary to enact major changes to grant legal aid to accomplish the provisions of the Bill. Surely, the Minister cannot have it both ways.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> The hon. Gentleman is straying into the question whether the amendments are necessary, or adequate to tackle the problem that we have been discussing. I submit that they are neither. That is why I am prepared to accept the principle that something should be done, but not to accept the amendments now, as I shall explain later.
<P>
On the canard about the new right for soldiers to sue their officers, I must say that the Bill has the backing of the services chiefs of staff. The proposals have not been introduced hurriedly; they follow close and careful consultation with the services. As a result, the Bill achieves its objective of holding service discipline in a way that is consistent with the European convention on human rights. If the procedures in the Bill were not to be followed in a particular case, an individual facing disciplinary proceedings could draw attention to that in his defence, just as he could if procedures under the present system had not been followed. The court, usually a court martial, would have to decide whether any departure from the procedures was relevant to the case. The Bill is designed, as far as possible, to work in all circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keetch:</B> Just so that I can allay my constituents' fears, I want to know if it is the case, as Sir Peter de la Billiere said, that soldiers will be allowed to sue their commanding officers for compensation if they are given orders which prove, with the certainty of hindsight, to have been ``wrong''.
<P>
Will soldiers be able to sue their commanding officers, yes or no?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> No.
<P>
I want to make one or two general points, and I apologise for boring the Committee--
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> It is not boring.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Wait until you have heard it. Although I do not wish to be boring in any circumstances, sometimes that is difficult. I mean no disrespect to whoever composed the excellent brief to which I shall refer during my speech. The trouble with rambling through a response to a debate in which half a dozen hon. Members have spoken is that one often misses points. If there are any points that I should have covered--
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Perhaps my point.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Yes, indeed. The amendment would extend legal aid to those being dealt with summarily, but that is not acceptable either to the Government or to the services. Legal aid means legal representation and that is not appropriate in a summary trial. That matter should properly be argued during the services Bill next year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> The hon. Gentleman quoted the chiefs of staff in support of the Bill; we should reflect on the words of Sir Charles Guthrie, which were quoted by his noble Friend Baroness Symons of Vernon Dean, who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I shall quote exactly what Sir Charles has agreed that I may say in this Chamber. The services at all levels wish to introduce compliant disciplinary procedures as soon as possible. Ideally, they would like revised procedures introduced during the current legislative session.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 16 December 1999; Vol. 608, c. 371_72.]
The key word is ``compliant''; the services are relying on the same legal advice as the Minister and his hon. Friends. In respect of the summary justice procedure, especially the appeal against the commanding officer's orders, there is no legal justification for such trials. Such procedures are not necessary in order to make them compliant. That is what has caused confusion in the public mind about the ability of a soldier to sue his commanding officer. I suspect that the Minister has slightly misdirected us, because a soldier probably would be able to sue his commanding officer by taking a case to the European convention on human rights; he will be able to do so under British law after 2 October when the European convention on human rights legislation comes into force. The Minister may want to take advice on the matter to be absolutely certain about his position. What is at issue is the matter of compliant disciplinary procedures and of a soldier being able to question the commanding officer's authority by appealing against his orders.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> We are straying into the meat of future clauses and I am reluctant to pursue such matters. I made it clear that the fact that one or two newspapers get the wrong end of the stick and relentlessly pursue a line, irrespective of denials, will not change the right of individuals to sue under present circumstances. It makes no change whatever--and I can say that only so many times. I completely refute what has been suggested. It is simply not the case.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The amendments would achieve two objectives. First, they would give statutory effect to service personnel's entitlement to legal aid when they have been charged with an offence under service discipline Acts. Secondly, they would extend the provision of the Legal Aid Act 1988 to service personnel who require legal aid overseas.
<P>
Let me say straight away that I see no need for the amendments, simply because current legal aid schemes will fulfil all the expectations of the hon. Member for Salisbury, apart from their being reflected in the statute book. Each service operates its own legal aid scheme, and legal aid is available to all those who are to be tried by court martial and wish to appeal to the courts martial appeal court, and to those who are to be tried by a criminal court outside the UK for an off-duty offence. It is available to civilians who are to be tried by a standing civilian court--the equivalent of a magistrates court--outside the UK. It is also available to those appealing to the summary appeals court once the right to appeal is established, and to those who wish to have legal representation at a custody hearing.
<P>
The criteria that must be met by anyone applying for service legal aid are that they must be subject to service law--under one of the service discipline Acts--and that assistance must be in the interests of justice. Individuals are required to show that they have insufficient means to obtain assistance without help from public funds. When matters are to be tried in a foreign court, it is necessary to establish that the host country has no equivalent scheme for non-nationals. Nothing in the Bill changes eligibility for legal aid under the services schemes, or affects the amount of aid that an individual may receive, other than the extension--not restriction--of rights to appeal in summary hearings. As I have already said, legal aid is usually unavailable in summary hearings. That is viewed as overly restrictive. One of the reasons for extending the right of appeal is that service people do not have the same advantages as those in civilian proceedings. We recognise certain exigencies in air force law, for example, and we shall deal with that matter later.
<P>
The hon. Member for Salisbury and other hon. Members referred both on Second Reading and today to new guidance issued in December by the Legal Aid Board, which would limit the availability of legal aid under the civilian scheme to UK residents. That will have no effect on the continuing operation of the service schemes, which are separate. The schemes are designed to meet contingencies overseas, so there is no need to extend the provisions of the Legal Aid Act 1988 to overseas service personnel.
<P>
On the point raised by the hon. Member for Salisbury about people being interviewed under caution, they are entitled in those circumstances to use the services of a duty solicitor. As to the particular case presented the hon. Gentleman, I feel as uneasy as everyone else when a case takes such a long time to resolve. However, it has been known to happen in civilian circumstances too. Overall, the present system works well and should not be changed without sufficient reason, which has not been advanced today. Detailed arguments about legal aid should be referred properly to the full quinquennial review next year. I therefore urge my hon. Friends to reject the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Key:</B> The Minister started by reminding us that the colonel's court martial took place on the grounds that his action had been prejudicial to good order and discipline. Yes, but it beats me why be believes that that affects my argument. As I clearly said, there were 11 months between the arrest and the charging of the officer and the question of legal aid being brought into play. My amendment specifically addresses that point.
<P>
The Minister says that all our concerns will be wrapped up in a new armed forces Bill next year. I wish I had his confidence about that. I do not, because I spent three months debating the previous armed forces Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I would not be presumptious enough to suggest that all concerns will be addressed by next year's Bill. We can, however, attempt to address them then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I am glad to hear that, but it provides little comfort to the many service men and women who are currently seeking legal aid and advice. I have already mentioned nine RAF personnel at RAF Bruggen in Germany whose legal advisers have been thrown into disarray by the decision of the Legal Aid Board. I cannot accept that the amendment should fail to be carried.
<P>
Next year, the armed forces Bill will, like all armed forces Bills, become a Christmas tree Bill. I recall that the previous Bill had baubles hung off it, including the future of the Royal Naval college. The Government will doubtless have many new ideas between now and then, not least the consolidation of the three service Acts, which has been put off for almost a decade.
<P>
If the Minister examined the record of the previous armed forces Bill, he would find that the Government pressed many technical legal amendments on Report. They were taken on the nod, and the Opposition--the Labour party--did not even speak of them. The amendments were not subject to a Division of the House of Commons on the grounds that they were technical. The entire present Bill is being cited as a technical amendment, but we contend that it is not. If the Government persist in voting against us on this amendment, I am delighted to hear that they will re-examine the issues later.
<P>
Many factors influence military discipline and we hope to examine them in Committee. However, I give notice that some factors, such as the redress of grievance procedures, are especially important and we must pursue them more vigorously. That matter could have been addressed in the Bill and is another example of the Bill's failure to address discrepancies in judical processes between the civilian and military systems. I could cite many other examples, but the Minister is protected by his excellent officials from the steady stream of cases of unhappy service men and women who feel that their fears about unfairness are not being addressed. Many feel that their career prospects have been blighted because of the misjudgments of one person--whether a junior NCO or a senior officer--and that the redress of grievance procedure is arbitrary, lengthy and unfair.
<P>
We are going to have to look forward to the next armed forces Bill, but I cannot allow the Minister off the hook. If he believes that we are going to cave in on all our amendments simply because he says that the issues can be looked at again next year, he is sorely mistaken. He will not get away with that. Of course there are advantages in the procedures of the armed forces Bill, which allow us to take note of individual cases. The Special Select Committee procedure on that Bill is a model of how Parliament should scrutinise the legislative programmes of Governments--but that does not help us now.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for promising to write to me about legal aid. I would be even more grateful if he would agree to copy and send the letter to all members of the Committee, as we shall all wish to return to it.
<P>
I finish where I started. The amendment is not unreasonable. It would do more than the Government intend to do, which is probably why they are resisting it. It is entirely consistent with the Bill's purpose of improving the lot of our service men and women. I intend to press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I seek one further assuracne from the Minister. Article 6 of the European convention states, in relation to a service man's civil rights:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does seem that in the case cited by my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury, there was a good argument that it was not brought within a reasonable time. Had that service man been entitled to legal aid between the investigation and the charge being brought, I have no doubt that his legal representative would have made the case for it. The Secretary of State has said that the Bill complies with the Human Rights Act 1998. Will the Minister say whether it does comply if legal aid, which our amendment proposes, is not to be allowed?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Legal aid is allowed, but only in circumstances that we consider to be entirely appropriate. Delays can occur in any trial or in the process of bringing a person to trial, not only in armed forces cases such as this. But the hon. Gentleman's point is not really relevant. Our legal aid system fairly covers people up to and including trial. After all, even if the person in question had had legal advice it would have made no difference to the onsent of the trial.

<B>Mr. Key:</B> The rationale for this raft of amendments is based on the practicalities of armed forces personnel costs and on ensuring that proper support is provided to an accused person. The Bill proposes not only one judicial officer but a whole new administrative support function with a new role for new lawyers and new investigators, as well, of course, as administrative staff to administer the new procedures, the travelling arrangements and their subsistence costs, the subsistence costs and arrangements for witnesses and the take-up of armed forces legal aid, plus the implementation of all the necessary new computer systems and office equipment. It is estimated that the first year's take-up costs will amount to almost £2 million, plus the recruitment of, apparently, 95 additional administrative personnel. That is a gross underestimate. This procedure will soak up massive amounts of time and effort at every level of every unit in the armed forces, quite apart from the central support staff.
<P>
In the past couple of months, as we have begun preparations for the Bill it has been interesting to see the answers that I have received from the Ministry of Defence on many detailed points. The most obvious comment to make is that in almost 17 years in the House I have never had so many answers coming back on the appointed day with the words ``I will answer shortly'' or ``I will write to the hon. Member and a copy will be put in the Library of the House''. Only once or twice have we heard the line that the answer could be provided, but only at disproportionate costs. We have been told regularly that the information requested is not held in the form required, and so on. There has been every conceivable excuse under the sun. What it comes down to is that, basically, the people who have had to design the Bill--which, as the Minister told us, is a stop-gap affair pending serious consideration of the human rights of our service men and women, maybe next year, with luck--that is, the Army legal services, are completely overstretched and do not have a sufficient number of people in this whole sphere. All this is at a time when the Lord Chancellor's Department is being so helpful in cutting legal aid to civilian lawyers when they could help, and so on. Above all, information is just not being collected. Were I a less charitable person, I might be tempted to say that Ministers do not know what they are talking about. That would be a terrible allegation, but one is tempted to draw that conclusion. If the Ministers were not such charming people I would perhaps say that, but I know that it is not true of the Parliamentary Secretary or the Under-Secretary of State for Defence.

<P>
Outside the House it has been said that answers to my parliamentary questions have made it clear that the Army has not quite known what was going on in its own back yeard. The lack of available statistics on the number of offences and their outcome, and on a mass of other detail, is pretty alarming. However, the Ministry of Defence is making up for lost time. It now appears to be willing to put in place a vast army of additional bureaucrats. I am told that some see it as a case of the Government creating the sort of armed forces which we do not want if it means spending more time and money on policing the forces than on delivering an efficient effective force with the right tools.
<P>
A former soldier has told me that he regards the measure as support for procedures to undermine commanding officers. He thinks that the problem of the ethos being undermined is extraordinary when what are needed are more resources for developing and training staff to develop new expectations. People in the forces who know how the system works and understand it, think that we should be investing far more money on dealing with skills shortages and new ideals by which to live rather than bringing in a new role that is devoid of the right skills, experience and background, but has considerable additional costs. With our proposal for judicial officers, we seek to draw attention to these deficiencies.
<P>
The role of the judicial officer was challenged in the other place. On Second Reading, my noble Friend Lord Bunham said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The judicial officer, who plays such a large part in the Bill, will take away much of the control and authority that a commanding officer has over his unit. The amended Section 75C of the Army Act proposed by the Bill states:
<P>
``If, on an application by the commanding officer of a person arrested a judicial officer is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the continued keeping of that person in military custody is justified''
<P>
he may authorise it. I presume the commanding officer has no say in the matter at all and the periods for which custody may be used are very short. Again, that might be alright in Catterick and Colchester, but not in the front line or in a submarine under the polar ice cap.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 29 November 1999; Vol. 607, c. 672_3.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall not pursue the question of submarines and polar ice caps, which were simply intended as an illustration that has clearly degenerated into a frivolous example. Such things are unlikely to happen on submarines under the polar ice cap.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> They have never happened.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I am not surprised to hear that, so I shall waste no more time on it.
<P>
However, the Defence Committee is anxious about the matter. In its report on the Bill, it said that introducing a more litigious atmosphere into the world of military discipline would create reasons for worrying about the risks to operational effectiveness. Operational effectiveness is the touchstone of the Bill. We entirely concur with the Government's sensible approach to military discipline and personal behaviour in the code, as military effectiveness is paramount. However, that is also why we tabled these amendments.
<P>
When the Defence Committee examined the Minister for the Armed Forces, the hon. Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar), it asked whether the introduction of judicial officers into summary proceedings would have an adverse effect on commanding officers' ability to exercise authority and on their personnel's perception of that authority. Perception is all important. The Minister told the Defence Committee that the Bill was introduced.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>precisely to maintain the authority of the Commanding Officer and service discipline.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister believed that ensuring Eurpoean Convention on human rights compliance would strengthen the commanding officer's authority by protecting it from challenge in the courts. I understand that line of thought, which was paraded with unfailing regularity by Baroness Symons during the passage of the Bill in another place. I accept the reason for such a belief, but the argument is not sufficient. However, when questioned by the Defence Committee, Brigadier Andrew Ritchie, director of personal services in the Army, said that studies carried out by the Army showed that the number of individuals whom commanding officers would wish to detain in custody for more than 48 hours was probably only about 240 a year. He said that the Army does not regard the provisions of the Bill relating to judicial officers authorising continued detention
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in quantity terms, as an enormous problem and  do not believe Commanding Officers' authority will beundermined.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, a minor problem in quantity terms might be an enormous problem in non-quantity terms, affecting a handful of men and women. There is not much point enacting a Bill applying to large numbers of people if it takes the approach of ``blow the individuals''. That is an extraordinary suggestion on the part of any Government.
<P>
The Defence Committee pursued the matter when it examined witnesses, probing the practical difficulties of bringing an accused person before a judicial officer if deployed on active service, especially in a remote part of the world. I understand the problem with remote parts of the world, and I am not suggesting that we cover every eventuality by the book when someone is involved in war or conflict in the jungle, up the Khyber or elsewhere.
<P>
I accept that and do not wish to pursue the matter. However, the British military operates in remote parts of the world and does make some errors. Although 99.9 per cent. of military personnel behave with superb poise, and never do anything wrong or step out of line. Indeed, if they do, the sergeant shouts at them. As long as he does that, things may be all right. However, as we shall no doubt discover shortly, the sergeant will be in trouble in relation to the human rights of those at whom he is shouting. This morning, we heard that the Church of England is advising its clergy not to put an arm around a distressed parishioner in case doing so is misconstrued and they face prosecution or litigation. We do not want sergeants to put their arms around soldiers in the jungle or elsewhere, let alone up the Khyber. However, we must not forget that the services have their separate system of law precisely because they operate away from the mainstream judicial system.
<P>
During consideration of the Bill in another place, the possibility was raised of having two parallel systems, one operating in peace and the other during operations. The Army's director of personnel services told the Defence Committee that to have two parallel systems would serve of itself to confuse and potentially to undermine military discipline, not least because there would inevitably be a grey area between when we were on one system and when we were on the other and definitions of operations are notoriously difficult.
I understand that. So the Committee was assured that the possibility of an accused person being kept in custody, for example, for more than 96 hours without being charged would arise on only a few occasions and that that would normally be only for their own protection in certain limited circumstances.
<P>
The Ministry of Defence is confident that when those circumstances arise and it becomes necessary for an accused person deployed in operations to appear before a judcial officer, the legislation is sufficiently flexible for ways to be found to meet such a requirement. The point about flexibility was also pursued in the other place. So the suggestion is that the new system of law will be all right for many people; but if not, it will be sufficiently flexible. That suggestion needs to be probed, explained and justified because most deployments involve more than one of the services. That is important because purple deployment is now the norm.
<P>
The three separate service Acts reflect the different traditions of the three services down the years and, in the case of the Navy and Army, down hundreds of years, but the fact is that those personnel now operate together. RAF pilots might operate from aircraft carriers and be mixed with other military personnel for weeks or months at a time. The problem is that the services are deployed together, but judicial officers could be drawn from any of the three services, so they will be steeped in the traditions of only one service. An RAF judicial officer might serve on an aircraft carrier. Qualified lawyers from other Commonwealth countries could serve as judicial officers. I would be the first person to agree that that could be very helpful, especially if the person involved was in East Timor; it would not be too much of a step to Darwin. We shall return to such matters later.
<P>
The Army's director of personnel services thought the the likelihood was ``remote'' that a commanding officer would wish to detain a person when the unit was deployed on active service. I accept that that is the norm. I have visited forces on active service in Bosnia and Kosovo, for example, where it is unlikely to find anyone in detention. The Army's director of personnel services said: if we have somebody who is in quite serious trouble he is going to be a drag on rations if he is on operations.
Therefore, efforts would be made to send him back from the front line to the main regiment. That might be possible, but, equally, it might not be. There are plenty of examples of NATO peace-keeping duties in which troops from constituent nations have faced extremely difficult situations. The Dutch have bitter experience of that in Bosnia, as we all remember.
<P>
The Committee stated:
<P>
We remain concerned that the legislation should cover all eventualities, and look forward to the Government clarifying this issue during the Committee stage of the Bill.
Well, this is the opportunity for the Minister to clarify the Government's position. The Defence Committee will no doubt pore over the Minister's words. Of course, it will call Minister's to account in respect of the Bill in due course. If the Defence Committee does not have time to re-examine the Minister on the matter, we will be able to pore over it again when considering the armed forces Bill next year. Some of us have long memories, and we will remember what the Minister says.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
The broad aim in this part of the Bill is to achieve independent supervision of how the services police treat any detained person. I know that the hon. Member for Tatton has many examples, to which he may allude, of the behaviour of the services police and how they treat detained people. That problem is probably best solved by the appointment of a duty officer or, in more colloquial terms, a custody officer--that title is more in line with civilian terminology. That officer would view his or her functions as independent of the services police and of the detained persons, would be guided by a code of standards in relation to the treatment of a detained person and would be in charge of formal documentation--of a custody record, in other words.
<P>
In the case that I mentioned on a previous amendment, there was a lack of continuity of record keeping, no custody record, and no equivalent of what would be expected in civilian proceedings. The formal documentation or custody record should log all that happens to a detained person at a police station, whether in custody or not, with events being timed and so on, as in the civilian process. Having a custody officer system in the existing services arrangement--without making related changes--would create difficulties. At many special investigations branch or Royal Military Police stations there are no satisfactory arrangements for detaining personnel, who will probably be kept in the guardroom of their unit, because there are no police station cells in the military setting. The person under arrest is likely to be mared down to his unit and kept there. The process is easier for the Navy because on a ship the person does not have much opportunity to escape unless he swims for it.
<P>
The current arrangement means that officers will have to direct somebody to accompany an accused man wherever he goes. Therefore, in terms of welfare he is in the custody not of the police but of his unit. It might be sensible to consider the introduction of custody centres at certain points within divisional areas, or at main RAF stations. If there were relatively few centres, the number of judicial officers needed--or rather, custody or duty officers--could be kept to a minimum. What is the point of having a huge range of custody officers if it is possible to have custody centres? In addition, resources could be focused on the provision of good interviewing facilities with, perhaps, video interviewing equipment, which might be necessary in connection with legal services, as we will see elsewhere in the Bill. There could also be civilised cell accommodation.
<P>
The custody officer could be in the hands of the general officer commanding the division. The custody officer--this is important--need not be a member of the services police; he could be a commissioned officer outside the chain of command of the services police, unconnected with anyone likely to attend the custody centre. He should have the power to delegate deputies; perhaps there should be a principal custody officer for each centre, who can delegate. I suspect that that would be welcome, and it would certainly be a substantial improvement on the current situation.
<P>
That is the background to the amendments. If we are serious about improving the lot of service men and women who fall by the wayside, the amendment would be of great benefit to them. It is difficult to believe that the imposition of a massive new bureaucracy, with judicial officers, will make enough difference to allow the Government to achieve their aim.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Keetch:</B> I will be brief. I said that we would support anything that would improve the Bill; the amendment would not do that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) said that the Government wanted to have their cake and eat it: the Conservatives are now doing the same. If we are to do things properly, we need an independent figure such as the judicial officer--it cannot be the duty officer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury on a skilful set of amendments designed to get round the difficulty with the clause. The hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch) said that we should do things properly and involve judicial officers. The issue is how we can do things independently, as well as the role of judicial officers, and it goes to the heart of the question of independence in courts martial, which should be bombproof against appeals based on the convention.
<P>
Under the terms of the European convention on human rights, courts martial and the summary appeal courts, which we will discuss later, are strictly independent. That is the big problem with the Bill; Ministers have been unable to say--to the Committee, to the House on Second Reading or in the debates in another place--that the proposed measures will not be the subject of further successful appeals under the convention. One of the key issues will be independence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keetch:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but I understand that the judicial officer provides that independence; perhaps the Government will clarify that. If we revert to the use of a duty officer, that independence will not be there, and accepting the amendments would make the legislation even more susceptible to what the hon. Gentleman might call ``bomb damage''. The judicial officer is the key independent element that will ensure that the Bill complies fully with the European convention on human rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> That argument is right, to a degree, but if it is, the whole court martial system is equally liable to an appeal under the convention on grounds of independence. The duty officer cannot be in the chain of command for the soldier, sailor or airman involved. My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury made it clear that the term ``custody officer'' might more properly describe the practical function involved, although the Bill calls him the ``duty officer''.
<P>
Amendment No. 37 would allow for the commanding officer to appoint an independent custody officer--it is the custody officer who must be independent. If he is, that meets the requirement under the convention, just as the whole court martial system does, because the officer is independent of the chain of command. If the system for appointing the custody officer--or duty officer--as set out in my hon. Friend's amendments is not fireproof against an appeal to the European Court, neither is the whole court martial system. In that case, we would have to consider other ways of protecting the system of military justice.
<P>
The real beauty of my hon. Friend's proposals is that we would get rid of most of the expensive bureaucratic burden associated with custody as covered by the first part of the Bill. He has found a way to achieve that which is as fireproof under the convention as the rest of the Bill, by appointing qualified independent custody officers to carry out their duties independently and fairly in the interests of a person who is accused of an offence or, in the case of custody before charge, who may be accused of an offence. It should not be necessary to have 95 extra officers, at vast expense. We should remember that the money comes from the defence budget, not from the Treasury. Every cost or unnecessary burden on the services that we remove from the Bill means more money is spent on better equipment and more training for soldiers, sailors and airmen rather than on expensive lawyers who will not do much fighting for Her Majesty and her country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Bell:</B> I was interested in the use of the word ``independent'', which is one of the most manipulated and abused in the language. I have seen some extraordinary things: innocent soldiers appallingly treated by the legal system, and the reverse. I remember a sergeant in the parachute regiment who punched, and floored, two officers at a party, and then discharged his weapon illegally. His only chance of acquittal was the incompetence of the army legal service, which duly obliged.
<P>
What is important is that the Government have devised a wording that is as compliant as possible with the convention, and in this case I support them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I want to probe this issue of practicalities, which my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury mentioned. Often, small units go to remote parts of the world and in such circumstances the mechanisms in the Bill will be cumbersome and impractical. The Minister will say that he cannot accept the amendment because it does not comply with the European convention on human rights. If he uses that argument, I will ask him why he has not done as the French have done and asked for a derogation under clause 15. I see no reason why we cannot have two parallel systems. The issue was examined by the Defence Committee.
<P>
When a service man is going on active duty he could be informed, in writing if necessary, that he would be under a different judicial system in such circumstances. The Minister must explain how the paraphernalia of the Bill will operate in, for example, a case of gross insubordination to a senior officer in a small unit such as the SAS, operating in a remote region in the Gulf. The Minister must tell the Committee, very carefully, in that instance--he is nodding.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> No, I am not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Oh, he is not. When service personnel are in remote and difficult situations, perhaps under intelligence cover, they need to know the arrangements for judicial officers to be flown in to deal with disciplinary cases. If the Minister is not going to accept the amendments, he must tell us why.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I shall deal first with the principle of the amendments, which would entirely negate one of the main provisions of the Bill. The hon. Member for Salisbury will not be surprised to know that I will oppose the amendments and encourage my hon. Friends to do likewise.
<P>
The appointment of independent judicial officers is a key provision of the European convention on human rights; if we do not appoint independent officers we will not comply with the convention and the point of the measure is that it should be compliant. A duty officer from anywhere in the chain of command appointed by a commanding officer would negate the principle of the Bill and I cannot therefore accept the amendments.
<P>
The amendments have, however, given us the opportunity to probe other suggestions and accusations levelled at the Government, and I shall deal with them in the order in which they arose. First, on the subject of cost, there will not be a body of full-time judicial officers sitting around waiting to be used in these cases. The additional function will be fulfilled by existing judge advocates, people who are already involved in the legal system, and that burden will incur only a marginal extra cost, as I explained. The cost will not be as great as the hon. Gentleman suggests.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
As the Bill recognises, the role of a custody officer is properly exercised in the first 48 hours by the commanding officer. He is the equivalent of the sergeant in charge of the police station, whose duty is to ensure that custody provisions are properly applied in the initial circumstances. After 48 hours, it is no longer tenable for the custody officer alone to have that responsibility; that is why the judicial officer is introduced at that stage. The hon. Gentleman's more detailed points about the other functions of a custody officer will be dealt with more appropriately in next year's Bill rather than in this one, which has a specific purpose.
<P>
I do not want to be dragged into a ``what if'' argument on operational requirements. If I respons to one hypothetical case, somebody will stand up with an even more far-fetched one for me to discuss. That is happening even as I speak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keetch:</B> The Minister will forgive me but as the Member for Hereford, I cannot allow to pass the scandalous slur on the SAS by the hon. Member for Cotswold. He seemed to suggest that the regiment may have been involved in gross insubordination. Just as the Minister confirmed that he is not aware of any incident involving a submarine in the polar ice cap, will he also confirm that he is not aware of any gross insubordination incident involving my constituents serving in SAS regiments in the Gulf?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Despite my elephantine appearance, I have a reasonably lively imagination. I, too, can conceive of unlikely cases in the heat of battle in the jungle or the desert, where operational situations may require a highly disciplined soldier who disobeyed the orders of his commanding officer to be placed under restraint. However, that is highly unlikely. In every operational circumstance that we can think of, the commanding officer's right to do what he thinks fit would take precedence and we would support him in that respect. That might, in the future, lead to someone questioning whether he had taken a correct action, but we cannot forsee whether that will be the case. However, as far as we know, the measure complies with the provisions adequately by giving the commanding officer the right to do what is necessary under operational circumstances and by giving the offender the rights that are due to him or her when circumstances permit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I draw the Minister's attention to the conclusion of the section of the Defence Committee's report about custody without charge, which states:
<P>
We remain concerned that the legislation should cover all eventualities and look forward to the Government clarifying this issue during the Committee stage of the Bill.
Is the Minister proposing to ignore that recommendation to the Committee? He is not clarifying the issue.

<P>

<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Where possible, I have given clarification. Doubts were expressed about whether there will be operational control by a commanding officer and I said clearly that that is the case; I do not intend to say it again. I do not know what further clarification is necessary. We said that operational considerations will remain paramount; the Bill has been designed to work in all circumstances and there should be no misunderstanding of the matter. I do not want to get into a ``what if this happened'' argument, and suddenly find myself on another planet discussing ``what if that happened'' and being light years away from the point. The provisions suggested by the hon. Member for Lichfield (Mr. Fabricant), who had doubts about video conferencing, would then come into effect. On another planet, it would not be difficult to get a proper time relay. I am sorry to digress; I hope that we shall not discuss video conferencing in detail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> Later, alas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, as he said something very important. He said that nothing in the Bill will preclude a commanding officer taking the action that he believes to be right. If that is what he said, what would happen when a soldier was required to be detained for more than 48 hours but no judicial officer was present?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> In those operational circumstances, it would be unlikely for that to take place, but I am trying to avoid too many hypothetical cases. If there were no alternative, however, we would back the judgment of the commanding officer, which would not necessarily constitute a defence in law. The issues can be decided only on a case-by-case basis. Procedures must be justified in operational circumstances and, as I said, we would support the commanding officer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to hear what the Minister said, but I cannot find any provision in the Bill that allows a commanding officer to take such action. It is all very well for the Minister to say that he would back the commanding officer, but how can he do so unless the Bill provides for it?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> We did not consider it necessary to make specific reference to that in the Bill. Our legal advice and that of service chiefs suggests that the Bill provides adequate support for the person charged and for the commanding officer in all circumstances. We intend no further changes to the provisions.
<P>
I have addressed all points other than derogation, which has been raised before. We cannot derogate from the convention; nor would I wish to do so. I am happy with the application of European convention on human rights provisions to the armed forces. They are entitled to its protection. I recommend that the Committee opposes the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I am disappointed that the Minister is proving so intractable. We have reached the second group of amendments without any sign of the flexibility that we would expect from the hon. Gentleman, who is held in great affection by the House of Commons for the way in which he does business. We have tabled sensible amendments and expected greater satisfaction from him than we have received. The amendments are a serious attempt to improve the Bill and encourage greater efficiency in the armed services. Dealing with custody is a fundamental part of the Bill.
<P>
As I said, it is extraordinary that the Government are so inflexible and unprepared even to countenance our sensible suggestions, which have not been plucked out of thin air or put forward in a partisan spirit. Our amendments are based on the sound advice of practitioners in the field who believe that the amendments could improve matters. The Minister should not fall into the trap of assuming that every amendment that we propose is a delaying tactic intended to obfuscate the issues or in any way dilute his intentions. We are in the business of improving the Bill so that when it becomes an Act it will assist the whole chain of command and those who have fallen by the wayside.
<P>
I deeply regret that the Minister has not provided an adequate explanation of why the Government cannot accept the amendments. I am therefore forced to press for a Division.

<B>Mr. Key:</B> This is a matter of practicality, dealing with how long anyone should be kept in custody. We are, after all, seeking to bring military law more closely in line with civilian expectations, and when we examined the provisions, we saw an anomaly. It would be appropriate to limit to a more acceptable level the maximum period to be spent in custody before charge.
<P>
I spoke earlier about the substantial discrepancies in the due processes of judicial law as compared with civilian law. They are seriously out of kilter and the Commitee expressed its opinion that the issue can be revised on another occasion in another year. However, it is a matter of great practicality and if the Government are serious about improving the human rights position of service men and women, they should accept these straightforward amendments.
<P>
The amendments would establish some equivalence with civilian detainees. I acknowledge, of course, that service conditions might sometimes call for longer periods of investigation. I have observed already that in military circumstances, there is seldom a police station down the road with interviewing suites, electronic recording facilities, cells, canteens and so forth. In military circumstances, the accused might have to be marched off to rejoin his unit and be kept in custody there rather than at a Royal Military Police point. That could mean some delay.
<P>
Once the accused has arrived, however, why should he or she be subject to a longer term of custody than under civilian circumstances? We believe that 96 hours is just too long and that the 72 hours that applies in civilian cases would be fairer. If there were duty officers with the same powers as a civilian magistrate, the period in custody could be extended, if necessary, but it would be improper for the commanding officer to impose 96 hours of custody on a suspect.
<P>
The issue is simple. Do the Government believe that complying with the European convention on human rights means locking soldiers up for longer periods that civilians? We think not. We believe that 72 hours would be more appropriate. To many people, that is just a number, but I noticed that during the passage of the Bill in another place, the Government were unwilling to accept great arguments of principle and moment yet were occaisionally willing to recognise the validity of numbers. I am therefore hopeful that they might accept our reasonable suggestion about reducing the number of hours in custody to 72.
<P>
It is a simple and straightforward group of amendments and I hope that the Minister, in his simple and straightforward way will accept them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I hope that my hon. Friend will forgive me, but I have some difficulties with the amendments that he proposes. Like the Minister for the Armed Forces before the Defence Committee, the Under-Secretary has failed to engage in a discussion of the circumstances in which custody before charge will be necessary. In our discussion on the previous group of amendments, he refused to be drawn into in painting any scenario. However, we must get into such painting now because in this clause the Goverment are putting in place a provision for scenarios in which judicial officers are not available within 48 hours.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
On the question of 96 hours, proposed new section 47D (5)(b) of the 1957 Act states:
<P>
if it is not practicable for the application to be heard at the expiry of that period, as soon as practicable thereafter but not more than 96 hours after the relevant time.
<P>
Of course, someone who cannot get the judicial officer within 48 hours is clearly in an immensely difficult position and may be detatched on operations with small groups of forces, possibly in a counter- insurgency role or on covert radio or electronic silence. In such circumstances, a young officer having to detain someone without charge might be unwilling to do so simply because he is not sure how to do it. A lieutenant leading a patrol may never have come across such a development.
<P>
Therefore, the Government have considered certain scenarios in introducing the qualification that there should be an extra legal period if it is not practicable to make application within 48 hours. However, if doing so is not practicable after 48 hours, it may still be impracticable after 96 hours. An officer may have to release a person in custody after 96 hours in certain circumstances, such as being in a nuclear submarine under the polar ice cap. The Under-Secretary is right to say that that scenario has never arisen, but it must be considered as it would be wrong to upset a ship submersible ballistic nuclear on its patrol pattern.
<P>
There may be circumstances in which an officer does not want to bring a certain individual to charge, as he may be being detained for his own protection or that of his collegues. Such a person may have become psychologically or psychiatrically damaged and be a danger to himself and his colleagues. That is a medical problem but, on occasion, the interface between medical and illegal activity may result in an officer not wishing to bring an individual to charge but wanting to have the circumstances more fully investigated. However, detention is necessary and it is wholly impracticable to bring the detainee before a judicial officer.
<P>
I am therefore anxious about the amendment. As Brigadier Ritchie's evidence to the Defence Committee clearly suggested, it would be highly unlikely that someone could not be brought before a judicial officer within 48 hours. However, in such unlikely circumstances, one needs as much time as possible to extricate oneself from operations to get back into communication with one's superior chain of command in order to get access to a judicial officer, even if only by video link.
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury will reconsider whether 72 hours would be more appropriate than 96. I am not sure that 96 hours is long enough for someone in such circumstances. In the very exceptional circumstances covered by subsection (3)(b), we should consider whether junior commanders have long enough to resolve the situations in which they may find themselves.
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend will consider whether he wants to press the amendment to a Division because 96 hours is barely adequate in the circumstances.

<P>

<B>Mr. Martin Bell:</B> I welcome the signs of disagreement on the Conservative Benches, and I trust that that will shortly be met by signs of independent thinking on the Labour Benches. I hope that the hon. Member for Salisbury will press the amendment to a Division. We do not have to talk about scenarios; I can tell the Committee about real situations involving front-line troops. While fighting a war or peace keeping, they tend to live in improvised conditions, perhaps in tents, schools or factories that have been commandeered for the purpose. Those installations do not come equipped with prison cells. The last thing that a commanding officer at the sharp end wil think of doing is to establish a prison cell.
<P>
If a soldier has committed, or is suspected of committing, a serious offence, he is quickly sent under close escort to rear echelon. There never was a forward unit that did not have a rear headquarters, where such matters could be dealt with. I honestly believe that the 72-hour provision is not only sensible and provides more protection to the accused, which must be one of our imperatives in considering the Bill, but is more compliant with European legislation, so I support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> This matter was debated in the House of Lords. My hon. Friend Lord Burnham moved an amendment that would have put flexibility into the system. I should have liked that amendment to be accepted. Flexibility, rather than a hard-and-fast time frame, should be included in the system. However, all of us who want to improve the system would like it to comply with the European convention, under article 6 of which cases must be brought to trial as soon as possible. So the general presumption must be that that should be the case. If that is the case, I do not understand why the Minister cannot accept the amendment, under which we want to shorten the time that someone can be held in custody without charge. That must be the overwhelming wish of the Committee and, I should have thought, the House.
<P>
In response to the amendment tabled by Lord Burnham, Baroness Symons said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In relation to the convention, we have been advised that in order to comply with the principle of fairness, 96 hours is the maximum period of custody without charge that is likely to be compatible.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 24 January 2000; Vol. 608, c. 1331.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
If she said that, I cannot understand why the Minister cannot accept the amendment, because it errs on the side of caution and of human rights and justice. I hope that the Minister can give us comfort on the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I want to deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Tatton. I have been involved in a circumstance in which the provision could have applied if we had been on operations, not on exercise. I shall describe it to make it clear why I have difficulty with the amendment. I was a member of an armoured reconnaissance regiment, training on exercise Lionheart in 1984. At the beginning of that exercise, which was intended to prepare for the third world war, I commanded a troop of four Scimitar armoured cars deployed on reconnaissance duty along the notional inner German border.
<P>
During the build-up to the declaration of war and the invasion by the enemy forces, we overtly patrolled the border, flying the flag and trying to reassure the people there that NATO forces were ready to deter the enemy. That paralleled exactly what we would have done in reality. When we received the intelligence that an attack was inevitable, we went from overt patrolling into covert observation posts, which had to be hidden because we would have either to withdraw as the enemy approached or to stay in position and report his progress down through the chain of command. It was essential that those observation posts remained covert. The squadron received its orders to go into observation posts and to begin the covert phase of the exercise, and at the same time the second in command of the enemy force rolled up outside the place where the squadron leader was giving orders to his troop commanders. One of my fellow troop leaders and two soldiers saw him and arrested him and made him a prisoner of war.
<P>
The German brigadier did not like getting the prisoner of war treatment from my colleagues. He was banged up against the side of his staff car, his legs were kicked apart and he was searched. To his embarassment, a teddy bear was produced from his pocket--he possessed a teddy bear but he did not have an identity card. He was asked to explain what he was doing on our side of the line. There was no more to be said about it at the time. The commanding officer of the regiment, who had been listening to the squadron leader giving his orders, came out and saw the brigadier, for whom--in a previous incarnation--he had worked in NATO headquarters. He saluted him smartly and, to our chagrin, released him before he could be passed down the line as a prisoner of war.
<P>
The German brigadier went back to his divisional commander and said that he had been assaulted by British troops. His account was wholly at variance with what had actually happened. The German divisional commander was incensed at how the British soldiers had behaved, and said that he was going to take his division off the exercise. He then informed the British corps commander that the whole exercise would be cancelled, although we had already gone out to the observation posts. The military police, breaching the security of the covert observation posts, went forward to our line and arrested the two soldiers and the young officer who had captured the German brigadier. They were held for eight days while the charges were investigated. Happily there was a German witness, an old woman whose comment when passing was, ``Dumkopf--typical Bundeswehr'', which upset the German brigadier more than slightly. However, she had witnessed our treatment of him, which was shown to be fair.
<P>
The military police had to come out to our covert observation posts, which would never have happened on operations because the posts would have been compromised. If we had been in that position we would have had to leave the posts in place; it might have been possible to arrest the accused, but not to bring them in front of a judicial officer, because it would have compromised the operation in which we were taking part. Time would not have been a factor--we could have been there for days, if not weeks. That is why I know, from my own experience, that the clause would cause difficulty. Ninety-six hours is not quite long enough, and I have difficulty supporting the suggestion of 72 hours.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moonie:</B> In the previous debate I was accused of being intransigent and heartless, but those are characteristics foreign to my nature. As I recall, I attempted to be as accommodating as possible without actually accepting any of the first group of amendments. I said that they might appropriately be tabled to another Bill at another time. However, the amendments in the second group were--although I did not want to use the phrase--wrecking amendments. They would have destroyed one of the main provisions of the Bill, and I could not possibly accept them. Similarly I regret to say that, although I have sympathy with the motives behind it, I cannot accept the group of amendments that we are discussing.
<P>
I agree that deprivation of liberty is a serious matter, and that protejction against it is a fundamental human right. However, the armed forces need flexibility. We seem to be caught between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, we are accused of destroying Army discpline by introducing a Bill incorporating European convention on human rights-compliant provisions, while on the other, we are accused of failing to comply with the convention and being overly flexible when we attempt to assert flexibility for Army behaviour. One cannot have it both ways, as much as one would like that. However, we are trying to be as reasonable as we can in all circumstances.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
We consider that 96 hours is a reasonable upper limit that takes account of previous decisions on an acceptable pre-charge maximum period of custody under the convention. Many cases have been heard in relation to that and our legal advice is that 96 hours is the maximum allowable. However, the 48-hour cut-off is the key point. A commanding officer may detain someone for only 48 hours and must then seek review. The judicial officer is not compelled to grant a further 48-hour period of custody. Generally, we would expect the officer to interview the CO and anyone else involved, take into account circumstances and authorise a further period of custody, although not necessarily 48 hours. He may well seek another review the following day at 72 hours or perhaps later. However, no one should be kept in custody without charge for any longer than is deemed necessary.
<P>
The 96-hour period is essential to allow the flexiblity needed to take account of special circumstances facing armed forces. The Bill also gives the judicial officer flexibility to grant a further period of custody, although not necessarily the maximum specified. The combination of those two factors provides adequate safeguards for good discipline and individuals' human rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Tatton for his common-sense approach. I accept that the Under-Secretary must defend his position and I am sorry that he does not see fit to accept the amendments. However, the hon. Gentleman is right, as the amendment is in the interests of human rights and would not undermine the authority of service discipline.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) spoke from personal experience and gave us valuable insights into how such matters work on the ground. I do not have any problem with that, as I accept that, in this case, he sees matters from a slightly different perspective. He spoke about covert activity, electronic silence and so on, which were debated in another place on Second Reading.
<P>
Covert activities and electronic silence, however, are rarities for the great mass of Her Majesty's forces. The Bill involves what goes on in Colchester, Catterick, Amesbury or Aldershot, where huge discrepancies remain. Not for one moment should we believe that the SIB is lurking behind the trees in Kosovo, waiting for something to happen. Things are not like that. However, the rare instances of criminal activity in the forces must be addressed.
<P>
As has been pointed out during the passage of the Bill in this House and another place, there are great discrepancies in how matters are currently handled. In garrison towns, military and civilian treatment of misdemeanours are quite different. The military adopts a tariff approach. The military police would no doubt arrest a squaddie who is drunk and disorderly on a Saturday night in Aldershot. He would be marched off and would appear before the commanding officer the following morning when a substantial fine would be imposed. The tariff for being drunk and disorderly is approximately £600, a lot of money in anyone's language. I heard from my chief constable last month that the standard fine for a squaddie found relieving himself in the street in my constituency is currently £750. That is a heavy fine, and a damned good thing, too. If, on the other hand, the Home Office police arrested a squaddie who was drunk and disorderly, the process would be different, as I have seen for myself when out on a night patrol with Wiltshire constabulary in Salisbury. If some slightly merry soldiers rolling out of a night club into the gutter, falling over and damaging one another, whether intentionally or not, see a police car approaching, they do not mind too much until the civilian police say to them, ``Hang on there. We're just going to radio for the red caps'' whereupon, as I said on Second Reading, the incapacitated squaddies are suddenly transmogrified into olympic athletes who will never have moved as fast in their lives because they know what will happen to them.
<P>
We are not talking about jungle covert activities, but about crime in other circumstances--for example, crime committed by soldiers in Germany. This is a less frequent occurrence now because there are fewer military personnel there. I recall that a serious crime was committed there. On one occasion squadies out for a drink on a Saturday evening in a German town committed an unforgiveable crime. They had been on a tank exercise on Luneburg heath and were bivouacked there for the night. They decided that it was all a bit boring so they slipped off into the nearest town and had a few drinks. They started walking back and decided that it was rather a long way so they flagged down a car, dragged out the occupant, punched him, laid him in a ditch and went off with the car. The next morning there in the middle of a squadron of tanks was a VW. That was a terrible crime. Whatever the circumstances, we think that it is in the interests of human rights that the maximum time should not be as long as 96 hours.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister for Cotswold was right to say that going for the maximum number of hours that are compatible with the ruling of the European Commission on human rights will be challenged. The Government have argued many times in the other place that they wish to avoid the opportunity for challenge. That has been the basis of their case for going as far as they have on so many of the provisions in the Bill, which many people allege will undermine the chain of command. Here, we have stood their argument on its head. The Government suddenly announce that they will go for the maximum time that they think they can get away with, saying that they think they probably will not be challenged but that in any case that is what they intend to do.

<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Surely that is entirely consistent with the approach that I have defined. We shall apply the convention to the armed forces, as is our duty, while ensuring that we are able to maintain operational requirements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> Well, there has been a great deal of goldplating during the passage of the Bill, and I have sought to illustrate that suddenly the Government are adducing a different argument. A reduction to 72 hours would assist the Government's case and be more consistent with their general approach to the proposed legislation. I am sorry that they have declined to accept the amendment. In view of the support of the hon. Member for Tatton, quite apart from the our having the courage of our convictions, we shall press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Key:</B> We have had a good debate on clause 1 although I regret that we did not make further progress with out amendments. However, there remains one issue on which I should be grateful for genuine clarification.
<P>
I am concerned that we are changing the custody arrangements for the armed services and the three discipline Acts without actually being sure exactly to whom they apply. I referred to section 211 of the Army Act 1955 which relates to the application of the Act to reserves and auxilliary forces. I am still not completely clear about it. I am sure that the Bill covers the Adjutant-General's Corps and service personnel and support--the Pay Corps. It covers education, training and support--the RAEC; the Army Legal Service, the Royal Military Police, the military police and the Military Provost Guard Service--the prison officers. I am equally sure that the military guard force is not covered by the Bill because the force is undeployable. I am not clear whether the Bill covers various other categories. I have in mind the central volunteer headquarters of the Territorial Army--the CVHQ. Is the CVHQ covered? What about the Royal Artillery, the Royal Logistics Corps, the Royal Engineers, and others such as the infantry and the medical services. What about the reserves--the former regular members of the armed services who have a reserve liability. Will they be covered? This is not a pedantic point but a practical one. Many people need to know who will be covered by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I cannot give a full answer now. As far as I know, the Bill involves all serving personnel and civilians who are covered by Army discipline Acts when they are overseas. I am not sure which other groups may be covered. I shall try to provide an exhaustive list--of course, I cannot promise to get every individual into it--and give the Committee the information.

Question put and agreed to.
