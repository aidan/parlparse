somewhat dull Thursday, after a fairly traumatic and difficult week for
the House. The Speaker has appointed me as an additional
Chairman&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;Hear,
hear!&#148;] I am grateful to be able to help out in the unavoidable
absence of both Mr. Hood and Mr. Atkinson, but I
am happy to tell you that Mr. Atkinson will be back in the
Chair this afternoon, so you will have to suffer me for only one hour
and 25 minutes.</div>
<a name="09052148000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind
Members that amendments may be tabled during the recess. Any amendments
received in the Public Bill Office before 4.30 pm on Thursday 28 May
will appear in print on Friday 29 May and will be unstarred and
eligible for selection by the time the Committee resumes on Tuesday 2
June, after the brief Whitsun recess. I remind the Committee that when
you adjourned earlier this week on Tuesday, you were, and therefore
still are, debating clause 6. I think that the hon. Member for
Hammersmith and Fulham had just completed what he had to
say&#151;</div><a name="09052148000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000233"></a>The

Gentleman speak&#151;one that I have had many times in the past, and

me again with his eloquence. Both the Conservative and Liberal Democrat

spoken.</div><a name="09052148000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09052148000236"></a><b class="B">Mr.

today. Would it be possible for you also to chair the final sitting of
the Committee, as you did so well last
year?</div>
<a name="09052148000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000237"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am most grateful&#151;as
we come up to the selection of Speaker, such comments are welcome
indeed. Unfortunately, the matter does not rest with me. I am merely a
temporary and additional Chairman for this sitting. If there are
further problems and I am asked to chair the Committee again, I shall
readily accept. I am grateful to the Government Whip for bringing me
entirely up to date, because I am clearly at a disadvantage, the
Committee having sat twice already.</div>

Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): Allow me to add my congratulations
on your appointment as our additional Chairman, Sir Nicholas.
Unfortunately, not having been here on Tuesday, you missed the
magisterial way in which my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and
Fulham explained the whole of clause 6 in great detail, including a
large measure of the economic thinking behind it. You missed the
delights of Laffer curves and the precision of the calculations of tax
rates and their impact on
people.</div><a name="09052148000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
reflected since Tuesday&#146;s sitting, I think that, inevitably, it
all comes back to the adequacy and quality of the modelling used to
underpin the assumptions within the 50 per cent. tax rate. The adequacy
of the modelling is a topical subject. The Government will be aware of
the wish of the TaxPayers Alliance for more dynamic modelling. I have
some problems with that not being comprehensive enough; nevertheless it
shows that the idea of modelling is very much on the table. That was
recognised by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. One of the other things
that seemed obligatory on Tuesday was quoting the IFS, and I have one
such quote today. I must put down my glasses because, in my efforts to
be frugal these days, I print things with two sides on the same page,
so as not to increase expenses. The Committee will therefore have to
excuse me if I peer somewhat as I read. The IFS says that, in its
initial reaction to the Budget, it seems that the Treasury
has</div>
<a name="09052148000185"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not accounted
for consumer spending falling as a result of this change. If these
effects are taken into account, the Government could lose up to
&#163;1.5 billion in indirect tax revenues, even if the Treasury is
right&#148;.</div><a name="09052148000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a lot of concern about the underlying modelling that took place to
justify the 50 per cent. tax rate&#151;if, indeed, it was done to
justify it. Given that it goes to the credibility of the tax system, it
is important that it is based not only on political will in the United
Kingdom but on
analysis.</div><a name="09052148000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Matters
are made even worse by the abandonment and the absence of the fiscal
rules. I did not believe in them very much and nor, it seems, did the
Chancellor or the Prime Minister before him; nevertheless, they were at
least useful in pointing to a direction in which the Government would
go.</div><a name="09052148000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall not go through the issues that we spoke about on Tuesday in
detail, but it is important to understand where the tipping point is in
each of the Laffer curves, depending on the range of behaviours. We
heard my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham talk about
data on average taxpayers being used to inform decisions about
specialist groups, which again goes to the heart of the credibility of
the underlying modelling that took
place.</div><a name="09052148000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Institute of Chartered Accountants expressed concern about such matters
in its pre-Budget submission to the Government and in its post-Budget
assessment, in which it called for a detailed economic analysis to be
undertaken. It used the same words in its pre-Budget 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div>statement, and the fact that it used the same words suggests strongly
that it is not happy with the economic analysis done.</div>
<a name="09052148000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We heard
about the confusion in the Treasury Committee about the adequacy of the
modelling for the 50 per cent. tax rate. My hon. Friend the Member for
Northampton, South, who is not here today, quoted question 335 from the
proceedings of that Committee. The Chancellor was talking about the
&#163;150,000 limit and the 50 per cent. tax rate and
said:</div><a name="09052148000186"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is no science behind it, it is just simply my judgment that I thought
that figure was an appropriate figure. It is the top 1%, as it happens,
of earners in this country and I decided that that was the right
level&#148;.</div><a name="09052148000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
there is some
confusion.</div><a name="09052148000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000239"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Does my hon. Friend infer from that quotation that
the figure of 50p was perhaps selected on political rather than
economic grounds?</div>
<a name="09052148000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000240"></a>John
Howell:</b> That is a pertinent remark, and it is a pertinent
conclusion to draw. In the morning sitting of the Treasury Committee,
Mr. Williams, who is the director of personal tax and
welfare reform at the Treasury, said that some modelling had taken
place. There is therefore confusion about whether the modelling was
scientific. Was the Chancellor criticising the modelling that had taken
place, which he would have been aware had been described in a little
detail in the earlier sitting? Did that modelling take place before he
reached his decision on a 50 per cent. tax rate? Was that modelling to
justify a decision that had already been taken, or was it modelling
that was used to inform a decision before it was taken? We simply do
not know the answer to that.</div>
<a name="09052148000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should also
like the Minister, in summing up, to comment on the points raised both
by the IFS and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. The Committee
would benefit from a much better explanation&#151;perhaps an
explanatory memorandum on
modelling.</div><a name="09052148000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09052148000241"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): I listened with care
to the hon. Gentleman, who clearly has concerns about the clause. Maybe
he is going to depart from the fence on which his Front-Bench team has
sat so far and call a vote on it. Would he like to tell us more about
his practical thinking on this day, on this
matter?</div><a name="09052148000033"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000242"></a>John
Howell:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for exposing the bear
trap in front of me with such clarity. <i class="I">[Laughter.]</i> I will not
take insults, Sir Nicholas. Perhaps he feels that because I have not
been here as long as other Members sitting here today I am going to
walk straight into it. I am politically astute enough to realise that
the bear trap is there and tiptoe around it, which is precisely what I
am going to do. I am not going to depart at all from the comments that
have been made by my hon. Friends on the Front
Bench.</div><a name="09052148000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09052148000243"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): I will almost jump into
the bear trap because, let us face it, our party has made it quite
clear that it is the wrong measure and is against the interests of the
nation. Does my hon. Friend agree with me that, because of the fine
mess the Government have got us into, we cannot make any promises until
we see what the books are like?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div><a name="09052148000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000244"></a>John
Howell:</b> My hon. Friend is completely right. It really is
quite outrageous to expect us to make those sorts of
promises.</div>
<a name="09052148000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000245"></a>Mr.
Todd</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="09052148000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000246"></a>John
Howell:</b> Just let me finish my sentence.
<i class="I">[Laughter.]</i></div><a name="09052148000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09052148000247"></a><b class="B">James
Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): Make him a
Minister.</div>
<a name="09052148000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000248"></a>John
Howell:</b> Him or me? We need a change of Government before
there is any possibility of me becoming a Minister, and I look forward
to it. Go on, I will give way now&#151;I have forgotten where I was.
<i class="I">[Laughter.]</i></div><a name="09052148000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000249"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> It would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman described
what this bear trap is. If it is a matter of principle and this is the
wrong policy for the country, then surely his party should vote against
it&#151;as indeed should the party of the hon. Member for Taunton,
who likewise declined to tell us how he intended to vote on the matter.
If it is the case that the measure will not actually raise any money,
then surely the point raised by the hon. Member for Wellingborough is
irrelevant. It is not going to make the circumstance of our economy any
better or worse, so his argument appears confused at the very
least.</div><a name="09052148000041"></a>

that entertaining intervention, I remind the Committee that we are

Finance Bill of Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition. If the hon. Member for

<a name="09052148000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had better
conclude because it is the last day before the Whitsun recess. This is
a serious matter, and in some ways I regret the levity with which we
have started. In response to the intervention that I made on Tuesday,
the Minister said that the extent of worsening in the global downturn
that had occurred between the pre-Budget report and the Budget was down
to political judgment. Of course political judgment needs to take
place&#151;I do not deny that, that is what we are here
for&#151;but it cannot be all political judgment. The concerns raised
by my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham, by me in
commenting on the modelling, and by the various organisations that I
have mentioned today, illustrate the need for the Government to come
clean and detail the modelling that took place to make this decision
and the timing of it.</div>

more interesting elements of the Minister&#146;s introduction to the
clause was when he said that, &#147;The higher band reflects the fact
that the wealthy have reaped benefits in past years from the growing
economy&#148;. I understand that significant debate took place on
Tuesday afternoon about that sentence, not least with the hon. Member
for Taunton. It brings into play a worrying precedent: we could have
ever more retrospection and an element of or a desire for clawback
within the system. The hon. Member for Taunton was right, there are a
lot of people who have not necessarily reaped tremendous rewards; they
have found it difficult to get on to the housing ladder, despite
earning multiples of the national average salary. As the hon. Gentleman
is aware, in central London that is often the
case.</div><a name="09052148000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
in their late 20s and early 30s suddenly earning significant sums of
money will, before too long, get caught by the higher tax rate,
assuming that it stays at 50 per cent. for incomes of &#163;150,000
or more. Those individuals have not reaped any great benefits from the
past, but will pay the price going forward. Therefore, it is worrying
that the Government&#146;s justification is couched in those terms.
If that is the justification for a 50 per cent. band, it leaves the
door open for significant clawback of past
gains.</div><a name="09052148000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
avoid stepping into the bear trap in South Derbyshire or elsewhere, it
comes as little surprise that early opinion polls suggest that an
overwhelming majority supported the Government&#146;s plans to impose
a higher tax band on those earning over &#163;150,000. One should not
give too much credence to opinion polls, which are academic until the
tax comes into play. My party leadership has correctly identified the
blatant political gauntlet that has been thrown down and is designed to
embarrass us. After all, as many have said, the tax band stands to
raise negligible additional income. Even the most ambitious
thoughts&#151;income compared to borrowings of &#163;175
billion or more&#151;suggest that the income will be fairly tiny.
Accordingly, my party is entirely justified in declining to play to the
Government&#146;s line. The most urgent priority of any incoming
Conservative Government&#151;assuming that happens in the next
year&#151;will be to stabilise public finances.</div>
<a name="09052148000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">As someone
who was a businessman before I entered Parliament, I want low tax. Low
tax is phenomenally important, particularly for the entrepreneurial
class. Equally, as I have frequently observed in debates and speeches
over the past couple of years and in an intervention in this debate,
there is an increasing sense of insecurity among an ever larger
proportion of the UK work force about the spoils of globalisation being
spread inequitably. In many ways, that is a particular danger for the
political class because the sense that the spoils of globalisation are
unequal no longer comes only from the folk on the traditional left,
increasingly, middle-class Tory-voting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>people have those concerns, with some justification. They see property
prices rising astronomically and private education, something that they
may have taken for granted, now outside their reach, particularly if
they have several children. It is important for the whole political
class. I fear that that sense of unease will grow, especially among
middle-class professionals, or at least among those who are outside the
once gilded corridors of financial and associated
services.</div><a name="09052148000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the predictable truth of the imposition of clause 6 is that the
super-rich will not pay a penny more in tax. They are either
non-domiciled or in the privileged position of being able to
characterise much of their income as capital gains, which will be
subject to the unchanged 18 per cent. tax rate. My hon. Friend the
Member for Hammersmith and Fulham made that point extremely well. I was
an entrepreneur with a relatively small business that turned over about
&#163;2 million at its height. There is an opportunity to have a lot
of what is effectively income as dividends, taxed through the capital
gains regime, or one can sell off a business at some point in the
future for the equivalent of an income stream, because that will be
charged at only 18 per cent. It seems that such additional revenue that
would be obtained through the provision will come only from modestly
successful small business people who, I fear, will then have even less
incentive, or indeed collateral, to expand their enterprises, as well
as from salaried workers who are unable to avoid the increase and who
frequently earn sums not wildly in excess of the &#163;150,000
threshold. Their instinct to do the right thing on savings and pensions
would be blunted as their disposable income falls
significantly.</div><a name="09052148000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
party is right to express concerns. We understand the critical
importance to our national economic health of promoting small start-up
businesses. Competitive tax rates are essential to encourage
entrepreneurs, especially as we make our way out of this deepest of
recessions. Conservatives appreciate that raising tax now, even on the
wealthiest in our communities, risks prolonging the UK&#146;s
economic
downturn.</div><a name="09052148000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
decade or so ago the decision of the then Labour Opposition to stick to
the Tories&#146; tax and spending plans was an explicit recognition
that our economic strategy in the mid-1990s was right for the nation.
That is in stark contrast to the situation today. Even in these
turbulent times the public should not be taken for fools. No one out
there believes that the Government's recklessness with the public
finances is worthy of
emulation.</div><a name="09052148000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Financial Secretary will understand why the Conservatives wish to make
much of the mandate for change, as indeed the Liberal Democrats have.
In spite of its being a popular measure, there is no mandate to change
the tax rates. It is possible that we will have an election before 5
April next year, in which case this is somewhat academic. The Financial
Secretary did not make the same case when he was a young Back Bencher
in opposition from 1994. He was happy not to make that case about 22
Tory tax rises when there was an argument after the 1992 election and
we clearly did breach an election pledge on tax, because of the
terrible economic circumstances when we went into a double-digit
recession during the early 1990s. It was never put from the Labour
Benches at that time that there was an understanding that, given the
economic circumstances, the right thing for the nation, which it
eminently proved 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div>to be in 1993 and 1994, was to put up taxes. Indeed, his Government,
particularly in their first and second terms, reaped the benefits of
that stable economy. It is difficult to look at the issue of the
mandate without saying that there is some force majeure that comes into
play.</div><a name="09052148000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000256"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen
Timms):</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting case. I
wonder whether he thinks there is a difference because the recession in
the early 1990s was home-grown, a consequence of Government policy,
whereas what we are seeing at the moment is the biggest global economic
downturn in 70 years.</div>
<a name="09052148000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000257"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> The right hon. Gentleman makes a well-rehearsed
case. Elements of the recession in the early 1990s were worse than in
other parts of the world. It was a global recession as well, albeit
with a less globalised economy. China and India, for example, were
barely coming out of decades or centuries of relatively quiet economic
activity. In the past 15 years matters have been transformed. Our
argument has been&#151;the proof is in the pudding according to the
International Monetary Fund and other independent global
forecasters&#151;that in many ways we have a more serious situation
simply because we racked up huge debts during a time of plenty and were
not putting reserves aside. I accept that we are in a very different
stage.</div><a name="09052148000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that the Financial Secretary shares with me an interest in
international affairs. It is very evident that we are still at a
relatively early stage of this recession. Only six or seven months ago
there was a sense that we were going to be appallingly badly hit as a
result of our reliance on financial services. But one effect of the
rapid depreciation of the pound has been that we have perhaps got off
slightly more lightly than other countries, such as Germany, which only
six or seven months ago were seen to have a very stable financial
situation with no Government debt. But as the trade situation globally
has imploded, such countries&#146; massive reliance on international
trade has made them more vulnerable to what I would call the second
stage of this
downturn.</div><a name="09052148000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
tactics have been involved, I suspect that my party has been slightly
more soft-pedal on this issue than my hon. Friends the Members for
Wellingborough and for Northampton, South would have liked. However,
there is a sense that we are all in this together. It will take time
for us to get out of the downturn and its effects. I will not make any
suggestions about how I think that the public finances will be
corrected, but clearly, a range of areas of public spending will have
to be seriously considered. Nobody denies that. I know that the retort
from the Labour Benches will be, &#147;Which hospitals and schools
are you going to cut?&#148; However, I suspect that that will land on
deaf ears in the electorate.</div>
<a name="09052148000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even the
Government&#146;s own figures, coupled with their ambitious growth
figures, leave little doubt that public spending rounds for some years
to come will be less generous than they have been over recent years. If
there is to be a slowdown or even cuts in public expenditure, it will
be the less well-off in our communities who suffer the most. There
must, therefore, be a sense that the burden of the overall downturn has
been applied across the board. For that reason, at least in the
immediate term, I suspect that it is unlikely that a Conservative
Government would be in a position to reduce the 50 per cent. tax band,
although we would hope to do so as quickly as possible, as we need to
encourage entrepreneurs.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div><a name="09052148000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
last point is about the importance of the City of London. As a
representative of the City, I hope that we can get it back to a
strongly competitive state. As I mentioned last Tuesday, it is
important to recognise that the City is not made up only of big banks,
but provides a range of other financial services. Many of those have
thrived in recent months and continue to do so because they have
international competitive advantages compared with other parts of the
world.</div>
<a name="09052148000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Insurance is
a tremendously successful sector, and there are many lessons to be
learned from the appalling disasters that beset Lloyd&#146;s only 20
years ago. The setting up of Equitas was an important model for the
ways in which we can get out of many of the problems with our banking
system. Lloyd&#146;s now goes from strength to strength, which is a
great joy to us all.</div>
<a name="09052148000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
are clearly reliant&#151;perhaps in all honesty, slightly
over-reliant&#151;on the financial services industry. A Faustian
bargain was made with our European partners when the big bang took
place in 1986. London was, is, and thankfully for some years to come
will remain, the great European financial centre. That Faustian bargain
probably meant that more industry went out to Germany, agriculture and
other advantages went out to France, although we had the financial
services.</div>
<a name="09052148000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">My instinct
is that financial services will remain important. Even during these
recessionary times, 30 or 40 million people a year in India and China
are joining the middle classes. They are instinctively savers and
investors for the future, and will require financial services products
in order to save in an effective way. In the immediate and the medium
term, the overall cake for financial services will be smaller, and we
must do our best to ensure that London&#146;s slice of it is at least
maintained if not enlarged. Nevertheless, this issue illustrates the
fact that we need to have a slightly more balanced economy. That is not
to say that we do not have strength in other areas&#151;we have
tremendous success in a range of creative industries such as computer
games, where we are global leaders making a terrific amount of
money.</div>
<a name="09052148000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us be
honest&#151;we still have a very successful manufacturing sector. It
is smaller, but it is high resolution and high value-added. In this
world where we expect high wages in the economy, we should thrive on
that and try to ensure that we get the best out of our research and
development. That might be in luxury products&#151;we are going to
get big markets from China and India in the future, with 2.5 billion
people there.</div>
<a name="09052148000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000258"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I hesitate to intervene on the hon.
Gentleman who represents the City, but this is about the higher rate of
tax, not the general economy in this country and on what it depends. I
have been generous&#151;as I always will be&#151;to members of the
Committee, and particularly the hon. Gentleman. Perhaps he would return
to the clause stand part debate and the higher rate of
tax.</div>
<a name="09052148000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000259"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> Sir Nicholas, you have not only been generous, you
have been over-generous. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> I shall
criticise you with great praise, of course. This is perhaps a point at
which I shall bring my comments to a conclusion. I hope that the
Minister takes on board much of what we say. There are grave concerns
about what is being proposed. It appears to us ever more to be a
political rather than an economic measure, and that cannot be good for
this country.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000263"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I called the Member to speak. I am sure that the
hon. Member can make the point in a speech, but
briefly.</div><a name="09052148000190"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="09052148000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000264"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Briefly indeed. First, I thank you, Sir
Nicholas, for that gesture and express my enthusiasm for your
chairmanship, however brief it is. I recall the last session of last
year&#146;s Finance Bill Committee and I can understand your
diffidence in not necessarily volunteering to take charge this
time.</div><a name="09052148000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to depart from my gentle probing of the Opposition on this subject
and state something of my own view, which is actually in sympathy with
some of the arguments expressed. My main reason for supporting this
measure is not that I believe it will deliver any substantial revenues.
The points made that the sums involved will be relatively small are
perfectly reasonable. I see it more in terms of conveying to our nation
the importance of equity in our response to this crisis and of stating
that those who are best off and best able to bear some burdens should
at least contribute some more towards the solutions that we must
find.</div>
<a name="09052148000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000265"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> As always, the hon. Gentleman is making a
thoughtful point. He accepts some of the arguments that this will not
raise huge amounts of revenue and he justifies the increase on the
basis of equity. I understand the point he is making, but does that
argument justify breaking a manifesto pledge? The Government&#146;s
justification is that we are in a financial mess which changes things,
but it does not change the argument over equity in the same way that it
does the argument over the public
finances.</div><a name="09052148000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000266"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> That is a fair challenge. My answer is that the
circumstances could not have been predicted in 2005&#151;certainly
not by me&#151;and I do not think informed economic observers thought
that we would face anything like these circumstances at the time of the
last election. I do not lightly set aside pledges made; but when faced
by facts and evidence one must adapt to the circumstances regardless.
The electorate will shortly have an opportunity to make a judgment on
the realism or otherwise of that argument.</div>
<a name="09052148000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me turn
to the measure itself. Although I do not think that it will produce
substantial revenue, we should ensure that it does no harm. I am
worried&#151;I look forward to the Minister setting my mind at
rest&#151;that in the haste of preparing this measure, little thought
was given to the relative advantages of the various means by which
people might choose to avoid paying. There is a variety of
ways&#151;there have been references to informed newspaper pieces
about what to do if one is hit by this tax. Some have economic
benefits; others have none. Bearing it in mind that our purpose is not
substantially to raise money, we ought to be ensuring that those who
seek advice on how to evade the tax do so in a way that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>is least harmful to our revenues and most beneficial to our economy at
large. We need to look at how to incentivise investment in small
businesses and we shall come later to clauses that will cover that and
the tool sets that are applied to venture capital trusts, enterprise
investment schemes and so on. Worthwhile thought is to be given to how
to ensure that those who are seeking to manage their tax affairs do so
in ways that help our economy and our Exchequer over time, rather than
simply losing that revenue and entrepreneurial spirit to our
country.</div><a name="09052148000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will, of course, support the Government in this for the reason that I
gave, but more thought needs to be given to how we make this change
work. Fortunately, this is a change that will occur in 12
months&#146; time, and there is plenty of
opportunity&#151;</div><a name="09052148000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09052148000267"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): The hon.
Gentleman said that he did not expect the measure to produce much in
the way of revenue. Without an effective dynamic model with cross-party
consensus on its effectiveness, we cannot know for sure what it will
do. The hon. Gentleman suggested that equity made it right. If it lost
the Exchequer money, would equity still trump effectiveness? At which
point would he draw the line? I respect the hon. Gentleman, as do many
on both sides of the House, for his integrity in dealing with these
issues, but on this point he seems to be doing a number of somersaults
in order to support the
Government.</div><a name="09052148000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000268"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> At times like this, I take references to integrity
with care because they are easily trumped. This is a delayed measure.
We are not implementing it this year. If we were, I would have been
rather more forceful in my criticism. We have some time to reflect on
exactly how to design this in a way that does least harm to our
revenues and does most benefit to our economy, or at least loses us
least, to balance the equity effect, which is important. The hon.
Member for Cities of London and Westminster was quite right here;
public perceptions are rather important in this. Most people recognise
that we face an unprecedented crisis, certainly unprecedented in most
people&#146;s lifetimes. Equity is an important dimension. We should
respect that, but we need to make sure that in the design of this we
provide tools that are of value to our economy and our Exchequer over
time, because there are plenty of very expensive people who will be
working on this with great care to ensure that they advise their
clients properly.</div>
<a name="09052148000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000269"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> It is a great pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship again, Sir Nicholas. It is also a great pleasure to follow
the hon. Member for South Derbyshire. He made some good comments and
made the first real defence I have heard for the increase to 50p. Had I
spoken first, my worry would have been that the hon. Gentleman would
rise like a phoenix from the ashes quietly to intervene. It is rather
like the umpire&#146;s finger going up in a cricket match and one
thinks, &#147;Gosh, I am about to be bowled a bouncer here.&#148;
So I am very pleased to have spoken after
him.</div><a name="09052148000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to look at the history of how this has come about and why there is
so much debate. Unfortunately, there is not enough debate from the
Government side. I would have liked to hear more from Government
Members on this issue. But here we are. Clearly Tony Blair made a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div>pledge that income tax rates would not go up. That was signed up to by
every Labour candidate. There has to be a very significant reason to
depart from that. The hon. Gentleman started to make a defence of it,
but I do not believe that it was a strong enough defence. I hope that
it will be put to a vote and that the Government Back Benchers who have
not spoken will call for a Division, because they clearly want to
support their manifesto&#146;s original pledge and vote against the
rise to 50p. Nobody on their side, apart from the hon. Member for South
Derbyshire, has demurred from the
proposal.</div><a name="09052148000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09052148000270"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Greg Hands</b> (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con): By the same
logic, the hon. Member for Taunton should fulfil his party&#146;s
manifesto pledge by voting for the new 50p tax
rate.</div><a name="09052148000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000271"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I know that the hon. Member for Taunton will vote
for the 50p tax rate&#151;it never crossed my mind that he would not.
I was impressed with the contribution made by my hon. Friend the Member
for Cities of London and Westminster, and I agreed with almost
everything that he said. He was wrong on one point, however; there is
not a wafer of difference between myself and my right hon. Friend the
Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) and my hon. Friend the
Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne). I agree entirely with their
analysis; we should fix taxes for the many and not for the few as soon
as we are in power. Other than that one caveat, I agree entirely with
my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and
Westminster.</div><a name="09052148000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South Derbyshire made the case that there was not much
economic merit to the matter under discussion. I warn the
Government&#151;perhaps this will also help them in terms of the next
general election&#151;that, in the past, when Governments have moved
away from their manifesto pledges on tax, disaster has befallen them.
That was true of John Major, for example. A Government should be for
all the people, including the middle classes. That was Tony
Blair&#146;s great success&#151;he realised that Governments need
everybody on board. To turn to a core vote dog-whistling strategy is
very dangerous for the country and for the Government. Whatever happens
at the next election, we want some Labour Members in Parliament to form
an Opposition; it would be very dangerous if we only had Conservative
Members.</div>
<a name="09052148000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the policy
details, I am struggling with the figures in the Red Book. In table
1.2, entitled &#147;Budget 2009 policy decisions&#148;, on page 11,
I think that the 2010-11 figure is the only one that does not include
any assumption of the 45p tax rate, because that rate was already built
into the original forecast. If I am reading the 2010-11 figure
correctly, the increase to 50p in the pound will raise &#163;1.13
billion. I think that that is what the Red Book tells us. As many
members of the Committee have said, that is not a significant amount of
money, and my hon. Friend the Member for Henley has pointed out that we
might lose money elsewhere in the tax programme. I agree with those
analyses. If the figure is &#163;1.13 billion, may I suggest a
pain-free way in which the Government could get rid of the 50p tax rate
without impacting on public spending? In fact, my proposal would enable
the Government to increase public spending on schools and hospitals,
and it would not damage the domestic situation in any way.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div><a name="09052148000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
year&#146;s proposed contributions to the European Union are
&#163;3 billion, and the latest estimate is that they will increase
to &#163;6.5 billion next year, which is an increase of &#163;3.5
billion. Tony Blair said that that would happen only if there was
reform to the common agricultural policy. That has not happened, so the
Government have an easy way of saying that they have found the money
and do not need to implement the 50p tax rate, and none of their Back
Benchers would have to vote against them in the Division that will
follow this debate. It would be a pain-free solution. Furthermore, it
would do the Government an enormous lot of good during the European
Union elections. I hope that my contribution has been helpful and
constructive for the
Government.</div><a name="09052148000088"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000273"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I apologise for jumping in quite so early and am
grateful to the Minister for giving way. I noticed his first
words&#151;&#147;Clause 6 is necessary&#148;. Is clause 6
necessary for the Government to fulfil their stated policy objective of
raising the top rate of income tax to 50p? The new rate is not coming
into effect until next year, so why is it necessary to have clause 6 in
this year&#146;s Finance
Bill?</div><a name="09052148000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000274"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> It is here because it was important to set out in
the Budget how we should achieve the fiscal consolidation required.
That is the announcement that we made in the Budget, and the Bill is
rightly enacting the Budget decisions. If the hon. Gentleman is
suggesting that we should defer the measure until after the election,
my view is that we should not. We should be up front with the British
people in how we shall achieve the consolidation that everyone can now
see is
necessary.</div><a name="09052148000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000275"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful for the reply, but I ask again why
the new rate is necessary in the Bill? If the Government have stated
what their objective is, that is indication enough, is it not? When the
Government say that they will do something, they will do it, surely.
Why is putting the provision into legislation necessary? I do not see
anything in the Finance Bill to raise the level of national insurance
contributions, although I acknowledge that that is a different set-up.
The provision is here for political reasons, and for political reasons
only&#151;there is no need for clause
6.</div><a name="09052148000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000276"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> It is not here for political reasons. It is here so
that the Government have a clearly credible consolidation strategy that
will achieve our objectives over the medium term, as we set out. If the
hon. Gentleman wishes to vote against the clause, he is perfectly
entitled to do so. Indeed, given what we have heard from the
Opposition, at one point I thought that they would vote against it,
although the implications appear to be that that is not the
case.</div><a name="09052148000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09052148000277"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): Part of the problem, although
we talked about it in the context of the 50p rate, is that
the clause did not mention the 50p rate, but an &#147;additional
rate&#148;. We know from the PBR last year that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div>a 45p rate was to be introduced in 2011; in this year&#146;s Budget
the Government said that a 50p rate would be introduced in 2010. Who
knows what the Budget decision will be next year, when the Chancellor
gives his final Budget? We are discussing a clause in which no rate is
defined or set, and we shall not know until next year whether the
Government are prepared to carry through their
commitment.</div><a name="09052148000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000278"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> We shall carry it through. The point that I want to
emphasise to the Committee is the importance of having a clear
strategy, which everyone can see, for fiscal consolidation over the
next few
years.</div><a name="09052148000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000279"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Will the Minister give way on that
point?</div><a name="09052148000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000280"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> No. I shall make a little progress before I give
way again, but I shall look forward very much to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intervention a little
later.</div><a name="09052148000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham gave the Committee a long list
of objections to the clause, but his case is flawed by the fact that he
is not going to vote against clause stand part. If he is not persuaded
by his own arguments, I shall not detain the Committee long responding
to them. However, I shall respond briefly to some of the
arguments.</div><a name="09052148000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
on the estimate of the revenue from the measure, the hon. Gentleman
asked some questions about elasticities and the figures used. The
behavioural estimates that underpin the figures in the Red Book are
based on taxable income elasticities&#151;how much declared income
reduces, for whatever reason, for each percentage point decrease in
post-tax income. We have chosen to use a figure for taxable income
elasticity, as the hon. Gentleman acknowledged, of 0.35. We looked at
all the evidence available for the UK&#151;including the IFS figure
of 0.46, as he said&#151;most of which consists of studies looking at
the 1980s and the 1990s, and at the academic evidence available for a
range of other countries, the USA in
particular.</div><a name="09052148000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000281"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The Financial Secretary seems to be arguing that
the IFS figure of 0.46 is outdated because it was derived from
behavioural observations from the 1980s. However, surely it is far more
likely that higher rate earners will be much more able to avoid tax
today than in the 1980s, due to greater international mobility, the
greater ability to conduct business from a different home country and
the greater ability of such people to tap into expertise in tax and
accounting. For all those reasons, he is surely making the wrong
assumption about behavioural changes in the last 20
years.</div>
<a name="09052148000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000282"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that the
judgment needs to be based on the present circumstances and not those
of previous decades. The Government have taken a number of policy
measures, for example those announced in the 2004 statement by my
predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Dawn
Primarolo)&#151;</div><a name="09052148000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000283"></a>Mr.

<a name="09052148000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000284"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The hon. Gentleman must let me respond to his point
before I give way again. That 2004 statement by my right hon. Friend
was about anti-avoidance measures and the regime requiring
anti-avoidance products 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div>to be disclosed. All those measures are likely to have had a downward
impact on taxable income elasticity in the UK. Also, structural
differences between the tax systems in the US and the UK mean that it
is likely that taxable income elasticity is lower
here.</div>

<a name="09052148000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are having
an interesting debate about who might avoid paying tax. Will my right

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000286"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right to draw the
Committee&#146;s attention to that fundamental point. What we need to
do is support families and households through this difficult time in
the economy&#151;the degree of difficulty is unprecedented&#151;to
maintain investment, in the way that we set out in the Budget. We must
do so to protect the economy, individuals and particularly employment,
which was the highest priority of all in the Budget, to get through the
downturn in the best possible shape&#151;indeed to make the downturn
shorter and shallower than it would otherwise have
been&#151;</div><a name="09052148000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000287"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="09052148000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000288"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> And to protect the nation&#146;s interests in
that
way.</div><a name="09052148000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
resisted the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attempt to intervene earlier, I
feel that I owe it to him to give way now. In fact, it is a pleasure to
do
so.</div><a name="09052148000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000289"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b><b class="B"> </b>In my original attempt to intervene, I was
going to say that if the measure is not necessary, it should not be in
the Bill because that is bad drafting and that would be a real reason
for everyone on this Committee to vote against it.</div>
<a name="09052148000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
intervention now is different. The measure is supposed to protect
employment. Unemployment in my constituency is 84 per cent. higher than
it was when John Major left office. How can the Minister possibly say
that anything the Labour Government do will protect employment in
Wellingborough?</div>
<a name="09052148000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000290"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The record on unemployment is extremely clear, as
the hon. Gentleman knows. The steps that we have taken in the Budget
will be particularly effective in tackling the problem of unemployment.
Perhaps the most important step was the jobs guarantee, which will
ensure that, from next January, anybody under 25 who has been out of
work for 12 months will be guaranteed a job or training place. There is
funding for 100,000 new socially useful jobs, to allow that guarantee
to be discharged.</div>
<a name="09052148000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000291"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> If I may, I want to assist the Minister to answer
the question put by the hon. Member for Crawley, who asked where all
the additional money would go. About &#163;2.75
billion&#151;perhaps as much as &#163;3 billion&#151;of the money
that is raised will go to pay off less than one tenth of the money that
this Government will have to borrow because of the mess and debt that
they have stacked up. That is the true answer. It will only make that
much difference; a tiny element of the borrowing will be paid off on
the debt interest.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div><a name="09052148000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000292"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The measure will yield &#163;6 billion over the
forecast period. Opposition Members may not feel that that is a large
sum, but &#163;6 billion is an important element in our consolidation
of the strategy, which is needed and must be in place in the period
ahead.</div>
<a name="09052148000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000293"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The Minister is most generous in giving way so
often. Can I take him back to the point about the modelling? Going back
to the dispute this week between the Treasury and the IFS about
different rates of tax avoidance, the Minister seems to be saying that
the assumption in the Treasury model is a rate of 0.35 for
those earning more than &#163;150,000. Will he tell us what the
Treasury&#146;s assumption is for the general
population?</div><a name="09052148000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000294"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The measure will not apply to the general
population, but will apply to, as I have emphasised, the
highest-earning 1 per cent. of taxpayers.</div>
<a name="09052148000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000295"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I should explain myself a little more clearly. I
talked about the matter at some length in my contribution on
Tuesday.</div><a name="09052148000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000296"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Not long
enough.</div><a name="09052148000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000297"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> It
obviously was not
clear.</div><a name="09052148000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000298"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> It may have been unclear&#151;or perhaps not
great in clarity. I think the point made by the IFS is that the 0.35
ratio is roughly the same rate that is used for the general population.
Why should higher earners be held to have exactly the same propensity
to avoid tax as the general population, when precisely the opposite
appears to be the
case?</div><a name="09052148000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000299"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The figure that the IFS suggested, to which the
hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham referred to in his lengthy
contribution the other day, was 0.46, which is an elasticity, rather
than a rate. However, the IFS acknowledged in its report of
20 April that that is a tentative estimate. It also made it
clear that the estimate was subject to uncertainty about the extent to
which growth in top incomes was due to structural changes rather than
tax reductions. The assessment made by our experts is that 0.35 is the
right figure to
use.</div><a name="09052148000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000300"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I am extremely grateful to the Minister for giving
way; he has been astonishingly generous. Will he share with us what the
range of estimates is? The Treasury must have picked an elasticity
figure to go on, and I am interested to know what were the risk
factors, what were the lowest figures given in Treasury advice to
Ministers, what was the smallest elasticity attributed to that highly
mobile, high-earning group, and what was the greatest
elasticity&#151;the greatest risk. Secondly, given the importance of
the matter, will the Minister share the advice that was given to allow
the general public to have a better understanding of the impact? Like
the hon. Member for Crawley, I am concerned about the impact on public
services, on which ordinary people in my constituency
depend.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div><a name="09052148000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000301"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> We produced not a range, but a figure for the
modelling to be carried out, and that figure was, as I have said, 0.35.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am grateful to Opposition
Members for their acknowledgment of my extreme generosity, but I must
make a little more progress before I give way again.</div>
<a name="09052148000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
talking about &#163;6 billion being raised in the first three years
of the measure, which is an important contribution to consolidation. It
is right that that part of the consolidation comes from those most able
to pay, rather than hitting those on low or middle incomes. There is an
important dimension of fairness, and 98 per cent. of taxpayers will not
be affected by the
measure.</div><a name="09052148000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the changes that we will make to national insurance contributions as
part of the consolidation, which was also mentioned in the debate, we
raised national insurance because it is broad based. The changes will
apply to employees, the self-employed and employers, spreading the
burden across the economy and across all sectors. It will protect those
who do not pay national insurance, including those who rely on savings
and those of state pension age.</div>
<a name="09052148000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000302"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful that the Minister is maintaining his
reputation for his generosity. When will we see some legislation
implementing the increases in national insurance contributions, on the
basis that his argument is that we need to show&#151;to use his
phrase&#151;a credible fiscal
consolidation?</div><a name="09052148000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000303"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Separate legislation will be needed because that
measure cannot be set out in the Finance Bill. Those responsible for
the legislative programme will set out the details at the appropriate
time.</div><a name="09052148000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000304"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Will the right hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="09052148000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000305"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am not in a position to make any announcements on
that subject today, but I will of course give way again to the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="09052148000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000306"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s comment
about how that will be done at the appropriate time, but will it be in
this parliamentary Session? Given that he is so anxious to set out
legislation that demonstrates a credible approach to the fiscal crisis,
why have we got one measure now, but the national insurance
contributions stuff perhaps after the
elections?</div><a name="09052148000192"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="09052148000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000307"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> We have the income tax measure now because we have
the Finance Bill, in which it appropriately sits. I am sorry to
disappoint the hon. Gentleman, but as I have said, I am not able to
make an announcement on national insurance
legislation.</div><a name="09052148000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had an interesting debate. We have discussed the important subject
of the UK&#146;s international competitiveness and carefully
considered the impacts both on individuals and on the UK economy. Our
conclusion is that with the 50 per cent. rate the UK will continue to
be a competitive place for business, with a tax burden that compares
well internationally. I referred on Tuesday to the international
benchmarking work that has been done on that subject. We have taken the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div>lead in announcing our future plans for fiscal consolidation, which is
part of the boldness to which the International Monetary Fund paid
tribute in its report yesterday. We have been absolutely right to do
that, and other countries are also considering ways of doing it, most
notably the
USA.</div><a name="09052148000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
enjoyed the comments made by hon. Member for Cities of London and
Westminster, but I say to him that the US budget has proposed taxes on
high-income Americans totalling some $637 billion over the next
10 years. I enjoyed attending the reception for the City of
London that he hosted on Tuesday evening in the House, and I remain
confident&#151;he affirmed this as well&#151;that the City and the
UK as a whole will continue to be strongly competitive in the years
ahead.</div><a name="09052148000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000308"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Does the right hon. Gentleman believe that high
earners in the UK are a more internationally mobile group than those in
the United States? Comparisons are often made between this country and
Sweden, which has a higher tax rate. Does he accept that if an economy
depends on internationally mobile people to a larger extent, greater
care has to be taken with the higher tax
levels?</div><a name="09052148000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000309"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> There certainly is a competitive world market for
talent; we need to factor that into our considerations, and we have
done so. On that basis, we are confident that the measure is the right
one. The 50p tax rate has a job to do. It will make an important
contribution to the medium-term fiscal consolidation of the
economy.</div>
<a name="09052148000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for South Derbyshire was right to highlight the
concern about fairness. The question has been asked whether the measure
will be permanent or temporary. The fiscal consolidation that we need
will take some time, as the Red Book set out. All I can say to the
Committee about that is that we will, of course, keep all taxes under
review.</div><a name="09052148000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham has also made some important
comments on the trust rate of tax and concerns about the effect of the
changes to the trust rate on vulnerable people and those on low
incomes; he also referred to dividend taxation. The trust rate of tax
will be increased in line with the higher rate of income tax of 50 per
cent. to prevent people from using trusts to benefit from the
difference between the trust rate of tax and the additional rate of
income tax. However, income paid to beneficiaries who receive income
from discretionary or accumulation trusts carries a credit at the trust
rate, which from 2010 will be 50 per cent., so those who do not pay
income tax of 50 per cent. will be able to set the tax credit against
their total chargeable income and claim back any surplus income tax, as
they can now. The standard rate band also taxes the first &#163;1,000
of trust income from a discretionary trust at only 20 per cent., which
benefits a large number of small trusts, as many of them have income
under that
figure.</div><a name="09052148000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman mentioned in particular the special tax regime that
applies to vulnerable beneficiaries. Those rules, including the
definition of disability, were consulted on in detail during the trust
modernisation programme, which ran between 2003 and 2006. The special
tax regime is for trusts used by vulnerable people who are unable to
look after their financial affairs. More general support for disabled
people is provided 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div>elsewhere in the tax and benefits system. I understand his point that
the definition of disability is a sensitive issue and that the
understanding of what constitutes disability is continually evolving.
Officials have recently discussed with groups such as the Disability
Benefits Consortium the definition of disability in relation
to
trusts.</div><a name="09052148000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000310"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> That is an important point. The Minister has
confirmed that he has been in discussions with the DBC, but my
information is that it remains unsatisfied with the set of provisions.
Can he confirm that that is correct? What is his impression from the
discussions he has had with the DBC and the Low Income Tax Reform
Group?</div><a name="09052148000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000311"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I can confirm that those discussions are continuing
and have not yet reached a conclusion. I have no doubt that those
groups will continue to press their case. The issue is not the rate of
tax ultimately paid, but whether it is necessary for reclaims to be
made against the higher rate of tax. That is an important question, so
those discussions will
continue.</div><a name="09052148000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman claimed that the additional dividend rate would
discourage investment in equities. The tax rate is to be 42.5 per
cent., which is 10 percentage points above the existing higher rate on
dividends, so matching the changes to the income tax main rate to keep
things as straightforward as possible. I put it to him that the changes
strike the right balance between raising revenue as fairly as possible
and encouraging wealth creation. No only are dividend rates lower than
the tax rates on other income, but they are reduced further by the
dividend tax credit available to almost all investors. The existing
credit will remain in place and at the same size&#151;one ninth of
the value of the dividend&#151;which encourages investment by
individuals and reflects the fact that tax has already been paid by the
company.</div><a name="09052148000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000312"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> May I come back to the intervention I wanted to
make earlier, which was about the Chancellor&#146;s comments on the
justification for the 50p rate? In an interview with the<i class="I"> Daily Mail
</i>on 23 April he said that he would be calling on people with higher
earnings</div>
<a name="09052148000187"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to contribute a
bit more while we resolve this
situation.&#148;</div><a name="09052148000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that it is difficult for the Minister to say when the
situation will be resolved, but can he at least tell us to which
situation the Chancellor was referring? Was he talking about the
financial crisis or the position of our public finances and the ongoing
budget
deficit?</div><a name="09052148000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000313"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> He was speaking about the need for a period of
consolidation. As I said a few moments ago, the consolidation will take
some time to be concluded, as we set out in the Red Book. Our
assessment in the Budget is that the public finances will be back in
balance by the later part of the coming
decade.</div><a name="09052148000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000314"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> If the rate is to be increased to 50p until the
situation is resolved and the Minister anticipates that it will be
resolved around the later part of the decade&#151;I do not know
whether he is referring to 2017 or 2018&#151;when the Government
project they will have a balanced budget again, is he saying, without
making a commitment, that the broad intention would be to lower or
abolish the higher rate and return it to the current 40p rate? Is that
what the Government have in mind?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000315"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am saying that my right hon. Friend the
Chancellor will make assessments of the right rates of tax in each
Budget. The hon. Gentleman no doubt envisages my right hon. Friend
making that assessment again in 2017, and he is probably right about
that. The Chancellor will make the assessment at the
time.</div><a name="09052148000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to respond to a couple of points made by other hon. Members in the
debate before I conclude. The hon. Member for Henley was concerned that
the VAT impacts were not accounted for, but they are, in the normal
way. The economic forecast reflects the 50p rate&#151;the
rate was input into the Treasury model; the economic forecast was the
output of that and VAT receipts were then computed in the normal
way.</div><a name="09052148000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster made the point, which
others have made, about how diversion into capital gains could be more
attractive. Differentials between tax on capital and income are not new
in the UK tax system. In the 1970s we had a substantial gap and it has
been a familiar feature of the UK tax system, which is why the statute
book contains a significant amount of anti-avoidance legislation.
Indeed, clause 49 has further provisions, so that can be dealt with as
well.</div><a name="09052148000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000316"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="09052148000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000317"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> No, I shall now conclude. By way of summary, the
Government have thought carefully about how the further money required
for the consolidation should be raised. It is right that those who are
in the best position to do so should be asked to make a contribution,
which is what clause 6
achieves.</div><a name="09052148000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000318"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> On a point of order, Sir
Nicholas.</div><a name="09052148000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000319"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I shall take it, but I cannot think what the
point of order is. I shall listen and judge
accordingly.</div><a name="09052148000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000320"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> It is the convention that income tax rates are set
on an annual basis for the year ahead. Despite the Minister being
pressed, we have had no justification for the necessity of the clause
or what its legislative effect is. Sir Nicholas, can you advise me
whether the clause would therefore appear to be fairly harmless and to
have no impact, and could therefore be enacted next year? Is it
appropriate that such a clause is included in the Bill, when it does
not appear to have any legislative
effect?</div><a name="09052148000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000321"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The answer to the final part of the question, in
my opinion, is yes. It appears to me, and I have taken a little advice,
that the clause deals with setting a framework for a higher rate of
tax. The level of that tax can be set in a future Budget. I hope that
that deals with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point of order. I
understand his point and clearly there is some confusion. The clause,
in my estimation and on the advice that I have taken, is the setting of
a top rate of tax, without specifying that top rate of tax, which could
come in future
legislation.</div><a name="09052148000154"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000322"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am permitting a debate on the schedule,
although the broad idea and the content were discussed in the last
debate and on the Floor of the House. However, the hon. Member for
Hammersmith and Fulham wishes to deal with some technicalities and this
is the right
opportunity.</div><a name="09052148000193"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000323"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Some important technical issues arise from the way
in which schedule 2 amends the Income Tax Act 2007. They stem from the
decision to add the definition of the higher rate limit or the new
additional rate of tax to section 10 of the Act, rather than to section
20. Section 20 defines the starting rate and basic rate limits, which
are not defined under section 10. I think that the Government are
amending the wrong section of the 2007
Act.</div><a name="09052148000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, paragraph 9 of schedule 2 alters the definition of the
&#147;basic rate limit&#148; under schedule 4 to the 2007 Act so
that it now refers to section 10, even though the limit remains
specified under section 20, not section 10. Paragraph 4 of the schedule
tries to amend subsection (6) of section 10 of the 2007 Act
when&#151;to judge from a copy of the 2007 Act that I printed from
the website of the Office of Public Sector Information&#151;there is
no subsection (6) of section 10. I should be grateful for clarification
from the Government. In my copy of the Act, the section ends at
subsection (5) not subsection (6), so I am confused about precisely
what is being
amended.</div><a name="09052148000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
6 of schedule 2 adds the higher rate limit to the scope of section 414,
but leaves the parenthesis referring to section 20 alone rather than
including section 10, where it seems to be more appropriate. In other
words, if schedule 2, which will amend the 2007 Act, is to have
validity, it should refer to both sections 20 and 10. Those are
important points, and it is necessary to have this slightly separate
debate so that such matters do not get lost in the overall political
discussion about the 50p tax rate. For the sake of tidiness, the
Minister might want to consider specifying all the limits under one
section because, at the moment, it seems that the parliamentary
draftsman had a little change of heart and left a few loose ends in the
important provision that amends the 2007
Act.</div>
<a name="09052148000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000324"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The hon. Gentleman has raised an interesting and
thoughtful point. I reassure him that the drafting is technically
right. Section 20 of the 2007 Act was repealed by the Finance Act 2008,
which was passed after the 2007 legislation to which he
referred.</div><a name="09052148000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000325"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I was hoping that the Minister would answer my
question about subsection (6). It does not appear to be in the Act, yet
it is being amended by the schedule. How can that take
place?</div><a name="09052148000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000326"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> As I said, I reassure the hon. Gentleman that the
drafting is technically right. I would be happy to drop him a line on
that specific point and, indeed, copy my response to each member of the
Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div><a name="09052148000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000327"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> On a point of order, Sir Nicholas. Excuse my lack
of familiarity with the situation&#151;I do not come from a legal
background&#151;but surely we cannot just accept an undertaking that
the drafting is correct when we are referring to a subsection that does
not exist. Perhaps we could adjourn so that the Government can come
back with a correct explanation of the whereabouts of the relevant
subsection (6) in the 2007 Act that the schedule is supposed
to be
amending.</div><a name="09052148000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000328"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I will attempt to help the hon. Gentleman a little
further. I am at a slight disadvantage because I do not have the same
piece of paper in front of me that he has in front of him. I think that
he was describing the 2007 legislation that he had copied
off the internet. The whole of section 20 of that Act was repealed by
the Finance Act
2008.</div><a name="09052148000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000329"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The Minister says that section 20 was repealed, but
the relevant subsection (6) is part of section 10, not section 20. Is
the right hon. Gentleman saying that section 10 has been repealed? If
it really has been repealed, whatever happened to subsection (6) of the
section that was
repealed?</div><a name="09052148000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000330"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I have difficulty as the hon. Gentleman is
referring to the 2007 Act, which does not reflect the amendments made
under last year&#146;s Finance Act. If he had in front of him a
version of the legislation, together with all of the amendments made
under last year&#146;s Finance Act, he would see that the drafting
was indeed technically
correct.</div><a name="09052148000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000331"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I hope that the Minister is right, but I took the
copy of the Act from the OPSI website. Perhaps as a result of this
discussion he might ensure that that website is updated immediately, if
he is right about the amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 resulting
from last year&#146;s Finance Act. Obviously a number of us are
looking at something that is out of date.</div>
<a name="09052148000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000332"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I sit on the Joint Committee on Statutory
Instruments. Only yesterday we reviewed regulations relating in part to
this Bill. There were potential errors that needed correction, so the
Minister should be careful when saying that all the drafting is correct
on
this.</div><a name="09052148000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000333"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. We
are now awaiting an answer from the Minister and also an undertaking
that the OPSI website will be updated with due
speed.</div><a name="09052148000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000334"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I do not know whether the Minister wishes
to reply, but I have just had whispered in my ear, &#147;It&#146;s
a website thing.&#148; May I suggest that the Minister seeks to
clarify that and perhaps then we can move
on?</div><a name="09052148000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052148000335"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> If the hon. Gentleman looks at last year&#146;s
Finance Act on the same website and takes account of the changes that
made to the draft that he has in front of him, he will get the answer
to his questions.</div>
