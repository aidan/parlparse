<H4><center>FINANCIAL SERVICES OMBUDSMAN SCHEME</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed: No. 681, in page 224, line 13, leave out `Part' and insert `Act'.—[Miss Melanie Johnson.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> It would be helpful if the Minister could briefly explain what the amendment consists of because I have not had a chance to examine it carefully.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> That is a shocking revelation. I shall help the hon. Gentleman out—I just need to find my glasses because they will help me to help him out.
<P>
Schedule 14 makes further provision for the structure of the scheme that is established under part XV. It creates the framework around which the constitution of the scheme operator can be built and puts in place several requirements to which the scheme must adhere.
<P>
The role of the chief ombudsman is not spelt out in detail in the schedule, which simply requires the scheme operator to appoint a member of the panel of ombudsmen as chief ombudsman. His duty will be determined by the scheme operator and that body corporate's constitution.
<P>
The schedule makes additional provision for the panel of ombudsmen. A panel must be appointed by the scheme operator, and the chief ombudsman is taken from the panel. The ombudsmen on the panel must be independent of industry and the parties to complaints. The provision does not mean that the ombudsmen should be independent of one another. 
<P>
The amendment is a minor drafting point. As paragraph 2(1) is drafted, it is not clear whether the word ``Part'' refers to part II of the schedule or to part XV of the Bill. The amendment uses the word ``Act'' to avoid that problem. That does not widen the provision; the only provisions that relate to the scheme are those under part XV and schedule 14 to that part.
<P>
I hope that all hon. Members will be happy to accept this simple amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 682, in page 224, line 27, leave out sub-paragraph (4).
<P>
The amendment has been tabled because the inclusion of the current provision is not appropriate. The scheme operator is a body corporate and a Companies Act company. The Bill provides for the scheme operator to have a constitution, which is set out in its memorandum and articles of association.
<P>
The formulation in the paragraph is commonly used in relation to statutory entities that are not corporate bodies and whose powers are circumscribed entirely by the terms of the statute that confers functions on them. That is to ensure that those powers are wide enough.
<P>
Although statutory functions are conferred on the scheme operator, its vires should be set out in its constitution, to the extent that that constitution is not in conflict with the statutory provisions. Assuming that the scheme operator's constitution allows it to do what is described in paragraph 3(4), that will clearly not be incompatible with its duties under the Bill. There is therefore no need for a further statutory power.
<P>
We have chosen to delete the provision rather than to replace it, because the scheme operator does not need a specific provision to enable it to discharge its functions. If the FSA does not equip operators with such powers it will have failed to discharge the duty that paragraph 2(1) of schedule 14 will impose on it.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> This is an opportune moment to invite the Economic Secretary to clarify the structure of the scheme operator in company terms. We learned details not from her but from Mr. Walter Merricks, who is, in a sense, the shadow chief ombudsman—I use the word ``shadow'' to mean not being in opposition but awaiting full statutory powers. The Government told us that in effect there will be a board of directors with a chairman, Mr. Whittam Smith, and several directors. The ombudsman will therefore be the chief executive. That is a slightly unusual position for someone who is usually a quasi-judicial figure. I am not sure whether that is the right structure. To what extent will the ombudsman hold all the quasi-judicial powers? Will they be delegated to deputy ombudsmen or to any of the ombudsman's 320 to 400 employees, who will carry out their various functions under the scheme? The Economic Secretary's explanation of the situation would be useful and it would serve as the background to some points that we want to raise later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Economic Secretary illustrate some of the powers that it was thought the scheme operator might exercise under paragraph 3(4) that she now feels would be inappropriate?
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I was hoping that my hon. Friend would ask about the powers in paragraph 3(4). Will those powers be subject to statutory and parliamentary control, or will the articles of association of the company be involved? If so, the company could change the powers at will. Would not that reduce the amount of statutory and parliamentary supervision?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend—that thought had not occurred to me, although I hope that the Economic Secretary will respond to it. Although that question was more interesting, I was trying to ask a different question, which I should finish. The amendment appears to curtail the powers of the scheme operator by ensuring that he or she must exercise his or her powers within the parameters that are detailed in schedule 14. Are the Government withdrawing the general enabling clause because they can conceive of some powers that might have been exercised in that context that they now find to be unappealing? I hope that the Economic Secretary will illustrate some of those powers, but not all of them.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Sadly, the hon. Gentleman will find that my powers of illustration are not good—any of my school art teachers would inform him of that. I shall do my best to answer his question in a moment.
<P>
I need some guidance on how widely you wish to allow us to take the debate at this stage, Mr. Malins.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> It would be helpful if we could stick to the amendments for the time being and discuss schedule 14 in detail during a later stand part debate. There are some crucial issues that are not covered by debates on amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that we are dealing with amendment No. 682 to schedule 14, the wording of which is as plain as a pikestaff on the amendment paper. I shall rule out of order any matters that are brought up in the debate that are out of order. Subject to that, we can proceed. So far, I am content with what I have heard, and it is of course a matter for the Minister what she chooses to answer.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Malins.
<P>
I turn to the point that was made by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire about the relationship of the chief ombudsman to the corporate body. As we established earlier this evening, we are talking about a company limited by guarantee. The constitution is set out in part II of schedule 14. The chief ombudsman is not the chief executive; he is appointed by the scheme operator.
<P>
Paragraph 15(2)(e) allows the scheme rules to delegate matters, short of actually determining disputes, to staff members.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I was interested to hear the Minister say that the constitution of a company limited by guarantee is set out in part 11 of schedule 14, because I would have thought that it would be set out in its memorandum and articles. I have never heard of a company limited by guarantee whose memorandum and articles are substituted by parts of a schedule in an Act. Perhaps I am learning something new, but I would be grateful for some clarification on that point.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> To point out the obvious, the constitution is set out here. I cannot comment at this stage on the right hon. and learned Gentleman's remarks about what is usual in such circumstances. We are on relatively unusual territory, discussing a singular set of circumstances. Under the arrangements that we envisage, the constitution is indeed outlined in the schedule. Obviously, it will also be set out in more detail in memorandums and articles of association.
<P>
The scheme does not need this power; its constitution will allow it to do all the necessary and conducive things that it has to do. It is possible that the scheme could argue that it could do more than what is set out in its constitution, under the separate provision of paragraph 3(4), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The powers of the scheme operator include power to do anything which is necessary for, or incidental or conducive to, the performance of functions conferred on it by or under this Act.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under paragraph 3(4), the scheme operator will have the power to do anything that it feels to be conducive or necessary—for example, buying furniture, hiring cleaning staff, renting property to accommodate staff or providing a canteen or other facilities for staff. It will be able to do all that under its constitutional powers in the memorandum and articles.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am sorry, but I have not understood the Minister's answer. I asked what I hoped was a fairly straightforward question. The discretionary power is being removed from the scheme operator. He will be left with more clearly circumscribed powers. What general powers do the Government envisage that the scheme operator might have exercised under sub-paragraph (4) which he can no longer exercise?
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The schedule indicates some key features, that the constitution of the scheme should have. Its actual constitution will be determined by the memorandum and articles. The hon. Gentleman has taken to gesticulating wildly in a bizarre manner. I cannot help him really. The position is similar to that which the FSA has under schedule 1.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> No. As I said, the position is similar to that which the FSA has under schedule 1, so the position with regard to its constitution and its memorandum and articles is comparable.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I do not think what the Minister is saying is accurate. I do not mean that she is misleading the Committee but she may be wrong The amendment would remove the power of the scheme operator to perform
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``functions conferred on it by or under this Act''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The sort of function that may be conferred on it by or under this Bill may be exceptional, so how will a company that is limited by guarantee, and does not have power specifically under the Bill, be able to do unusual things? I anticipate that we shall be putting the sub-paragraph back on Report because when we have gone through the Bill a little further, we shall find that it is necessary.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The FSA must equip the operator with powers. If it does not do so, it will have failed to discharge the duty imposed on it by paragraph 2(1) of schedule 14. The FSA will have the requisite powers.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> That seems very unlikely. Paragraph 2(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Authority must establish a body corporate to exercise the functions conferred on the scheme operator by or under this Part.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister's answer simply begs the question. We must look further to see what functions are conferred on the scheme operator by or under this part.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am not clear what point the right hon. and learned Gentleman is making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The Minister was about to move on to answer my question, but she sat down. I have risen only to give her the opportunity to take another look at the note that has come her way, in the hope that I might find out what it says.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is asking for most unreasonable things now. He remarked on the need or otherwise for paragraph 3(4). There is no need for paragraph 3(4) because the scheme has the same discretion under its constitution. There is no reduction in the powers by deleting paragraph 3(4).
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> In that case, will the Minister explain what was meant by this otiose piece of drafting? There seems to have been a bit of bungling by parliamentary draftsmen, leading us all to be detained here at 8.30 pm to correct their mistakes. Is my interpretation right?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I do not wish to comment on the work of the parliamentary draftsmen. However, I said initially that the provision was not needed, which is why we propose to delete it, so the hon. Gentleman is at least partly right.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 683, in page 225, line 9, leave out paragraph 6.
<P>
Schedule 14 includes provision for deputy ombudsmen. Consultation with the ombudsman scheme revealed that there is no need for an extra group of ombudsmen to be included, as there is already provision for a panel of ombudsmen. The constitution of the scheme should allow for different levels of ombudsmen, should that be thought necessary. Amendment No. 683 therefore removes an extraneous provision, deleting the category of deputy ombudsman from the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I want to add only a little to the point that I made in connection with Government amendment No. 682.
<P>
It is extraordinary that so many aspects of the Bill require fundamental change. Here is yet another provision that the Minister has described as extraneous, suggesting that it should be removed. There has been a measure of consensus on the Bill. We are trying to work together on it, and it has been carried over from one Session to the next. The Government have not been under immense pressure on it, so I cannot understand why so many basic amendments are detaining us at this time of night.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> My question arises in relation to paragraph 1.10 of consultation paper 33, which states that the FSOS board will be responsible for appointing the panel of ombudsmen, including the chief ombudsmen. That suggests that there are two levels of ombudsmen. If so, presumably the second level has something of the nature of a deputy ombudsman. What will be the authority of those who are appointed if paragraph 6 is removed from the schedule? I asked that in the first intervention that I made in relation to schedule. However, it did not come to the Minister's mind when she replied to my other questions. Perhaps now is the moment to ask it again.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will listen, as I have just explained exactly why we do not think it necessary to include paragraph 6 in the schedule. There is a panel of ombudspeople, which allows for different levels of ombudspeople, should that be thought to be necessary. Given that provision, we do not need a provision specifically for ombudsmen or deputy ombudsmen.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment proposed: No. 726, in page 225, line 38, after `may' insert `charge for it or'—[Miss Melanie Johnson.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Minister explain briefly the purpose of the amendment?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The amendment—
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> No.
<P>
Paragraph 9, as drafted, throws doubt on whether the scheme operator could charge for any information or guidance that it chooses to publish. The amendment makes it clear that it is at the discretion of a scheme operator whether to charge for publications or to distribute them freely.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Clearly, this is a point of policy. We know that the consumer incurs no charge for making a complaint to the chief ombudsman or the system as a whole. One would therefore have anticipated that there would be no charge for guidance on how to deal with the matter. The amendment appears to throw that in doubt. Before the amendment is accepted, will the Minister say what kind of things will and will not incur a charge?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We would not expect a scheme operator to charge for leaflets giving guidance to members of the public. Clearly, a scheme operator would not be able to publicise itself if it charged for such information—people are not likely to pay for leaflets that they might pick up at a bank. We would also not expect a scheme operator to charge firms for a copy of the scheme rules or a handbook. However, if the publication in question were a digest, which a firm could choose to receive regularly it would be possible for the scheme operator to charge a subscription fee. That should provide an indication of the approach.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment proposed: No. 684, in page 227, line 5, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) provide for the reference of a complaint, in specified circumstances and with the consent of the complainant, to another body with a view to its being determined by that body instead of by an ombudsman;'.—[Miss Melanie Johnson.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Amendment No. 684 blows a hole in part of the ombudsman scheme It states that the ombudsman may, in specified circumstances and with the consent of the complainant, decide not to deal with the matter himself but offer it to another body with a view to its being determined by that body instead of by him. As I understood it, once a matter had been referred to an ombudsman and he was dealing with it, that matter would stay with the ombudsman, and the procedures that we have discussed would apply. The amendment is therefore quite a substantial change to this part of the Bill. I was surprised that the Minister attempted to move it formally, without any explanation to the Committee of the change. Before I comment further, will the Minister explain why the Government have introduced the amendment?
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I, too, would like to know that. However, I think that there is a more troubling question. The amendment provides for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the reference of a complainant, in specified circumstances and with the consent of the complainant, to another body''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not say whether the person complained against will have any say in the matter. Presumably, the person complained against will be an authorised person or someone on the provider side of the industry. Although we have certain criticisms of the scheme that we shall return to in relation to article 6, it seems rather surprising that a scheme establishing a carefully crafted ombudsman system which is basically set out to be balanced and fair is, under this apparently innocent little amendment, capable of being hived off at the will of the ombudsman and the complainant to a body that is wholly unspecified, without regard to the views of the member of the industry concerned.
<P>
I am sure that there is good reason for putting that provision in the Bill, but it requires careful explanation, and we look forward to hearing that explanation in the light of what at present seems an imbalance.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The ombudsman scheme that we envisage will need the provision outlined in the amendment if a complainant comes to it who would be better investigated by the pension ombudsman or another scheme. At present, paragraph 15(2) of schedule 14 sets out a list of conditions on which the scheme can dismiss a complaint. The fact that another scheme may be better placed to consider a complaint is not a feature in that list.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked for an explanation which I am trying to give, and I think it would be more helpful if I gave it.
<P>
The fact that the scheme can pass on complaints does not mean that it should do so if it is the best scheme to consider the complaint. If it were to start passing complaints to other schemes as a matter of course, it would not fulfil the duties placed on it by the Bill, and the FSA would also be in breach of its duty to set up an effective dispute resolution scheme.
<P>
We realise that the scheme has been set up to be a one-stop shop, and that is as it should be. However, we must be realistic. Each scheme has to have boundaries, and it will not be able to deal with some disputes to the best of its ability, or possibly at all. The provision in the amendment means that the scheme can pass a complaint to another scheme rather than send it back to the complainant. The amendment requires the scheme to obtain the consent of a complainant before passing on the complaint; the scheme will have to give a reason why it cannot consider the complaint or why it is not best placed to do so. In that way, the scheme will be better able to serve consumers to ensure that they get the best possible advice and to try to present a seamless service between itself and the other schemes.
<P>
Opposition Members will be well aware of the sort of problems that the amendment is designed to deal with, because, as constituency Members, we all regularly come across situations in which something has perhaps not gone to the best body to deal with it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am sorry, but I am not well aware of that, despite 20 years as a constituency Member. The only example that the Minister gave was that such a matter might go to the Personal Investment Authority ombudsman. I am afraid that I shall reveal my ignorance—I was under the impression that the PIA ombudsman would be subsumed into the scheme under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The pensions ombudsman.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I see.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I was astonished by the Minister's suggestion that such a matter might go to the pension ombudsman because, clearly, the ombudsman has no responsibilities in that field. Therefore, how on earth could that be relevant? We do not need a clause in the Bill for the ombudsman to say that a complaint for which he is not responsible should be passed straight on to the person who is.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention, because he raises a point that will help the Minister and those advising her. It sounds as though that is the kind of example that people have in mind, and which undercuts the structure of the Bill. The matter ought to be considered differently.
<P>
I thought that matters might, for example, be passed to the small claims court as another adjudicating body or to private arbitration. The Minister will recognise—and I would like her comments on the issue—that the wording is completely open ended. The amendment says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``with the consent of the complainant, to another body with a view to its being determined by that body instead of by an ombudsman''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What that means, in an open-ended way, is that the member of the industry complained about—who is not consulted and who has no veto on the matter—could find the complaint passed to a body that he finds entirely unattractive and be without means of redress. That body might be unattractive not because it was malign but because it was not experienced, lacking an understanding of the industry's views. It would require more time and trouble to explain the general structure of the industry to that body than it would to the experts who will be appointed as ombudsmen under the scheme.
<P>
That is an example of flexibility being taken too far. Opposition Members have had to say repeatedly, with the objective of achieving better legislation, that there are risks in giving total flexibility on every point to every body that has power. Enormous discretionary power is given to the Treasury and to the FSA. Now, we find that enormous discretionary power is to be exercised in an imbalanced way—with the consent of one side but not the other—by the scheme operator.
<P>
The schedule has not been properly explained. The only example given is of the pensions authority and that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester has rightly noted, may be a suspect example. The Minister will explain, and I hope that I have spoken long enough for her to have been given guidance on that matter; as to my other points, I look forward to an answer.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have already answered those points, but I shall run through them again for the right honourable and learned Gentleman's sake, in the hope that I can make it clearer a second time.
<P>
The scheme and the FSA must fulfil the duties placed on them by establishing an effective dispute resolution scheme that obviously meets the needs of relevant complainants. I remind the right hon. and learned Gentleman that the Personal Investment Authority ombudsman deals with the sale of personal pensions; the pensions ombudsman, whom I gave as an example, deals with the different situation of occupational pensions.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> No, I would like to finish my explanation.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am happy to give way whenever the right hon. and learned Gentleman asks a question. However, he does not allow me to give an answer; he always returns with a further question. I hope that he will allow me to finish my answer; given the rules of debate in Standing Committees, he is free to respond.
<P>
Complaints will not often be passed to other bodies. However, the provision may come into effect in some cases, such as those involving hybrid complaints. For example, a complaint made by a consumer who was advised to pay into an occupational pension scheme that turned out to be unsuitable would fall under the jurisdiction of the pensions ombudsman, but the financial services ombudsman scheme could investigate a complaint about the advice that was given. Both might need to be involved. If it is better for the complaint to be expedited by the ombudsman or the scheme, they should be drawn into dealing with it appropriately rather than sending it back to the complainant, which is what the amendment avoids.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I would like clarification on why the pensions ombudsman does not come under financial services legislation. What statutory framework does the pensions ombudsman come under that is not included in the provision?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Selling pensions will be a regulated activity. The Bill's ombudsman scheme overlaps the pension ombudsman on occupational pensions. The amendment allows the scheme to carry forward arrangements that deal with potential overlap.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> When we discussed the previous two amendments that deleted paragraphs that had been rendered otiose or superfluous, we were given the clear impression that the parliamentary draftsman was at fault.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Parliamentary draftsmen are seldom at fault; it is their instructions that are usually wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am only going on the impression that was given. It appears that the parliamentary draftsman has produced an amendment that is either otiose or defective.
<P>
In response to my right hon. and learned Friend, the Minister said that the amendment would apply to pensions issues delegated to someone else. As I tried to make clear in an intervention, I cannot understand why that situation would arise. We have a separate pensions ombudsman who deals with separate territory. An ombudsman is not going to initiate a case on something over which he has no jurisdiction. I cannot understand why we would waste time by covering that in the Bill, which is why I agreed with my right hon. and learned Friend's suggestion that we must be discussing another body. I wracked my brains to think what that could be. He mentioned the small claims court, but I am not sure that the Minister knows what it is, although I hope that she finds out before we finish dealing with the amendment.
<P>
Let us suppose that circumstances exist in which the ombudsman might hand over jurisdiction to another body. That raises several questions. First, what is the other body to be if it does not have a clear and well-understood remit, such as that of the pensions ombudsman? Secondly, what are the specified circumstances? Should we leave that vague phrase in the Bill? No one will be able to understand what it means, and it has an extraordinary scope. Thirdly, what is the answer to my right hon. and learned Friend's question about the imbalance in the provision? If there is a legitimate case for handing a decision to another body—we are waiting for an example—the complainant, who is probably the consumer, can decide whether that should happen, but the firm that is complained against has no say in the matter. That is why I said that parliamentary draftsmen had included unnecessary provisions, although in this case they have produced a late amendment that is unfair and therefore defective.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendment provides that in certain circumstances a complaint will be dealt with by another body
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``instead of by an ombudsman''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The word ``ombudsman'' is in lower case. That implies that the circumstances envisaged will not be referred to the pension ombudsman; that is ruled out by the drafting. It seems clear that it is envisaged that the matter will pass to a body other than an ombudsman, and I cannot think that that can mean other than the courts. That goes to the heart of what constitutes the agreement involved when one goes to the financial services ombudsman, or whatever he will be called. Either the amendment has been misdrafted or its intent is unclear—it does not seem to accord with the explanation in the Government's notes, which is that where there is the odd ombudsman outside the FSA who would be more suitable, he is the chap to deal with it.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I fear that the hour is affecting the minds of some Conservative Members. First, in response to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, I would point out that ``ombudsman'' in paragraph 1 of schedule 14 is in lower case and obviously refers to the specific ombudsman whom we are debating. Likewise, our amendment uses a lower case letter as well. We should not get too hung up on the capitalisation or otherwise of letters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I do not think that the hon. Lady has dealt with my hon. Friend's point. He said that the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``instead of by an ombudsman''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
must mean ``instead of by any ombudsman''. If it meant only the ombudsman under the Bill, why does it not say ``the financial services ombudsman''?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The word ``ombudsman'' as used in the amendment carries the same meaning as in the paragraph 1 of schedule 14—that is, a member of the panel of ombudsmen, as provided for by paragraph 4 of that schedule.
<P>
Perhaps I could draw hon. Members' attention to what the Joint Committee said about this aspect of the provision. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We . . . expect the FSA to put in place a system of signposting to ensure that consumers concerned about any financial service are directed to the appropriate body if an activity about which they are concerned does not come within its remit.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is part of the provision ensuring that that recommendation of the Joint Committee is carried out in the Bill.

If there is an opportunity, we should divide on the amendment because it is not in a sufficiently acceptable state to be included in the Bill.

</FONT>Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 685, in page 228, line 18, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The standard terms may include provision to the effect that (unless acting in bad faith) none of the following is to be liable in damages for anything done or omitted in the discharge or purported discharge of functions in connection with the voluntary jurisdiction—
<P>
(a)the scheme operator;
<P>
(b)any member of its governing body;
<P>
(c)any member of its staff;
<P>
(d)any person acting as an ombudsman for the purposes of the scheme.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment refers to the scheme's liability in damages in respect of the voluntary jurisdiction. Schedule 14 does not need to refer in detail to voluntary jurisdiction. For example, paragraph 19 simply provides for complaints to be dealt with and determined on standard terms which are fixed by the scheme operator and approved by the FSA and which can be agreed with participating firms and consented to by complainants who wish to use the scheme.
<P>
Standard terms for the voluntary jurisdiction may cover, albeit not on a statutory basis, procedural and other matters, such as fees, investigation powers, determination and enforcement of awards, which are covered in the Bill and in procedural and scheme rules under the compulsory jurisdiction. Indeed, the scheme operator and the FSA recently announced in their joint consultation paper No. 33 their intention that the standard terms under the voluntary jurisdiction should, as far as possible, mirror procedural and scheme rules under the compulsory jurisdiction.
<P>
However, there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of standard terms that purport to exclude liability of the scheme in damages. That uncertainty arises not just in relation to firms and complainants, who might otherwise argue later that it was an unusual, unfair or unreasonable exclusion to be contained in standard terms, but in relation to third parties who might not otherwise regard themselves as bound by the terms.
<P>
The schedule provides in paragraph 11 for the scheme operator and the ombudsmen to have statutory immunity in damages for anything done or not done in the discharge of their statutory functions under the compulsory jurisdiction, except when that is done in bad faith or is unlawful under section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998. That immunity will allow the scheme to carry out its functions effectively and without constant fear of legal challenge.
<P>
Without immunity the scheme would be forced into a defensive position and would have to weigh the consequences of taking what it thought to be the correct action against the prospect of being sued.
<P>
As the relationship between the scheme and its voluntary jurisdiction members will be consensual, the scheme is not automatically afforded the same protection as under the compulsory jurisdiction. Nevertheless, we believe that the scheme should be able to provide effective immunity for the scheme operator, its staff and the ombudsmen, provided that those terms are contained in the standard terms agreed by the voluntary jurisdiction participants.
<P>
The amendment provides a statutory basis for standard terms which confer immunity on the scheme, with the agreement of the participating firms. As the voluntary jurisdiction is consensual, there is no need to provide the same safeguards in respect of section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998. I urge hon. Members to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Before we accept a further extension of statutory immunity to a body created pursuant to statute—although in this case a company limited by guarantee—I would like clarification of certain points.
<P>
First, if we were dealing with compulsory jurisdiction, would there be immunity and where is it to be found? Secondly, are there existing schemes of voluntary jurisdiction comparable to that which we are creating under the schedule? If so, are they at present the beneficiaries of statutory immunity, or is this the first time that statutory immunity will have been given?
<P>
In our debate before dinner, we were seriously concerned about what seems to be a creeping policy of extending statutory immunities in circumstances in which the fundamental principles that I outlined earlier are not fulfilled. This proposal suggests that the policy is more than creeping—it is, perhaps, walking and maybe, later, galloping. I hope that the Minister will accept that those fundamental principles are not fulfilled here.
<P>
The Minister said that it would be undesirable to have a scheme of voluntary jurisdiction that was not protected by statutory immunity, because those exercising their powers of voluntary jurisdiction would be constantly looking over their shoulders for fear of being sued for negligence if they used it. I hope that I may be forgiven for suggesting that that is a far-fetched notion. If a system of voluntary jurisdiction were set up, it would be difficult to spot the circumstances in which it could be used negligently. However, if it were, the likelihood is that it would be causing serious injustice. It is difficult to see, on public policy grounds, why the citizen who suffers damage as a result of serious injustice caused by negligence in such circumstances should not have a remedy.
<P>
The purpose of the Bill is to provide the citizen with remedies in circumstances in which they suffer injustice in the area of financial services, yet this aspect of the Bill is designed to do exactly the opposite. Will the Minister give us an answer to these perfectly reasonable questions?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The right hon. and learned Gentleman may wish to bear in mind that, under the existing arrangement, the voluntary bodies agree immunity with the firms and the complainants. The experience of other voluntary schemes is that liability and damages, including to third parties, have been a concern, despite the existence of contractual exclusion clauses. These schemes have needed to obtain indemnities from their members. In any event, if the standard terms are provided for in the statute, it is right that any uncertainty about their scope should be resolved in statute.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Listening as carefully as I could, I noticed that the present schemes are voluntary and have to obtain agreement from both parties, whereas here we are setting up a scheme that could be forced upon a member of the industry. Perhaps the Minister will clarify whether the notion of a voluntary jurisdiction would appear voluntary only to the complainant? Am I mistaken? I shall be encouraged if I am.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I believe that this immunity would be conferred only with the agreement of participating firms. I hope that that helps the right hon. and learned Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am sorry. The Minister is too clever for me. I am not quite sure what a participating firm is in that context.
<P>
Is any firm that is authorised a participating firm, or do firms have an opportunity to agree or to disagree to an individual instance of jurisdiction? That is what concerns me.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I believe that whether or not immunity is conferred is voluntary.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am sorry to press the point—it must seem tedious—but it cannot be voluntary or we come back to the present situation, in which, judging from the Minister's carefully read out explanation, it is already voluntary—I understand that it confers immunity by contract. That is not now proposed; instead there will be compulsory immunity. However, it is not clear whether, if the voluntary jurisdiction is exercised, it is voluntary to the complainant or to the complainee—the person complained against.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> It is voluntary for firms to sign up to the scheme, but once they have done so, they are bound to accept the jurisdiction. Firms cannot decide not to accept immunity if they join the scheme; it is whether or not to join the scheme that is voluntary. That is the sense in which it is a voluntary jurisdiction.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Fourteenth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> May I ask for your guidance, Mr. Malins? Many points on schedule 14 were not covered by our amendments, and I would like your advice on whether we should debate the schedule paragraph by paragraph or as a whole.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> On a schedule stand part debate, all matters can be covered by one general debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I should like to start by taking a look at paragraph 3(3). Sub-paragraph (4) has, of course, been removed. Sub-paragraph (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the terms of their appointment . . . must be such as to secure their independence from the Authority in the operation of the scheme.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The appointment is that of the ombudsmen, and the crucial issue is that they should be seen to be genuinely independent of any other authority so that they can exercise their functions correctly.
<P>
That looks all right in principle until one discovers—the Minister will correct me if I am wrong—that although the Bill assures us that the ombudsmen will be independent of the authority, they will be appointed by the FSA. There will be no independent parliamentary scrutiny, as we proposed earlier, even though the Minister is sympathetic to the idea and, in a recent document, the Government strongly supported the principle of parliamentary, specifically Select Committee, scrutiny of appointments to quangos of all types. Furthermore, the ombudsmen will be paid by the FSA, so we shall be asking quite a lot of them if we expect them to be not too attentive to what the FSA thinks of their performance.
<P>
Before we can agree to that, we need to know a lot more—fascinating notes come my way too, but in nothing like the profusion that they come to the Minister—about the tenure of the scheme operator. Will it have a three, five or seven-year term? We need to know how that term might be altered, and whether the FSA can alter it. What will be the procedure for the dismissal of the scheme operator in such circumstances and what will be done in the event of his poor performance? Will he be on a bonus scheme? How will the scheme operate? Will the FSA also be devising it?
<P>
The Bill goes into so much detail about the establishment of a scheme, so it is a little bizarre that it has so little detail on how the independence enumerated under paragraph 3(3) will be secured. I have many points to make about schedule 14 and I shall do my best to get through all of them in one go. Paragraph 5 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Chief Ombudsman is to be appointed on such terms . . . as the scheme operator considers appropriate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, his independence is itself dependent on the scheme operator. The same point that I made in respect of paragraph 3 applies to paragraph 5. There is no back-up scrutiny, no long-stop scrutiny and no justiciability of anything that the scheme operator may consider appropriate in such circumstances. When I read that paragraph, I recalled what I had read over the weekend in consultation paper No. 33. On the subject of independence, it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The FSOS''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the scheme—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``will also need to have in place arrangements for dealing with complaints against itself. Like the FSA, the FSOS proposes to appoint an independent Complaints Commissioner to investigate such complaints.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a fairly clear and sensible demand for long-stop scrutiny, as I suggested. The consultation paper continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``These arrangements would be confined to complaints about the operation of Scheme procedures (eg allegations of delay in handling a case).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They would not provide a means for opening up debate.
<P>
I should be grateful to know from the Minister whether there will be an independent complaints commissioner to deal with complaints against the scheme. If so, why is it not set out in the Bill? My earlier point seems to apply again: the Bill is extremely detailed, yet it is hedged around with occasional clauses that give it wide discretion to be varied without there being further recourse to primary legislation. Such an important proposal is contained in the consultation paper, which was published only a fortnight ago, at paragraph 4.30 under a major sub-heading ``Complaints against the FSOS'', but I cannot find any legislative back-up for it in the Bill. However, I may have just missed it. I shall be pleased if I have.
<P>
Paragraph 8 of the schedule refers to the annual report and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Each report must also comply with any requirement specified in rules made by the Authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That sounds fair enough, but why should it be subject only to the authority? Why is the report not subject in some way to parliamentary scrutiny? If it contains budgetary information, at the very least it should be subject to scrutiny by a body that is adept to handling that data, such as the National Audit Office? I should be grateful to receive advice from the Minister on that. I may come back with a few more points when she has had a go at answering those that I have just made.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I have just one point and I should be grateful if the Minister could concentrate on it because I did not really get a satisfactory answer when we dealt with it before in another context. The terms of the appointment of the chairman and members of the board must be such as to secure their independence from the authority in the operation of the scheme. Will the Minister please spell out how that will be done? At the moment, it is entirely vague.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am happy to give an illustration. I think that the right hon. and learned Gentleman for North-East Bedfordshire is doing some illustration of his own because I can see what his pen and his eye are doing.
<P>
Paragraph 3(3) is a key provision, which concerned the hon. Member for Chichester. It deals with the constitution of the scheme, which we have discussed to some extent. Sub-paragraph (3) provides that the chairman and members of the board must be appointed on a basis that secures the scheme's independence from the FSA. The provision is important because it makes it clear that the scheme should be an independent body, which is separate from the regulator. That is an important provision, which I am sure that we all support. The scheme is not meant to provide a further method of regulation, but it is fundamental to the FSA's objective of consumer protection. In addition, the chairman of the scheme board must be appointed with the Treasury's approval.
<P>
However, the FSA has a duty under paragraph 2 to set up the scheme operator, as I mentioned earlier, and to ensure that the scheme can carry out all the functions conferred on it by the Bill. The scheme operator is accountable to the FSA and must make an annual report to the authority. The chief ombudsman must also make a report to the FSA on the discharge of his functions. The FSA will have to include those reports in its own annual report to the Treasury, which will be laid before Parliament, as we have discussed many times. That addresses a further question that the hon. Member for Chichester raised.
<P>
Perhaps I could sketch out in a little more detail one or two other aspects of the independence of those covered by the schedule. The chairman's term of appointment is four years. The salaries will be set by the FSA, but funded by levies on firms that participate in the scheme. The reports to the FSA will be on functions and statistics, not internal matters. The salaries of the chairman and chief ombudsman will be published in the annual reports, so there will be quite a degree of transparency about the arrangement on a regular and annual basis.
<P>
The independent complaints commission is an FSA and ombudsman initiative. It is a clear sign—as the hon. Member for Chichester rightly noted from paragraph 4.30 of consultation paper No. 33—of the commitment of the FSA and the shadow ombudsmen to openness, transparency and putting a scheme in place. Provision for that is not made in the Bill and does not need to be. I sometimes wonder at the fact that Opposition Members demand that we put more and more in the Bill on the one hand and tell us that it is oversized and has too much detail on the other. We cannot meet both those demands. On this occasion, we feel that it is appropriate to meet the suggestion that has been made, but it does not need to be in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for her answers, as far as they have gone. She told me that the length of tenure will be four years and that the FSA will set the salaries. I would be grateful if she could provide more information, particularly about the exercise of the crucial power of the FSA for dismissal of the scheme board chairman. If a person can be dismissed at will by the authority from which he is supposed to be independent, I submit that he cannot be particularly independent. Will his salary be fixed or variable as in a bonus or incentive scheme? Those are crucial issues for the effectiveness of the scheme.
<P>
I would also like to ask the Minister more about the matter I raised about consultation paper No. 33. She seemed to support the general tenor or gravamen of the paragraph, but was disappointed that the Opposition wanted an extra clause in the Bill, which she was against. I do not mind whether it is in the Bill—we can return to the matter on Report if it becomes clearer that legislation is needed—but I want to know whether the Minister is committed to implement the clear proposals that were set out in the FSA consultation paper published only a few weeks ago. Having an independent complaints commissioner would provide a measure of assurance about the independence of the scheme operator.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Obviously, the consultation document includes a strong and supportive statement about the independence of procedures for handling complaints. We are keen to see such procedures in place. The hon. Member for Chichester and I may not agree about the importance of building the provision into the Bill, but all the indications are that the proper procedures will be put in place. The FSA itself views that as essential.
<P>
The dismissal of the chairman would be subject to Treasury approval, but I invite the hon. Member for Chichester to tell us the circumstances under which the parliamentary ombudsman would be subject to dismissal. If dismissal were to be contemplated, it would be a sad day because the credibility of the scheme rests on the quality of people who are doing the job. If that were to become an issue, we would have reached a pretty poor pass. I do not know what arrangements apply to the parliamentary ombudsman; perhaps the hon. Gentleman does. I would be happy to write to him if he has any further questions about them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify how the dismissal powers will be exercised. She asked me quite properly how I would deal with them. My response is that the power of the ombudsman—particularly a jumbo ombudsman of such authority—should be subject to scrutiny by a Select Committee, which was the approach adopted in our amendment. The Government liked the content, but not the idea of building it into the Bill. I should be grateful if the Minister would write to me and confirm that there will be an independent complaints procedure, which would be good news.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I just want to be satisfied that nothing short of serious misconduct or unfitness for the job on medical or mental grounds would be enough to justify dismissal.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> If a person was unfit on medical grounds I would hope that he or she would not be dismissed but that some arrangement could be reached. I am happy to write to right hon. and learned Gentleman about this. Everything would fall into disrepute if we were ever to reach that stage with someone who occupies such a position in public life. None of us knows what arrangements are in place for the parliamentary ombudsman.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 14, as amended, agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 198</center></H4>
<H4><center>Compulsory jurisdiction</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No.701, in page 99, line 27, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and
<P>
(c) which are contained in an order of which a draft has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is fairly self-explanatory. It would insert part of a new subsection into clause 198. It attempts to make the provisions subject to parliamentary approval. Earlier today we discussed at some length the observations of the Deregulation Committee that were given in evidence to the Joint Committee bemoaning the fact that so few of the rules that will flow from the Bill are subject to parliamentary approval. That is an omission from clause 198 because the rules affect the setting up of a compulsory system of jurisdiction that is separate from the courts. Many firms will be subject to it and it will be a new experience for them. At present, members of the SFA in particular are dealt with by arbitration. Under the Bill, they are to be dealt with by what will effectively be an independent legal system, so it is especially important that it be made subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Hence our proposal for new paragraph (c). I shall be interested to hear the Minister's reaction.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Member for explaining his views on the amendment. However, I must raise a number of objections to it. First, its effect would be that the compulsory jurisdiction of the ombudsman scheme would be determined not by the FSA's rules but by regulations. This seems a huge step backwards, given where we are now. Many authorised firms under current regimes are already subject to the jurisdiction of at least one existing scheme. In many instances the schemes were established by the industry, which means that there is no formal external accountability for the arrangements. While, technically, membership of the schemes is, of course, voluntary, the reality is that relevant firms would find it difficult not to be members of the scheme. For example, a condition of membership of the Association of British Insurers is that an insurance agent must also sign up to the Insurance Ombudsman Bureau.
<P>
Schemes that have been established on a statutory footing—notably those under the Financial Services Act 1986—have been established by rules made by the relevant recognised self-regulatory organisation. Again, they are not subject to external scrutiny, except to the extent that the FSA must satisfy itself that the relevant schemes are adequate for the purposes of satisfactory investigation of complaints against members of the relevant self-regulatory organisation.
<P>
The scheme proposed in part XV of the Bill is a substantial improvement on those arrangements. It is better from the consumer's viewpoint because participation in the ombudsman scheme will be compulsory for relevant authorised firms. It will be much simpler, as there will be one scheme instead of eight. The scheme will be significantly better for the industry too. The Bill makes clear provision in relation to what the scheme may and—by implication—may not do, providing a degree of certainty that did not exist in any of the other arrangements.
<P>
Additionally, there will be real accountability. Any proposals for rule making by the FSA will be subject to the usual protections under the rule-making provisions of part IX, which include all the features of clause 125 that we have already debated. Committee members will recall that those are not the end of the accountability arrangements. The FSA will be accountable to Treasury Minister who, in turn, will be accountable to Parliament. Under parts XIV and XV, the FSA will publish an annual report which will include information about the performance of its functions.
<P>
The Treasury Committee has said that it intends to review those reports and take evidence from the FSA. As I said, I welcome that. The consumer and practitioner panels will have a legitimate role in considering the effectiveness of the arrangements. There is no reason to depart from our current proposal that rules about the operation of the scheme should be governed by the same arrangements that apply to any other rules made by the authority.
<P>
I hope that my explanation of existing protections and the problems with his party's proposals reassures and helps the right hon. Gentleman, and that he will withdraw his amendment. However, if he does not do so, I shall ask my hon. Friends to oppose it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I do not mind the authority drawing up rules. However, I was suggesting that those rules should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The argument that the rules will be dealt with elsewhere, so that there is in effect a self rule-making system does not altogether reassure me.
<P>
I listened carefully to the Minister, who gave a full reply and outlined some safeguards, so I will not press the matter, although it illustrates a point that we made in relation to other parts of Bill. We are examining ways of increasing parliamentary scrutiny, wherever appropriate. However, in this instance, I do not intend to press the matter to a division. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 198 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 199</center></H4>
<H4><center>Voluntary jurisdiction</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 677, in page 100, line 34, leave out `respondents who are not' and insert `persons other than'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may consider Government amendment No. 727.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The amendment makes a simple drafting correction. Clause 199(10) contains an error, referring to firms that may participate in the voluntary jurisdiction as respondents. Of course, firms do not have to be respondents to actual complaints in order to join the scheme. That is a minor point.
<P>
To explain the purpose of amendment No. 727, I shall say a little more about the operation of voluntary jurisdiction, which is made by rules that are, in turn, made by the scheme operator rather than the FSA, but require the FSA's approval. Under the voluntary jurisdiction, the ombudsman scheme can deal with complaints related to financial services activities not covered by the compulsory jurisdiction. If such an activity is subject to the compulsory jurisdiction for authorised persons, complaints about that activity when carried out by unauthorised persons may be brought within the scope of the scheme. For example, the activities of consumer credit firms will be dealt with under the voluntary jurisdiction.
<P>
For the ombudsman to examine a complaint under the voluntary jurisdiction, complainants must be eligible to bring a dispute to the scheme, respondents must be members of the scheme, and the act or omission must have taken place at a time when the voluntary jurisdiction rules were in force. However, the scheme operator and the FSA said in consultation paper 33 that they do not plan to include—
<P>

Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>10.16 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming—
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Amendment No. 727 will allow the scheme operator to make voluntary jurisdiction rules under new subsection (13) that will allow past claims under the predecessor scheme to be dealt with under the ombudsman scheme. New subsection (14) will enable individual firms to agree to have complaints about other past acts or omissions dealt with under the ombudsman scheme, if the voluntary jurisdiction rules allow.
<P>
I trust that Committee members will agree that those provisions are useful enhancements that will increase the flexibility of voluntary jurisdiction, and will accept the amendment.

Amendment agreed to.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, the taking of which would be commensurate with the requirements of the applicable rules, general guidance and legislation'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I thought that I heard the Government Whip say ``Not moved.'' I had a moment's hesitation about how to handle the clause, but it passed.
<P>
Amendment No. 702 is a tiny amendment that is related to the more substantive amendment No. 703, which would delete the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the applicable rules, general guidance and legislation''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have tabled the amendment because, in our view, the ombudsman should apply all the rules, guidance and legislation that governs a person's conduct in the first place. It is not the application of some loose notion of fairness but a breach of those rules that would generate liability under the scheme. If the current wording is retained, we run the risk that firms that observe the rules will nevertheless be liable before the ombudsman. Clearly, that would be wrong.
<P>
Amendment No. 704—[Hon. Members: ``Get on with it.''] I had better get the Economic Secretary's response to amendment No. 703 and work out my views on amendment No. 704.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I want to assist my hon. Friend. I believe that amendment No. 704 supplements amendment No. 703. Amendment No. 704 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the requirements of the applicable rules, general guidance and legislation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The idea is that complaints should be determined in accordance with law rather than on the basis of what an ombudsman considers to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances. The Government should give us an assurance that this complex and carefully worked out structure of rules and regulations will be enforced, and that the benefits of the consultation process will not be set at naught because complaints are determined according, in old-fashioned language, to the length of the Lord Chancellor's foot. In this case, perhaps we should refer to the length of the ombudsman's foot, although the Economic Secretary might prefer to refer to the length of the ombudsperson's foot.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I understand the reasoning that lies behind the amendments, but I do not want to insert into the Bill the constraints that are contained in amendments Nos. 702 and 703. If the ombudsman were constrained to consider only guidance, laws and principles, he might be unable to examine all the circumstances that a case might involve, including maladministration, for example, or unreasonable delay. I would not want to place such constraints on him, and it would not be right for his investigations to be too focused on the legalistic side of the dispute. We believe that the ombudsman's scheme should remain quick and informal. I hope that Committee members accept that the ombudsman should take into account what the amendment proposes and much more besides.
<P>
I might be able to help the hon. Member for Chichester before he returns to amendment No. 704. In the light of the assistance that the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire gave him, I suspect that the hon. Gentleman will say nothing further about the amendment. I find amendment No. 704 to be unsuitable. Clause 201 will allow the ombudsman to direct a respondent to take steps in relation to a complainant. That might include, for example, correcting a situation or apologising for an unacceptable error. I am sure that Committee members recognise that, where appropriate, it is important to resolve disputes by means other than monetary recompense. Amendment No. 704 would interfere with that process. I hope that Opposition Members will accordingly withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The Economic Secretary appears broadly to agree with the argument but not with the amendment. We may create problems for ourselves if the Bill contains such a loose notion of fairness. There is sense in arguing that the ombudsman should apply the rules as they are. If a firm can show that it has its own rules, it should be sure that it is free from the liability of being examined by the ombudsman. There may still be a problem in this regard, and we may have to return to the matter on Report, but I do not intend to press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. I had hoped that the Economic Secretary would say that one would only rarely come across a case in which it was not fair and reasonable to take into account all the rules and regulations and whether they had been complied with. I had rather hoped that the Minister would agree that that is likely to be the case. However, my hon. Friend and I will be content if she will undertake to consider the matter further.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am happy to give the right hon. and learned Gentleman my assurance on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Clause 200 involves some important issues. The most important of those relate to subsections (5) and (6), which create the asymmetry between the treatment of complainants and firms that we briefly discussed earlier. The problem, in a nutshell, is that when the ombudsman rules in a case the firm will be bound by the decision, whatever it may be, but the individual complainant is not so bound, and can go to judicial review. Is that a correct or sensible approach? It is probably not morally right, and may be a breach of natural justice. The term ``natural justice'' has a corpus of law behind it on which I am not well qualified to speak—although fortunately the former Attorney-General, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire, is very well-qualified to do so.
<P>
Furthermore, we may find that subsections (5) and (6) generate legal problems in that they come into conflict with article 6 of the ECHR. An extensive passage on that in the Joint Committee report considers that and points out that there is a great danger that it might do so. The matter is also considered in paragraphs 79 to 81 of consultation paper 4. [Interruption.] Does the Whip want to add something?

<P>

<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): I would love to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members should keep sedentary interventions to a minimum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Consultation paper 4 states that the ombudsman will have to take his work forward in a quasi-judicial manner. The effect of that will be to slow the implementation of the scheme. The processing of cases will involve an ombudsman in far more work than would otherwise be the case and lead to a formalisation of the scheme. In other words, it will move in the opposite direction from the one that we want, which is one of flexibility and speed in dealing with cases. That is why we supported ombudsman schemes on principle when they were first created. Considerable worries attach, both in law and in practice, to subsections (5) and (6). We may table an amendment on Report, but I shall not take the debate further now.
<P>
I should like to the Economic Secretary to tell us what advice she has had on the extent to which the proposal may formalise the process and, therefore, slow the speed at which cases can be considered. I should be interested to hear my right hon. and learned Friend's response on article 6.
<P>
<H5>10.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The right thing for me to do is ask the Economic Secretary some questions and listen to her answers; perhaps we shall return to the matter on Report. It is striking that the clauses will provide one party with a right of access to the courts but not the other. That worries the Opposition. I should like to hear the Economic Secretary's advice on whether that is a denial of natural justice.
<P>
Normally, the right to be heard is one of the prime requirements of natural justice. Imbalances such as that under the proposal are rare. I do not know of any others, but that may be because of my ignorance. I should like to know if any precedent exists for granting one party to a contract a right of access to the courts but ousting the jurisdiction of the courts over the other party. The courts are often jealous of their right to do justice; they do not like their jurisdiction to be ousted. The Government need to justify the ousting of the courts' jurisdiction before we can agree to the clause. This is the first opportunity that the Economic Secretary has had to provide that justification, and we look forward to hearing it.
<P>
Everyone is entitled to a fair trial under article 6 of the European convention on human rights. A fair trial normally includes a right to appeal through the normal processes. The clause will not exactly provide complainants with a right to appeal; they will have a right to take matters to the courts, but respondents will have no such rights and will be stuck with the ombudsman's determination. If that determination is against a respondent, he is effectively denied a right of appeal, although the other party is given the equivalent of such a right. Again, I should like to hear the Economic Secretary explain how that is consistent with article 6.
<P>
One of the practical reasons why the Government should think that through carefully is that, as I said in an earlier debate, in the rare case of an authorised person considering that he is genuinely threatened by the operation of those clauses, he will go to his lawyer and look for remedies. The remedy proposed sticks out like a sore thumb. Article 6 cases are common; it has been a fruitful source of judicial review litigation. That has been shown by the divisional court judgment—it might have been a Court of Appeal judgment—in the case of the Crown v. Keberline. If the Economic Secretary has not been advised on whether that case is relevant, it should at least be checked.
<P>
We are raising serious issues. As it is 10.33 pm, if the Economic Secretary is not fully armed with the answers, it would be sensible if she would at least tell us that she will consider what we have said and return to such matters on Report without making any commitment. If she would say that, it would keep alive an important point. If she were to say less than that, we could not accept the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Patrick Hall </B>(Bedford): I want to raise a couple of points with my hon. Friend the Minister with regard to subsection (2) which refers to the ombudsman taking into account what is fair and reasonable. I assume that one of the things that will be taken into account will be existing voluntary codes—for example, the banking code, which is drawn from various banks and building societies. I understand that it tends to reflect the minimum service standards—the lowest common denominator, as it were—rather than standards that might best serve consumer protection. Will the ombudsman look to improve existing voluntary codes; if so, how might that be done? The statutory single ombudsman scheme, as proposed in the Bill, has great potential to resolve disputes, to help people, raise consumer confidence and form a discipline to improve industry performance. That is important, but if, in practice, the scheme is only as good as the voluntary codes—the lowest common denominator—an opportunity to add value will have been missed. Will the scheme consider and seek to improve those voluntary codes?
<P>
I want to consider the detail with regard to the operation of the single ombudsman scheme. Many of the important details, such as eligibility, will be determined by the FSA, but they are not spelled out in the Bill. I understand that the FSA intends the scheme to cover individuals and small businesses. I know from constituency examples how important it is for small businesses to have access to an effective ombudsman scheme. What is a small business? The current banking ombudsman operates a very narrow definition of small business—certainly not the small and medium enterprise definition that is adopted by the Department of Trade and Industry. I shall be happy to receive my hon. Friend the Minister's reply in writing to the question: what is her definition of a small business?
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Perhaps I can start with the point made by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire about the nature of balance and the question of the ombudsman's decision being binding on firms, but not on claimants. That is a key hallmark of an ombudsman scheme and how it is likely to work. The provision is consistent with current banking and insurance schemes. The ombudsman scheme is intended to be fairly informal and quick, especially compared with the courts. We are all agreed that it is highly desirable to achieve that result. The court-based process, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman knows, can provide an inherent advantage to the better-resourced party—usually the firm. It is important for consumers to be able to seek redress without fear or financial risk to themselves. They can go through the ombudsman, rather than an expensive court-based process. That is one reason why this scheme is attractive to consumers and other complainants in different circumstances. It is also important for consumer confidence that awards are binding on firms.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am keen on ombudsman schemes, which should be binding, but is it the case that the banking scheme is binding on one side only?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> It is as I understand it.
<P>
Let me say more about how the scheme ombudsman must determine complaints under compulsory jurisdiction. The clause does not direct the way in which a decision will be reached; nor does it set out the process for mediation and determination. That detail will be determined by the Financial Services Authority and the scheme under their respective rules. The procedural aspects of the ombudsman scheme are set out in clause 199. In particular, the ombudsman must inform the respondent and the complainant of his decision and the reasons for it. The complainant is under a duty to accept or reject that determination within a set period. If a determination is accepted, it will be binding on the respondent.
<P>
There has been much talk about the fact that the ombudsman's decision is binding on the respondent while the complainant is free to choose whether to accept a decision. The scheme exists to enable individuals to settle cases outside the expensive arena of the courts. If the way remains open for a respondent to reject a decision and take the matter to court, the consumer could again decide that it is better not to pursue a complaint. That key hallmark of the scheme is important for consumer confidence. Decisions by the banking ombudsman and insurance ombudsman schemes are binding on firms only, which puts them in the same category as existing schemes.
<P>
It is perfectly possible to operate the scheme effectively while also protecting the parties' ECHR rights. Firms and complainants that bring disputes to the ombudsman will be able to exercise their right to a fair and public hearing. The option of a judicial review will be open to both firms and consumers once the ombudsman's decision has been taken, which ensures that all parties will be heard. Article 6(1) stipulates that in the determination of civil rights and obligations, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal. The scheme will provide for a hearing to be held if one is requested by a party to the complaint. We do not believe that the scheme will be legalistic. We expect the right to a fair hearing to be exercised frequently.
<P>
On the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford (Mr. Hall), we expect the ombudsman to take account of existing voluntary codes when deciding what is fair and reasonable. The point of the test is that it is flexible. We do not want to hem in the ombudsman by stipulating the exact standards that will be set for firms. They will depend on the nature of the complaint. In addition, it is not for the ombudsman to improve the codes, although he can comment if he thinks that they are causing firms to make defective decisions.
<P>
My hon. Friend also mentioned the definition of small businesses. Whether small businesses can use the scheme depends on the definition of the eligible complainant, which is a matter for the scheme rules that are made by the authority under clause 198(6). That takes into account people who bring complaints to existing schemes.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am very disappointed that the Minister was not able to go as far as my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire suggested. It would be helpful to consider this matter without making a commitment and return to us at a later stage.
<P>
 The Minister dismissed all our fundamental points with arguments that were not based on the facts. She said that the lopsided and unbalanced approach, whereby one party could not go to law but the other could, was commonplace in ombudsman schemes. In fact, she said—I noted this down as she said it—that that was how they generally worked.
<P>
<H5>10.45pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That is simply not true of the vast majority of ombudsman schemes in the UK. Almost all of them have no bearing on access to the courts. Decisions are made and then announced by ombudsmen and parties may choose to accept or reject them. Although it is unusual for them to be rejected by either party, nevertheless they can be and that party can then go to law. That is how the parliamentary and the health ombudsmen schemes work. Some important cases involving negligence come before the latter. They are of the same genre as cases that could come before the financial services ombudsman.
<P>
The Minister cited precedents within the existing financial services regime, but she by no means gave the full picture. She missed out three crucial facts. First, of the eight schemes that are listed on page 33 of consultation document No. 4, only four involve any of that lopsided approach, and of those only two apply some restriction on firms' access to law. The key banking ombudsman scheme, to which the Minister referred at some length, is, like the other schemes where there is no general access to law, currently voluntary. Thus, firms enter a voluntary scheme knowing that it will limit their access to law, which seems perfectly reasonable. It is quite a different kettle of fish for a firm to be put involuntarily into a compulsory scheme and then to find itself unable to go to law in the event of an ombudsman decision going against it, which it feels leaves it aggrieved. That is a crucial part of the picture, which the Minister missed out.
<P>
Another crucial part of the picture that the Minister omitted was the fact that even in the banking scheme, for example, and the Personal Investment Authority scheme, appeals can still be made to the courts if the firm believes that a point of precedent is at stake which may have a bearing on subsequent cases. Thus, firms do have recourse to law, and the picture that the Minister painted, of more or less transferring and consolidating the existing arrangements and rolling them into the new scheme, is almost completely false. I deeply regret that.
<P>
The Minister must take on board that this is a serious issue which will, as I tried to point out earlier, have a considerable impact on firms and the way in which they behave, and could also trigger considerable concerns over the ECHR, justiciability and natural justice. I believe that the provisions will also lead ombudsmen to an excessive formalisation of their approach, which will cut away at the informal, flexible and speedy approach that we want them to take.
<P>
I repeat my question: is the Minister prepared, with no commitment, to say that she will think again about this issue so that we can return to it on Report?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I want to reiterate what I said, because the hon. Gentleman seems to have taken no account of it. It is obviously important for consumer confidence that awards should be binding on firms; the procedure is there to provide an alternative to court action for consumers, but it should not deprive them of their legal rights before they decide to accept the determination. I made that point clearly; I cannot give the hon. Gentleman any more comfort than I have given in my remarks—the clause is fine as it stands.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`of a specified kind, which shall be of a kind which a court could award if it were deciding an action for breach of contract or for negligence, whichever is appropriate'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is almost an explanatory amendment, and I can be brief in discussing it. I am sure that everybody will be delighted to hear that. It is intended to ensure that awards will be of the kind that a court might award if it were deciding an action for breach of contract or for negligence. Monetary compensation should be calculated by the ombudsman on the same basis that it is currently calculated in contract or tort cases. Without the amendment, the clause would allow much wider criteria to be used to guide decisions on the size of such payments.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The meaning and effect of the amendment are clear. It would restrict the ability of the complainant to go to the ombudsman when suffering from delay or maladministration by the respondent firm. Ombudsman schemes have traditionally dealt with such complaints and awarded damages in those categories. I would not be prepared to limit the new ombudsman scheme's powers to those that would result from the amendment. I encourage him to withdraw it; if he does not, I shall encourage my hon. Friends to vote against it.

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I can be brief. Government amendment No. 679 covers a minor drafting point and ensures that clause 202 applies only to compulsory jurisdiction. The words to be inserted by the amendment were omitted in error.

Clause 202(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Cost rules may not provide for the making an award cannot be made against the complainant in respect of the respondent's costs.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is unreasonable, as, in a small number of cases, an ombudsman might feel that he should award costs against the complainant. If a complainant behaved in an irresponsible way or generated unreasonable delay in the investigation, it would not be reasonable for a firm to have to bear all of its own costs.
<P>
The amendment is relatively simple. It deals with a relatively rare set of circumstances in which a complainant acted unreasonably and vexatiously. I hope that the Government will accept it.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The cost provisions in the clause do not include awards in respect of a respondent's costs, which are not within the ombudsman's control. The policy behind the decision is to achieve a balance between deterring vexatious complaints and avoiding such heavy penalties that complainants who behave reasonably will be deterred from using the scheme. The clause therefore provides that the respondent's costs cannot be awarded against the complainant, even when the ombudsman decides in favour of the respondent. Without that provision, the scheme could be a more risky procedure than most complainants would care to venture into. Respondents will be better placed than most individuals to meet any costs incurred.
<P>
The amendment would take us back to the position that we have sought to change. It would disturb what we regard as a satisfactory balance between the two extremes. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am sorry that the Minister did not feel able to consider accepting the amendment. The cases in which it would apply are set out in subsection (3)(a), (b) and (c). We may want to return to the matter on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) A company approved under section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 as an investment trust shall not be a collective investment scheme.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister explain why my amendment is unacceptable? It seems perfectly reasonable that a company approved under section 842 of the 1988 Act should not be part of a collective investment scheme. I look forward to hearing why the Minister finds that unacceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> In view of the hon. Gentleman's comments a few moments ago, I shall be glad to help.
<P>
The amendment provides that a company approved under section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 as an investment trust should not count as a collective investment scheme. I am not convinced that that is appropriate. UK-incorporated investment trusts are not presently caught by collective investment scheme legislation and it is not intended that they will be under the Bill. That is why the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
Subsection 206(5) provides that the Treasury may provide by order that certain types of arrangement may be excluded from the definition of collective investment scheme. We published a draft of that order for consultation in February and paragraph 20 of the schedule to that order clearly specifies that UK-incorporated investment trusts cannot be collective investment schemes unless they are also an open-ended investment company.
<P>
A standard investment trust is generally a closed-ended corporate body. Incorporation in the UK would take place under the Companies Acts. If a company were to redeem or repurchase its shares, it would do so under chapter 7 of part V of the Companies Act, which deals essentially with the maintenance of capital in the interests of shareholders. UK-incorporated investment trusts with those features are not open-ended vehicles, as clause 207, which specifies the definition of an open-ended investment company, makes clear.
<P>
I understand that section 842, referred to in the amendment, can apply to companies not incorporated in the UK but resident here effectively, if their central management and control is here. The amendment could provide that irrespective of where they are incorporated, bodies corporate that are incorporated overseas and resident here would automatically not be collective investment schemes. That could make the tax status of a company determine its regulatory classification, which I am not convinced is right in principle. In the light of that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I gave some powerful reasons why the Minister should have accepted my amendment, and I am disappointed that he has not done so. However, I do not intend to press it, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 206 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Further consideration adjourned.—[Mr. Allen.]
