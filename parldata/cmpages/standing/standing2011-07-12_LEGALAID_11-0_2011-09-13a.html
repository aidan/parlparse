                  </strong> Good morning, Mr Hollobone. It is a pleasure to be
back in Committee this morning under your chairmanship. The amendment
would exempt business and human rights cases from the proposed changes
under the Bill to conditional fee arrangement matters when United
Kingdom-based multinational corporations have been challenged on
actions that they have taken that have caused harm and damage to
individuals in developing countries. In other words, I am referring to
cases when exceptionally rich and powerful corporations have caused
harm to some of the poorest and most disadvantaged people in the
world.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000019">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
most famous recent such case was Trafigura with which members of the
Committee will be familiar. It was debated extensively on Second
Reading, when my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan (Lisa Nandy), in
particular, made a powerful speech. There have been several other cases
of similar ilk, and my contention is that over the years, those cases
that have come to court would not have been able to do so, nor would
future such cases, if the Government’s proposals proceed
unamended. At present, cases involving multinationals that are being
challenged by individuals in effectively what are class actions are
being funded through the use of conditional fee arrangements. That
follows the removal of legal aid for such cases a number of years
ago.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000020">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith will be talking more fully later
about the general concept of the operation of CFAs and some of our
wider anxieties about the Government’s proposals, so I shall
confine my remarks to the specific aspects of such arrangements as they
affect human rights cases between multinationals and individuals in the
developing
world.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000021">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Such
matters involve cases when the abuse or harm arises outside this
country, usually in a developing country, but as a result of corporate
actions and corporate behaviour when the corporation in question is
either a UK company or part of a multinational organisation where
oversight and control rest ultimately with a UK parent. It is therefore
appropriate that actions should be brought in the UK courts. Class
action cases being brought back home to the UK jurisdiction are
evidence of a trend that can also be seen in several other countries.
In the United States in particular, a substantial number of similar
cases have begun to be seen in the courts. They have also been seen in
Europe. Similar cases are being brought in France, Germany and the
Netherlands, as they are increasingly in Canada and
Austria.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000022">&#160;</a>
               </p>

                  </span> I do not want to
pre-empt what my hon. Friend is about to say, but there is the Alien
Tort Claims Act in the United 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 475<a class="bkMark" name="Column475">&#160;</a>
                  </div>States, which is why there is specific provision there. In other
jurisdictions, including the UK, such cases are developing
gradually. They are still at the beginning stage of
development and my research shows that no more than a dozen have been
brought. We are talking not about a proliferation of law in such

                  </strong> My hon. Friend is right. As he says, cases in the
US have been brought under the US Alien Tort Claims Act, and different
routes to justice have been followed in some of the other jurisdictions
I mentioned; for example, actions in France have been taken in part
through the criminal legal system, although there is a private action
element to such cases. My hon. Friend is right to highlight the point
that despite the underlying global trend to secure justice for very
poor people in the countries and jurisdictions where control of
behaviours is ultimately exercised, very few such cases come to the UK
courts. It would be wrong, therefore, to characterise the trend as an
instance of conditional fee arrangements leading to the out of control
swamping of our legal system by unmeritorious cases—jurisdiction
shopping—coming to the UK without any basis to do so. As I hope
I can demonstrate to members of the Committee this morning, that is
absolutely not the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000024">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
ensure that such cases can continue to come to the UK courts when
appropriate, amendment 192 makes a number of proposals that would vary
elements of the Bill as proposed by the Government. First, it proposes
that the Lord Chancellor should be endowed with a power to exempt by
order certain conditional fee arrangements from the new provisions,
specifically those limiting the success fee to 25% of the damages
recovered and those prohibiting recovery of the success fee from the
opposing party, the defendant in the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000025">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
stress that the amendment creates only a future power for the Lord
Chancellor to make an exception. It would not introduce an exception in
every case and with immediate effect. I hope that will give the
Minister and his ministerial colleagues the opportunity to reflect in
detail on how the amendment could be adopted in a way that is fair and
secures access to justice for the poorest. I hope that breathing space
will be taken advantage
of.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000026">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
potential exception proposed in the amendment is limited to cases that
include claims brought by individuals in tort. It would not apply to
businesses making claims against other businesses and to commercial
disputes. The amendment is aimed at the imbalance of power and the
inequality of bargaining position between poor individuals and the
large multinationals that they might seek to proceed
against.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000027">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I might be stating the obvious, but a theme of
this group of amendments will be inequality of arms. It is good that we
start with this pair of amendments, because there can be no greater
disparity than between people from the developing world living in the
most basic circumstances and the most powerful corporations in the
world.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000028">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> My hon. Friend makes absolutely the right point. If
there is concern that we would see better-off individuals who could
rely on actions in their own countries being tempted to bring such
cases to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 476<a class="bkMark" name="Column476">&#160;</a>
                  </div>court, the amendment suggests a further limitation that torts must occur
where the damage has taken place in a developing country. The amendment
defines a developing country with reference to per capita gross
national income. I have not made up that definition; it is used by the
World Bank. I accept that that could bring in a number of countries in
eastern Europe as well as in Africa, Asia and south America, so I am
certainly open to considering other definitions of “developing
country” if Minsters want to put forward alternatives. None the
less, we are all clear that, as my hon. Friend said, we are talking
about some of the poorest people in the poorest countries in the
world.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
exception would be further limited to cases certified as appropriate by
a High Court judge. Those cases could not reach court without going
through the preliminary hurdle of a judge verifying that it was
appropriate for them to be heard in the UK. The judge’s
criterion would be that the proceedings should be considered by a court
in England or Wales to be in the interests of justice. That would
exclude weak cases, because we do not think it right in the interests
of justice that such cases should go to court. It would exclude cases
without adequate links to the UK jurisdiction. I am not suggesting that
every activity undertaken in a developing country by a multinational
with a UK base or UK interests has to come back to the UK; a clear link
to the UK parent would have to be demonstrated if such cases were to be
heard here. It would also exclude cases involving very low-level
complaints, because it is clearly inappropriate for civil cases to be
heard in court if the subject matter is
trifling.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000030">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
would also expect the judge to apply a criterion relating to the
disparity of resources between the claimant and the defendant, to which
my hon. Friend has just alluded. The exception would be reserved for
cases where claimants are weak and defendants are strong. Of course,
the reality is that defendants would probably be sued only if they were
substantial concerns, as otherwise the ability to give effect to the
judgment and to award damages would be
worthless.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000031">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Cases
would be able to come to the UK courts only if, in the absence of the
ordinary rules on success fees, the claimants would be at significant
risk of being unable to secure effective legal representation.
Claimants would qualify for the exception only if they could show that
an apparently meritorious claim would be stifled if it was impossible
to recover a success
fee.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000032">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
concept of certification by a High Court judge may seem an extra
procedural and bureaucratic hurdle to put in the way of such cases and
therefore likely to cause additional cost. I recognise that, but as I
have said, such cases are serious, significant, and few and far
between. An example of the concept of certification by a High Court
judge is in domestic cases where such factors pertain and it is
important that cases are brought to justice. In that respect, the
amendment is based on the tried and tested position in public law
cases; for example, for judicial review. In that instance, cases
brought in the public interest that might otherwise be stifled by the
risk of having to pay costs to a successful defendant can be subject to
a pre-emptive order by a High Court judge either preventing the
defendant from recovering any costs or limiting the defendant to
recovering a specified sum that the claimant could afford to pay.

               <p class="tabbed">In
effect, amendment 192 would provide that a High Court judge may allow a
success fee to be recovered if that is the only realistic way to bring
a claim in cases involving multinational corporations, where it is in
the interests of justice to bring such cases to court. Similarly,
amendment 193, which I shall say more about, would protect the
recoverability of after the event insurance premiums in those
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000034">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">All those
individuals and organisations say clearly that, if the amendments I
propose are not made, it will be impossible to bring cases involving
multinational corporations and human rights abuses overseas to courts
in future. That will be of real concern to all hon. Members, who are
anxious about our obligations to some of the poorest people in the
world. I was pleased to note that the Lord Chancellor appeared to be
listening with particular attention during the excellent speech made by
my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan on Second Reading; I hope that
means he will think carefully about possible solutions to improve the
Bill’s operation. I am also aware that human rights around the
world has been a long-standing concern to many Liberal Democrat
colleagues—and rightly so. They have spoken up courageously many
times about the importance of protecting individuals against human
rights abuses by large organisations, so they will share my
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000036">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is very
important that we protect access to justice in the UK in such cases; it
shames this country if we do not. We in the UK should aspire to and
achieve the highest standards of corporate governance for UK-owned and
controlled multinational corporations, not only for the obvious ethical
reasons that go with such behaviour, but in the interests of business
fairness. It is right to reward good behaviour by corporations and to
penalise bad behaviour; not to do so creates an imbalance between those
organisations that abide by corporate responsibilities and those that
do not. It gives unfair business advantage to the unscrupulous, which
cannot be in the interests of good commerce.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000037">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As I have
said, it is important that we offer access to justice when people have
suffered real harm. Such people must be able to bring their cases to
the UK courts and to access UK law in pursuing their claims for
compensation, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 478<a class="bkMark" name="Column478">&#160;</a>
                  </div>because of the significantly stronger protections and general propriety
and integrity of the UK justice system. Such cases and the harm caused
are shocking. In  the Trafigura case, as hon. Members will
know, some 100,000 people in Ivory Coast, which is one of
the poorest countries in the world, suffered from the dumping of toxic
waste on their doorstep—their coastline—with no regard
for their well-being, health and quality of life. It must be possible
for those who suffer such harm to challenge the dismissive and arrogant
attitudes of those who cause it. In that instance, I am pleased to say,
a substantial settlement of more than $150 million
was—<em>[</em>

money. It is important that they can come to the UK courts to get those
meaningful levels of compensation, although, as I shall describe
shortly, some limitations have affected the levels of the compensation
that they can achieve. If the hon. Gentleman is trying to suggest that
people who are already the most vulnerable should not be able to claim
legitimate compensation because it costs a lot of money, I am shocked.

to another such case, which may bring home the depth of the outrage and
abuse that we are talking about. In the Monterrico case in Peru in
2005, a multinational corporation, through its local security company,
in an attempt to drive away farmers who were seeking to defend their
land and prevent the development of mining activity, subjected some of
those very poor farmers to beatings and sexual assaults, and held them
captive and subject to hooding. That was a fundamental abuse of their
human rights, so it is right that they were able to bring their case to
court and in due course received a substantial out of court settlement.
We are talking about significant abuse and a huge imbalance of power.

seek
redress.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000043">&#160;</a>

if the success fee is shared in the way he suggests, those cases

cost being paid to claimant’s solicitors in such cases, there is
a simple way to reduce costs overnight: they could restore legal aid.
As Lord Justice Jackson would say, that would the most efficient and

little more about the moral context before I go on to success fees,
after the event insurance premiums and so on, because that is the meat
of the amendment and hon. Members are anxious to address it. In 2005,
John Ruggie, the UN Special Representative for Business and Human
Rights, produced a framework that I think provides the governing
principles under which these cases should come to court and the
UK’s obligations in relation to them. The framework imposes a
duty on Governments to protect the human rights of individuals against
third parties, including business; creates a responsibility on business
to protect human rights; and requires that Governments secure the
existence of adequate legal mechanisms to provide a remedy for
individuals whose rights are harmed.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000048">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is to the
credit of the UK Government that they accept the importance of the
framework and the international human rights obligations on our country
that arise from it. I am pleased that they endorsed the protection,
responsibility and remedy framework as recently as June this year at
the Human Rights Council in Geneva, where the Government reaffirmed
their commitment to implementing the guiding principles that accompany
that framework, including principle 26, which
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000049">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“States
should take appropriate steps to ensure the effectiveness of domestic
judicial mechanisms when addressing human rights-related claims against
business, including considering ways to reduce legal, practical and
other relevant barriers that could lead to a denial of access to
remedy.”<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000268">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Although
the UK Government have confirmed their support for provision of access
to legal remedies in such circumstances, the proposals in the Bill will
prevent such cases from going ahead, in breach of those international
obligations. To understand why, it is important 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 480<a class="bkMark" name="Column480">&#160;</a>
                  </div>that we understand the drivers of cost, as I think the hon. Member for
Wyre and Preston North suggested, how such costs are currently funded
and shared, and the impact of the proposed
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000050">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Such
cases are inevitably costly and complex, for a number of reasons.
First, there are logistical factors that drive up the costs—the
victims and the evidence that needs to be gathered are overseas, so it
costs extra to collect the information required and to bring the case
fully prepared to court. The fact that the claims are usually against
the UK parent company rather than the operating subsidiary means that
claimants need to overcome the corporate veil obstacle and investigate
any relationships that may exist between various entities within the
multinational conglomerate. Although that was not the case for
Trafigura, it often is when large multinational groups are involved.
That adds a further level of complexity and cost.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000051">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The financial
and reputational implications for multinational corporations challenged
in such cases are absolutely huge, so they inevitably and
understandably instruct the best, top-quality international lawyers,
who are not cheap. They rightly, on behalf of their clients, seek to
unpeg each element of the claimants’ case, so a high number of
procedural and substantive challenges and diversions is therefore
possible as a case proceeds. The evidence is likely to be technically
complex,  often involving and requiring highly specialist
expert reports in a range of professional fields—engineering,
environmental science, chemistry and medicine.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000052">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To have any
prospect of securing justice for victims in such cases,
claimants’ lawyers will need to allocate substantial resources
to them—comparable, or at as comparable as they can achieve, to
those deployed by the lawyers for the multinational corporation. It is
important to note there is a high level of public interest in such
cases coming to court, so while I accept that they are not low-cost
cases—quite the opposite—it is exceptionally important
that such cases can proceed. Because legal aid is no longer available
for such cases, most are now funded through conditional fee agreements,
under which claimant lawyers are paid only if they win. The model
enables a slightly more level playing between the victims of human
rights violations, who are often poor, and multimillion-dollar
corporations, but it also means that claimants’ lawyers shoulder
a significant financial burden before the case is resolved and face the
risk of losing all costs if the case is unsuccessful. It is in
recognition of those risks that claimants’ lawyers have been
allowed to charge success fees—an uplift on their standard fees
that is recoverable from the multinational corporation if the case is
successful.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000053">&#160;</a>

hon. Friend has said, it can be reduced by the court, and often it is
not 100%. Equally, the reason for having the 100% success fee—I
will not defend it when I speak—is that it is a major incentive
to defendants to settle early, when they should do so. That is what

                  </strong> I am aghast at what the Minister says, as though
success fees are driven up by poor claimants represented by largely
public interest lawyers who ultimately make very little money out of
such cases. They start work on a number of cases that never come to
court—they simply identify those that are not too difficult to
take forward—for which there is never an agreed settlement and
for which they receive no fees whatsoever. The success fee enables them
to take the very small number of meritorious and likely to be effective
cases through the courts to redress the imbalance of power between a
very well funded multinational and a very poorly funded claimant. As he
rightly says, the success fee need not be 100%, but there is an
imbalance of power in negotiations on it. If the court felt that
success fees were so unfairly weighted to the claimant, it could take
the opportunity to reduce them. It is important that the Minister
considers why that does not happen and whether the fees are, in fact,
an accurate and fair reflection of the risks borne by the
claimant.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000061">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Cases
might last for years, requiring the deployment of substantial resources

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 482<a class="bkMark" name="Column482">&#160;</a>
                  </div>that brings. The disbursements involved in such cases are usually
exceptionally high, often running to hundreds of thousands of pounds,
sometimes millions. It is therefore important to note the development
of after the event insurance, which is a market response to cater for
such risk and which serves to reassure usually very poor claimants that
they can pay their costs if the claim is successfully
defended.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000062">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Firstassist
Legal Expenses pointed out that even where such insurance is in place,
defendants may seek to increase the costs or try to seek security for
the costs, which is a further barrier to a poor claimant bringing
forward a claim. They might argue that after the event insurance cannot
be relied upon; that the policy will be voided by the actions of the
claimant and the insurer will seek to wriggle out of the obligation; or
that it is not set at a sufficient level, although in practice that is
rare. Claimants could seek a cost-capping order themselves, but as the
case proceeds defendants often seek to challenge such orders and try to
have them
revised.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000063">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
combination of success fees and after the event insurance offers the
only way to even up the imbalance of power and enable cases to proceed.
The Government’s proposals would undermine the effectiveness of
the approach that has evolved and result in cases being kept out of
court. The non-recoverability of success fees in jurisdictions such as
Australia and South Africa, where they are not allowed, has shown that
in such jurisdictions the cases virtually never come to court. If
success fees are capped at 25%, as the Government propose—I
think the Minister sought to address that point a moment ago—in
the majority of cases that will prove to be insufficient to meet the
risks and costs of proceeding with cases. It is not that the costs are
being unnecessarily driven up and that the success fee is a driver of
high levels of costs. The costs are endemic to the nature of such
cases, and a cap of 25% on a success fee would mean that the costs were
not adequately covered by the success
fee.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000064">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is also right to note that the compensation secured by victims is often
too low to meet the success fee. For example, when having regard to
compensation and the loss that the victim has suffered, the monetary
value of such loss will be lower in a poorer country and the value of
compensation reduced. That combination—the triple whammy of
non-recoverability of after the event insurance premiums,
non-recoverability of success fees from a defendant and the capping of
them at 25%, and non-recoverability of basic costs to the extent that
they fail the proportionality test—would make it impossible for
cases to
proceed.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000065">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
success fee cap and the limitations that Ministers propose will bear
especially harshly on victims if compensation is—as it often
is—less than the amount of the costs incurred. The disparity
between compensation and costs in multinational human rights cases has
become worse as a result of the Rome II regulation 864/2007 coming into
force. The effect of articles 4 and 15 is that compensation will
usually be assessed in accordance with local law, which in the case of
developing countries will invariably be significantly lower than
compensation awarded by a UK court. Previously, the House of Lords in
Harding <em>v.</em> Wealands had held that assessment of compensation
would be assessed in accordance with English procedure. However, Rome
II will completely undermine any prospect of recovering success fees
from 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 483<a class="bkMark" name="Column483">&#160;</a>
                  </div>claimants’ compensation in multinational human rights cases. The
effect of Rome II is even more serious in relation to the proposed
changes to the principle of proportionality, which I will say a little
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000066">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
think I am right in saying that Ministers propose to increase the level
of general damages by 10% to ameliorate some of the adverse effect of
the non-recoverability of success fees from defendants. The problem
with that is that the disparity between costs and compensation common
in such cases is such that such an increase would not be anywhere near
sufficient to rectify the position in the vast majority of cases. It is
also difficult to quantify what the damages would have been and so what
would constitute a 10% uplift. There is no objective figure that we can
say would have been the position and would be the extent to which a 10%
uplift would improve
matters.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000067">&#160;</a>

the point raised by the hon. Member for Hammersmith regarding the
mechanism by which a 10% uplift would be applied. That may well be
amplified later, but I would have thought that any court dealing with
that would first assess the level of damages. For example, if the case
was about personal injury, the court would take guidelines, look at the
type of injury, assess the level of damages according to those
guidelines, and then impose a 10% increase. I suppose an analogy is
that when a criminal court comes to a view of passing, say, a
three-year sentence, it applies the discount of one third for a guilty
plea. The Minister may be able to help us, but that is how I think it
would work in
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000072">&#160;</a>

negotiations. It is therefore difficult to know whether an extra
element has been built in to cover the earlier costs of bringing those
cases to settlement. The other difficulty is that in any event, even

the costs of bringing  the cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000073">&#160;</a>

guidelines, so that there are new levels and so that we know what the
enhanced levels are. That has been done before, during a review of
general damages. The onus could be put on the parties, if they come
with a negotiation settlement, or in submissions to say, “This
is where we are, and this is where we will be with 10%.” Or it
could be simply be, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and

that has been incorporated. That is four ways to do it. Perhaps the

and I—and I hope the Minister and others—want to achieve.
We want at least to ensure the possibility of bringing meritorious
cases, so that in a tiny number of circumstances where significant
damage is suffered by some of the poorest at the hands of some of the
richest, those cases can come to the UK courts. I am grateful to the
hon. Gentleman for his helpful
intervention.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000082">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Time
is pressing, so I shall make some progress. I want to say a little more
about after the event insurance premiums. The Bill proposes that after
the event premiums would not generally be recoverable from defendants
in such cases. There is a contrast to be drawn with the proposals that
Ministers are bringing forward in respect of clinical negligence cases,
where I understand they intend to exempt the exclusion of after the
event insurance premiums. If that is true, it is welcome and would
recognise the specialist and costly expert evidence that is required in
many clinical negligence cases. However, as I have been trying to
explain, multinational human rights cases often require equally
specialist and costly expert evidence. To meet those costs, claimants
in such cases will still need to obtain after the event cover. The
magnitude of after the event premiums is such that unless they are
recoverable from multinational corporations, claimant firms will be
deterred from taking such cases on, further undermining the viability
of the
claims.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000083">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
let me say something about proportionality. The Government indicated in
their response to Lord Justice Jackson’s proposals that a new
test of proportionality would be introduced to assess the
recoverability of base costs, replacing the existing test, whereby a
court may still award base costs that are disproportionate to the
compensation awarded, provided that such costs were necessary to the
success of the claim. I accept that this issue is not raised in the
Bill, but I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify the
Government’s intentions. Are changes expected to the provisions
on proportionality and base costs, and if so, might they be effected
through changes to court rules or through
regulations?<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000084">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
I have said, costs in multinational cases invariably exceed the
compensation awarded, yet those costs should still be regarded as
proportionate, on the grounds of complexity and the importance of the
litigation or because the additional costs were generated by the
conduct of the defendant—the specific let-out that Lord Justice
Jackson proposed. However, when it comes to the assessment of costs,
multinationals will always argue that the recoverable costs should be
limited to the level of compensation awarded and that factors of
importance and complexity should not be applied for the benefit of
claimants.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000085">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As a result,
claimants’ lawyers will face the prospect of investing enormous
amounts of time, money and resources without knowing whether they will
recover anything more than a fraction of the costs, even if a case is
successful. Consequently, if implemented without the let-out clause
proposed by Lord Justice Jackson, this proposal would constitute a
strong disincentive against claimants’ lawyers taking on such
cases. Claims on behalf of victims in the developing world, where 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 486<a class="bkMark" name="Column486">&#160;</a>
                  </div>compensation levels are already generally much lower owing to the Rome
II regulation, would become almost impossible to
litigate under the new test. Very early on in the case, legal costs
would surpass the levels of compensation achievable, thus becoming
potentially disproportionate. That would be a further disincentive to
claimants’ lawyers taking on such cases. Claimants from the
developing world would be particularly disadvantaged.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000086">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In the
current context, where already, only a tiny handful of lawyers are able
and prepared to take on such cases—because of the high risk, the
uncertain prospects of success, the uncertain duration of such cases,
which could be long, and the high level of resources needed to run them
effectively, all of which will put significant pressure on the legal
firm’s cash flow, even if the case is eventually won—the
Bill’s overall impact is likely to worsen the position, which
means that no lawyer in this country will be able to take on such cases
in future. Leigh Day has said that it could not, morally or
practically, take after the event costs and success fees out of
compensation paid to poor and vulnerable victims, and that success fees
would be insufficient at 25% to cover the risks of taking such cases.
The conclusion is that access to justice for those in developing
countries in our courts would be
removed.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000087">&#160;</a>

a good encouragement to multinational companies to put their houses in

such actions being facilitated in courts in other jurisdictions around
the world increases, we do not want to go in the opposite direction
either. It would be to the shame of this country if we sought to
restrict access to justice in our courts in such cases as other
jurisdictions sought to open it
up.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000091">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion—you will be glad to hear that I really am drawing my
remarks to a close, Mr Hollobone—the consequence of the
Government’s proposals, if unamended, would be that only the
strongest and most straightforward 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 487<a class="bkMark" name="Column487">&#160;</a>
                  </div>cases would be able to go ahead, and those cases would be few and far
between. Defendants would put more pressure on claimants to
settle—and to settle for less—rather than claimants
risking costs that might not be recoverable even if they win. I have
done my best in drafting the amendments to put tight constraints on
when success fees and after the event costs could be recovered, and to
put constraints on the nature of such cases. However, I accept that the
detailed drafting of the amendment could be improved, as the hon.
Member for South Swindon rightly pointed out. If the Minister takes on
board the spirit of the amendment today but comes up with more tightly
drawn proposals later, I should be interested to hear
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000092">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is important to note that my proposals would not cost a penny to the
public purse—the costs would be borne in the industry—nor
are they anything to do with an out-of-control compensation culture.
That idea has already been discredited thanks to the work of Lord
Young: it is certainly not the case that poor and vulnerable people in
far-away countries are ambulance-chasing through the UK courts. Also,
if anyone is concerned that tightening up our jurisdiction and allowing
such meritorious cases to come to our courts will drive multinationals
away from doing business or basing themselves in the UK—that
concern has not been raised, but it might be in someone’s
mind—I should say that those jurisdictional battles were fought
a decade or so ago, and they seem to have made no difference to the
willingness of multinationals to base themselves here.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000093">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To conclude,
the amendments go to the heart of driving the good corporate governance
and behaviour to which my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith
referred. Most importantly, they go to the heart of our moral
responsibility as global citizens to provide justice and protection

               <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston should not apologise for
the length of time that she has taken, because every word was relevant
and she has addressed an important topic. I praise her for the
amendment’s drafting, notwithstanding the interesting debate
that she had with the hon. Member for South Swindon. It is much better
than my amendments, which we shall debate shortly, because it is much
more explicit and goes into detail. I do not need to go into such great
detail, but I shall make one or two comments. As my hon. Friend
indicated, I shall make some general remarks on our approach to part 2
and what is wrong with the Government’s approach when I speak
about my amendments in the next group, but for now I shall address
amendments 192 and 193.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000096">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The matter of
proportionality is raised, which the Government might think is the
easiest to sell. It is good for proportionality to be discussed at an
early stage, because prima facie costs should not be
excessive—they should not be greater than damages. Most men or
women in the street will find the prospect of lawyers raking in money
while meritorious claimants or defendants are financially limited
obnoxious. The Minister has built his case against CFAs partly on that
basis, which we shall discuss shortly.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000097">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Proportionality
is not always an infallible doctrine, however, as in Trafigura-style
cases, to use the shorthand. My hon. Friend has described
the view on both sides. The defendants are
organisations with deep pockets that are keen—for their
financial or reputational benefit—to maintain that they are not
liable, even when they clearly are. As I have mentioned in
interventions, it is not beyond such organisations—particularly
those in US, but also those here or in other jurisdictions—to
manipulate the justice system by drawing out and delaying proceedings
in the hope that the claimant runs out of money, patience or
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000098">&#160;</a>
               </p>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">Claimants
are often likely to be impecunious people. My hon. Friend the Member
for Stretford and Urmston mentioned Rome II, and since
2009—contrary to the previous practice of the British courts,
but this is now binding—in such cases, damages are likely to be
based on an assessment of what is appropriate for the particular
circumstances of the claimants. Therefore, for a group of miners in
Peru or a group of fishermen or villagers in west Africa, damages will
not be of the same order as for claimants recovering general or special
damages in the UK, even given the criticism of the value of general
damages in the UK, which we will discuss
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000099">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
that situation, particularly if it will not be permitted for ATE
premiums to be recovered from defendants, two consequences might
result. First, costs will inevitably be higher than damages in some
cases, and the Government will have to state whether that means that
none of those cases should go ahead. Clearly, not only do claimants
have a moral and legal right but, as the right hon. Member for
Carshalton and Wallington mentioned, the importance of those cases goes
way beyond their significance to the individual claimants, even in
multi-party actions, because corporations—they sometimes have
the resources of small states—will be held to account, and there
is therefore a wider public
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000100">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Should
the Government’s proposals go ahead, the second consequence is
that if such cases go to court—lawyers are strongly arguing that
they will not, and that there is simply no possibility of
claimants’ lawyers funding those cases—and claimants win,
the success fee costs or the ATE premiums will be greater than the
damages awarded in almost every case. The Government’s solution
to what they see as abuses is therefore nonsense, particularly in such
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000101">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have international obligations. I pay tribute to colleagues at the
Department for International Development for having maintained through
difficult financial times a role in the international community in our
trying not just to do our bit, but to give some leadership on aid to
developing countries. It would be good if other developed countries
showed the same attitude as the previous Government showed and which, I
hope, this Government will continue to show. Those are international
obligations, and we should be just as proud of our civil justice system
as we are of what we give in international
aid.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000102">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
good amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston
closely prescribes the circumstances in which the success fees would
apply. It gives a great deal of discretion and provides several hurdles
that claimants must overcome to take such cases to court, apart from
such obvious difficulties as the complexity of the cases and the
difficulties, which we have heard about, of dealing with that kind of
client.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000103">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">Given
all that, I am sure that the Government accept that we should take
pride in the ability of our justice system. We do not have the US
legislation that makes specific provision, but we have a
well-established and developed law of tort, which provides for such
cases and evolves in the way that common law often does. It is regarded
as an example internationally. There are cases in Canada and other
common law jurisdictions. There are also cases in Europe, although I
think they are more likely to be based on breach of regulations or
contractual disputes rather than on tort. To that extent, we are
leading the way outside the
US.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">Now,
because of Government proposals, we have had an about-face and the UK
is being criticised. My hon. Friend mentioned the letter from the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Business and Human
Rights that was published in the press earlier this year. I know the
Government will take it very seriously, because of what it states.
Whereas:<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000104">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
Government’s response includes the understandable aims of
‘seeking to reduce the unfair costs suffered by the many
businesses, individuals and other
organizations…’…Three related aspects of the
proposed reforms could, when implemented together, constitute a
significant barrier to legitimate business-related human rights claims
being brought before UK courts in situations where alternative sources
of remedy are unavailable. They are: abolishing the recoverability of
the Conditional Fee Agreement (CFA) success fee from the losing side;
abolishing recoverability of ‘after the event’ (ATE)
insurance premiums in non-personal injury cases; and introducing a new
test of proportionality in costs
assessment.”<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000272">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
hope the Minister will give the amendment the attention it deserves and
answer it in detail. I hope that in doing so he will deal with the
point that the commissioner has raised and also deal with criticisms
from the Committee on the Elimination of Racial
Discrimination:<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000105">&#160;</a>

Committee encourages the State party to take appropriate legislative
and administrative measures to ensure that acts of transnational
corporations registered in the State party comply with the provisions

State party should ensure that no obstacles are introduced in the law
that prevent the holding of such transnational corporations accountable
in the State party’s courts when such violations are committed
outside the State party. The Committee reminds the State party to
sensitize corporations registered in its territory of their social
responsibilities in the places where they

               </p>
               <p>Allowing
for the international language, with which we all struggle, I think
that what is being said is very clear. International organisations, to
which we are party and to which I hope the Government will have regard,
are seriously worried about the effects of the proposed legislation on
cases of this
kind.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000106">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
the UN Special Representative’s letter, a reference was made to
concessions in personal injury cases  in relation to ATE
insurance—perhaps a slight misunderstanding—but there are
concessions in relation to clinical negligence. I hope that the
Minister will clarify or at least give an indication of what the
regulations are likely to say about what precisely is being exempted.
We know that the Government have considered the matter and that it will
be near impossible to get clinical negligence cases into court without
some provision being made for recovering ATE costs. We will come on to
the practicalities of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000107">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">What
is different in such cases? The ATE market is more developed now than
it was 10 years ago, which allows some cases to go forward. However,
even if the Government wish to cherry-pick and to say that there 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 490<a class="bkMark" name="Column490">&#160;</a>
                  </div>are some meritorious types of claim and some less meritorious types,
surely the Government should be interested in a species of negligence
causing personal injury</p>
               <p class="tabbed">Multi-party
actions are not always founded on personal injury claims. They might be
founded on environmental claims, so—the Minister can clarify
matters—presumably they will fall outside the concessions under
the legislation on personal injury claims, including the 10% uplift. We
have talked a little about that, but even if it were absolutely clear
how that will happen and what the quantum would be, it is likely, given
that local circumstances would dictate the level of damages, to be a
fairly nugatory sum compared with costs. Even if that applies, it is
not likely to make a
difference.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000108">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for South Swindon referred to the letter from several
extremely well-respected organisations, and members of the Committee
will have received briefings from the Corporate Responsibility
Coalition, Amnesty, CAFOD, Friends of the Earth, Oxfam, Traidcraft and
others. The Government regularly consult those organisations, greatly
respect them and will want to take notice of them. It is not only the
Opposition and the lawyers whom the Government think might have a
vested interest in such matters, but those organisations that speak up
most often for those people throughout the world who suffer, whether
from natural disasters or man-made disasters caused by companies that
make their profits, are registered and are responsible to legal
authorities in this country. My hon. Friend the Member for Stretford
and Urmston has dealt with most of what needs to be said, but will the
Minister say who will benefit from the change in the law that he
proposes in respect of multi-party actions against multinational
companies? The answer is—it is perhaps the clearest example of
all those that we will investigate today—that benefit will go to
those who already have power, wealth and influence against those who do
not.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000109">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have read the Government’s consultation documents and the
Minister’s statement in preparation for the Bill. The Minister
maintains that both access to justice and fairness in the ability
between the parties in litigation will not be affected by the Bill. I
have set out the clearest possible example of when that will happen, so
I ask him, as well as dealing with the issues of detail that my hon.
Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston raised, to deal with that
point of principle, too. Does he accept that, if the amendments are not
accepted, the ability to make multi-party claims, of which there have
been no more than 10 or a dozen over the past 20 years, but which is a
growing—albeit slowly—area of law, will simply disappear?
It might be arguable in respect of other matters. We could be talking
about cases with a 50%, 55% or 60% chance of success, what risks
lawyers will be willing to take and whether the market will adapt to a
contingency fee rather than a conditional fee agreement, but in such
cases all those who have considered such matters and spoken about them
will say that there is no prospect of such litigation
continuing.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000110">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">As my hon.
Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston said, the Liberal Democrat

internationalist party. I genuinely believe that it is concerned about
such actions, so I will put the same question to the right hon. Member

<div class="columnNumber">

                     </span>
                  </strong> Good morning, Mr Hollobone. We have moved on to
part 2, which deals with litigation funding and cost. Clauses 41 and 43
will amend the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 so that success fees
under a conditional fee agreement—subject to one exception,
which is after the event insurance premiums—will no longer be
recovered from a losing party in any proceedings. I say to the hon.
Member for Hammersmith that we have nothing against CFAs per se or
against developing the law of tort in that area. Our problem lies in
the distortion to CFAs that took place under the last
Administration.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000112">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston seek to
permit the Lord Chancellor, by regulation, to continue to allow the
recoverability of success fees from a losing party and certain claims
of damages or breach of contract where the damages are alleged to have
occurred in a developing country, and in those cases, to continue to
allow recoverability of ATE insurance premiums. The hon. Lady has
explained that amendments 192 and 193 seek to protect the rights of
individuals in developing countries to claim damages against large
multinational companies. However, the amendments go much wider than
that and would give such claimants an advantage over other claimants
without real justification. Given the concerns that have been raised
about multinational companies, I will concentrate my response on those
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000113">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
me first address the hon. Member for Hammersmith, who said that the
cheapest way to fund the cases would be through legal aid. Many cases
that are primarily concerned with obtaining damages are excluded from
the scope of the current legal aid scheme. There is a scheme for
excluded cases that allows individual cases to continue to receive
legal aid where, in the particular circumstances of the case, the
failure to do so would be likely to result in a breach of the
individual’s rights to legal aid, the Human Rights Act 1998 or
European law. Claims of such type would be considered for public
funding on a case-by-case basis, but Lord Justice Jackson did not
recommend retaining legal aid for such cases. I should also advise the
hon. Gentleman that he seems to have committed his party to some
£50 million of cost to the taxpayer.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000114">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let me also
address the 10% uplift in general damages. Although the hon. Gentleman
is right in saying that that is not directly relevant to the
amendments, the issue was raised by various hon. Members, so let me
address it here. Not all the measures in the package of reform require
primary legislation. Qualified one way costs shifting and the new
proportionality test will be implemented through changes to civil
procedurals. The senior judiciary has agreed to look at how to take
forward the increase in general damages for non-pecuniary loss, such as
pain, suffering and loss of amenity in tort cases, by
10%.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000115">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> We had a little sidebar argument about the
increase in damages, and I think we will come on to that later. The
Minister raised the issue of cost. I have 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 492<a class="bkMark" name="Column492">&#160;</a>
                  </div>been listening to him for about a year on the subject now, and he always
says that everything, whatever it is, costs £50 million. I am at
something of a loss as to how claims against
multinational companies funded by a CFA would cost
£50
million.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000116">&#160;</a>

have a strange type of hearing that manipulates everything I say into
something else. The point that I was making to the hon. Member for Wyre
and Preston North was not that we supported the restoration of legal
aid for that, but that if that was the Government’s principal
concern—that they were so concerned about claimants’ cost
in such actions—that was a remedy that they could look at. It is
a matter for the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000118">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman made that
clarification, which is important from his point of view. As the
Committee might know, the Civil Justice Council is an independent body,
which is chaired by the Master of the Rolls. We have asked the CJC to
undertake work in three areas: the behavioural test for QOWCS, the
operation of the original part 36 penalty in higher-value claims and
non-money claims, and the content of a possible practice direction to
support the new test of proportionality. The CJC is actively pursuing
that work, with input from all key
stakeholders.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000119">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Following
the CJC’s preliminary work, a conference of experts on the
detail of how the proposals will be implemented is to be organised by
the CJC at the end of October. There will also be some secondary
legislation under the Bill—which I say for
completeness—specifying the cap on success fees that lawyers may
deduct from the claimant’s damages in personal injury cases at
25% of damages, excluding damages for future care and loss under clause
41(2), and setting out the detail of the recovery of ATE insurance
experts’ reports in clinical negligence cases under clause
43(2).<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000120">&#160;</a>

giving way. I always look at how many pages of notes he has, so I am
not really trespassing on the time of the Committee because his answers
to the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and
Urmston look embarrassingly
brief.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000121">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">So
many regulations are to be made under the Bill that I would not expect
to have them all in front of us—we had that debate a couple of
weeks ago too—but on this issue I would have expected a much
clearer indication from the Minister as to how the Government intend to
implement their replacement for CFA. QOWCS and a 10% uplift are
absolutely fundamental, yet we do not have
anything.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000122">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I have just outlined the process, but let me
speak a little more about proportionality, because the hon. Member for
Stretford and Urmston was as interested in what that would involve as
she was in the process. The Government will introduce a new test of
proportionality to recoverable costs and a new definition of
proportionality. The requirement would be, first, to assess the
reasonableness of the work done item by item; the court would then only
consider the proportionality 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 493<a class="bkMark" name="Column493">&#160;</a>
                  </div>of the resulting total amount in accordance with the new test. If the
total costs are deemed to be disproportionate, the court would make a
reduction to a proportionate level. The new test will introduce the
requirement for the courts to consider the proportionality of global
costs as the dominant test in civil litigation, over either
reasonableness or necessity. The new test will not only look at the
sums at issue but also take account of the complexity of the
litigation, the additional work generated by the defendant and wider
factors such as reputation or public
importance.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000123">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments under discussion are neither necessary nor appropriate. The
Government believe that claims against multinational companies will
still be possible once our CFA reforms are implemented. One of our
major reasons overall for the reforms, however, is that we believe that
the costs involved will be more proportionate to the sums at issue. The
Bill seeks to address not the validity of the claims but the iniquity
of a system that can allow legal costs to escalate significantly more
than the related damages. That is core to the next group of amendments,
so I will save most of my comments for that
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000124">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I am disappointed in that philosophical approach.
Is the Minister saying that the effect of Rome II, which will
inevitably depress the level of the compensation awarded, is an
opportunity that Ministers have seized so that it will be almost
impossible for some such cases to come to
court?<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000125">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Lady will hear my later comments, which
will be that we have a system in this country that is not replicated
anywhere else in the world. It is worth emphasising that: the current
system of recoverable success fees and recoverable ATE insurance
premiums, with the consequence of high costs, is not seen in any other
jurisdiction in the world. The impact of the amendments would preserve
the unique threat of high costs against British firms that does not
exist for other firms from other countries in the world. That cannot be
good for British businesses operating abroad.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000126">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">CFAs will
continue to be available, but the Bill also extends funding options.
Under clause 42, the Government will allow damages-based agreements to
be used for the first time to fund such claims. Group actions, in
particular, are suited to DBAs, because legal representatives can
recover their fees as a percentage of the damages awarded to each
successful
claimant.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000127">&#160;</a>

another passage of <em>Hansard</em> that might come back to haunt him.
First, he is wrong, because, as we have said, specific legislation in
the US allows for that type of litigation, which is far more developed
than it is here. Secondly, other developed jurisdictions are catching
up with the position here. The conclusion that one may reach is not
that the Minister perceives an unfair advantage to British
companies—excluding their being held to account for the
appalling things that they might do in the developing world—but
that he generally intends to ensure that there is impunity for
multinational corporations against the people to whom they do
harm.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000128">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Stretford and Urmston is concerned that damages may become
too low under CFAs. As I said, DBAs will be available, and group
actions are particularly suited to them because legal representatives
can recover their fees as a percentage of the damages awarded to each
successful claimant. In Trafigura, there were 30,000 claimants, so DBA
might have been an attractive option. As the hon. Member for Stretford
and Urmston said, Motto and others <em>v.</em> Trafigura was one of the
leading cases brought against a multinational company under a no win,
no fee agreement. In that case, the defendant paid out some £30
million in damages to the 30,000 claimants in the Ivory Coast, which
was, on average, £1,000 damages for each
claimant.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000130">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
costs claimed by the claimants, however, were almost £105
million, including success fees and an after-the-event insurance
premium of £9 million. I repeat: damages awarded totalled
£30 million, with an average of £1,000 each; legal costs
sought by the claimant lawyers were almost £105 million, which
is some three and a half times as much as the damages secured. Those
costs are currently before the courts for
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000131">&#160;</a>

such cases are very high, but will he tell us to what degree such costs
are driven by the nature of the case and the behaviour of the
multinationals? He seems to imply that the costs arrive out of the
ether at an exceptionally high level, but there are underlying drivers,

               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments would not meet the intended purpose of the legislation,
which is to reduce litigation costs; it would allow such costs to
continue to escalate as I have described. The proposed certification
process would open up uncertainty and significant prospects of a
satellite litigation—which, again, would increase
costs—relating to the criteria for certifying claims as suitable
for exemption from the new CFA regime. For example, where the amendment
refers to the proposed claimant’s resources, what is meant by
“significantly less”? Would that mean that claimants and
their solicitors would be uncertain whether the exemption proposed in
the amendment would apply at the outset of the

As my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston has said, they
are ignoring why costs reach that sort of level. Costs must be
justified and, as the Minister has said, they are currently being
assessed. That is particularly important in cases such as that of
Trafigura, which, as we know from its involvement with the
super-injunction, was  the most obdurate and stubborn
defendant, when it should have considered its own liability and made an
admission sooner.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000136">&#160;</a>

confirm to the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston that the
Government are carefully following developments in this area. She is
right in saying that the Lord Chancellor is, as I am, keen to maintain
a provision for human rights protection. She asked whether the courts
routinely reduce success fees. The courts can reduce the level of such
fees recoverable from the other side, but it is a long and expensive
process. Since Rogers <em>v.</em> Merthyr Tydfil, a 2006 Appeal Court
case, it is difficult to challenge the level of ATE insurance premiums
because specific evidence is needed to show that comparable reasonable
cover might have been obtained at a lower
price.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000139">&#160;</a>

anything fundamentally different about these cases that would justify
an exception in the Bill. The package of reform includes some balancing
measures that will assist claimants in the new regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000141">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In personal
injury cases, there will be a cap on the amount of damages that may be
taken as a success fee under a CFA. The cap will be set at 25% of
damages awarded, other than those for future care and loss, and will
help to protect claimants’ damages. In addition, qualified one
way costs shifting will mean that in the majority of personal injury
cases the claimant will not be at risk of having to pay a winning

persuaded the Minister, if not to give me firm guarantees of what the
Government would do to meet the concerns that we have debated this
morning, but at least to assure me that they understand the seriousness
of those concerns and that he would go away and look for ways to
address and to ameliorate them. I am very disappointed that he has
instead largely sought to defend the system that the Bill will
introduce, and the harm that it will do to some of the poorest

looking at some of the other cases. There have not been many, but they
include South African workers poisoned by mercury, Namibian uranium

Peruvian anti-mine protestors, and Colombian campesinos who suffered
damage to land. Those are the sort of claimants in such cases. We have
had no evidence from the Government that such cases with such claimants
against such defendants will be possible. We have not seen such
evidence in impact assessments, and we have seen no evidence on how the

to have taken a simplistic view of such cases, based solely on the

understandable reasons, and high costs, which are also driven by a
range of understandable factors. They have completely missed the

take in our leadership role in relation to the treatment of developing
countries. The Labour Government were the first to introduce a

picked up and continued. The proposals will undermine that

disappointed by what the Minister has

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">I accept that
the nature of such cases, which are long in duration and require highly
technical evidence, drives up costs. The opposite party, the
multinational defendant, will be advised by highly qualified, very
expensive and large legal teams, which means that the claimant must
also seek to acquire the best possible, and therefore costly, legal
advice, if there is to be any equality of arms. Those cases inevitably
involve gathering evidence from overseas and from people who may be
poorly educated. There may be language barriers or geographical and
environmental barriers to obtaining the evidence. Costs are high not
because greedy lawyers are driving up success fees and not because
there is no incentive to keep costs down, but because the cases, if
they are effectively run, are
costly.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000154">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister provided absolutely no evidence of those costs having, in some
way, spiralled out of control. He seemed to think it sufficient to
argue that they were very high in comparison with the level of
compensation that would be paid. However, that is inevitable, as
compensation is set in the context of the countries where the harm
occurs. People live on exceptionally low incomes in those countries, so
the value of the damage that they suffer in monetary
terms—measured by the impact on their income rather than on
their general well-being—will inevitably be very low. Rome II
has underpinned the monetising approach to the quantification of the
harm that people suffer. It is not that the cases are undeserving,
unmeritorious or trivial; it is the legal context that has ensured that
the damages have become so
low.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000155">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has been unable to present any evidence that costs are being
driven up to bankroll lawyers, which was partly implicit in what he
said. If he is correct that fees and costs are being driven up by
lawyers in this country, why are only a tiny number of firms—so
few that we can count them on the fingers of one hand—willing to
take such cases? If they were so remunerative, would we not see UK
legal firms piling in to run them? The contrary is true: only one or
two firms have been able and prepared to take the risk of taking on
such cases. Predominantly, they are public interest firms that
specialise in high-risk cases for vulnerable claimants, for whom levels
of compensation will always be low. If these cases were so lucrative,
we would, I venture to suggest, see a much larger market for them. Far
from there being evidence of lawyers driving up costs, there is an
absence of lawyers willing to take on such cases, which suggests costs
are in no way out of
control.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000156">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
know the Government take their international human rights obligations
seriously, but I do not see how these proposals can possibly meet the
standard we are required to achieve if we are to comply with the human
rights obligations in the framework set out by the special
representative. Not only might that constitute a formal breach of
international obligations, but it will certainly cause, and has already
caused, considerable damage to the UK’s moral reputation in the
world.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000157">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It seems that
this country can be seen as a place where access to justice will be

rewarded and poor practice is punished; and

tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston in that

on some of the points that need to be addressed in relation to part 2,
on both personal injury and CFA and ATE generally.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000203">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To be clear,
there are a number of areas of law that we want to discuss in some
detail. I hope that is acceptable to the Committee. In each case there
is a pair of amendments, one referring to clause 41 and one to clause
43, relating to where the Government’s proposals 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 501<a class="bkMark" name="Column501">&#160;</a>
                  </div>are so unclear or faulted that it would be wrong to proceed in repealing
success fees and ATE as they wish and replacing them, if at all, with
damage-based agreements.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000204">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We will
debate those points in the round, and I will speak now to the
amendments in my name. There are some in the names of my hon. Friends
the Members for Kingston upon Hull East and for Stretford and Urmston.
I will not address those; I do not want to steal their thunder. If
anything needs to be added, I will do that later this afternoon. I am
sure, however, that that is unlikely to be necessary. As I indicated on
the previous set of amendments, I will preface speaking to each
amendment with the common theme going across them. I will not make a
long speech about part 2 in the round, because it is not appropriate,
but there are some common themes to link up. I will use the various
amendments, as we reach them, to illustrate some of the problems that
we have with the Government’s
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000205">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">First,
so that the Minister is clear that we will not always be critical of
him or his stance, the intention of part 2 is perfectly sound, and it
is one with which we have a great deal of sympathy. Were it better
drafted and more of a scalpel than a sledgehammer, he might find us
supporting it. The origins are the wake of the Woolf reforms, which
were highly successful reforms of the civil justice system. They came
in just when I thought I had understood and learned the old rules and
all the precedents, details and footnotes. I was priding myself on
that, and then they all went away. Notwithstanding that and the fears
that the Bar would become redundant, because everyone would understand
the new CPR so clearly that lawyers would no longer be necessary, that
proved, as the Minister would say, not to be the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000206">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Woolf
has transformed civil litigation in this country. It has been hugely
successful. It has simplified matters, it has given clarity and it has
sped up court processes. As Lord Woolf himself said, however, it has
not been as successful as he or others wished in reducing costs in the
civil justice system. It is in everyone’s interest that costs
are reduced. Why would anyone wish costs to be more than absolutely
necessary? As an end in itself, there should not be unjust enrichment
by lawyers or anyone else in the system. There should not be
inefficiencies. It is not just an end in itself; it is also about
discouragement to litigation or an undue penalty on those who are
litigated against if costs are excessive. If the Minister says,
“I am bringing forward part 2 to control costs, whether it be
through malpractice and profiteering, or whether it be simply through
reducing them,” we can all sign up to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000207">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">After
hearing the Minister speak on the matter many times, I consider that he
believes that reducing costs is an end in itself and that that can get
in the way of the merits of cases and the fact that sometimes there has
to be litigation, which sometimes involves high costs, often because of
the misconduct of one of the parties and not always the claimant. While
welcoming the general approach and intention of the Bill, we argue
first that the methods it uses are imperfect per se or are introduced
at the wrong time in the wrong way and, secondly, that there will be
unintended consequences of what are laudable aims. There is a principle
of unintended consequences. Turning what is always a difficult to be
balanced system 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 502<a class="bkMark" name="Column502">&#160;</a>
                  </div>of law for parties with disparate means into one that is no longer a
level playing field is unfair, especially on those of limited
means.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000208">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
illustrate that point, we have set out in the amendments eight to 10
separate areas of law, each with different problems. It is not an
exhaustive list. Last night, I was looking at amendments on
environmental law that we have not tabled because we could go on
endlessly finding other anomalies and exceptions. However,
environmental law is an important area, and I suspect that it is about
to become much more important because of the Government’s
intention to chuck the planning regime out the window and allow a
free-for-all for developers. That could be another area where there
should be more provision to allow cases to go to
court.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000209">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some
of our amendments are related to personal injury. Clinical negligence
is interesting because it is one of the few areas where the Government
have made a concession in ATE premiums—we will explore exactly
how far that goes—yet the Government will not extend such a
concession to related areas of law, such as industrial injury and the
multi-party actions that we have discussed. We will also debate
non-personal injury areas of law, which are caught in exactly the same
way, but do not have the same concession and safeguards. For example,
they are not subject to QOWCS. The Minister said that he wants to talk
about the pros and cons of QOWCS, but at least that will give some
protection although we believe it to be imperfect protection. Why, for
example, should there be that degree of protection in clinical
negligence or personal injury, but not in professional negligence? Why
should someone taking a professional negligence claim against a
solicitor have less protection than someone taking a clinical
negligence case against a surgeon or a hospital? There is no
logic  in
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000210">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government present themselves—the Minister has done so this
morning—as business friendly, even to the extent of showing a
reckless disregard of the interests of vulnerable people in the
developing world. The hon. Gentleman sets out as his stall that that is
what the Government seek to be, yet the provisions under part 2 of the
Bill will have a catastrophic effect on insolvency claims. Most of the
wronged parties are likely to be businesses, many of which will be
small and medium enterprises. Small businesses themselves often make
use of no win, no fee against suppliers or other organisations that
they do not have the financial clout to take to court. Perhaps those
organisations are a bit like the multinational companies and rely on
that. If CFAs are not available, and there is the risk of having to pay
the other side’s costs at the end of the procedure, claims
simply will not exist.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000211">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We will also
talk about media law and privacy law, which could not be more topical.
I do not know whether most of the claims brought against the <em>News of
the World</em> and other media organisations over privacy matters are
funded through no win, no fee agreements, but a substantial number are.
For reasons I will give when I reach that part of the Bill, it seems
very unlikely that people will still be able to bring such claims in
that way. We are therefore handing more power to another big
player—the big media corporations, the media conglomerates and
the Murdochs of this world. If they did not have enough power already,
they are having one of their few vulnerabilities taken away.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000212">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
started his argument by mentioning the phrase “compensation
culture”. He believes that this part of the
Bill is designed to address that culture. In that—he has
probably heard me say this before—he relies on what Lord
Young’s report said. Of course, Lord Young’s report said
that the compensation culture is “perception rather than
reality”, but that never seems to stop the Minister endlessly
repeating the phrase.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000213">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I agree with
the Minister that abuses have grown up, particularly in the personal
injury system—or racket, one might say—and those abuses
need to be tackled. One such abuse, which has perhaps had the most
attention recently, is referral fees. It has had the most attention
because of the very effective campaign run by my right hon. Friend the
Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw). The Minister will hear more from him
at oral questions today; indeed, my right hon. Friend will also
introduce a very timely ten-minute rule Bill on this subject on the
Floor of the House this afternoon, and I hope we
will all be able to be there, although we may not, given
the timing.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000214">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We can,
therefore, all agree about referral fees. However, the clear briefings
given by the Ministry of Justice up until two or three months ago said
that nothing would be done about them. Following the campaign by my
right hon. Friend, however, there was a volte-face, and the Government
are now going to ban them. We know that because the Minister issued a
written ministerial statement last Thursday in which he said he would
ban them. In the press statement accompanying it, he said he did not
know how he was going to do that, and he certainly gave no indication
of when he was going to do it. I would be happy to hear—either
now or when the Minister responds—when we will have an
amendment, or how he intends to deal with referral
fees.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000215">&#160;</a>

me ask another question, which the Minister may want to think about
that. Why have we got ourselves into this situation? We have known
about the Bill for the best part of a year, and referral fees have been
an issue for longer than that. The Minister has met the Association of
British Insurers and other organisations on many occasions. The reason
he gave—I am not stalking him; I was just listening to him on
the radio—<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000217">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Yes, I am sure that is still permissible. The
Minister was asked last Friday morning why he had not done anything
previously. On the “Today” programme, he was asked,
“Have you come round to the idea of a ban?” His response
was, “We are waiting to hear what the Legal Services Board

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
other interesting thing about that series of interviews with the
Minister and the Association of British Insurers, who often seem to do
a Tweedledum and Tweedledee act on such occasions, was the question:
will insurance premiums go down? I would love that question to be
answered with “yes”, but it was not. It was answered
with, “Well, there are lots of considerations. Perhaps. Who
knows? Depends on what the weather is like”, and so on. I was
not that surprised by
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000222">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
was slightly more surprised when I read in <em>The Daily
Mail</em>—<em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>
                  <em>]</em> I only read it
online; I do not buy it. The article cites Admiral, which is clearly
the most successful of the top 10 insurers in financial terms. It gives
the lie to what the other nine in the top 10 say—that they are
all doing us a favour in the premiums that they charge us, because they
are all making a loss. In fact, they make a substantial profit. We then
find out why. The<em> Mail</em> story said:<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000223">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Motorists

head of insurer Admiral has warned…Shares in the company plunged

               </p>
               <p>the
Government would agree with that. The article also
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000224">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Referral

               </p>
               <p>Therefore,
Admiral says that if we go ahead with a ban, insurance premiums would
rise. That is not the way the Government have been selling the
proposals. I understand that they want to be populist about what can
sometimes be an arcane subject, but they must get their house in order.
They are proposing significant changes to the operation of civil
litigation across the board in this country. They cannot do that on the
basis of a few soundbites about car insurance premiums going up or
down. That is a serious issue that needs to be
addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000225">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
matter can be addressed by tackling what the Minister calls the
compensation culture, but what most people simply call a series of
abuses in the system that can be tackled—the text messaging, the
adverts that we see on daytime television, the related scams that go
with selling insurance details, in which insurance companies are one of
the leading offenders, as we have seen, and car hire. Credit hire for
motor vehicles is a disgrace that should have been dealt with earlier,
and which needs to be tackled at some stage. What is the logic of
introducing fundamental changes in the civil justice system before
dealing with relatively straightforward
abuses?<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000226">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">There
are arguments over the amount of fraud and about how to deal with
injuries, whiplash injuries in particular. Those matters are being
effectively—far more effectively than by the
Government—pursued by my right hon. Friend the Member for
Blackburn in his ten-minute rule Bill. Even if the Government do not
adopt that Bill, I hope that they will respond at the appropriate time
to the proposals and the specific issues raised by my right hon.

               <p class="tabbed">At this stage
of proceedings, given that we are already well into Committee stage and
discussing part 2, why are the Government still so far from introducing
any proposals to tackle such obvious abuses? Instead, they have
leapfrogged that by deciding that CFAs need to be done away with
wholesale. It may be that there is a better system than the current
one, but surely it would be logical to deal with that as it is before
completely overturning the apple cart and adopting a system that
previously proved unworkable and works only with difficulty in other
countries.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000227">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If the
Minister believes that success fees are too high and that there are
abuses in the ATE market, he can regulate on those matters. The
Minister wishes to control abuses such as referral fees and amend the
civil procedure rules to encourage early settlement by claimants and
defendants—we agree with that—and the issues in
clauses 41 and 43 could be dealt with in exactly the same
way. Rather than take that option, however, the Minister has decided to
go for the big bang and pursue a different path.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000228">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let us look
at some of the facts that the Minister has chosen to ignore.
First—Lord Justice Jackson is clear about this—the
introduction of CFAs was a replacement, in part at least, for either
the restriction of eligibility for or the abolition of legal aid,
particularly in personal injury matters. I remember—as no doubt
the Minister does—when that happened in the 1990s, because there
was some furore about it at the time and about whether the system would
work. The ensuing 15 years have been a process of trying to make the
system work. There has been a lot of satellite litigation and
improvements in the system. There are undoubtedly still deficiencies,
but its original purpose, which was to provide a recourse to the civil
justice system for those who could not, for whatever reason, afford the
substantial costs—there are always likely be costs beyond the
means of the average person— still exists. The
Government have not addressed that matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000229">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
ignores the fact that CFAs are a swings-and-roundabouts system.
Everybody knows that to be the case, so for the Minister to be outraged
by the level of success fees per se, and to concentrate on success fees
from celebrated cases where defendants may have behaved badly and where
substantial uplifts of 100% were given, is somewhat disingenuous. It
ignores cases that appear to have merit, and which the
claimant’s solicitors take on in good faith to help those whom
they believe are meritorious claimants but who, for one reason or
another, including the litigation process or perhaps because of the
discovery of more information, prove to be losers. In such cases, the
claimant’s solicitor gets nothing, which is the single greatest
discouragement to pursuing unmeritorious cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000230">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The second
great discouragement is the ATE market, which works on the proviso that
an assessment will be made about the merits of the claim. I ask, in
parenthesis, how that compares with the regime under QOWCS in which
there is no discouragement, or not the same level, to a claimant from
entering into litigation. It might be nuisance or opportunist
litigation because there is no restraining insurance
market.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000231">&#160;</a>

lost.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000232">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">I
want to give a practical example of the role of lawyers. The Colossus
system, which is a sophisticated computer system that insurance
companies use for assessing damages, produces figures that are about
20% below the level of damages that courts award. I have met insurers
individually or through their representative bodies on several
occasions. They say—I am sure they are absolutely sincere in
this—that PI claims in particular can be settled very quickly.
This is what should happen: someone has an accident and the other party
is at fault; once the details are passed on, the person gets a phone
call from the offending party’s insurers, who say, “We
will offer you so much for it.” That means that, rather than
going through an 18-month litigation process and all the paperwork, the
problem or personal injury remedy can be sorted out, with a cheque,
within a matter of days. However, if the programme that insurers use
regularly delivers figures significantly less than what a court would
award, who can blame injured parties for seeking redress through the
courts? The complexity of personal injury law means that they are then
likely to need a
lawyer.</p>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will attribute nothing to the Minister—I learnt my lesson on
that—but another issue that floats around in the briefings
miraculously appearing in <em>The Mail on Sunday</em>, without any
assistance from the Ministry of Justice, the ABI or anyone else of that
kind, is that the parties who use CFAs are somehow unusual or not the
man in the street—that the scheme does not help individuals.
However, the typical male claimant with a CFA is aged under 39 and has
an annual income of a little more than £29,000; the typical
female claimant is aged under 44 and has an income of a little more
than £19,000; and 53% of claimants earn less than £25,000
per year and only 18% of them more than £40,000 per year. Nor is
it the case, as is sometimes alleged, that such people are serial
claimants and regularly make multiple
claims.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000248">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is also true, which the Minister and the previous Government can both
take credit for, that the real problems of inflated costs are being
brought under control: 75% of personal injury claims are road traffic
claims, and in the main they are now administered through the portal. I
think that my figures are right, but that has roughly halved costs.
They might well still be too high, in particular in straightforward
cases or when there is early admission of liability and early
settlement, and yet the fact is that they have been brought under
control relatively swiftly and effectively by simply amending the
existing system. Further proposals, which I believe that the Minister
supports, will extend that to other areas of personal injury
litigation, which will eventually cover about 95% of all cases; also,
the tariffs will be raised and, therefore, a greater number of road
traffic claims will be brought within the arrangement.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000249">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">There was an
attempt, when we were still in government, to bring down the level of
success fees for defamation cases. I will talk about privacy later on,
but there was such an attempt. It failed—it was voted
down—but nevertheless it showed that it is perfectly possible
for the Government to control success fees, perhaps through primary
rather than secondary legislation, which might have been the lesson of
that attempt, and perhaps not as draconically as bringing them down
from 100% to
10%.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000250">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
set out those facts because they are needed as the background to the
reality of the claims that is often not heard in the media or, I am
afraid, on the Floor of the House. I am not in any way defending the
status quo but simply saying that, if we start with the status quo and
look at what it actually is and at what abuses need to be cured, we
might not come up with the Minister’s solution. Behind such
matters are important questions of right and
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000251">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
go to the heart of our problems with clauses 41 to 43, the first net
effect, however one dresses it up, will be that it will be more
difficult for people who have suffered some injury or damage, whether
to their reputation, person or finances, and who wish to have redress,
to go to court. I will look in some detail at how much more difficult
it will be and at the percentage of people with meritorious claims who
will not now go to court, but a proportion of them—I do not know
if it will be a third or less than that—will no longer be able
to do so. They are people who deserve some redress, but they will not
receive
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000252">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
under the new system, if claimants prevail on a firm of lawyers to take
their case, it will make sophisticated calculations about whether it
has a sufficient chance of success commercially. At the end of the day,
such firms, which are not charities, have to continue to run and to
make some profit, as I am sure that, given his background, the Minister
appreciates and supports. If the case is taken and won, the success
fee, such as it is, will be recovered from the claimant’s
damages. However the 10% is calculated—even if it is calculated
perfectly sensibly—it will not be adequate to cover the success
fee that the claimant’s lawyer is entitled to.
<em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>
                  <em>]</em> The hon. Member for Ipswich again
says that the lawyer does not have to take that fee, but the Minister
will realise that that proposition is silly. A law firm is a commercial
organisation, like any other business, and it has to be able to pay its
costs and make adequate recompense. It is doubtful whether, in many
cases, there will be sufficient equity in the system to allow firms to
continue to take such cases, but if they do so, they will take that
money from meritorious claimants who have taken their cases to court
and
won.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000253">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
addition to suffering the harm, whether it is an industrial injury or
it is damage to their reputation, and all the stress and strains of
litigation, when claimants win and recover their damages, they will be
told, “I’m sorry, but a quarter of that will now have to
be taken away to pay for the costs of litigation.” It simply
seems inequitable that those costs should be deducted, as the price of
claimants not being able to afford privately funded litigation in the
first
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000254">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Where
QOWCS does not apply and ATE insurance is not available, because it
would be unaffordable even if there was a market for it, the actual
value of the success fee will be greater than that of the damages. That
is not due to greedy lawyers. As in multi-party and perhaps 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 509<a class="bkMark" name="Column509">&#160;</a>
                  </div>defamation cases, in which for one reason or another quite small damages
are often awarded—properly so, because other things are going
on—the amount awarded in costs will not be sufficient to cover
even the lawyer’s
fees.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000255">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is interesting to see what is and what is not in the Bill. Clearly,
what is in the Bill is that there will be no more success fees or,
except in very specialised circumstances, ATE premiums. What is not in
the Bill is qualified one-way costs shifting or the 10% uplift. We have
had this debate in part already. The Minister says, “Well,
that’s because we are still working on that, and that’s
because we’ve decided that those things are better in
regulations.” I say that that is not good enough. If we are to
legislate on the basis of a completely new way of dealing with civil
litigation claims—civil litigation costs—we need to see
the package in the round before the Committee and before it is voted on
on the Floor of the House. I am sure that when the Bill goes to another
place, those points will be made even more
amply.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000256">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am not implying any mala fides on the part of the Government. I am sure
that they will come up with proposals on QOWCS and that they are
sincere, as Lord Justice Jackson was in saying that there must be
mitigation for the quite stringent changes that the Government are
proposing—those parts of his report that they have chosen to go
with. However, what the effect of QOWCS will be is highly relevant. All
we know at present is that they will mean that in most cases—we
are talking about personal injury cases—there will be no ability
for a successful defendant to recover their costs from an unsuccessful
claimant, but what does “in most cases” mean in that
context?<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000257">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
has been said that only the very wealthy need fear what is happening.
Perhaps the implication is that the very wealthy should be finding
other ways of funding their litigation, but who is to make that
judgment? What form of words or formula will be used? It is not one-way
costs shifting; it is qualified one-way costs shifting. Let us say that
the same type or form of words will be used as is used in legal aid
cases. That generally means that a legally aided party will not, other
than under lottery clauses, pay the other party’s costs, but by
definition a legally aided party is an impecunious party.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000258">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The category
of people who typically take CFA cases at the moment are those called
MINELA cases—middle income, not eligible for legal aid. I have
indicated the sort of income levels that we are talking about. How can
someone in that position be sure that they will not be subject to a
costs order? I do not see how we can legislate for something that
removes so many abilities for people to get into court; the
compensatory elements of that, which will still give some protection,
are not made
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000259">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
fear of costs is the biggest element that prevents people from taking
litigation. I have the results of a survey that suggests that that is
exactly the case, even under CFAs, whether that is because of a
misunderstanding or because of a fear. We are not a litigious society.
The survey is a public opinion survey from January of this year. Only
50% of those questioned—a large cross-section of the general
public—said that they would claim at all if someone else was to
blame.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000260">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Whether
one considers claims against the NHS or slip-and-trip claims in the
street, what is surprising is not the volume—not the
compensation culture that the Minister talks about—but the fact
that in most cases, people just accept these things as hazards of
everyday life. If they want anything at all, they want an apology, an
explanation and the rectification of the problem so that what has
happened does not happen to someone else. They are not interested in
going through two or three years of litigation to acquire what is often
quite a small amount of damages. However, that does not mean that they
should not be entitled to that if they need it; and quite often, for
poorer people, even £2,000 or £3,000 as a response to a
personal injury that has caused them loss—that has caused them
to take time off work or otherwise lose income—is an important
sum. In the survey, 77% of people said that they would not start a
claim even if the costs risk was very
small.<a class="bkMark" name="11091389000261">&#160;</a>
