<B>Mr. Alan Duncan </B>(Rutland and Melton): I beg to move amendment No. 49, in page 3, line 35, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(e) individuals who are homeless'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To some Labour Members, it may seem curious that I, of all people, am to be cast in the role of a caring Conservative but, as one of the most misunderstood politicians in British political history, this is my moment to prove that I am not who they think I am. Serious intent lies behind the amendment. It would add much to the social purpose of the Bill, which the Government regard as a high priority. I hope that the proposal is consistent not only with what purports to be their policy but with the common decency that crosses party lines when it really matters.
<P>
Under clause 5, the Commission is instructed to exercise certain functions in certain areas, which I think is sensible given that the Government want to inject a serious social and environmental purpose into the way in which the Post Office is constructed and how the Commission goes about its duty in overseeing and regulating it. The Bill must take into account individuals who are disabled and chronically sick.
<P>
It will be of great importance to people who are not mobile and who need access to a post office, as it will be to pensioners. Similarly, we all know that the ability to collect a pension is very much at the root of the debate about the rural or, as I prefer to call it, the community Post Office network. The clause also refers to ``individuals with low income'' and allied to the groups to which I have referred are ``individuals residing in rural areas''.
<P>
My amendment would add a fifth category, ``individuals who are homeless''. Someone who is just glossing over such matters might think that the amendment was a little silly in that it is impossible to deliver a letter to someone without an address. ``You can't put a post code on a cardboard box,'' someone has quipped to me. There are many other practical ways, however, of including those whose plight is homelessness. A proper system of communication can assist the exclusion that the homeless face.
<P>
Homelessness is not a small issue. When the Labour party was in opposition, it made serious comments about it, as did we, in opposition and, indeed, in government. I am sorry to say that the number of homeless people is growing. The figures for the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999 show that there were about 105,900 homeless people. That is a higher figure than when the Conservative party was in office, which illustrates that the scale of the problem is growing, not declining. It is a high priority for the Prime Minister to do something about it. He said that Labour would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>do everything in our power to end the scandal of homelessness, to tackle the spectacle of people sleeping rough on the streets and to end the waste of families sleeping in bed and breakfast accommodation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not happening.
<P>
Above all, the plight of the homeless rings true in the words ``of no fixed address''. For someone who is in trouble, rootless and unable to insinuate himself back into society and a stable life, being of no fixed address is a great problem. Including such people in a proper system of communication that enables them to establish a recognisable record of consistency in their habits and show that they can be reliably contacted and contact other people, can only be of benefit.
<P>
The backpacker travelling around France has access to a well-established system through which people can send a letter, or even a cheque or money order, to a post office. The letter has ``poste restante'' written on it and remains at the post office until it is collected by the person backpacking through France or tasting the wines of the Loire.
<P>
Such a system may exist in Britain, although I do not often hear about it. The Minister may know better than me. If it does, we should make more of it and include it in the Bill. The Post Office already takes account of people of pensionable age, people on low incomes and people who live in rural areas. If those categories can be specified in the Bill, why not specify the homeless, too?
<P>
I advocate a much better established and recognised system that includes homeless people and enables them to be contacted for the purpose of collecting benefits, for example. If they have a reliable pattern of movement and can be reliably contacted, that can only help in tackling fraud, which is an issue about which the Government feel strongly. Enabling such people to establish a well-documented and well understood reliable link would help their job prospects.
<P>
Homelessness is an evil that should not exist in a modern society, but it always will. The poor will always be with us, and so will the homeless, but we can do our little bit this morning to help them by including them in the Bill as a category of people to be included in the Post Office network and the system of communication, the nature of which may change dramatically over the next few years. Homeless people may be able to have an e-mail address, which, because costs are falling, they could use despite their poverty. It would not be a geographical address, to which I am mainly referring this morning, but it would be a point of contact, and the service could be provided through the Post Office network.
<P>
The ability to receive and send physical deliveries via a recognised route for homeless people would be of great value. I urge the Minister seriously to consider this simple amendment. It is well intentioned; I do not want to score any political points. I would like it to be accepted so that in looking to the future we can add to the purpose and effectiveness of the social exclusion policies that the Government are genuinely trying to implement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Page </B>(South-West Hertfordshire): As you know, Mr. Maxton, I was keen to discuss the amendment at the end of our previous sitting, because it is remarkably caring. As the Committee will know, in opposition hon. Members propose amendments that fall into several categories. Some are tabled more in hope than expectation. Some are designed to make a political point or to tease out information from the Minister. Some are tabled with genuine enthusiasm, and this amendment falls into that category.
<P>
I considered the Bill with my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan), who moved the amendment so ably. Our vast army of advisers, officials and experts guided us through its intricacies, and I only wish that the Minister had been given as much support as we receive in preparing our amendments, because the Bill would have been much better. When we came to this clause, my hon. Friend said, ``I can't believe that the Government have not included the homeless. We must table an amendment to include them.''
<P>
I know that the Minister may try to do a crawly backtrack on the subject by saying that under the clause regard could be had to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the interests of other descriptions of users.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, we believe that the category of homelessness should be firmly placed before the eyes of the regulator. The clause is motherhood and apple pie.
<P>
I hesitated for a moment before I raised another matter, because I hoped that Labour Members might make some comments, but I shall not do so now. At our previous sitting, the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Dr. Turner) had a call from the press and was up like a shot to make speeches left, right and centre. So were his colleagues. They were up like dragon's teeth, arguing for the Post Office. Obviously, they have not had a call from the press about the homeless, which is why they sit in their deaf, dumb and mute state. I hope that I can prod one or two of them into endorsing this amendment to help the homeless.
<P>
The amendment puts its finger on how the clause will operate. It divides the spin from the substance. Subject to your guidance, Mr. Maxton, I think that the clause should be read in conjunction with the draft statutory social and environmental guidance to the Postal Services Commission. I know that it is draft guidance, but it is also statutory, which gives it a force above mere guidance. If I were a manager of the Post Office reading the guidance, I would be quaking in my boots at how I would operate it and what the cost would be to me as the licensed operator. The guidance is open-ended.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That document comes under clause 32, so we shall discuss it in detail then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I accept what you say, Mr. Maxton. I simply want to refer to one aspect of the draft guidance and ask the Minister how it will operate if our amendment on homelessness is accepted. I agree with what is in the guidance, which is a commitment to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a fairer society through social progress which recognises the needs of everyone.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That must include the homeless, who are some of the more vulnerable people in society. How will the guidance give the Commission a focus to help the homeless? Will the Government give money to the Commission to help it carry out that commitment? If not, how will the Commission do its work?
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is no good the Minister saying that it is our amendment and is not in the Bill, because the question can be asked about the four categories in the Bill. The clause states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In performing its duty under subsection (1), the Commission shall have regard to the interests of<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
four categories, and we want to add another. If the Government accept the amendment, how will the Commission have regard to the homeless, not to mention the other categories?
<P>
The Minister's answer will provide a focus as to whether the commitment to a fairer society is spin or genuine substance.

<P>

<B>The Minister for Competitiveness (Mr. Alan Johnson):</B> I have much sympathy with the amendment, and we were waiting to see whether it was mischievous or not. I do not ask the Committee to accept it, but I appreciate the sentiment behind it. We were curious to see whether the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton could re-invent himself as Mother Teresa, and whether the case was made in the spirit of the clause.
<P>
Homelessness is a problem. I am not sure whether the figures are going up or down, but the Government have pledged to reduce homelessness by two thirds over the next couple of years. There are 1,600 people sleeping rough in this country, 600 of them in London. Ninety per cent. of them are males between 18 and 25. Generally, they come from similar backgrounds. Many have been in the armed forces or were institutionalised as children.
<P>
Can the homeless as a distinct group be included in the clause? The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) said that I would probably come out with some crawly backtracking. I do not know what that is, unless it has something to do with representing Crawley, which is now a Labour seat. We can include the homeless under the clause as it stands. The hon. Gentleman said that the clause was motherhood and apple pie, but four groups have been chosen that have problems with postal services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I would not want the Minister to leave on the record that I said that the clause was motherhood and apple pie. I said that it was motherhood and apple pie unless the Government propose a method to translate the matters of legitimate concern into practical benefit and use.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The point made was that the four categories do not seem to have any specific relevance to the work of the Commission, but we believe that they raise specific identifiable concerns in relation to postal services. Services for the ``disabled or chronically sick'' mentioned in subsection (2)(a) include articles for the blind. Other postal services relate specifically to them. The point of the guidance was to say that the Commission should not consider such services a drain on resources. They all have to be cross-subsidised. Articles for the blind cost the Post Office something like £20 million a year. Socially beneficial postal services must be preserved and protected.
<P>
The location of post offices is important to the ``individuals of pensionable age'' mentioned in subsection (2)(b), as pensions are paid through the Post Office network. I imagine that the homeless could fall into the category in subsection (2)(c), ``individuals with low incomes''—I do not know too many homeless people who have middle or higher incomes. We all know about the specific problems of people ``residing in rural areas'', who are mentioned in subsection (2)(d). The Bill then states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that is not to be taken as implying that regard may not be had to the interests of other descriptions of users.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We should like to discuss with the Commission the issues raised by the hon. Members for South-West Hertfordshire and for Rutland and Melton, but not in the context that they suggested. We do not have a specific difficulty with postal services to the homeless. Our intention is to make them take the first step from homelessness into a hostel. We must encourage youngsters who come down to London and live on the street to go to hostels. When they take that first step, they will have a postal address. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton asked how a homeless person can get a job if he does not have an address and how such a person can link back into society. The way in which to solve such problems is not to say that life on the street could be made more palatable and that we could assist people to live on the streets. We want to encourage them to take that first step off the streets into hostels and then into bed-and-breakfast accommodation and a flat of their own. That is the right way in which to end social exclusion.
<P>
The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton referred to the poste restante. It exists in this country as well as abroad. It is not just for backtrackers. [Laughter.] I mean backpackers. I am a crawly backtracker again. Homeless people can have a post restante address, although we would much prefer them to have a hostel address. Next year, we are putting about £22 million into removing people from the streets and into hostel addresses. If travellers are camped on a registered site, that constitutes a postal address. The amendment is genuine. It is not frivolous. However, it suggests that the Commission should encourage those who are homeless not to bother about going into a hostel because they could be provided with a postal address on the streets. The clause caters for such circumstances, but we are willing to reconsider our environmental guidance to see whether we have dealt with the matter sufficiently. That is the approach to the problem.
<P>
The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton talked about homeless people having an e-mail address, which takes us back to the Electronic Communications Bill. I think that the facility for that exists through the internet café system. A scheme called ``Hotmail'' allows people to log on to any computer with internet access. We must ensure that homeless people have a roof over their heads, at which point they will have a postal address.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> We have had a genuine exchange of views. I am disappointed, however, because I thought that I was on to something that could lead to cross-party endorsement. The Minister's only point was that the amendment would not be a good idea because it would encourage people to be homeless, and that it would make life on the streets more acceptable and easier. That argument could be deployed about any benefit. One could argue, ``Don't give anyone unemployment benefit; it only encourages unemployment,'' or, ``Don't give anyone sickness benefit; it only encourages people to be or to pretend to be sick''. That is a pretty flimsy argument.
<P>
The categories of individuals in the clause are, as the Minister says, people to whom the Post Office network needs to pay special attention to ensure that their needs are met. The homeless are also such a category. The Minister is saying that he recognises that, but that he hopes that they will be catered for in the catch-all two lines that follow the specific categories:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>but that is not to be taken as implying that regard may not be had to the interests of other descriptions of users.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The reason why those four categories exist is that they are, legitimately and under the proper political process, established lobbies. They can manage their interests and express their needs through the various organisations better than the homeless ever could. The homeless can never be politically organised as the disabled, the pensionable, those on low incomes—although that group less so—and those in rural areas can. By golly, that last group is speaking and squealing even as we conduct our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Laxton </B>(Derby, North): I ask the Committee to excuse my voice; it is a bit croaky this morning, for some reason.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lindsay Hoyle </B>(Chorley): Thank goodness for small mercies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Laxton:</B> That is pretty rich, coming from my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley with his loud, rasping Lancastrian voice that deafens us all the time.
<P>
To inject a slightly frivolous note, away from the line being pursued by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton, the practical problems of delivering correspondence details and registering arrangements to homeless people could be immense. In the case of someone like Swampy, buried under the Manchester runway extension, will a sort of troglodyte Postman Pat have to get the necessary paperwork to him? I would volunteer my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) to do that, but I would not do it myself.
<P>
On a more serious note—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is making an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Laxton:</B> I am trying to be brief. In fact, my voice is going so I shall stop.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That would be wise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Derby, North for helping my case. It can be difficult to set up arrangements for itinerants and for those who live in different places but perhaps return to one address more often and so are contactable there. What the hon. Gentleman says is true—and can, with a bit of effort, be overcome—so the amendment should be accepted. The Post Office may not make sufficient effort to overcome the obstacles to setting up a system that allows mobile, nomadic people to be contacted. It is less likely to make such an effort if groups such as the homeless are not as organised as the specific categories that the Minister believes—and we all agree—need to be cared for.
<P>
That is why we should make a particular effort to define the homeless as a group and include them in the Bill. In fact, I would argue for the four categories in the clause to be deleted and for only the homeless to be included as a specific category, because I am confident that the Post Office will always look after the people referred to in those categories—the sick, the pensionable, those on low incomes and those in rural areas, although I am increasingly worried about the latter category. I want to include paragraph (e) because it is far less likely that the Post Office will look after homeless people, compared with the other four categories included in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is absurd to exclude from the Bill those whom we all admit need help, yet who are least likely to be helped under the existing system, and include the four groups who are most likely to receive help. Completely topsy-turvy priorities have been used in drafting the Bill. The catch-all phrase is not enough. The homeless deserve a chance. We are not talking about spending millions and squillions of pounds to help them; we are saying that a system should exist to ensure that they can pick up their mail. Moreover, if included in the Bill, the system would become widely recognised as an acceptable procedure, so that those homeless people who are on the journey back to a more established and regulated way of life, whether through a hostel or a job, could establish some credibility and dignity. They would gain practical benefit from being able to communicate by post.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): I support the hon. Gentleman. This modest but worthwhile amendment would highlight the interests of the homeless. Indeed, some people are roofless, not in their own home and bed-and-breakfast accommodation. Under the amendment, the commission would have to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>have regard to the interests of
<P>
</UL></FONT>homeless people.<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I am not one for coalitions, but I am prepared to enter into one now, and I welcome his support. The more I speak, the more I convince myself about the amendment. I am beginning to become quite stewed up because I am utterly unconvinced by the Minister's wish to exclude the excluded from the Bill. The homeless deserve to be mentioned specifically for the purpose of addressing a growing problem in a simple, practical way. Given all the environmental and social ingredients of the Bill, they should not be left out.
<P>
I hope that we shall not have to press the amendment to a Division, but we will if we must. If the Minister were to accept the amendment, there would be no adverse political consequence for him or his party. On the contrary, we would have done what the House should do: we would have found, after a sensible debate, a simple way to improve the Bill, and we could go home for the weekend in the knowledge that we had done something for the homeless that could make a great difference to them in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I was almost reaching for the Kleenex for a moment. The longer that the debate has gone on, the more convinced I have become that we are right to oppose the amendment. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton said two things of significance, one of which was that if we did not give an address to the homeless we might as well extend that logic and not give unemployment benefit to the unemployed because it encourages them to be jobless. He went through a list of similar examples, and I thought that he was quoting one of his books, but apparently he was not. We are not saying that the homeless should not receive benefits; we are finding the best way in which to help them. Neither the hon. Gentleman nor anyone else has addressed the nub of the argument.
<P>
Let me first correct the figures. I said that the Government were investing £22 million, but we are in fact putting £200 million into dealing with the problems of homelessness and people sleeping rough over the next three years. We aim to reduce the problem by two thirds by 2002. Our approach—there is nothing between the three main political parties on the matter—is to reject anything that sustains a street lifestyle. People sleeping rough often have complex emotional problems, acute problems such as drug addiction and various other health problems. The only way to begin to tackle their problems is to get them off the streets. That issue does not divide the official Opposition, the Liberal Democrats and the governing party.
<P>
Homeless people can receive mail while they are homeless through poste restante or by nominating a postal address. Anyone can nominate any postal address from which to receive mail. If people are living in a hostel, they can receive mail. If they are in a registered travellers' site, mail can be delivered to them.
<P>
In his second contribution, the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton argued that all the other categorisations could be taken away and ``homeless'' inserted. However, I reject his argument that the clause is all about encouraging the Postal Services Commission to encourage the Post Office to set up a system whereby mail can be delivered and received by the homeless. That is not in the best interest of the homeless, as all three political parties agree. I accept the genuine motivation behind the amendment, but we do not need it.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also argued that all the categories in the clause had pressure groups. However, he failed on category (c). As far as I am aware, individuals with low incomes do not have major pressure groups. The term ``pressure group'' was used in an almost pejorative way, as we heard that rural pressure groups are squealing and speaking all the time. I believe that rural pressure groups do a good job in advancing the concerns of the rural community. People on low incomes have no effective voice and nor do the homeless.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Does the Minister accept that a 16-year-old kid who has left home and is sleeping rough in London should at least be contactable, rather than disappear off the map altogether?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The arrangements for being contactable exist already. If the argument is that the Postal Services Commission should put pressure on the Post Office to put pressure on Royal Mail to provide a postal address for homeless people, the facility is already there in post restante. Homeless people can nominate a postal address.
<P>
Most important, we must discourage living on the streets. The first step to social inclusion is going into a hostel for shelter. That reminds me that there is a lobby for homeless people. Shelter and Centrepoint are effective and articulate lobbies on their behalf. They would accept the Government's argument that the homeless can be dealt with under the clause as it stands, and that the Postal Services Commission can be involved under the rubric of environmental and social guidance. Accepting the amendment would encourage the view that there should be a system that allows people to continue to be homeless. We reject it, as we reject anything else that militates against the Government's ambition to get people off the streets in order to deal with their many and difficult problems. In the spirit in which the amendment was moved, I ask the Committee, which has examined all the arguments and had a worthwhile debate on the issue, to reject the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I do not want to delay the Committee for more than a few seconds. Of course, in as much as the post office network is so important to so many communities, we endorse the clause as it compels the Commission to look at the interests of categories of people. As the Committee will know from an earlier debate, we would have added to those categories, but other than reminding the Committee of that the Opposition will not oppose the clause.

<H4><center>Duties in relation to public post offices</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Clauses 31, 32 and 33 flow into each other as they have various responsibilities and counterbalances. The clause
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>imposes a duty on the Commission, in consultation with the Council, to provide advice and information to the Secretary of State about the number and location of public post offices and their accessibility to users.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That refers to the draft statutory social and environment guidance to the Postal Services Commission. How will the Commission provide accurate data on accessibility without collecting information regarding the communication needs of specific groups of users and the range and adequacy of the services that postal operators provide?
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
According to the guidance,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Commission shall have regard to the desirability of consulting with respect to the needs of vulnerable people where practicable, even when not required to do so.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a clear line of direction, which brings me back to the point that I made on clause 5. I shall make it again now and I shall probably make it again on clauses 32 and 33. There is a lot of spin here. I used the phrase ``motherhood and apple pie''. Everyone is in favour of motherhood and apple pie, but where is the substance? How will the clause be translated to rectify a problem?
<P>
Sub-post offices are closing at a record rate because of anxieties about automated credit transfer. What will happen if following consultation with the council, the Commission advises the Secretary of State that a post office will close because of worries about lack of income following the introduction of ACT, no one wishes to buy it and its value goes through the floor because the Government are still dithering about how to proceed?
<P>
How will the clause be translated on the ground? Sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses in my constituency tell me, ``Richard''—because I am that sort of friendly person—
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> Dick.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> No, they do not call me that. They can be friendly and respectful at the same time, as the Minister will know from his previous experience.
<P>
Sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses ask me, ``Richard, where am I going to go? What am I going to do? My income is going to fall dramatically, and at the moment I am getting no direction whatsoever from the Government.'' It is obvious that the Commission will quickly inform the Secretary of State that it can provide information about the number and location of public post offices. However, what will happen to access for users of other postal services? The Secretary of State will say that, because of worry and doubt, post offices are closing. What will be done? The quicker that the performance and innovation unit reports, the better, but where, ultimately, is the substance behind all the spin in the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> This is a short clause that will ensure that the Commission will take certain matters into account in providing advice and information. The first two categories are obvious. We must know how many post offices there are, where they are located and how they are distributed. However, on reflection, does the Minister believe that a third category should be specified? We might table an amendment to ensure that the Commission will provide advice and information to the Secretary of State about not only the location and distribution of post offices but the network's viability as a commercial concern in individual branches.
<P>
The Commission's advice to the Secretary of State that, for example, 21,000 or 20,000 post offices are private businesses will not mean much if all those private businesses, whether they be a Spar shop, only a post office or a part-time operation, are about to face financial ruin. The report and the advice will be meaningless if branch post offices are about to collapse as self-supporting enterprises. Another category, which might read, ``(c) their viability as commercial concerns'', is equally crucial to the usefulness of such advice and information, especially if that viability does not exist. The financial viability of the Post Office network is as crucial as the location and distribution of post offices in the network. Given that the viability of the network following the introduction of ACT is the kernel of the issue that the country faces, the advice to the Secretary of State is useless unless that viability has been assessed.
<P>
Does the Minister genuinely believe that the clause is sufficient? It is good as far as it goes, and I am delighted that the Secretary of State will be told some salient facts about the existing Post Office network. However, if the crucial fact of how it will survive if it does not have any money is missing, that advice will not be up to much. I urge him to tell the Committee why no financial criteria are included in the advice that the commission is bound to give the Secretary of State.

<P>

<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I support those who have expressed concern about clause 31. We would be far better informed had we received the report from the PIU. I am not alone, as I know from my colleagues to the right of me, the hon. Members for Rutland and Melton and for South-West Hertfordshire, in having heard many people express concerns about sub-post offices. We have had many debates about it and still I feel no more certain about the situation now. The Commission must consult the council to provide advice about the number and location of public post offices.
<P>
The White Paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government remains firmly committed to a viable network of post offices . . . The sub-post office plays a valuable role in local communities, particularly for the less mobile. But the Post Office cannot sustain a network if it is not sufficiently well used, and nor can Government.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Post Office service and the sub-post offices are not sufficiently well used, of what will the advice consist? Many members of the Committee, including myself are concerned that if the network is not viable, the advice will be that there should not be post offices in certain areas. I look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> When ACT is introduced, there will be an automated network throughout the country. If we are not careful, the crocodile tears that have been shed by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton will overshadow the Bill. I agree that we must have a network and that the viability of the Post Office should be enshrined in the Bill. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will deal with that. When the previous Government were in power, the Post Office suffered feast and famine. As unemployment shot up, more people used post offices. As it began to drop, fewer people used them. There was a knock-on effect. As people become older, they are more likely to use bank accounts than post offices. We must look forward to the bolt-on services that can be provided as a result of automation of the rural and urban networks.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Drew </B>(Stroud): I want to emphasise one problem in my area that I am sure is replicated elsewhere. I wish to put it on the record how much I welcome the clause. It refers to the social and economic importance of the network. It would be useful to have the PIU report now. Representatives of the unit were in my area a week ago talking to people at various sub-post offices about the sort of initiatives that are being undertaken and the different types of work that they would like to be carried out. I hope that the report will inform the way in which the operation will work.
<P>
If a sub-post office is to pass on to another business, there will be difficulty with the one-mile rule, which never seems to have been enforced when the different businesses were set up. However, when there is a possibility of a change, the one-mile rule is often vigorously enforced by Post Office Counters. That can cause difficulties in rural and urban communities because geographical distance is not necessarily the only way in which to measure communities. Leonard Stanley, which is next to King's Stanley in my constituency, is in an absurd situation. The community wishes the post office to re-open but, because it is within one mile of King's Stanley post office, members of the community have been told that their wish cannot be fulfilled. Such matters need to be looked at carefully. Communities should be able to be more proactive about their postal services.
<P>
It would help to receive clarification from the Minister about the relationship between the role of his boss—the Secretary of State—the Commission and the council. Local communities will want to know about the line of accountability. If they genuinely believe that they are being listened to and that their ideas will be enacted, certainty will be brought into the way in which postal services are operated. Clearly, the PIU will cover the relationship between local communities and their postal services. Given that the clause mentions the relationship between the Secretary of State, the Commission and the council, it would be helpful if the Minister could clarify how the different powers will operate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> This debate is important because concerns have been expressed by members of the Committee. No one should be in any doubt that the clause is an important addition to the various measures that we intend to take to protect the Post Office network. As the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said, we cannot guarantee that post offices will stay open when they are public-private partnerships dependent on the commercial viability of retail outlets. However, now that we have for the first time a powerful body to regulate the industry, we can give those partnerships through the access criteria something that at least establishes what we mean by a nationwide network of post offices.
<P>
Various Governments talked about such protection when the nationwide network was 25,000 post offices in the early 1970s, as they did when the figure slipped down to 20,000 post offices in the early 1980s. We are still saying it now when there are 18,500 post offices. Between 1990 and 1997, 10 per cent. of rural post offices closed. Over the past 20 years, they have seeped away at the rate of 1 per cent. a year. If we said blandly that the job of the regulator was to ensure a nationwide network of post offices, it would not go far enough. There should be access criteria for the public, not remote virtual reality access criteria, in that a person can telephone a post office that is within 75 miles. We want something that is tangible, under which the revamped and reinvigorated Consumer Council for Postal Services to regulate and monitor on our behalf and report to the Secretary of State.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said that sub-post offices are closing at a record rate. I accept that not everyone in the nation is gripped by every word that we utter, but Hansard is examined carefully, especially by communities concerned about the future. We must ensure that we draw a line under the frenzy about the network's future.
<P>
In 1999, the last year to be measured, there were about 500 closures, compared with usual annual average of 200. Sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses are understandably worried that the advent of the computerised network means that it will be time for them to leave the scene. Eighteen months ago, there was a highly publicised case of an 87-year-old postmistress who, having done a wonderful job for many years, asked if she could be exempt from the computerised Horizon network. The answer, I am afraid, is no. A computerised network must cover every one of the 18,500 outlets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> The Minister may recall that I asked about training on a previous occasion. His response reinforces the point that some people, including me, find it difficult to come to terms with modern computers and so on. Will he reassure us that people who find such matters difficult may get a little extra training or encouragement to cope with the new system?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> Yes, I can give that assurance. I chair the Horizon working group, which includes the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, the Communication Workers Union and Post Office Counters, and whose aim is to oversee the introduction of Horizon. The group is dealing with many matters, especially balancing, a trauma familiar to every postmaster and postal officer, including my hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Miss Smith).
<P>
Training is available. Nevertheless, some postmasters and postmistresses believe that they cannot cope and that it is time for someone else to take over. That is the only evidence that have for the increasing number of closures.
<P>
There are no exemptions. Horizon must cover the whole network and gaps are inconceivable.
<P>
<B>Miss Geraldine Smith </B>(Morecambe and Lunesdale): The post office in Wray, a village in my constituency, is up for sale. A buyer cannot be found because there is not enough business to make the post office viable.
<P>
However, there is still postal activity in Wray, as every house needs mail to be delivered and parcels arrive in the community. Is it not possible for the Post Office to introduce a public duty in Wray whereby the mail could be delivered, parcels handled and an afternoon post office counter service provided? Such a duty would provide the public with a facility for buying stamp or collecting pensions. A sub-post office that would otherwise be unable to survive could own that facility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> That point emphasises the importance of the Postal Services Commission and the revamped and reinvigorated consumer representative. I shall take it up with the Post Office.
<P>
The cardinal question posed by Opposition Members was about what the Commission can do to tackle such problems. It can investigate when it believes that the cause of a problem—the threat to the network and the access criteria—is resolvable and is not simply a result of population migration. If no one lives in an area any more, little can be done about it. Important issues about the unit payments that the Post Office makes to sub-post offices might need to be tackled.
<P>
All the signs about closures are that the increase in postmasters leaving the network is due to concerns about future computerisation. We continue to hear arguments that the network is diminishing in value, and that sub-postmasters have put £1 billion of their own into the network. The more people talk about the about the network being undermined, the more that will be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I hope that my brief intervention is in line with what the Minister will say, so I invite him to talk about the fact that it is important that the Commission gives the Secretary of State information about the financial viability of post offices. The Minister agrees that that is crucial to the preservation of the network. There may be a good story to tell.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> There is indeed, and I shall mention that as part of a general list of reasons why sub-postmasters should feel that there is opportunity, not threat.
<P>
No Government would dispute the need to move to a safer, securer and more reliable system of paying benefits. The migration to automated credit transfer could take place gradually, with decline turning to collapse, and collapse to crisis. The problem could be someone else's in 10 years' time, or we could tackle it now and eradicate £100 million-worth of fraud a year at a stroke.
<P>
The previous Government's well intentioned benefit payments card was clearly an interim measure throughout the eight years' duration of the contract. They and any responsible Government would change to ACT, as we intend to. By grasping the nettle, we are saying that we should plan and programme for the change. Sub-postmasters have said to me for years—in another capacity, I represented them—that we have an under-utilised, under-promoted resource. Suddenly, with the understandable concerns of rural communities and sub-postmasters, the spotlight is turning on it and we have an opportunity to act.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's point about viability is valid. The difficulty, which we do not welcome, is that the performance and innovation unit study is completely independent and cross-cutting. It was commissioned by the Prime Minister last October, and we had no control over its timetable. We need to get the Bill into statute. As the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters recognised, the Bill will give the Post Office greater commercial freedom and end the uncertainty of eight years of review, which is an important step forward to protect the network. There is no sync between the Bill's passage and the PIU study, which is due to be completed in the spring. [Interruption.] I shall ignore that, because I was getting on to me peroration. The whole point of the study is to tackle the question of viability, and to work out how we can protect the network and how it can deliver the Government's objectives.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman pointed out that no amendment has been tabled to the clause, although an amendment may need to tabled, perhaps by us. We have to wait for the outcome of the PIU report on the viability of the network, just as we have to wait before we can set the access criteria, and for so many other matters. Viability will be a major issue in the protection of the network
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Is it not gross irresponsibility to raise all those concerns regarding the introduction of ACT without having viable, revenue-generating alternatives in place so that we can allay the fears of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses? The Opposition do not think that this is joined-up government; we think that it is irresponsible government. We do not want to talk down the network. We want a viable network throughout the country, performing a valuable social service, but the number of post offices has decreased. I would like to think that the Minister is right and that the decrease in numbers has now ceased and we are back to a normal rate. Can he assure that that is the case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> Yes, I can. The decrease in figures was a blip. The headline in one of the newspapers that cited the figure of 500 was exaggerated, but the figure was nonetheless greater than the average over the past 20 years. The Post Office is now convinced that the trend over the past three months is significantly slower and it anticipates a lower than expected figure because the figures are calculated over the financial, not the calendar, year.
<P>
There is no need to generate doom and gloom. We are being not irresponsible, but responsible. The easiest thing for us to do would be to walk quietly away from the problem, allow the network to continue to decline year by year, with people migrating gradually to ACT, and to do nothing about it. We could just leave it to someone else to sort out in future. We are talking about opportunity, not threat. While we are not saying that the PIU study will resolve everything, the work of that unit is important because it takes an all-party perspective and reports directly to the Prime Minister. It will greatly influence the way forward. However, it is not the only relevant element. The Government have invested £500 million in the computerisation of the whole network. The Treasury is not putting in that money to computerise 40,000 counter positions at 18,500 post offices merely to close them afterwards. It is being done to give post offices the opportunity to attract new work.
<P>
The debate needs to be set in context. The computerisation programme will be completed by spring 2001. Discussions with the major banks are taking place—the furore about charging for the use of cash machines will give the Post Office the opportunity to offer its cashback facility. The introduction of 3,000 cash machines in post offices by the end of 2001 is also very important. The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) made the bizarre comment that that would attract ram raiders into rural areas. That is rather missing the point. Some people live in villages with no access to cash, so they have to drive to the nearest town to withdraw cash, which they then spend in that town. Having cash machines at rural post offices is very important to people in those communities. Not only will people be able to draw money from the cash machine, they will then be able to spend it in the post office. So it is an important innovation.
<P>
An experiment is being conducted in Cornwall, with all its 270 post offices offering the full range of banking facilities for Barclays. Opportunities are being opened up for people to receive money in their bank accounts via ACT or, for people who do not have and do not want a bank account, for the post office to be used in a new way, beyond the old order book or ration book system. Changing from paper to plastic to ACT is the way forward. It may be a visionary idea, but pensioners might be able to withdraw money using a card system negotiated by the banks, which could, using computer technology, inform them that they are eligible for income support. We have a huge problem, because 1 million pensioners are not receiving their entitlements. Horizon presents a range of opportunities, and the postmaster system offers a gateway for Government services to go on line by 2008—a proposal that formed a major part of the Electronic Communications Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Does the Minister accept that the apparent good news about providing automatic teller machines in rural areas has rather been dynamited by the subsequent news that pensioners who withdraw money from such an ATM will find that a significant percentage of their pensions has disappeared in the form of a fee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> That is another issue about which my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister have expressed anxieties. The Post Office is a facility for giving cash. Indeed, it is the largest cash distributor in the country. Notes held to order for the Post Office are a huge business. Post offices hold cash, and people could use a post office cashback facility if they are disgruntled with banks that charge for access through ATMs. We face a range of genuine opportunities, and access criteria are important.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked how the Commission will carry out its duties and about its power to gather information. Clause 33 requires it to collect information about the provision of postal services. Clause 36 allows it to require information for relevant purposes, including information that is relevant to its functions under clause 31. It will therefore be well equipped to carry out its duties under the Bill.
<P>
I answered the point about viability eloquently and fully. My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) mentioned the rather esoteric one-mile rule, a matter with which the commission and the new consumer body could help us. The rule, which probably dates back to Dick Turpin's time, is that a post office may not be located within one mile of another post office. There were good reasons for the rule—to protect the viability of postmasters' businesses by ensuring that another post office was not going to open up three doors away. It may no longer be useful, and the Commission may be able to help us. No doubt the PIU will also consider the rule. Although the rule has existed for years, I never heard it mentioned in debates, and I never heard people discuss how post offices might be used to deliver Government services. I never heard about what is now a huge debate about people in rural areas having access to cash. The debate has come about because we have put the spotlight on the problem with a determination to resolve it.
<P>
The clause is crucial. We shall be influenced by the PIU study, and amendments may be necessary later. The social and environmental guidance that we have issued is merely a first draft and will be subject to additions and subtractions. However, the general principle is sound, and I ask the Committee to agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 31 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 32</center></H4>
<H4><center>Duties in relation to social and environmental matters</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 69, in page 18. line 3, leave out `from time to time' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`at least every three years and on a long term basis'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 72, in clause 34, page 19, line 20, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(f) a report on implementation of guidance given under section 32(2)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> We have already discussed the importance of these clauses, and it has become clear what an important role the Commission will play in the future of Post Office services. The link between the Commission and the Secretary of State will become clearer over time.
<P>
The vital role of the Commission has been referred to many times. Under the Bill, the Secretary of State must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>from time to time give guidance about the making by the Commission of a contribution towards the attainment of any social or environmental policies,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is vital. It is explained in greater detail in the draft guidance. Such an indefinite statement as ``from time to time'' should not be built into the Bill. We are waiting for the PIU report, for example: to all intents and purposes, we could never get it—but I am sure, of course, that we will. There is no time scale for that report and there is no time scale for the guidance, which is so vital that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>at least every three years<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would be appropriate.
<P>
The Minister could surprise me by saying that he expects guidance to be issued much more frequently—perhaps every year, which would be good. However, the general lack of certainty with ``from time to time'' is a problem, especially in view of the many requirements connected with sustainable development, suitability for pensions and so forth. As I said, the guidance is vital, so we should expect the Minister to be more definite about when it will be given.
<P>
Amendment No. 72 would require the Commission to publish an annual report on its activities. Having an annual report is to be welcomed, clause 34 makes no reference to including in that report
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a report on implementation of guidance given under section 32(2),<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which deals with important social and environmental consequences. Clause 34 refers to a general survey of developments, a report on licence holders and so forth, which is fine, but it is not unreasonable to highlight the importance of the social aspects. The amendment would achieve that and I hope that the Minister will accept it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I rise briefly to support the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter). I shall not repeat what he said, but I should like to draw the Committee's attention to the key five words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>on a long term basis.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The addition of those words would be valuable. If the guidance is done well, it can lead to stability and support the financial viability of the Post Office network, which we all wish to maintain. With no foresight and no long-term view, there is a risk of the current uncertainty that bedevils the network remaining. The hon. Gentleman is on to something when he commands the Secretary of State to take a long-term and not a short-term view. That is exactly what the network needs Conservative Members are prepared to support Liberal Democrat Members on these two amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> As I said previously, clauses 31, 32 and 33 are a clutch of clauses that follow each other in a logical progression. I, too, would like to support the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare, particularly on amendment No. 72, which would ensure implementation of the social and environmental guidance in the report. I have already said on more than one occasion that we want to try to separate the spin from the substance. The amendment will do exactly that.
<P>
I do not wish to be pedantic but it would be helpful to have legal advice on the extent to which the Postal Services Commission, when it is up and running, will be bound to accept the guidance of the Secretary of State. We have heard a lot from the Minister about the independence of the Commission and the regulator. What would happen if the regulator said, ``I do not accept your social and environmental guidance and I will be saying in the report that it has not been implemented because the Commission has rejected it''? Does the Commission have such independence?
<P>
We are talking about the evaluation between spin and substance. Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State shall from time to time give guidance about the making by the Commission of a contribution towards the attainment of any social or environmental policies set out or referred to in the guidance.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I regard the phrase ``a contribution'' to mean positive support and financial aid. The annual report should state what implementation of the social and environmental guidance has taken place. I must congratulate the Liberal Democrats on putting a focus on an annual report that will show the effectiveness of this guidance, but where is the support coming from that will enable the guidance to be implemented? There is a lot of spin but I hope to hear a little substance from the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> There is lot of substance in the Bill, enough for hon. Members to get their teeth into. The amendments are well intentioned and I understand the reasons behind them but the point is—and it is a constant dilemma when we deal with amendments of this kind—the need to ensure flexibility. We do not want to tie the hands of the Secretary of State or the regulator at this time. In practice, the Secretary of State may well issue guidance at least every three years, and certainly on a time scale that reflects the developments in the Government's social and environmental policy.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The requirements in the amendment are arbitrary. In fact, any specific requirement for the Secretary of State to issue guidance in a set time scale is simply too arbitrary. Guidance has to be changed and updated to keep in line with Government policy and other developments. We must keep the mechanism flexible, so we do not want a rigid requirement.
<P>
Amendment No. 69 includes the requirement that guidance should be given
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>on a long term basis.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, we should consider long-term developments, but we need the flexibility to include medium and short-term developments as well as long-term goals, so it would be unnecessary to present the guidance as suggested in the amendment.
<P>
The main thrust of the speech made by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire was in support of amendment No. 72. That amendment is misguided and shows that the purpose of the social and environmental guidance is perhaps not totally understood. The independence of the regulator was discussed during the debate on the sittings motion. Opposition Members argued that the Select Committee on Trade and Industry should be involved in that appointment to ensure proper independence. The company will be a publicly owned plc; the Government will own 100 per cent. of it, so we must ensure that the regulator is independent.
<P>
The problem with amendment No. 72 is the suggestion that the Postal Services Commission should have a duty to implement any guidance. It will have a clear duty
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to have regard to any guidance,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but it will not be required to implement it fully, otherwise it will not be an independent regulator. I know that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire understands that the proposal would clash with the regulator's independence.
<P>
The regulator will be required fully to take into account the guidance issued by the Secretary of State. That obligation is made clear in other clauses. The Commission would not fulfil its duty if it failed to pay attention to the guidance. We cannot include a duty to implement the guidance and the problem with amendment No. 72 is the suggestion that the Commission should have such a duty. Amendment No. 72 would require
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a report on implementation of guidance given under section 32(2).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A duty to implement the guidance would be added to the annual report, in which the duties of the regulators will be set out.
<P>
The amendments are unnecessary. They would cause confusion about the regulator's proper duty to have regard to the guidance. The suggestion that it has a duty to implement every instruction given by the Secretary of State would not be in accordance with the independence that we want to give the regulator.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I shall deal with the Minister's comments briefly. He referred to the long-term view that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton rightly suggested in amendment No. 69. We should take a long-term view. Some of this country's economic problems have been caused by the lack of a long-term view. So I do not accept the Minister's argument. It is easy to talk about a lack of flexibility and to suggest that people's hands should not be tied. However, we often have to tie people's hands, otherwise they will not do what they are required to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will note the fact that no response has been given to the use of the word ``contribution'' in relation to the implementation of the social and environmental policies that might be proposed in the report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that helpful intervention.
<P>
The word ``rigid'' implies something unsatisfactory, whereas flexibility implies something satisfactory. That is not appropriate in this case, however, as we are discussing something very new indeed. The Bill includes a regulatory function. In view of the fact that the regulator has taken up so many roles, it is right that it should be required to give information about how matters are progressing.
<P>
Careful reading of amendment No. 72 shows that it concerns a report on the implementation of guidance. That is extremely important, as we are entering new territory and many matters will arise. As the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said, environmental aspects are vital as they cover many issues. We are asking only for a report on implementation. It would not necessarily have to say that everything has been done, but that some recommendations and guidance have been implemented, and others not, giving the reasons. That would be extremely valuable as it would put a duty on the Commission to justify decisions not to implement certain guidance.
<P>
The amendments contain valuable points and I intend to press them to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> It is always difficult when there is coalition on the Opposition Benches. I accept completely the points that are being made. We are not suggesting that the Commission should not be required to report on guidance-related issues in its annual report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> It is not a coalition. I am sure that the Minister is delighted when Liberal Democrat Members agree with the Government on the many occasions on which they are obviously right. Sometimes, we agree on a relevant point, but that is not a coalition matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> We shall call it a Con-Lib pact then. Clause 34(2)(e) states that the Secretary of State may require the Commission to report on any guidance matter in its annual report. However, because the guidance is not a duty or a function of the Commission, it would not be appropriate for it to have a statutory duty to report on its implementation.
<P>
The amendment would specifically require the Commission to report on the implementation of guidance, thus suggesting that it is under a duty to implement the guidance, but there is no such duty: the guidance is just guidance. I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I am sure that the Committee will not have any difficulty with the amendments, but I shall explain them. We must ensure that the council and the Commission have appropriate powers to allow them to operate effectively. It may be in the future that a reserved area will no longer exist and that universal service providers will therefore no longer be licensed. The Bill must provide for that situation. We intend to have it on the statute books for many years. It will give the council and the Commission powers to obtain information from universal service providers and consult and publish advice to such providers, who are not necessarily licence holders.
<P>
The amendments will not change the current situation. As I said on Tuesday, I anticipate that the Post Office will be licensed by the Commission and will be the designated universal service provider. They provide for a situation that may occur in the future when there is no longer a reserved area, but when we shall still require for the benefit of the British public a universal service obligation. The amendments will require the council, the Commission and the Secretary of State to continue to fulfil the functions of collecting information on the provision of the universal service obligation, publishing advice and information to the universal service providers and consulting them. They will ensure the continuation of essential functions provided by the council and the Commission.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 70, in page 18, leave out line 10 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) any other persons or organisations with an interest in the matters contained within the guidance'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 74, in clause 39, page 22, leave out line 34 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) any other persons or bodies with an interest in, or affected by, the code.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I was nearly caught on the hop. I expected the Minister to make a longer speech on the previous amendment than he did.
<P>
The amendment concerns the lack of consultation and transparency in the clause. It would replace the reference in the clause to other persons whom the Secretary of State wishes to consult by a reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any other persons or organisations with an interest in the matters contained within the guidance.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome the way in which the Government have brought various important aspects into the Bill, such as the environment and the access facility. The Minister should not have great difficulty in firming up on the clause. The provision
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such other persons as the Secretary of State considers appropriate<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
leaves matters open. It should be more specific as outlined in the amendment.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 74 deals with transparency. Clause 39 requires the Commission to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>prepare . . . a code of practice governing the discharge . . . of its functions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Consultation could be increased by the implementation of amendment No. 70. Both amendments are about joined-up government, and we always encourage Departments to work together and be aware of one another on environmental issues. Amendment No. 74 would require the Commission to consult not only the Secretary of State, the council and licence holders, but
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any other persons or bodies with an interest in, or affected by, the code.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendments are about the important matters of consultation and transparency, which we discuss frequently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I am sympathetic to the intention behind the amendment. The two relevant clauses, which are on consultation on the guidance by the Secretary of State and the Commission's code of practice, should be wide enough to ensure that, so far as practicable, all who are affected by or have an interest in the issues raised have an opportunity to comment. That would be in accordance with the principles of openness and transparency.
<P>
To require the Commission and the Secretary of State to consult
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any other persons or organisations with an interest<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is far too onerous. The existing wording,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such other persons as the Secretary of State—
<P>
</UL></FONT>or, in the case of clause 39, the Commission—``considers appropriate'', gives the flexibility to consult not only those
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>with an interest in the matters contained within the guidance,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but other persons considered appropriate. It is important to retain that flexibility.
<P>
We are not sure what is meant by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any other persons or organisations with an interest.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Practically everyone in the United Kingdom sends and receives post, so one could say that everyone has an interest in the guidance. That could cause confusion. How would the Secretary of State or the Commission know whether they had managed to consult everyone with an interest? It is better to stick with the wording in the Bill, which provides for full consultation without placing unnecessary or onerous burdens on the Commission and the Secretary of State.
<P>
We have issued the preliminary draft of the social and environmental guidance and published it on the web. We intend to repeat that, together with a mailing to a wide range of persons and organisations known to have an interest in postal matters, when we consult on the real thing after the Bill has been enacted. That should assuage any fears that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare might have about the consultation being inadequate.
<P>
It is for the Commission to decide the most appropriate consultation process when it introduces its code of practice. As an independent body, it should have that right, and it is obliged to publish its code of practice. I expect that it will take the same view as the Government, and will consult as widely as possible along similar lines to those that we propose to adopt when consulting on the guidelines.
<P>
Nothing separates us on the subject of what we intend to achieve. We want openness, transparency and full consultation. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that the clause as drafted adds no confusion to the situation. Given that 28 million people a week use Post Office Counters, to consider the situation in terms of those likely to be affected or to have an interest in the guidance would detract from clear directions both to the commission and to the Secretary of State. The clauses as drafted fully meet the points raised by the hon. Gentleman, who I hope will withdraw the amendment. If not, I ask the Committee to oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I am glad that the Minister said that he was sympathetic. I was unsure whether he was suggesting some confusion on my or my colleagues' part—
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> Well, thanks very much. I was grateful for the Minister's reassurance that consultation will be as wide as possible and that he accepts our point about persons with other interests. As he said, that could be a rather broad commitment. We made some legitimate points about joined-up government, transparency and consultation. The Minister was kind to accept the general drift of our case, so in the same spirit, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The whole clause shows the Minister at his most tantalising. There is such hope and expectation for the clause to address the problems of the Post Office network but, sadly, none of the material to provide the satisfaction and comfort that we all seek. The clause has all the bones, but none of the flesh. The success or failure of this part of the Bill depends on the detail of protecting environmental and social concerns.
<P>
It is unsatisfactory and a great pity that such an important element of the Bill is not before us in full detail. We have draft guidelines of a sort, but the real detail is still stuck in the PIU with no promise of receiving it before Easter: indeed, we know that we will not receive the substance before the end of the Committee stage, which is regrettable. At the moment, we have only hope and expectation, the bare bones of intent without the substance of decision, and therefore the prospect of a continuing unsatisfactory state of affairs in the Post Office. Equally unsatisfactory is our inability properly to scrutinise the Bill and to establish what exactly it will achieve.
<P>
On Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) proposed our reasoned amendment and said that the House of Commons should decline to give the Bill a Second Reading because it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``fails to introduce clear access criteria to protect the network of sub Post Offices.''—[Official Report, 15 February 2000; Vol. 344, c. 815.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are now scrutinising the Bill, but that remains the case.
<P>
A great deal hangs on what the PIU will produce. The Government have contracted out from their own principal Department the decision-making process and the design work to establish how the Post Office network can continue. That renders the clause enabling but, as it stands, deficient and inadequate.
<P>
I have read the draft statutory guidance, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Performance Innovation Unit . . . in the Cabinet Office is currently working to identify the contribution made by post offices to the vitality of local communities, and to consider how the Post Office network can best contribute to the Government's objectives in the future.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also contains an amusing contradiction—no, circular argument—when it states in paragraph 4.20:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Commission shall have regard to the desirability<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of consulting certain groups, but continues that it is required to do that consultation
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>even when not required to do so.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have no objection, I am merely amused by the strange state of affairs whereby the commission is and is not required to do something at the same time. Ultimately, it may boil down to whether statute and guidelines have equal or different powers in law. They have different powers. This is only a guideline. It is a pity that we have not had the opportunity to get our teeth into all the details that are still in some garret office at No. 10 Downing street, ready, I suspect, for us to study.

<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> It is pity that the best part of three years into office, and having had 18 years to think about it, the Government do not have these criteria properly defined and ready for us to study. If they thought that they were so much better, they could have taken time out to design the document that we are champing at the bit to read. We will not oppose this but we express sadness that the real detail and meat of the clause remain unavailable to the Committee as we scrutinise the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> Well, I have been called worse things than tantalising in my time. To a certain extent all Bills have hope rather than substance. Clause 32 talks about a commission that has not been established and that cannot be established until the Bill receives Royal Assent. We are talking about a council for the consumer that has not been established yet and about licence holders who have not had an opportunity to apply for their licences. The access criteria will be in the final guidelines, but the guidelines can only be in draft at the moment because until the Bill has received Royal Assent, we cannot go out to consultation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton pointed out some wording in the draft guidance and it is as well that he did. He has up until 31 July to comment and that will obviously be taken into account. He said that the PIU study was ready and in a garret somewhere. I can assure him that it is not. I obviously have to meet the PIU study group from time to time as it undertakes its work. If anyone is desperate to get the information out and into the public domain, we are. We would like it to inform the debate in Committee, but the PIU study is very comprehensive and will be completed in due course.
<P>
Finally, in his usual entertaining way the hon. Gentleman asked why we have waited nearly three years to do this. In 18 years in government, the Tories failed to implement a manifesto commitment made in 1992 to introduce an independent regulator. They failed to act on their Green Paper. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire was the DTI Minister responsible for the Post Office. In the two years from 1995 to 1997, they did nothing. Once they had decided that they could not privatise the Post Office, they tried to plunder it.
<P>
This study was commissioned as a result of the concerns when the benefit payment card went belly up. We would have liked that benefit payment card project to succeed. It was a well-intentioned project. The private finance initiative project that launched it was, as the Trade and Industry Committee said, blighted from the start. It was a problem before we came into government. We rescued it and put Horizon back on the platform—[Laughter.] We put it back on the tracks. We could not get down to the nuts of bolts of what is in the PIU study until recently. With those few, tantalising remarks, I ask the Committee to accept that clause 32 stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 32, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
