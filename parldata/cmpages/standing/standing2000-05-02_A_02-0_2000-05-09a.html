<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, everyone. I have had a request from gentlemen Committee members that they be allowed to remove their jackets, which they may. Lady Members may also wish to, if appropriate.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Meaning of ``local authority'' in Part I</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I beg to move amendment No. 87, in page 1, line 15, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(vi) a parish council'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 88, in page 1, line 16, leave out ``or.
<P>
No. 89, in page 1, line 16, at end insert ``or a community council.''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> First, may I apologise to you, Mrs Michie, and to the Committee for not being with you during the debate on the sittings motion. I also apologise in advance for not being in Committee this afternoon, as I will be in the House for the Report stage of the Transport Bill.
<P>
I have not served under your chairmanship until now, Mrs Michie. I am greatly looking forward to doing so. I have only recently finished serving on the Standing Committee that considered the Transport Bill under the chairmanship of Mr. Gale. He had a reputation for irascibility-his description of himself, not mine. I am delighted that I never once caused him to demonstrate it. One way of doing so was by demonstrating my ability to be brief. I want to repeat that at the outset today.
<P>
The amendments are simple. The Bill gives local government a general competence in the form of economic, environmental and social well-being powers. Unfortunately, it does not give similar powers to the tier of local government called parish councils. The amendments are simply an attempt to give to parish councils the power that the Government consider it appropriate to bestow on other tiers of local government.
<P>
Members of the Committee know that many parish councils attempt to work with various organisations, business communities and others to develop issues that support the economic, environmental and social well-being of their areas. Their hands are somewhat tied, however, by section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972, which limits their expenditure for these purposes to £3.50 per head of the electorate. We contend that those powers should be improved so that that tier, which misses out in proposed legislation, is able to be more widely involved.
<P>
The debate will also provide an opportunity for the Minister to say a little about her views on the future of parish councils.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): It is a great pleasure to see the hon. Gentleman here on one of his fleeting visits. To what extent have he and his party consulted parish councils about the magnitude of his proposals? I ask that only because it was apparent from a recent debate on an order dealing with best value in parish councils that they vary enormously in their budget, the scale of their operations and the range of activities in which they engage.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I trust that the hon. Gentleman does not think that I would table amendments of this nature without fairly extensive consultation. The National Association of Local Councils, for example, has urged passionately that amendments such as these be proposed.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman is aware that were the amendments to be accepted, they would give parish councils an opportunity to make use of these powers: those that did not want to use them would not be required to do so. As the Bill is drafted, these are opportunities for local government, not requirements on them. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that there has been consultation and that the amendments are supported by the vast majority of those who represent parish councils.

<P>
Another point on which the hon. Gentleman may share my view is that there is some concern outside about the Government's intentions for the future of parish councils more generally. I understand that the Minister is clear in her mind that the Government have no intention of curtailing the work of the councils. That message has not been as widely received as we might have hoped. I trust that when the hon. Lady responds she will take this opportunity to make a clear statement on the issue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point to which we shall return. I appreciate his earlier remark about giving a mere power to parish councils to use, or not, as they see fit. What would the hon. Gentleman's attitude be if the power effectively became a duty?

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the conduct of Committee proceedings necessitates our tabling at this stage amendments that deal merely with the giving of powers. He knows that later we shall debate whether the powers should be made a duty. In such circumstances, under existing legislation parish councils can operate even if they have been given a duty. If a power were turned into a duty without our amendments, parish councils would not have to take any action. On the other hand I trust that if a power became a duty, the hon. Gentleman would join me in stating that there is no sense whatever in giving any tier of local government a power without also giving it the means to raise the funds to undertake its responsibilities. Unfortunately, a deficiency of the Bill is that there are no opportunities for local government at any level to raise the funds.

<P>
We are debating whether to extend the power to parish councils. I hope that the Committee will think that that is a reasonably sensible way to give similar opportunities to all tiers of local government.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I have already given away the drift of my intervention. This is an important issue. Parish councils are an important tier of local government-a view that we share with the Liberal Democrats and I hope that we may share with the Government. However, we want to probe a little further.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 87, 88 and 89 would extend the new power to parish councils. We support an enhanced role for parish councils, which in many parts of the country are the definitive voice of local grass-roots opinion. However, we counsel caution. I am interested in hearing what the Minister will say.

<P>
I am slightly surprised at the suggestion that, by and large, parish councils are not as keen on the idea as the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) suggests. One difficulty is that parish councils vary enormously in size and activity, as we discovered when we debated regulations exempting most parish councils from the strict regime of best value. About 30 parish or town councils had budgets of more than £500,000 a year and a handful-no more than 10-had a budget of more than £1 million a year. That is far removed from the level of expenditure and activity of parish councils in my constituency, but it does not undermine their role and importance in our local communities. In constituencies that are more rural than mine, parish councils are even more important.

<P>
There is a danger that extending the general power, let alone a duty, to parish councils, could mean that some of those councils will feel overburdened. Many people who volunteer to be parish councillors and give up their time willingly might be discouraged from doing so. Some parish councils may become more akin to other tiers of local government, with which there is a danger of overlap or even conflict. That must be avoided. I have a sneaking suspicion that that may be the gravamen of what the Minister has to say: it is all very well tabling amendments, but how will the proposal operate in local authorities that cover the same geographical area?

<P>
The Liberal Democrats' proposal would impose heavy costs on parish councils in producing and publishing their own community strategies. I doubt if many parish councils would want that sort of obligation and cost to be imposed on them. However, the spirit of the amendments is to be applauded. We strongly believe that parish councils should be strengthened and that they need to be protected. Government and Opposition parties must make it abundantly clear that parish councils are valued, that they have a long-term future and that, where possible, they will be strengthened-they are not going to be messed around with or replaced with neighbourhood forums or some other new Labour talking shops. I expect to hear the Minister's views on that matter in her reply.

<P>
The Conservative party is engaged in a large consultation exercise with parish councils, first, to establish that they appreciate that we want parish councils to continue and prosper and, secondly, to find out how they wish their powers and responsibilities to be extended and strengthened. The initial replies from all over the country show that there is not a great groundswell of opinion in favour of extending the power, let alone the duty, to local parish councils. They are much more concerned with nitty-gritty issues such as the level of their auditing costs, their formal involvement in the planning process, the drafting of local plans and so forth. Those are matters for another day.

<P>
I reiterate what the hon. Member for Bath said about the important issue of resources, which we shall consider in later debates. The reality is that the Government are wishing a new power or duty on local councils at every level, but are not giving them the means to make anything of it. It was abundantly clear in another place and in a subsequent exchange of letters between my noble Friend Lord Dixon-Smith and Lord Whitty that the Government intend to provide neither the extra resources to back the new power, nor to give councils the right to raise money themselves. The Bill is explicit that they will not be allowed to do that and we shall debate that in due course. That is a great shame. The point applies to all levels of local government, but in particular to parish councils, which are, by definition, smaller, have fewer resources and are likely to be more stretched. We are cautious about these proposals. We are keen to hear what the Minister has to say, as we have not yet decided whether we should support the amendments.

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Beverley Hughes):</B> Hon. Members will not be surprised to hear that we cannot accept amendments Nos. 87, 88 and 89. That is not because we do not value the role that parish councils and community councils can play in our country's democracy. I agree with the hon. Member for Bath that both have a vital role to play. He and the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) asked about the Government's view of the future of parish councils and the enhanced role that they can play.

<P>
If I sound weary it is simply because I have said this so many times now, but our commitment to the parish tier of councils must be judged not only by our words but by our actions. We have already created another 62 parish councils since coming to power and I signed the orders for many of them in the past nine months. We expect to have created between 80 and 85 new parishes in the first three years of this Government. Although Opposition Members tried to fuel fear among parish councils that we had a different set of intentions, which they did for their own political purposes, they now appear to agree with our position. We see a clear and strong future role for parish councils, but that does not mean that we should necessarily burden them with powers and duties that they are ill equipped to fulfil. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> On raising fears, the hon. Lady would be better off talking to her right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment whose remarks at the last Labour party conference, which he thought were unreported, started the hare running, rather than berating the Opposition.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> My right hon. Friend has put the record straight on many occasions. That newspaper report was wrong.

<P>
We must recognise that the statutory framework in which parish and county councils operate is different from that applying to principal authorities. That statutory framework needs to recognise both the limits and strengths of the role that parish councils play. Only a small number of the 13,000 or so parishes have more than one or two officers serving them, or have budgets of more than a few thousand pounds. There is little point in extending the powers of parishes in ways that they could not exploit or imposing a duty that they lack the resources to fulfil.

<P>
The steps that we are taking to modernise local government form an interlocking package of reforms. The power to promote well-being is being conferred on principal councils, alongside the measures to enhance political leadership and accountability, and through best value to secure continuous improvement in service delivery. We do not consider it appropriate to confer such broad powers without those complementary measures, and yet neither parishes nor community councils are subject to the provisions in part II of the Bill and only a handful are subject to best value. Parishes have a different set of checks and balances, both financial and legislative, from principal authorities.

<P>
That being the case, it simply is not appropriate to confer on them a wide-ranging power to engage in the same level of activity as principal authorities. That is not to say that there should be any diminution in the traditional role of parish and community councils in delivering benefits for their communities. Parishes and community councils will continue to use their powers under section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972, which allows them to support a wide range of activities for the local good, such as funding citizens advice bureaux, sports and leisure facilities and crime prevention measures.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bath referred to some consultation that he had undertaken, which suggested that many parishes were clamouring for this power. In fact, research by my Department found that, on the whole, these councils were satisfied with their ability to undertake and fund a range of activities using section 137 powers. We recognise that those powers may need further development and that a small minority found the limit on expenditure of £3.50 per elector a problem. We are therefore reviewing that this year as part of the wider local government finance review.

<P>
We fully expect both parish and community councils to play an important role in the community planning process, but we do not believe that they could or should lead it. However, we expect them to be one of the strategic partners engaged in community planning and we shall be making that clear in the guidance that we issue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> We shall come to this matter later, but are the Minister and her colleagues beginning to look favourably on the notion of some form of compulsion on other partners, including parish councils in a particular area, to participate with the lead authority on those strategies? That matter has been raised by a number of organisations and we have tabled amendments to deal with it.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> That is a complex issue. It raises the question of whether one body can force another to do things and we shall debate it when we get to the relevant part of the Bill. We would certainly expect parishes and community councils to be at the forefront of identifying their local needs and priorities. They are best placed to do so. Indeed, they are uniquely placed to engage their communities and to represent them in the inevitable discussions on community strategies and their delivery. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> This has been a fascinating debate. As I promised, it has been brief and my response will be too. The Under-Secretary of State for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston (Ms Hughes), made some encouraging remarks. She said that the Government are absolutely committed to the continuation of the parish council tier of local government. She also acknowledged that there are concerns about the problems that are created by the £3.50 limit that results from the 1972 Act and that the Government are considering changes to it. She also said that she is anxious to see the role of parish councils enhanced. Indeed, she went even further. She said that parish and community councils were ``best placed'' and indeed, ``uniquely placed'' to represent and deliver to their local communities.

<P>
The Minister is clearly a passionate supporter of parish councils. I am delighted to hear that. I hope that that message will get out more widely than elsewhere. We then come to the problem. She spoke with passion about parish councils and how she wanted their role to be enhanced and them to be the prime movers in everything that goes on, but she is not prepared to give them any additional powers to do anything about it. Indeed, a further complication should worry parish councils. The guidance that she will issue about how the next tier of local government will draw up its community plans will make it clear that parish councils will be expected to be at the heart of that process.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that I made it clear that I expect parishes to be strategic partners but not strategic leaders? Does he therefore accept that there is a legitimate difference in role between principal authorities and parish authorities in such matters?

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I accept that and I was about to mention that matter. The Under-Secretary said that parish councils will be strategic partners and not the lead body in the process. The hon. Lady must surely recognise that directly involving parish councils in developing the community plans in the way she described, which is exciting and which I fully support, will create additional burdens on the councils, yet she just said that because parish councils have little money and no staff, they are incapable of doing more, which is why she cannot accept the amendments. Although she says that they cannot take on additional powers, she has announced that they will have to accept additional responsibilities, without explaining how they will fund, staff or fulfil them. The hon. Lady's thinking shows some confusion.

<P>
What is crucial is that the Government have been clear about their commitment to the future of parish councils and I hope that the hon. Member for Eastbourne joins me in welcoming that. I think that he noticed, as I did, that there was no answer to the question of funding at any tier of local government to support the promotion of well-being, but we will return to that issue. Although the Government's thinking on the working of community planning and related matters remains somewhat confused, we have teased out a few clarifications from the hon. Lady, who has been helpful.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The Liberal Democrats make much of their understanding of partnership and their ability to deliver it, particularly at local level, so I am confused. Is the hon. Gentleman unable to understand how the principal authorities can support and assist a parish council as a partner in playing its legitimate role?

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for giving me the opportunity to share with her my understanding of that relationship. However, I suspect that I would be ruled out of order if I went into detail about it.

<P>
I accept that, in existing legislation, the principal authority can provide support to the minor authority-in this case, the parish council-to enable it to carry out some functions. Unfortunately, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne reminded us, the operation of parish councils varies enormously. Clearly, hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are commited not only to a continuation of but a renaissance in parish councils and to enhancing their powers and giving them greater opportunities to serve the local communities that they represent. Although we say that we want to accomplish that, we are struggling to find ways to achieve it.

<P>
The amendment was just one vehicle to start the process of parish council renaissance, but I am delighted that we have obtained at least a commitment to seeking ways of achieving that. I am sure that I should have known about it, but I did not, so I was also delighted to hear that the Government are examining the £3.50 issue. I hope that, before long, we will hear about their intentions on that. Given the fact that we have made some progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Sir Paul Beresford </B>(Mole Valley): I welcome you to the Committee, Mrs Michie, as I was not here last Tuesday to do so.

<P>
I have a simple question for the Under-Secretary, which she may answer during her explanation of the clause. My memory is failing me. Metropolitan unitary authorities are obviously covered by the clause, but to which class in the list do such authorities belong?

<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> Clause 1 establishes the local authorities to which part I of the Bill applies. It sets out the authorities that will be provided with the new powers of well-being and community planning. Under the clause, all principal authorities will be given the new powers. Parish and town councils will not, and neither will police, fire and civil defence authorities.

<P>
The reasons for withholding the powers from police and fire authorities should be self-evident. These bodies fulfil only narrowly defined and specific functions and it would be inappropriate to give them broad general powers to undertake anything that might promote or improve community well-being. Parishes are in a slightly different position-

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> If the hon. Lady has received complaints from local authorities about their rate support grants, standard spending assessments and so forth, she will also have received many complaints from the fire and civil defence organisations, which argue that their main contribution to civil well-being and helping the community is through prevention. They argue that prevention is not taken into account sufficiently in the SSA, so it might have been appropriate to broaden it.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> No, it would not have been appropriate to broaden it, for reasons that I have already made clear.

<P>
As I was saying, parishes are in a slightly different position. Although they, too, have limited statutory responsibilities, the Government believe that town and parish councils have an important role to play in local government. The new duty of community planning, which clause 4 will place on local authorities, will provide a process through which local communities can articulate their needs and aspirations and local service providers-local authorities, health and police authorities-can join together with the community to decide on local priorities for action.

<P>
As the closest level of government to local communities, effective parish councils should be part of any community planning partnership and will have a vital role in ensuring that the voice of their communities is heard. The guidance on community planning that we intend to issue will emphasise that point. Although parishes are important members of the partnership, it does not follow that they are equipped or resourced to lead the process of preparing community strategies. Clause 1 therefore reserves that role to principal councils. The reference to district councils under clause 1(a)(ii) includes metropolitan unitary councils.

<P>
The Government do not believe that parishes should be given the new power of well-being, which is a broad power that can be used to extend the range of local authority functions. The clause has been drafted so that authorities can use the new power to do anything-even what they are already permitted to do using other powers. If such a power were extended to parishes, it would effectively end the distinction between parish and principal councils. If it had the new power, a parish would be able to do anything that a district or county council could do, which is not desirable. Parish and principal authorities are different and have different, if equally valid, contributions to make to local governance. If parishes were given the new well-being powers, we would be obliged to extend the best value regime to them and to strengthen their audit and inspection regimes. That would increase parish costs without necessarily improving services to the community.

<P>
Ultimately, it is the quality of public services that is important and we want those services to be joined up across layers of government to ensure that they are efficient, effective and responsive to the needs of local people. Parishes will be able to assist fully in that process through their role in community planning and through their existing powers under section 137 of the 1972 Act. The message that we have received is that that section already enables parishes to support a range of activities for which they have no specific powers.

<P>
As I said, we know that the annual limit on expenditure represents a restraint for a minority of parishes, so we are reviewing that limit as part of the wider local government finance review. I hope that the Committee will support the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The clause is mainly definitional, so it does not require a long debate-[
Interruption.] I am open to persuasion, however. We have already covered the most important matter of parishes. Having put down a further marker about parish councils, we are as delighted as the hon. Member for Bath that the Government have come to glory in terms of their attitude to parish councils. They now see their merits and seem to be staunch defenders of their position. As so often under this Government, however, we should wait and see what actually happens on the ground. The powers of parish councils are to be excluded from clause 1, which makes it even more important for the Government to recognise their more modest aspirations. I was particularly pleased to hear that the Under-Secretary is re-examining the £3.50 limit. Any revision of that limit, which is important and long overdue, will certainly receive our support.

<P>
On a technical issue, the hon. Lady said that section 137 of the 1972 Act will still apply to parish councils. However, one of the Minister's noble Friends in the other place said that the Bill would effectively repeal section 137. Does that mean that there will be a specific exemption for parish councils? We shall come to that issue later, so the hon. Lady and her advisers can mull it over, as I do not require an immediate answer.

<P>
What is the state of play regarding the draft guidance on these matters? The guidance for part II of the Bill has been available for some time, although it appears to be changing shape. It would be useful to know when it will be re-issued-I put down a marker about the issue at our previous sitting. We are dealing with part I, so it would be helpful to know whether there is any prospect of the draft guidance making an appearance during the Committee stage. A feature of this Bill is that much of what is proposed seems to happen off stage-in the shape of regulations or guidance. We are therefore being asked to consider narrow matters and to put our trust in ministerial regulations and guidance. Will the Minister clarify what is happening in this respect, to make this stage of consideration more interesting and relevant?

<P>
One fundamental issue will spill over into the rest of part I. This clause and subsequent clauses illustrate the Government's difficulties. First, they backed away from conferring a general power of competence on local authorities. Then, they did some humming and hawing about whether to make it a power or a duty. Now, they have made it clear that councils will have no extra money to carry out these worthy activities-that would have applied to parish councils, if they had been included. Councils will not even be allowed to raise more money in their local communities. Ministers also intend to hedge the new power with restrictions on how it may be used by means of regulations.

<P>
The truth is that the Government simply do not trust local government and do not intend to give it the powers that it needs to increase the interest of local voters above the dismal level that we saw last Thursday. We wish to make the provision more relevant and more helpful to local authorities-a theme to which we shall return again and again in Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Before we come to the end of this debate, will the Under-Secretary, who has acknowledged that part I responsibilities will impose additional burdens on local councils at whatever tier, explain how that relates to clause 96(5)?

<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I shall respond briefly to some of the matters raised. When we reach clause 7, the hon. Member for Eastbourne will realise that section 137 of the 1972 Act will be repealed for principal councils, but not for parish councils.That will regularise the position.

<P>
On guidance on the power dealt with by clause 2, I hope that hon. Members will appreciate that for it to be effective we need to ensure that it covers all the issues that may be of concern to local government and others in a way that is both clear and helpful. For that reason, we need to consult a wide range of organisations, including the Local Government Association. We have begun the process, but it is not complete and, of course, the legislation is not yet in its final form. Guidance will need to reflect any changes introduced by the Committee or during later stages of the passage of the Bill. We are not yet in a position to present the House with definitive proposals on guidance, therefore, but we have set out some of the matters on which it may be helpful in our memorandum to the Lords Select Committee on Delegated Powers and De-regulation. Others have emerged as a result of points raised during the passage of the Bill and through discussion with other bodies.

<P>
Clause 96(5) was inserted in the other place to avoid questions of privilege. It will be removed after the Bill has been through the House of Commons.

<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> These three amendments deal with the health of residents, enterprise and equality of opportunity in an area. They would widen the scope of the new power in the Bill. As it stands, the Bill might leave local authorities unable to use this power, or reluctant to do so for fear of falling foul of the ultra vires doctrine. I am open to correction on this, but we have to be clear that, like it or not, it is waiting in the shadows to ambush unwitting councils or Ministers if they do not operate within the limits of the Bill. I often think that ``ultra vires'' is the phrase that most councillors learn in their first week because almost everything that they want to do turns out to be ultra vires. We all remember the slight legal difficulties that councils such as Hammersmith and Fulham got into over the swaps deals. [Hon. Members: ``Or Westminster!''] I see that Labour Committee members are coming to life at the mention of this rather dry, legal doctrine. That is always encouraging for a member of the legal profession.

<P>
The truth is that it is not a dry legal doctrine. It has had a hard impact on a range of council activities-or proposed activities-for a long time. It has suited people occasionally to claim that they are intra vires and ultra vires, depending on the circumstances, whether that is the Wednesbury decision in 1948 or any of a string of decisions over which law students have had to labour for many years. The bad news for them is that they will still have to do so because ultra vires is not dead or even sleeping under the Bill.

<P>
That is why we thought it appropriate to put in some extra goodies that councils should look at, along with those set out in the Bill. One of the consequences of the Government backing away from giving councils a general power of competence-which was debated in local government circles for a long period by some weighty backers-is that they have had to pick and choose the areas that come within the new power, or what may in due course become a duty. Other worthy activities should be included and more may arise.

<P>
On enterprise, we are talking about the economic well-being of a community and it would be interesting for the Minister to be drawn out a little on what she has in mind.

<P>
Conservative Committee members are eager to ensure that this is not a charter to expand public sector activities and to create a host of mini-quangos. In the past quarter of a century local government has rightly moved away from physically providing many services by enabling others to do so. We do not want to see this new power in the hands of a few unreconstructed old Labour Kilfoyleites, using it as a way of going back to the good old days. [Hon. Members: ``Oh! Come On!''] I seem to have got Labour Members going again. This is marvellous. I should get an agent.

<P>
One of the most eerie experiences I have had since I took on this job was addressing the annual conference of the Association of Direct Labour Organisations last summer. That really was a walk down memory lane-the old Labour attitude is alive and well and lurking in many councils. We want to ensure that this provision is not simply a recipe for such people to expand public sector activities at the expense of the private sector.

<P>

<P>
We have mentioned health and that chimes in well with what the Government say in other areas too. This is part of the continuing attempt of Opposition Committee members to persuade the Government to engage in joined-up government. The Minister will be aware that a Government amendment to the Greater London Authority Act 1999 gave powers to the mayor to create a health strategy for London and to publish a regular report. I know that we all feel secure in the knowledge that that is in the hands of the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone). As the noble Baroness, Farrington of Ribbleton, said on 21 June 1999:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The effect of these amendments<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
-and remember that they were Government amendments-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>is that health considerations will be a top priority for the mayor in discharging his or her<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
-a bit of optimism there-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>two most important functions-the preparation of strategies and the exercise of the general power. For example, in deciding whether or not to exercise the authority's general power, the mayor must have regard to the effect that the proposed exercise of this power would have on the health of Londoners.-[Official Report, House of Lords, 21 June 1999, vol. 602, c. 766.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That strikes me as a perfectly reasonable remark in the context of not actually knowing who the mayor will be. Two days later, the Baroness also said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the GLA will be under a duty, both in the exercise of its powers and the preparation of its strategies, to consider their effect on the health of people in London and to promote improvements in their health.-[Official Report, House of Lords, 23 June 1999, vol. 602, c. 979.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We all know that the health service is going through a period of rapid change. We are learning to live with the concept of primary care groups and perhaps in due course primary care trusts-the different ways of organising and delivering health care that the Government have introduced and are introducing. Increasingly, local authorities-if they are to be the community leaders about which we hear so much-are becoming involved, even if they do not want to be, by Government diktat in matters such as community policing, so why should health be treated any differently?

<P>
Another part of non-joined up government is, of course, the provision through the national lottery of healthy living centres, at which a number of constituencies, including my own, are looking very carefully. That again is already involving local authorities who are putting together bids. [
Interruption.] The Minister for Local Government and the Regions will no doubt make her point in her own time. However, local authorities are already involved, and if the dread of ultra vires doctrine is out there in the long grass with a big baseball bat, we should perhaps extend the power to be sure that local authorities are entitled to act in the way that has been proposed.

<P>
On another issue, Wealden, which covers part of my constituency, introduced a ground-breaking policy under which local GPs prescribed physical exercise at the council's leisure centre for elderly people, instead of drugs. The policy was an enormous success and has been copied throughout the country. Again, one wonders why such a power should not be included.

<P>
Amendment No. 6 deals with equality of opportunity. I am a tad surprised, given the Government's professed support for such things, that there had to be a Conservative amendment and that the Government did not include such a provision in the first place. No doubt the Minister will explain that.

<P>
We need to discuss general issues of equality of opportunity, but one issue impacts on the part of the Bill that deals with structures. A few months ago in the House, I addressed a meeting of councillors drawn from many ethnic minorities. Although I got a friendly reception, I am pretty confident that there was not a single Tory councillor in the room. None the less, it was patently obvious that there was a tremendous groundswell of concern that the percentage of ethnic councillors was still lower than the percentage of ethnic people in the population but that such people would be disadvantaged by the Government's proposals on the split between executive and scrutiny functions.

<P>
On the more general issues, section 33 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 requires the GLA to have regard to the principle of equality of opportunity and to publish reports accordingly. Conservative Members have never been the friends of great bureaucratic machines for policing or delivering concepts such as equality of opportunity. However, we wonder why London is such a special case in this regard and is treated so differently. Of course, it had the privilege of being chosen to pilot directly elected mayors and we shall be interested to hear how Ministers think that that experiment has gone so far. None the less, Lord Harris of Haringey tabled amendments along similar lines to ours and spoke about the promotion of harmonious race relations. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That is a critical responsibility of local government.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The response from Lord Whitty, the Minister in the House of Lords, was less than enthusiastic. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am not sure that we should  link the question of the promotion of race relations and equality to the physical exercise-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of the power in the Bill. However, he also said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Government will be publishing a consultation paper within the next few months, which will look at equality issues. That paper will discuss placing a general duty of equality on all public sector organisations.-[Official Report, House of Lords, 25 January 2000, vol. 608, c. 1452.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I can imagine that the definitional aspects of that proposal are presenting a few challenges, not least in the context of the great section 28 debate, to which we shall come later. However, given that the Lords amendments were withdrawn on the basis of Lord Whitty's comments, it would be helpful if the Minister could say what stage the consultation paper has reached and why authorities outside London are treated less advantageously as regards health and equality of opportunity.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State for Local Government and the Regions (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> I listened with great interest to the hon. Member for Eastbourne. He is clearly struggling to understand the new approach to local government that his party is developing and far be it from me to interfere in the Conservative party's agonising. In some senses, the clause represents the Conservative party's problem in edging forwards to a new relationship with local government.

<P>
The power of well-being, which gives the power to respond to the environmental, economic and social needs of the area, expresses what some have called a power of general competence, but in a way that makes the responsibilities of local government clear. It is not local government's responsibility to engage in foreign policy or in issues that lie outside the scope of its public's concerns about what can be effectively achieved locally. Local people do not want local government to take over the powers of central Government; they want it to respond effectively to their wishes.

<P>
The clause begins to express those objectives more clearly. I must tell the hon. Gentleman that we did an enormous amount of work on the power of general competence, but all the academics and advisers from the LGA and its previous incarnations felt that such a power would not make much progress with the ultra vires problems. We reached the decision to work on the power of well-being because it would make clearer the objectives that the principal authorities can and should spend money on achieving. Local authorities can talk about whatever they like. In a free society, no one can stop them from doing that. In fact, they can probably do what they like, as long as they do not spend public money on it. The clause and the power will enable authorities to set local priorities and take decisions about how they wish to respond to those priorities.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): No such provision was in the original draft of the Bill. The Government must have thought about it, because it has been part of the general debate. Why did they decide not to include such a measure in the original version?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It was not in the draft, because it was not ready. As the hon. Member for Eastbourne said, the subject has been fraught with legal problems and we wanted to be sure that we could implement the measure by a means that would deliver our objectives. This is a legal minefield. We needed to find a way to give greater powers to local government, without giving it problems. We also wanted to ensure that we dealt with some other subjects on which much work had been done and some that we were pursuing from the private Member's Bill introduced by Lord Hunt-the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon may remember it-in the other place during the first Session of this Parliament.

<P>
I understand what the hon. Member for Eastbourne seeks to do with his amendments, but they would take us back to the problems that he said that he wished to avoid. In identifying specific areas of activity rather than more general economic, environmental and social ones- I defy anyone to provide specific examples that are not covered by the broader definition-the hon. Gentleman undermines the more general nature of the duty. Some wish to improve the wealth and social position of people in his profession, but we do not wish to do that. Indeed, we wish to avoid it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I cannot part company with the Minister on that. Is she saying that my arguments about health could be covered by one of the headings-social or environmental, perhaps? These are probing amendments and I am just probing.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am more than happy to give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. The broad powers in the clause have been framed intentionally to allow authorities to undertake a range of activities to promote or improve the well-being of their areas and all or any persons resident there. The term
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``economic, social and environmental well-being''<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
is sufficiently broad to encompass the healthy well-being of local residents. The health of residents is inextricably linked to their social and environmental well-being.

<P>
The prevention of ill health is as important as tackling it. Indeed, the local authority's role is probably more important in the prevention of ill health, through working effectively with health authorities, trusts and so forth to ensure that those bodies are working effectively on the requisite health matters.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Does the right hon. Lady not think that the consequence will be an even more vociferous chorus of demands from local authorities for more money? They will say that they have been given wonderful new duties and that they must have more money to carry them out. It is already clear that the new mayor of London will spend much of his time saying that London does not receive its share-I hope that the Minister will turn a blind eye to such a patently untrue observation. Will the provisions not turn out to be a rod for the local authorities' own backs? The Minister talks about agonising. Is she not agonising over the future of the local authority finance system and will she not come to regret it?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Following the right hon. Gentleman's first intervention, I meant to say that I hoped that his injury was not too serious. If he has tripped over pavements in his Skipton and Ripon constituency, surely he would wish that the local authority had paid greater attention to his well-being. Perhaps the accident happened in Westminster and he would like to have a word with the Westminster authority about his well-being.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> On a point of information, the Minister's solicitude for my health is deeply moving and I am most appreciative. If she really wishes to know, I have a photograph of my knee joint and cartilage in my pocket, which I can show her. The doctor has taken a significant chunk of my cartilage out: it was not the consequence of falling over anything. Had I listened to my doctor and even more to my wife, I would not be here-but the Minister's company is irresistible.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am concerned whether the getting up and down to intervene is part of the right hon. Gentleman's treatment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> In the sense that it hurts, it probably is.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We always appreciate the right hon. Gentleman's contributions.

<P>
The manner in which local authorities tweak the power is up to them. That is precisely the sort of relationship that local government has sought for some time. I understood that that was where the Tory party was in its machinations over the future of local government. We cannot say that local government should have only the duties that we fund and know how they will develop and, at the same time, say that we wish local government to be responsive to local demands and interests, thus reflecting local rather than national priorities. Is it sensible to say that new powers can be conferred only if we prescribe what funding goes with them?

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> If I could bring the right hon. Lady back to the question posed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon, is it not clear from this part of the Bill that local authorities can do whatever they like? She precluded foreign affairs, but I suspect that some local authorities could happily conjure up well-being for their constituents in a way that related to foreign affairs. The clause effectively allows authorities to do what they wish, unless restricted under subsection (3). Recalling famous sayings about the party being over, the financial consequences could be considerable. That was my right hon. Friend's point, which she has not properly answered. Is the right hon. Lady concerned about the financial consequences? She keeps telling us-as she did in relation to the previous Bill-how important it is for local authorities to be financially prudent for the sake of the wider economy.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Of course I have not changed my view about that. Financial prudence is an important consideration for all public bodies. My point is that decisions about that are and should remain local decisions. The new power widens the opportunities for partnerships and for working with other public and non-public bodies. As the hon. Member for Eastbourne highlighted, such possibilities were ruled ultra vires in the past and had substantial consequences for local authorities and central Government. Both we and the electors want local authorities to act responsibly, but Conservative Members cannot have it both ways. They cannot say that they want local authorities to have new freedoms and then complain that if they receive new freedoms they will act irresponsibly.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I hasten to add that my right hon. Friend and I were questioning the Minister's thinking, not expressing an opinion.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am taking manifesto commitments from recent local elections seriously. The hon. Gentleman may not have signed up to them, but others did. I apologise if I have associated him with what his leader said about the future of Tory policy on local government. I am happy to return now to the amendments.

<P>
The clause provides maximum freedom to local authorities to develop the local economy, provide economic assistance and promote wealth creation. It deals with the enterprise issues that were raised by the hon. Member for Eastbourne. Indeed, local authorities will be able to do all that they can do at present under their economic development powers in the Local Government and Housing Act 1989-and the provision will allow innovative councils the scope to do a great deal more.

<P>
The power is sufficiently broad to encompass the activities mentioned by Conservative Members. One might ask what would be the harm in accepting the amendments for the avoidance of doubt, if nothing else. If amendments Nos. 4 and 5 were accepted, they might have a detrimental effect, because they could by implication narrow the scope of the power of economic, social and environmental well-being.

<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders </B>(Torbay): I have a brief question. When a resident of a local authority feels that it has acted beyond its powers, he will complain to the district auditor. Presumably, the Government will provide guidance on the new powers to the district auditor. When will that guidance be published, so that we can see precisely what the Government have in mind?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said this morning that we are working on the guidance. We will seek to publish it, but it is complex and difficult and we do not have it yet. Of course, that guidance will have to respond to any changes that may be made during the passage of the Bill. We will certainly ensure that we issue draft guidance for consultation as early as possible and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will take the opportunity to respond then.

<P>
Although the amendments are worthy in themselves, their cumulative effect would be to confuse the legislation. By listing some of the matters that the broad formulation encompasses, such as healthy well-being or enterprise, we would raise questions about others that were not listed. Their absence from the Bill might be taken to mean that they were not encompassed by the generic term. Therefore, it is better to exclude any clarificatory lists and rely on the undoubted breadth of the economic, social and environmental well-being formulation.

<P>
Amendment No. 6 raises equality of opportunity. We will expect authorities to have regard to equality of opportunity for their citizens when exercising this or any other power. Any local authority that did not do so would be failing its community or sections of it.

<P>
The Government believe that local authorities should have regard to equality of opportunity in everything that they do. As the hon. Member for Eastbourne noted, we are already committed to introducing a duty of equality of opportunity on all public bodies, including local authorities, which will make the amendment unnecessary. In any case, the amendment is too narrow, as it would apply only to the exercise of the well-being power, not to the whole authority. The amendment is unnecessary because of other legislation.

<P>
I remind hon. Members that last week the Government tabled to the Race Relations (Amendment) Bill an amendment that will eliminate unlawful racial discrimination and promote equality of opportunity and good relations between people from different racial groups. It will place a duty in relation to those two issues on public bodies, including local government. We seek to widen that duty as soon as possible to take account of other equality issues, such as gender and disability discrimination. As the hon. Member for Eastbourne noted, we will issue a consultation document on the wider duty, probably towards the end of June.

<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful for that explanation. The Minister may be about to deal with this, but can she not lose sight of the point about London? Despite what she says on the health issue and amendment No. 6, different rules seem to have applied in London.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The new London authority is very different from the principal local authorities with which we are dealing in the Bill because it does not have similar responsibilities or powers. The GLA is a new, purpose-built body with few statutory powers; in contrast, local authorities have a raft of existing legislative powers and duties and we are crafting this provision on to those.

<P>
The GLA has working with it principal authorities that are affected by the Bill. To ask those authorities to give precedence to health above their other duties would, to put it mildly, confuse the issues. I hope that the hon. Member for Eastbourne accepts that the GLA and principal authorities are different and that we need to treat them accordingly in the Bill.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider what we have proposed. We understand his concern that authorities should deal with the issues. However, the manner in which he is trying to ensure that they do so may not work out in the way he perceives and may even make things more difficult for them. With that in mind, I hope that he will withdraw amendment No. 4.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for those explanations. May I also take this opportunity of thanking my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon for making the effort to be here today after his operation. Although it is a matter for you, Mrs Michie, and for him, it may be that-no doubt under severe provocation-the odd intervention from a sedentary position might be possible if getting to his feet causes him discomfort. It is good to see him and we wish him a speedy recovery.

<P>
These are largely probing amendments, but this is a massive new departure in local government jurisprudence and it deserves much consideration. The Minister seemed to think that I was not a fully signed up member of the cult that worships what she calls the new relationship with local government. She knows that I am allergic to words like ``modernisation'', but there are some hard legal and political facts to be addressed. Given the enormity of what is proposed, from the legal point of view part I could amost be described as laconic in its drafting. We have established that this is not a power of general competence. There has been a retreat from that and once one does so, one is into drawing lines and making definitions and, consequently, helping lawyers to send their children to public school and buy the cottages in the Dordogne that so many new Labour lawyers seem to favour.

<P>
Of course we are not interested in local authorities talking about foreign policy-although that does not seem to stop them, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley said and I suspect that the new mayor of London may have something to say on it. I believe that the Minister accepted the fact that, despite all the good stuff in part I, ultra vires will still apply. I am happy for her to intervene because this is a crucial point. Is it accepted by Ministers and their advisors that ultra vires will still be out there?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I accept that I cannot prevent citizens or organisations from taking a council to court. No Minister can exempt that right or make sure that it is never used. Of course that will be an issue, and then what happens will be a matter for the courts. My intention was to point out to the hon. Gentleman that the amendment may make that possibility more likely rather than less.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am gratefull for that clarification, which goes to the heart of this debate. What stops people going to court-apart from lack of funds-is not having a good or even a prima facie case. The Minister rightly talked about a legal minefield and I am sure that she is right when she uses that expression, but people will still be able to challenge councils for acting ultra vires. That dreadful phrase will still resound through the law courts from time to time.

<P>
The point of the exercise-apart from providing something for bored Government Back Benchers to do twice a week-is to ensure, as far as possible, that there are no legal challenges. It is our job to try to get it right. With our limited resources we have tabled a series of probing amendments designed to point out the difficulties. Let me put the Minister out of her misery: I shall certainly withdraw the amendments because they will have served their purpose. But we are not here simply to make debating points; we want to ensure that the legislation is tightly and properly drafted and will avoid, as far as possible, expensive legal challenges in due course, so that instead of exiting one legal minefield we do not blunder into another new one, for which we do not have a map. One can say what one likes about ultra vires, but at least it has built up a body of law over a long period and, broadly speaking, people know-or should know-where they stand.

<P>
We are embarking on a new body of law based, as is our system, on decisions of the courts. That will take some time to settle down and it will involve drawing lines. I bow to no one in my respect for the Minister when she makes assertions. Weeks, months or years from now, lawyers will pore over Hansard because of the doctrine in Pepper v. Hart, which says that they can look at what we intended. Every golden phrase that has poured from the Minister's lips will be taken apart and analysed by some very clever people, earning large sums-that excludes most of us-with a view to finding a loophole.

<P>
It is all very well for the Minister to say that the definitions do not include foreign policy, but do include health. She may be right, but when she says that it includes health, what are we talking about? Are we talking about fuel poverty, for example, which is a crucial issue in terms of prevention, and on which massive comparisons can be made with Scandinavia, for example, on the rate of deaths of the elderly due to hypothermia? We know all about that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Patrick Hall </B>(Bedford): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that modern local government-by that I mean going back to the 19th century, when, broadly speaking, it was set up-has always addressed public health issues? Therefore, what is new about the provision, apart from bringing it up to date and improving and enlarging those powers? Public health issues have always been at the centre of local government.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Absolutely. The hon. Gentleman is at risk of taking up an interesting diversion, which I know that you will put a stop to fairly smartly, Mrs Michie. I mentioned Joseph Chamberlain in the Committee's first sitting. What brought people such as him into local government was that at the time it was expanding into lighting, sanitation, slum clearance, electricity and gas, and all of those sorts of things. He was cutting deals and pushing ahead with new enterprises that had not been dealt with before by local government.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman may be slightly off message in using the word ``modern'' in the context of the 19th century. He may need a re-education weekend supervised by the Whips' Office. ``Modern'' is anything that happened since 1997; nothing before that date happened-unless it was the evils of 18 years of Conservative Government-of course. The hon. Gentleman is really asking whether we need the new power at all. Perhaps he should come back to me on that.

<P>
The Minister tells us-so it must be true-that health is included in the definitions, but is she right? What do we mean by health? Do we mean such things as fuel poverty, spending on insulating homes and so on? The rock up against which we come on all these aspects of the Bill is money. It is a bit rich for the Minister to make snide remarks about Tory policy-which is still a developing concept, of course. In my odd moments of leisure from the Committee, I shall be working further on our manifesto. It is all very well for the Minister to bang on about our policies, to which I will come shortly.

<P>
The power is great on paper, except for the legal worries that I have that people will come along and take up a legal challenge just for the hell of it-we all have such people as constituents-but the authorities will not have been given the resources. We shall deal with that topic in greater detail, so I shall refer to it and move on. It is a fact that the Government do not intend to give extra money to back the power or to allow local authorities to raise extra money. Joseph Chamberlain and his chums issued bonds and did all sorts of fancy things to raise the money to do what they had to do.

<P>
The crucial difference between the Government's attitude to local government and ours, with our new policies on local government, is as follows. The Government are great on coming out with pious things that it thinks that local government should be doing. They think that local government should take lots of initiatives locally on education, policing on so on. But they will not give extra money; they simply think that local authorities should get on with it. They also say that, whatever local government's local priorities, they should be doing certain things. They offer specific grants that authorities must compete for to do them. They do not say, ``Here is a large block grant. Make up your own minds what to do with it locally, according to the priorities.'' The same applies with this power. The Government say, ``Here is a nice power; go off and use it. But do not think about raising money for it and do not think that you will get extra money from us.''

<P>
Our approach is completely different. We are working on ways of restoring to local government enormous control over its revenue-raising and spending priorities. We are considering a range of options. That means that local authorities will make their own decisions which, in turn, means that in time people will take more local interest in government, either as voters or potential candidates. The Government have a dangerously centralising nannying approach to local government, and their attitude to this part of the Bill, not to mention the horrors still to come, is typical of it.

<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Amendment No. 7 seems simply to remove the words ``or present''.

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I shall dispel any doubt in a moment. Our point is that local authorities are there to serve their local communities. In the absence of a provision for charging for services-a matter on which we shall spend some time later-it is unfair for local council tax payers to meet the cost of providing discretionary services to people who are not resident in an area. This is largely a probing amendment, but why does an authority need to use these powers in relation to those present, as opposed to those resident in an area?

<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I believe that the Minister will confirm this, but as I read it, the provision would apply to homeless people, gipsies, asylum seekers and so on.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I was coming to that. The scope for the provision is vast. We should be told what the Government have in mind. It can cover travellers-I prefer that expression to gipsies-who turn up, often on bank holidays for some reason, and cause considerable problems in some areas. It can cover asylum seekers, tourists and a whole range of people.

<P>
This provision has quite significant implications for the SSAs of a place like Eastbourne. If there are to be no extra resources, how will it apply to the many people-the million plus who visit Beachy Head in my constituency-who are present for part of the year but are not resident? Our grant for health services to some extent reflects the fact that visitors fall over pavements or have heart attacks. It does not happen that often-I do not want to put people off coming to my constituency-but visitors require local health services on a significant number of occasions.

<P>
The potential implications of the provisions are pretty substantial. I hope that the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) has recovered from last Thursday. He is right that the provision appears from a cursory reading to cover a large number of potential temporary residents in a location. The legislation needs to cover the ordinary rather than the extraordinary situation. Could the subsection empower a council to support the actions of a group of eco-warriors opposing the construction of a bypass? They might claim to be acting in the environmental interests of the area, but that could be totally alien to the wishes of the local residents who may have campaigned for years for that bypass. Is that the sort of thing the Government have in mind?

<P>
Could the provision be used, just to take an example out of the air, by a directly elected mayor or someone like that who has links with extreme organisations such as violent anti-capitalist demonstrators? Perhaps he or the authority could be in a position to spend money on looking after them. The Government must explain why those present cannot be covered by the rest of clause 2 and they must ensure that those resident and paying for services in an area have first call on those services.

<P>
<B>Mr. Patrick Hall:</B> I am surprised that the hon. Member for Eastbourne moved the amendment given that a similar one was withdrawn by his noble Friend Lord Dixon-Smith in another place. We are talking about a discretionary power for local councils to promote the social, economic and environmental well-being of their areas and councils, implementing that power in the interests of all or any persons resident or present in that area. That surely means working with, and listening to and trying to reach out and respond to all sections of the community.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> It is clear why my hon. Friend tabled a probing amendment. The hon. Gentleman just described what he thinks that the provision means, showing that he is also uncertain about it. We need some clarification here.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> I am not sure where that intervention was leading. I shall continue to make my points nevertheless. It may be a probing amendment but it is on the record and a response is in order. Local authorities, in trying to work in the interests of residents and those present in their areas, will need to listen to those people. Obviously, the majority would be local residents but they are not the only people there. The life of most towns, cities and local authority areas, including rural areas, is not characterised only by the permanent residents. It is self evident that other people are included such as students, tourists, commuters and shoppers who go from town to town according to their preferences. There are seasonal workers too as well as the homeless and rootless people who live rough on the streets.

<P>
Whether the amendment is probing or not, do the Opposition seriously seek to dismiss and reject all those people by pressing their amendment today? The Government have been consistent in their approach to the matter. The well-being of an area means the well-being of the permanent residents and those groups that I and others have mentioned. The White Paper ``Modern Local Government In Touch with the People'' is clear. Paragraph 8.11 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>enabling councils to take steps which in their view will promote the well-being of their area and those who live, work and visit there.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That is the only sensible and inclusive approach. It is the only fair approach in contrast with the potentially rather divisive one that the Opposition may be dallying with today. Reference to eco-warriors, violent demonstrators and others is a diversion. The law has every means of dealing with people who break or might break the law, wherever and whoever they may be.

<P>
I shall be brief, as others in the Committee have clearly set the tone. The amendment should be opposed quite firmly. I hope that, on reflection, the hon. Member for Eastbourne will follow the lead established by his noble Friend in another place and withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I hope that I can be genuinely short, unlike the initial protestations about shortness that we have heard, followed by the reverse. That seems to be reflected in the Liberal Democrat party manifesto too.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bedford (Mr. Hall) reminded me of what used to happen and probably still does. When new duties are delegated or imposed on local authorities they are reflected in the SSAs and there are discussions and calculations. The hon. Gentleman raised quite an interesting point. If people present includes tourists, a large number of local authorities will be interested in the Minister's definition. York and places such as that, including Westminster, benefited considerably in their SSAs because of the burdens placed on them by tourists. It will be interesting to hear the Minister's reply to amendment No. 7, which my hon. Friend tabled as a probing measure.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I think that the hon. Member for Mole Valley was becoming worried about members of his Front Bench denouncing some of the previous Government's actions. The weighting given to visitors in SSAs was enhanced-to put it mildly-somewhat beyond what anyone believed to be the true cost of visitors. I remind the hon. Gentleman that allowance is still made for visitors, but it is not of the exceptional nature that effectively benefited a particular authority only-overwhelmingly so under the previous Government. I must not get drawn further into that.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bedford said that Opposition Members need to remember that this is a power, not a duty. It is about the way in which local authorities establish their priorities for what is important for their area. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) tells me that more business people visit his borough every day than any other. In areas that attract a substantial number of visitors, it would be remiss not to ensure, within the power, that authorities were able to address that if they considered it important for the well-being of their area as a whole. The hon. Member for Eastbourne made it clear that amendment No. 7 is a probing amendment. On that basis, I invite him to withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I thank the Minister for her explanation, so far as it went. However, she did not tackle in detail the specific categories that were mentioned. The hon. Member for Bedford spoke about the homeless and the roofless. If I may put it in a dispassionate way and consider another category-commuters or tourists-we could be talking about perhaps millions of people, but there comes a point at which people who live locally and pay local council tax will have a view about the proportion of money that is being spent on them compared with people who are merely present but who make no contribution to local finances.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Jenkins </B>(Tamworth): Let us get this in perspective. One must be careful about saying that tourism has no effect on the local economy of a place such as Eastbourne. The hon. Gentleman portrays Eastbourne as a place where people trip over paving stones that stick out. I should have thought that his local authority would be careful to ensure that it enjoyed a good reputation and that visitors had a good time there. Failure to give Eastbourne's local authority that power would be detrimental to the local economy. I am sure that the people of Eastbourne would be extremely sad to be portrayed in that way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> This is getting interesting. So the new power is to ensure that people have a good time. That is marvellous. The definition is infinitely elastic. [Laughter.] I look forward to that ending up in court. I want to put it firmly on record that people do of course have a good time when they come to Eastbourne.

<P>
My point is that if people come in and out of areas as, say, commuters, unless they own a business-in which case they contribute indirectly through business rates-they are not making a direct contribution. There are endless arguments, which I had more than once with my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley when I was leading a delegation from Eastbourne, about the extent to which day visitors are reflected in SSA calculations, about the average length of stay and so forth. Those are immensely complex issues, and it is a mystery to me how my hon. Friend retained his sanity-[Laughter.] It should be put on the record that he did.

<P>
By including the little words ``or present'', the Government are making another rod for their back. One might ask why the Opposition should worry if the Government are intent on making rod after rod for their own back, but we are trying to be helpful and constructive. In that spirit, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
Government amendment No. 99.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am happy to speak to the amendments. I can dispense quickly with amendment No. 72, which replaces the words ``have regard to'' with the word ``determine''. There was a debate on that in the House of Lords. The obvious purpose of the amendment is to ensure the transparency of an authority's decisions and actions. We thought that the phrase ``have regard to'' was rather wishy washy and that ``determine'' was much more serious.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
All the amendments relate to the provisions for the promotion of sustainable development. Quite apart from being ungrammatical, amendment No. 107, which was tabled by the Liberal Democrats-[
Interruption.] I shall let the hon. Member for Bath defend his own amendment, which would water down the new power to such an extent that it would be virtually useless. Local authorities would be under constant threat of legal challenge on the basis that a decision did not provide ``reasonable balance''. Again, that provides work for the lawyers, rather than improving the Bill.

<P>
Government amendment No. 99 is linked to the Government's proposal to impose a duty on local authorities to produce a community strategy, which we shall discuss in more detail later. The amendment will reduce local authorities' flexibility in using the new power if they want to apply it in an unanticipated way that conflicts with their community strategy. They will first have to review ``their strategy'', which is overly bureaucratic and burdensome. However, in addition-we have seen this more than once in the Bill-the strategy will be subject to guidance from the Secretary of State. An obligation to have regard to the strategy would further extend the Secretary of State's power to circumscribe a council's freedom of action.

<P>
Our amendment would ensure that councils face as little constraint as possible in using the new power. The obligation to have regard to sustainable development risks opening up councils to legal challenge, especially from well-funded environmental pressure groups, which are all too willing to take councils to court. Our amendment would limit that risk, although we can be persuaded that there are other ways of achieving that. At the same time, the amendment would ensure that councils can be held to account for the impact of their actions on the goal of sustainable development.

<P>
That issue was developed in some detail in the House of Lords. My noble Friend Lord Dixon-Smith noted that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``sustainable development'' is not a precise phrase.-[Official Report, House of Lords, 25 January 2000; Vol. 608, c. 1442.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I have not had a chance to check the legal dictionaries, but I doubt whether there is a clear legal definition of that phrase. We think that we know what it means, but it would be interesting to hear what the Minister says. I suspect that we will find that as many meanings are ascribed to that phrase as there are members of the Committee.

<P>
If a well-funded environmental group took action against an authority, how would we define the phrase ``sustainable development''? A judicial review would be perfectly possible in such circumstances. Local authorities could again face considerable expenditure on legal fees. Wearing my politician's hat, I am eager to avoid that if possible. Therefore, anything that we can do at this stage to remove or at least to minimise that possibility would be welcome.

<P>
Lord Whitty, the Minister who responded to the debate in the Lords, recognised that there was concern, but did not seem to believe that it was terribly important. My understanding is that he felt that it was enough to write into the Bill the provision that a local authority must take sustainable development into account. He felt that that was the right way to word the obligation as simply a way in which local authorities would exercise their powers. However, the more discretion that one allows in such a provision, the more open one is likely to be to some sort of legal challenge.

<P>
Having said all that, I think that we all accept that local authorities should take account of sustainable development in the exercise of those and other powers. That is a modern and perfectly sensible approach. We simply wonder whether the wording could not be tightened up slightly, to the benefit of the Bill as a whole.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am a little taken aback, because the hon. Member for Eastbourne chided me on the grammar of amendment No. 107. Normally, I pride myself on getting such matters right. I have re-read the amendment, but I am still finding it difficult to discover what the grammatical fault is. I hope that I will be educated before our deliberations end, so that I do not make the mistake again, although at the moment I do not know what it is.

<P>
I find it interesting that the three amendments have been grouped together-this is in no way a criticism of your chairmanship, Mrs Michie-because they do three different things. My reading of Government amendment No. 99-which I confess is very different from that given by the hon. Member for Eastbourne-is that it removes any responsibility on local councils to have any regard whatever for sustainable development. Under the amendment, all reference to sustainable development is deleted.

<P>
I can understand the Government's concern about the current wording of subsection (3), because it requires a local authority to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>have regard to the effect which the proposed exercise of the power would have on the achievement of sustainable development in the United Kingdom.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That puts a huge pressure on local authorities, whereas it seems much more sensible for them to have regard-if that is to be the phrase-to the impact of their moves on sustainable development in their own area. Our amendment No. 107 would ensure that the reference is to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>sustainable development in their local area<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
rather than throughout the whole of the UK.

<P>
More surprising, however, is amendment No. 72. The hon. Member for Eastbourne went to great lengths to tell us how imprecise the phrase ``sustainable development'' was and how it meant that the Bill was a charter for lawyers by creating the possibility of huge expenditure by local authorities seeking to defend themselves against charges that might be made by eco-warriors. He referred to a sort of Swampy charter.

<P>
However, the hon. Member for Eastbourne does not seek with his amendment to remove the phrase ``sustainable development''. Indeed, he would make the position of local authorities more difficult by saying that they do not have to have regard to the effects of their moves on sustainable development; they merely have to work out what the effect is. They would not have to do anything about it, but merely determine what the effect would be and, presumably, publish it. The amendment moved by the hon. Member for Eastbourne would make the legal aspects even more difficult, while at the same time removing any possibility that local authorities, having determined the impact on sustainability, would have to do something about it. That is a bizarre proposal.

<P>
The main aim of amendment No. 107 is to tease out an issue that was not only debated during discussion of this Bill in the other place, but was discussed and conceded by the Government during the passage of the Greater London Authority Act 1999. During the passage of that Act, the matter that I wish to raise was debated and resolved, certainly to the satisfaction of Liberal Democrats.

<P>
When the Government first proposed this legislation, we were advised about their position by reading the local government White Paper of 1998, which set out their intentions for a power of general competence or, as it is now precisely defined, a power of well-being. The White Paper stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in taking decisions affecting their areas or its people, councils will have to weigh up the likely effects of a decision against the three objectives.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those three objectives were also referred to. The original proposal was that the Government would consider the integration of economic, social and environmental well-being. All three were considered to be important; all three had to be taken together and the balance between them weighed. The Bill provides a power for local councils to take one or more of those three, but they do not have to take all three together and look at the balance between them.

<P>
Equally, in the Greater London Authority Act 1999, the Government acknowledged that in balancing the three, councils should have regard to the sustainable impact on the local environment. Amendment No. 107 simply takes us back to what the Government originally proposed. In their amendment No. 99, they have not only moved away from that to what is now contained in the Bill, but also removed any reference whatsoever to the impact on sustainable development.

<P>
Both of those moves are in the wrong direction and amendment No. 107 gives the Government an opportunity to explain their thinking. I hope that they may be able to do so satisfactorily, but I confess that I think that is extremely unlikely.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I have three points. On the argument about the relative merits of ``have regard to'' and ``to determine'', ``have regard to'' is one of those wonderfully convenient expressions rather like the word ``appropriate''. It stands for something that one does not have to explain and is therefore very useful. The Minister used the word ``appropriate'' repeatedly this morning, but something is either right or wrong and it is helpful to say so. The phrase ``have regard to'' is more useful; it means that one has to act consistently with something, whereas ``to determine'' means that one has to evaluate, but not necessarily take any notice of it. This is one occasion when the convenience of the expression is probably helpful.

<P>
I do not understand what the Government intend on sustainable development. As the Bill originally stood, I said to myself, ``Heavens above! Let us think of some practical examples.'' Craven in North Yorkshire-my own council-is one of the smallest councils in the country, with a population of 50,000. The chief executive of Craven would suddenly have to work out the impact of sustainable development in the United Kingdom. How on earth is he to do that? Is he going to phone up the Government office in Leeds and say, ``Look, Fred, I have a problem here. Could you briefly explain the sustainable development policies of the UK?'', or is he to ask someone in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions for bits of advice-perhaps the Minister for the Environment, who is busy patching his council together again?

<P>
Local authority issues must be practical, achievable and accessible, yet these provisions are remote from the practicalities of how local authorities can act. Some authorities might simply declare that it is consistent; some might offer some mumbo jumbo about broad principles; and one or two might wish to send a delegation to Rio. None of these is a practical answer.

<P>
The clause does not provide a practical formulation. Local authorities must have regard to considerations that are available and capable of being evaluated. Local evaluation is important, by why have the Government moved away from the thermo-nuclear option-asking for the impact on the United Kingdom-to removing any option altogether and losing interest entirely?

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I had thought that sustainable development was a motto engraved on every single flag flown by the present Government, but suddenly it has disappeared from the text. Instead, we have this extraordinarily tautological clause, which states that local authorities must apply policies that fit in with their strategy. In other words, their strategy must be consistent with their strategy. Wonderful-though some local authorities might find even that quite difficult. The clause is tautological nonsense, which should be got rid of. I simply cannot undertand it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way, not least because he might appreciate the opportunity to sit down in the middle of his entertaining and helpful contribution to the debate. I wish him a speedy recovery. In view of the right hon. Gentleman's opening remarks about the difference between ``determine'' and ``have regard to'', is he supporting or opposing the amendment tabled by his hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne? He appears to be speaking against it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The hon. Gentleman must realise that there is a seamless thread on this side of the Committee. The free play of ideas within my party is essential to policy formulation. We have seen a draconian disciplined approach from the Government Benches-yet two Labour Back Benchers have actually spoken today, so a serious breakdown in discipline is obviously beginning to break out. I noticed that the Government Whip left for quite a long time and some interventions took place when he was not present. One hon. Member who intervened has disappeared already. Clearly, difficulties need to be addressed on that front. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne is anxious to encourage the participation of all members of this team and I am trying to assist him.

<P>
My serious question to the Minister relates to concerns about the broad policy of achieving sustainable development. We all wish to achieve that, though there are legitimate arguments about defining various impacts and the means of achieving it. My point is that it is extremely difficult to ask a local authority to determine the impact of a policy in such broad terms. The fact that the Government may wish to revise that does not surprise me, but I am surprised that they wish to remove it and put in its place a phrase that asks local authorities to act in accordance with their own policies.
 
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> One matter is clear: all sides can agree that the Bill as drafted needs amending and that it does not achieve our objective of making clear the links between the well-being power, the community strategy and sustainable development. I understand the desire of the hon. Member for Eastbourne for authorities to consider the effects of their actions and for us to be clear about what that means in practice.

<P>
However, like the hon. Member for Bath and, indeed, the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, I do not feel that amendment No. 72 makes much progress towards achieving that aim. The hon. Member for Eastbourne referred to discussion in the other place about the precise wording required. Other hon. Members have made it clear that the word ``determine'' places a requirement on the local authority only to establish the effects of the action that it is considering, and not to do anything about those effects. Therefore, the amendment would result in a pointless exercise for local authorities and would not greatly clarify the position.

<P>
I take the point from the hon. Member for Eastbourne that we need to ensure that we do not, inadvertently or otherwise, legislate so as to call into question the scope of the power in clause 2 or reintroduce doubt about how and when that can be used. Therefore, amendment No. 107 would be unhelpful. It would limit the power, because the authority would not be able to do anything unless it contributed to sustainable development. The requirement to secure a reasonable balance of the three elements would also create uncertainty about what an authority could do, and increase the potential for litigation, to which Opposition Members alluded. Therefore, there are problems with both amendments tabled by Conservative Members.

<P>
However, we all agree that we need a clear and practicable framework for the actions of local authorities in using their new power. Sustainable development must be integral to that framework. We have talked to the UK Round Table on Sustainable Development, the LGA and others about the best way to achieve those aims. The Government's approach is shown not only by this amendment, but by the amendments to clause 4. It was formulated by the round table and has its support.

<P>
The sum total of our approach achieves our aims as far as possible. As a result of those discussions, we have concluded that there should be a requirement on local authorities to have regard to the community strategy when exercising the well-being power, and Government amendment No. 99 introduces that requirement. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon is wrong to fear that the measure will decouple the community strategy and the well-being power from sustainable development, because in the amendments to clause 4, those connections will be made much clearer and more relevant than they are currently.

<P>
The amendments to clause 4 will require local authorities to prepare community strategies that will contribute to the achievement of sustainable development. The amendments require local authorities to have regard to community strategies for promoting well-being, and introduce a duty to prepare community strategies that contribute to sustainable development. Through those requirements, we are linking, as clearly as possible, the ways in which strategies should examine economic, social and environmental issues in a holistic way, with a view to improving the overall well-being of the community. In that way, well-being and sustainable development will be inextricably linked.

<P>
The power in clause 2 can be a potent tool for delivering sustainable development at the local level. The community strategy will provide the overall framework within which local authorities will use that power, but it will do more than that. It will provide the framework for all of an authority's other activities and for the activities of those of its partner organisations that have been involved in developing the strategy.

<P>
I hope, therefore, that hon. Members will accept that the approach that we propose in subsection (3) gives local authorities something tangible to consider when they use the well-being power. That approach emphasises the importance of using the power to help to deliver the priorities that local people identify within the strategy. That does not mean that local authorities can use only the well-being power to do things that are set out in the strategy. However, the provisions will provide a clear and sustainable framework within which local people can expect authorities to work.

<P>
That is our approach and, on that basis, I hope that hon. Members will withdraw amendment No. 72 and not press amendment No. 107. I also hope that they will accept Government amendment No. 99 and the amendments that we shall discuss to clause 4, and that they will see that we have tried as far as possible to take a belt-and-braces approach to making the required links.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I have listened with great care to the Under-Secretary and I noted her reference to the amendment that the Government have tabled to clause 4. Can she give me some comfort on that amendment, which we shall discuss later, but which is relevant to this debate? It adds to the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Every local authority is to have power to prepare a strategy for promoting or improving the economic, social and environmental well-being of their area<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in the United Kingdom.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
If the amendment is accepted, will the use of the well-being powers be required to contribute to the improvement of sustainable development? Furthermore, how will the Under-Secretary answer the implicit question from the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon about councils having to contribute to the promotion of sustainable development in the entire United Kingdom, as opposed to the local area that they serve?

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I can confirm that the word ``and''-this is the hon. Gentleman's important point-is included in the amendment. I hope that that reassures him about our approach to the balance between the three elements of sustainable development, which are also the three elements of well-being. We shall probably discuss the wording in relation to the rest of the United Kingdom when we get to the relevant point. I should say now, however, that local authorities will predominantly have regard to the contribution that they can make to sustainable development in their own localities. Some of the issues that a local authority faces might, however, have ramifications beyond its immediate boundary. We will argue that we should enable authorities to go beyond immediate issues of sustainability, even though we are not requiring them to take that broad perspective every time they think about sustainability. There will be times when authorities need to think about broader questions of sustainability beyond their own areas.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I apologise for interrupting the Under-Secretary a second time. As she suggested, there will be occasions when a local authority will want to take a sustainable approach that it believes and can demonstrate will benefit its immediate area. However, the reverse might be true of the impact on the wider area. One possibility-I do not support it, but it might well be cited-is that a local authority could develop an incineration scheme linked to a combined heat and power system that would develop sustainability in the immediate locality, but would nevertheless generate a large number of vehicle movements from outside the area to supply the materials. It might be deemed beneficial in the locality, but not in the wider area. I am still confused about how the Under-Secretary will deal with that conflict.

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> In many ways the hon. Gentleman is giving us examples that occur at every level. A proposal could have sustainable benefits in one part of the local authority area, but disadvantages, such as transport, in another. It is in the nature of trying to strike the right balance between social, environmental and economic benefits, that those competing and conflicting imperatives arise. It is impossible to give the hon. Gentleman an equation that can resolve those issues. They are inherent in the nature of thinking about sustainable development and well-being.

<P>
Having said that, I would ask the hon. Gentleman to reserve some of those points for later. The amendment removes the reference to the United Kingdom; it will appear in later clauses and we can return to those points in more detail when we debate them. I ask him to withdraw the amendment and not to press amendment No. 107. I commend Government amendment No. 99 to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I knew that I was missing something this morning-it was the word holistic. The Under-Secretary used it just now, which is a great relief. It is important to keep up the meaningless word count in local government policy. I apologise for accusing the hon. Member for Bath of tabling an ungrammatical amendment. I am still convinced that talk of reasonable balance is merely giving the lawyers opportunities, but I withdraw unreservedly my suggestion that it was ungrammatical.

<P>
I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon for probing my probing amendment. It is an example of big tent politics. He made a valid practical point about how the smaller council is to cope with grand concepts such as sustainable development. The Under-Secretary's answer, which eventually will become unsustainable itself, is that they will sort it out later in the Bill.

<P>
I was unkind enough on Second Reading to compare the Bill to one of those old Spanish hotels, but it seems to be part of a continuing process. We are now told that sustainable development will fall through a trap door on clause 2 but will pop up again later in clause 4. We look forward to that debate. Let us hope that we can nail down this rather slippery customer before the end of the Committee stage. It would be churlish not to withdraw my amendment, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Amendment made: No. 99, in page 2, line 8, leave out from ``to'' to end of line 10 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`their strategy under section 4'.-[Ms Beverley Hughes.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 110, in page 2, line 10, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) A charge may be imposed in respect of anything which is done in the course of exercising the power under section 2(1).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:

<P>
No. 94, in page 2, line 19, at end insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(g) recover all reasonable costs in exercising the power.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 95, in clause 3, page 2, line 30, at the beginning insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Subject to section 2(4)(g).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 3, in page 2, line 30, leave out subsection 2, and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The expenditure of a local authority under this Part in any financial year shall not exceed the amount obtained by applying the relevant provisions of subsections (4), (4AA), (4AB), (4A), (4B) and (4C) of section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972.

<P>
( ) All expenditure under this Part shall be subject to the accounting and inspection requirements set out in subsection (7) of section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 90, in page 2, line 30, leave out subsection (2).

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> As members of the Committee will be able to tell at a glance, the amendments relate to an authority's ability to finance activities that are carried out under the new power. It is fair to say that although amendments Nos. 90, 94 and 95, which were tabled by the Liberal Democrats, are similar in intention to amendments Nos. 3 and 110, they would fall short of achieving their aims. The main problem is that they would give local authorities the power to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>recover all reasonable costs in exercising the power.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That terminology is a little too loose in the context of the problem that we are trying to address. It could leave local authorities uncertain about incurring certain expenditure-and therefore unwilling to do so-because of the fear that it might be deemed unreasonable. The amendments contain an ambiguity that could create unnecessary legal arguments.

<P>
In due course, we shall need to have a major debate about clause (3)(2). Again, the amendments that were tabled by Liberal Democrat Members fail to pin down the issues with sufficient certainty. Amendments Nos. 3 and 110, by contrast, seek to bring more common sense to the charging arrangements. They would allow local authorities to charge for services carried out under the new power-although they would not be obliged to do so if they felt it to be inappropriate. That would strike the right balance. The amendments would also ensure that the power was not abused by maintaining the limits on discretionary spending that are stipulated in existing legislation and ensure that it is properly accounted for. The other amendments would do neither of those things.

<P>
This debate returns us to the question of financing the new power. Especially in the context of amendments Nos. 3 and 90, it is instructive to refer back to the discussions that took place in the House of Lords. Clause (3)(2) appears to place an absolute restriction on raising any funds at all to back up the new power. No sources of funds that I can think of are not excluded by the literal meaning of its words, which no doubt is the intention. That matter was debated at some length by Conservative Members in the House of Lords.

<P>
I shall refer to a letter on the subject, dated 8 March, which was sent to Lord Dixon-Smith by Lord Whitty, the Minister in the House of Lords. It is a brave attempt to clarify the position, but, like many such attempts, raises almost as many questions as it answers. Lord Whitty's letter states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The first point that I should like to make is that there is no limit on what authorities can spend under the well-being powers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So far so good. He continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Nor is there a limit on the activities that authorities can undertake using the well-being powers, except insofar as there are express prohibitions, limitations or restrictions on the face of other legislation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not want to return to that debate; we discussed the whole issue of ultra vires earlier this morning. The letter continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It will be for authorities to determine what they do and how much they spend on doing it.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
His second point is that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>there is nothing in the legislation that prevents authorities from raising money to be spent on improving the economic, social and environmental well-being of their community. The restriction in clause 3(2) merely prevents them from using the well-being power itself as the means of raising that money. Local authorities already have an array of specific money-raising powers at their disposal, including council tax.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Unfortunately, later in the letter, Lord Whitty refers to the Government's
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>reserve powers to step in and protect the local taxpayer if that is necessary.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Of course, as we know, that means capping. Despite the Government's brave claim to have abolished crude and universal capping, they have done nothing of the sort. As I have said before, and make no apology for saying again, the system that operated when we were in government, under which councils at least knew where they stood before they fixed their budget, no longer applies. It has been replaced by one in which there may be a knock on the door in the middle of the night and a demand that a council should come in for a ritual ticking-off by the Minister. It may be told that it might be put on to a list of recalcitrant councils.

<P>
I leave aside for a moment the details of the so-called refined capping system-that system operates under the council tax benefit subsidy scheme, which has had an extreme effect on certain councils. There should be no doubt about the fact that, whatever terminology they use, the Government are still in the business of capping. If we needed a reminder of that fact, it is contained in the fifth paragraph of Lord Whitty's very open letter. He states, with some equanimity and poise:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is not true, therefore, to suggest that the Government is giving authorities a broad spending power on the one hand whilst, on the other, denying them the freedom they need to raise the necessary funds  They can raise the funds they need within the existing finance system.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That returns us to where we started-there is no extra Government funding to back up the power.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> That is not true.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> If there is such funding, the Minister will no doubt tell us about it. The new power will not allow councils to raise revenue for funding. Money will therefore be taken from reserves or from another location. It will be taken from funds that are already allocated in a council's budget for other-presumably perfectly laudable-purposes. We want to allow councils to make certain charges for the services that they provide. We shall presently return to that matter in great detail. We have tabled a raft of amendments that describe specific issues for which councils should be able to make charges.

<P>
Behind this argument lies a question about the way in which the Government want to fund local councils. I said last week that the ground may be shifting under our feet while we discuss the way in which the new power will be funded. Are the Government intent on pursuing their front-line-first policy of diverting around the current local council structures and of providing funding direct for particular activities in local councils? If so-the spinning in that regard is pretty ferocious from certain quarters, including No. 10-all of the talk about the new power is more academic than we had thought. No funding will be made available to back up that approach, and the Government will move in exactly the opposite direction with regard to local government finance.

<P>
When all of those factors come together, it will be interesting to see how the Government respond. I realise that that is a broad issue that might be beyond the scope of the amendment, so I shall leave my argument there. The new power has no funding, the comprehensive spending review will come to a head in July, when we may receive an answer about front-line first, and an on-going review-I do not know when it will conclude-of local government finance is under way. When those factors collide, it will be fascinating to find out how the Government intend to fund local councils.

<P>
I want to discuss in more detail the idea of charging for discretionary services. There is a compelling and powerful-and virtually unanswerable-argument in this regard-that if a local authority is not obliged to provide a service, it should be entitled to charge for it if it does provide it. The only provisions that allow for charging by local authorities for providing non-statutory services are in the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, which amended previous legislation.

<P>
We need to keep a key question before us-when the dust has settled, and the Bill in something like its present form has been enacted, what real differences will there be in local authorities? What will local authorities be able to do that they cannot currently do? Will they be able to fund the performance of any new functions? If Ministers cannot point to examples of what they have in mind-

<P>
