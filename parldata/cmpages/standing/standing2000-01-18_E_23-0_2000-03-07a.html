<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I trust that you are all refreshed after the weekend and ready to do battle with part III of the Bill on road user charging and the workplace parking levy. I mention that to discourage any re-runs of previous debates—not that any hon. Members would wish to embark upon those.
<H4><center>Clause 139</center></H4>
<H4><center>Preliminary</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 606, in page 81, line 7, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Charges imposed in respect of any motor vehicle by a charging scheme under this Part shall be paid—
<P>
(a) by the registered keeper of the motor vehicle, or
<P>
(b) in circumstances specified in regulations made by the appropriate national authority, by such person as is so specified.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 625, 626, 637, 655, 656, 680 and 694.
<P>
Before we embark on these amendments, as usual, I am willing to allow a broad discussion of matters relating to this part of the Bill under the first grouping if hon. Members find that convenient, again on the understanding that we shall not re-run the debates when we discuss individual amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As you rightly say, Mr. Gale, we have reached part III of the Bill, which deals with schemes for congestion and workplace charges. If you are happy, I shall start with a brief overview to set the context of the policy behind this part of the Bill.
<P>
Clauses 139 to 146 deal with charging schemes and the procedures for making them. Before I deal with their purpose, let me set them in context. They are designed to give local traffic authorities the power to implement road user charging schemes to combat local congestion. They allow flexibility to operate joint schemes between different charging authorities, where that is the most effective way to deal with local traffic problems. The clauses also enable the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales to charge on trunk roads in limited circumstances to support local schemes or to help fund expensive infrastructure.
<P>
They are new and important powers, and the Government will work closely with the first charging authorities that plan to use the powers, to assist them, to learn lessons and to pass on best practice. Schemes will be made by order and local authorities will be expected to open them to widespread consultation and, if appropriate, to a public inquiry. Every scheme will be submitted for confirmation by the appropriate national authority. The Secretary of State will ensure that there has been full consultation and that the scheme is in the interests of the local community. That is likely to mean that public transport improvements have been made in advance of introducing the scheme and that there are sensible and robust plans for spending all the scheme revenue on a range of transport improvements.
<P>
Clauses 139 to 143 identify the authorities that can make charging schemes. As the Greater London Authority Act 1999 already provides powers for London authorities to make such schemes, the clauses provide such powers for all other local traffic authorities. Joint schemes may be made between local traffic authorities or between local, non-London traffic authorities and London traffic authorities, to give the flexibility required to combat congestion on local roads.
<P>
Clause 140 makes a direct link between charging schemes and the objectives in authorities' local transport plans. Any charging scheme must be an integral and coherent part of an authority's overall integrated local transport strategy. Charging schemes must help meet the policies in an authority's local transport plan, directly or indirectly. That gives an authority the flexibility, for example, to fund complementary measures outside its immediate area and promotes the Government's integrated transport policies.
<P>
Clause 143 sets out the two cases in which charges may be introduced on roads where the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales is the traffic authority. Charges may be introduced on a trunk road carried by a bridge or one that passes through a tunnel of at least 607 metres in length. This will allow charges to be introduced to help fund expensive new infrastructure or to promote integrated transport objectives such as reducing congestion. The Secretary of State has no plans to introduce charging on existing structures that are not already tolled.
<P>
Charges may also be introduced on roads for which the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales is responsible, if they are requested by a charging authority to complement its charging scheme. This limited power will ensure the effectiveness of local charging schemes. It might be used where a trunk road passes through a local charging area or where the effects of a local charging scheme would otherwise cause traffic management problems on a nearby trunk road.
<P>
Charging schemes will be made, varied or revoked by means of an order. There may be joint orders between authorities. The Secretary for State or the National Assembly for Wales will confirm—and could modify—the orders. Where a London charging authority is party to a joint scheme with a non-London authority, the order will need to be confirmed by the Greater London Authority and the Secretary of State and will not be confirmed until both are content.
<P>
It is envisaged that the Secretary of State will normally wish to ensure that there has been full consultation; that public transport improvements have been made in advance of introducing the scheme; that there are sensible and robust plans for spending all the scheme revenues on a range of transport improvements and, in some cases, that the right technology is in place. The Government will work closely with the first charging authorities that plan to use the new powers.
<P>
Charging authorities will consult interested parties when they make an order that establishes or varies a charging scheme. They will also be able to hold public inquiries when they feel that those are necessary. Clause 146 provides an additional safeguard by allowing the national authority or the GLA to require further consultation or a public inquiry and thus to safeguard the interests of the public and of business, if either feels that local consultation has not been adequate. Those powers can be used where an authority is making or varying an order, but if a charging authority wishes to revoke a charging scheme in the interests of the local community, there will be no barriers to it doing so immediately.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 606 and 626, for road user charging, and amendments Nos. 637 and 656, for workplace parking charges, serve two purposes. First, they improve the drafting of the Bill by separating liability for paying charges from liability to pay penalty charges that might result from the non-payment of a road user charge or failure to obtain an appropriate workplace parking licence. As drafted, liability for paying both charges and penalty charges is specified in clauses 149 for road user charging and in clause 165 for the place parking levy. Both clauses deal principally with the enforcement of charging and licensing schemes.
<P>
Secondly, the amendments make it clear that the registered keeper of a vehicle will be responsible for paying road user charges and penalty charges. The amendments provide that responsibility for paying workplace parking charge and penalty charges will rest with the occupier of the premises. As the Bill is drafted, the Secretary of State would need to make regulations to provide for those charges. The amendments remove that requirement and make the principle clear in the Bill. I hope that the Committee will agree that that is sensible, as they are important points of principle.
<P>
In addition, amendments Nos. 626 and 656 provide that regulations dealing with the notification, adjudication and enforcement of penalty charges are to be made by the Lord Chancellor. This will ensure that the Lord Chancellor's Department is responsible for regulations that deal with legal issues and will guarantee consistency in the legal process across England and Wales. Amendments Nos. 625 and 655 provide that regulations dealing with policy matters will be the responsibility of the appropriate national authority.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 680 and 694 to schedule 12 also provide that the registered keeper of a vehicle or the occupier of a premises will be responsible for paying charges and any penalty charges for road user charging and workplace parking levy schemes that may be introduced in London. Again there is a provision to make regulations to make persons other than the registered keeper of a vehicle and the occupier of premises liable for these charges. As before, the amendments also provide that regulations dealing with the notification, adjudication and enforcement of penalty charges in London are to be made by the Lord Chancellor. These are all tidying up provisions to the 1999 Act to ensure that it is brought into line with the provisions of the Bill.
<P>
That is an overview of the purposes and effect of the clauses that we are considering and the reasons why the amendments should form part of the Bill. I hope that the Committee will concur.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) for knocking his papers down, but Opposition Members are having a better start to the week than the Minister, who must be regretting 1999 Act now that it is all going wrong and the Labour party in London is tearing itself to pieces.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It will not surprise the hon. Gentleman to know that I had anticipated some such comment and it is in no way relevant to the matters under discussion.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I accept that the politics of the matter have no particular relevance, except that whichever Labour candidate one cares to choose will stick London with these horrible new taxes. It was an extraordinary volte face that the Government included congestion and parking taxes in the White Paper, their consultation paper, ``Breaking the logjam: The Government's consultation paper on fighting traffic congestion and pollution through road user and workplace parking charges'' and the London legislation. Before the election, the Prime Minister promised in public and on the record that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our spending plans need no new taxes at all.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and here are the extra taxes to provide for the spending plans that he wishes to fund.
<P>
The proposals will have little effect on congestion. Will the Minister give the Committee the evidence? He is waving a document produced by the previous Administration. That was unwise, because I can deal with that now. Fuel duties and other taxes on motoring were considerably lower then than they are now and we cannot reasonably debate infrastructure charging on the roads when fuel duties are so ridiculously high. The Government promised not to raise any new taxes before the election, but they accelerated the fuel duty escalator and because, in addition, they increased the number of budgets a year, it went rocketing up. They are raising many billions of pounds over and above previous Conservative plans. How can the Government now justify introducing yet more taxes on motoring when £34 billion will be raised in that way this year and less than one fifth of it will be spent on transport?
<P>
This is really about raising extra money. The whole traffic and congestion argument is just an excuse to raise extra taxes, like all the Government's other environmental taxes. Tax revenue comes first; all other considerations are secondary. By referring to clause 140, the Minister may be tempted to say that those taxes will be applied only if it is absolutely integral to the local transport plan. All the local transport plan needs is one line: we will introduce congestion taxes. The conditions of clause 140 are then satisfied. We are living in cloud cuckoo land if we believe that it is all part of some carefully honed and measured policy to reduce and then reverse traffic growth, which is what the Government originally promised on their website before the election.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government want to raise extra revenue, but they are going about it in the most inefficient and costly way possible. Will the Minister tell the Committee how much he believes the costs of collection of a congestion-charging scheme are likely to be? What is the threshold of efficiency that the Government should set as a proportion of the revenues to be used for that purpose? We have some pretty efficient taxes in this country and some pretty inefficient ones. Congestion taxes will probably be one of the most inefficient taxes to collect because the Government are rushing ahead without having any idea of the systems that local authorities will have to invent to collect it. Is 30 per cent. too expensive? Is 25 per cent. too expensive? How much revenue will be spent on collecting the tax and what will be an acceptable threshold?
<P>
What assurances are the Government giving about how those revenues will be applied? The local transport settlement for next year gave local authorities only £13.5 million in grant; the rest of it was borrowing approvals. That is probably the smallest grant, in real terms, given to local authorities for their transport virtually since records began. It is ridiculous to suggest that those revenues are additional to local transport grants because what the Treasury has given to the Deputy Prime Minister in hypothecation it has taken away in real money. It is not extra money but different money that will be going into local transport plans, raised from the motorist through the congestion taxes instead of coming from the Exchequer. The Government are presiding over a general increase in taxation and in spending on things other than transport. Less is being spent by the public sector on transport than under the previous Administration.
<P>
The Minister has to confront those fundamental philosophical difficulties. He will now give us a healthy diet of our own words for eating. As he probably knows, it is a salutary experience for Opposition parties and will do us no harm. However, I point out that he is now representing the Government—the party that said, ``No new taxes at all''. It is up to him to demonstrate that those taxes can be collected efficiently, when they cannot; that they will genuinely be additional, when the Treasury has already taken the money away; and that they are likely to have any effect on congestion.
<P>
We all know what the Leicester experiment showed—that £8 per day needed to be charged before there was any significant impact on driver behaviour. The hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Geraint Davies) is shaking his head. Does he dispute that evidence? It is well known from the research. If a £5 charge is put on people driving into London, the result will be more Jaguars and Rolls Royces, more official and chauffeur-driven cars, but perhaps fewer district nurses and teachers. Fewer people will come into London to do marginal work. The proposal attempts to force people out of their cars before any alternatives are in place. It puts the cart before the horse.
<P>
The Government should invest some of the additional revenues that they are already raising from the motorways in the sort of projects that we promoted when we were in government—light rail schemes, improvements in the railways and new tube lines. Those projects need to be in place before any charges are introduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the figures that he is quoting are based on surveys that have not been tested in the field? In places like Singapore, for example, the marginal impact of congestion charges is high in relation to modest changes in price. There is a dramatic easing of flows as a result of a change in drivers' behaviour. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman's thesis is completely flawed, as is characteristic of his arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I feel flattened by that comment.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I would like my hon. Friend to tell the Committee later about his visit to Singapore, where there has been congestion charging for some time. My understanding is that there is no evidence that congestion charging itself has any effect on the traffic flows in Singapore. What affects congestion is controls on the number of cars by rationing the licences available for the ownership of cars. I do not believe that even the present Government would go down that illiberal route.
<P>
In this country the Government pay out money to build car factories to encourage people to come here to make cars. They complain that cars in this country are too expensive and that people should be able to buy more of them more cheaply. They want us to pay tax when we insure our car and they want us to pay tax when we fill it up with petrol. Then, they want us to stick the car in the garage and take the bus.
<P>
That would be all right if there were enough public transport choices available. The Government should concentrate on providing more choices, not limiting the choices that already exist. That is what the policy is about: reducing choice, putting up costs and taxes and giving in to the Treasury's agenda for raiding the transport budget and the local authorities' transport budgets. It is not about putting extra investment into public transport, which is where it is needed.
<P>
Unless the Minister can deal with all those questions, in particular with the issue already-overtaxed position of the motorist, we shall continue to oppose this measure tooth and nail. He must be reflecting on the irony of the present situation. I have no wish to tempt your irascibility, Mr. Gale, but the Minister for Housing and Planning has already introduced the tax in London and it now seems a possibility, on the basis of today's poll, that those taxes could be imposed by the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone), which must have been the last thing that occurred to the Minister when he was putting the Greater London Authority Act 1999 through Committee. It is our job to make sure that the hon. Member for Brent, East does not win that election; our candidate says that he will not impose those taxes.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> You never know with Steve—always favoured them in government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right—Steve Norris is his own man. He will not put up these taxes as Labour candidates will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am sorry to disagree with my hon. Friend, but suggesting that the hon. Member for Brent, East will be levying the taxes is incorrect. Yesterday's announcement means that the Labour vote will be split down the centre, Steve Norris will be elected mayor and he will minimise charges on London's drivers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> He will not minimise them—they will not exist. I fail to see why the Government are getting so excited. There have already been fulsome pledges that such taxes will not be part of our campaign.
<P>
Will the Minister explain how he can justify imposing more taxes? He will say that it is not the Government who are imposing them. He will leave the dirty work to the local authorities, shifting all the unpopular and difficult decisions down to local level. He will keep the glory for himself and his Government by starving the local authorities of money so that they are forced to raise extra taxes to have any money to spend on transport. That is the underhand, dishonest and fraudulent way in which the policies have been perpetrated on the public. The Government promised no new taxes and here they are, red in tooth and claw, including them in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I confess that I am delighted to be back this week, but I am disappointed by that contribution from the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin). I gained little from his lengthy speech, but there were two nuggets buried in it to which I shall return.
<P>
My main concern about the speech by the hon. Gentleman is that he did not deal with the significant U-turn in Conservative party policy that, in effect, he announced. I recall, during the passage of the Road Traffic Reduction Bill in 1995–96, which I had the honour to take through Parliament, my discussions with the then Transport Minister, John Watts. At that time, he was somewhat sceptical about how it might be possible to reduce the ever-upward rise of traffic on our roads. After lengthy discussions with a wide range of people, he came to the conclusion that it would be possible through a range of measures, some of which would require charging for congestion. He also recognised, as does the hon. Member for North Essex, and I agree with him—this is one of his nuggets—that it could only be done by providing an increased range and quality of public transport to give the motorist more choice. During his time as Transport Minister, the view that action had to be taken on the problem began to develop within the Conservative party.
<P>
One reason for the change was that the motorist was losing out because of congestion. The CBI tells us that congestion is now costing British business about £20 billion a year. According to the RAC, the cost is somewhere in the region of £23 billion, which works out at a charge to every motorist of £800 a year. Motorists want to use their cars when they really need to and to be able to get around without sitting in permanent traffic jams. The Conservatives say that they are opposed to the sort of measures contained in this part of the Bill, yet that is a recipe for increased congestion on our roads and increased costs to the motorist. They are trying to have their cake and eat it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Of course I will give way. First, I should says that there was a period of sanity in the thinking of the Conservative party, when it seemed to be willing to start to address those issues. However, it is now so desperate for supporters from one source or another that it is trying to set itself up as the motorist's friend. By failing to address the problem of congestion with radical measures, the Conservatives will end up finding that even the motorist sitting in ever-longer traffic jams will no longer support their proposals. I give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned the CBI and the RAC. The CBI is campaigning for a reverse in the Government's cuts in the roads investment and improvement programme, and the RAC is opposed to congestion taxes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. That was an interesting intervention He picked two measures and said that the CBI was opposed to one and the RAC opposed to the other. When he looks at the full report, he might see that there are elements of support for the other measures from both of those organisations, just as there are from many other organisations.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Rosie Winterton </B>(Doncaster, Central): Is the hon. Gentleman aware that what the RAC has actually said is that motorists support congestion charging if the money is ploughed back into improving public transport?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising that point which I had planned to mention myself. I have said that there was a nugget of—I hesitate to use the words—common sense in what the hon. Member for North Essex said earlier—[Interruption.] The hon. Member for North Wiltshire has been clucking away for some time and I must give way to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman remember last week's useful briefing on the Bill by the Local Government Association? When I described Her Majesty's loyal Opposition as ``the Opposition'' he took strong exception to that and said the Liberal party was also part of the Opposition. This morning, he attacked my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex for what he believes to be our U-turn. Does that not demonstrate that he is in fact just the Government's poodle?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. It would be churlish of me to point out that we were both at the same briefing provided by the Local Government Association, but for rather different lengths of time. I spent a fairly lengthy time with the LGA, and I was able to have some serious discussions about the criticisms that it is legitimately levelling at the Government's proposals—criticisms that have led me to table a number of amendments opposing some aspects of the Bill. However, it would be wrong for me to say that I am opposed to the underlying principle of enabling legislation being proposed by the Government giving local authorities an opportunity to find interesting, imaginative, innovative ways of tackling a problem that they, the Government and the Liberal Democrats recognise needs to be tackled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman describes this as enabling legislation. It has already been made clear, both in the White Paper and elsewhere, that the Government will not look favourably on local authorities that do not avail themselves of these means. Local transport plans have to reflect the objectives of the Government, and it is the objective of the Government to make local authorities dependent upon this kind of funding instead of Treasury funding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Nonsense!
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Then why has it been put in the Bill if the Government do not want the local authorities to raise such taxes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I will promise the hon. Gentleman that if a local authority produces a local transport plan that does not include these measures, but which, in the authority's view, will start to address significant problems, and it can demonstrate that those measures will not solve them, I will stand shoulder to shoulder with him in support of the local authority against imposition from the Government. I suspect, however, that in a minute or two the Minister will rise to say that the circumstance will not arise.
<P>
There is a problem. I have already suggested that there is evidence that every year congestion is costing businesses £20 million and motorists £23 million. Congestion is responsible, through pollution caused by vehicles, for 3,000 or more deaths per year, and accelerating. It contributes to accidents on our roads, to damage to our road network and bridge infrastructure and to the overall damage of buildings by pollution from vehicles. Above all, people who need to use their vehicles are not able to do so effectively. We need to consider measures, not only to start to reverse the growth of traffic, but to reduce traffic in the longer term.
<P>
I turn to two nuggets hit on by the hon. Member for North Essex. First, he rightly referred to the need to create more choice for those who wish to travel.—[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We have been working on the Bill since the beginning of the century. Committee members should know by now that I take exception to hon. Members having conversations in the Committee. If they want to have private conversations, will they please do so outside?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> You will be pleased that I shall not extend the century much longer, Mr. Gale. The hon. Member for North Essex has hit on two nuggets. The first relates to providing more choice for people who need to travel. One way to achieve it, as he rightly said, is by a significant improvement in the amount and quality of public transport.
<P>
One intention of the proposals is to provide additional funds, ring-fenced for the benefit of public transport but, as the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions said, the only way in which the measures will succeed is if the alternatives are in place when they are introduced. It is therefore vital for there to be a mechanism in the Bill to enable local authorities to gain access to the funds in anticipation of their arriving from congestion and workplace charging, to allow them to provide instant support for local transport. We have tabled an amendment to that effect, to which we shall come later.
<P>
The second issue that the Committee must address is the Government's ``promise'' that the money raised by the measures will be additional money. We are talking about additionality. At present there is nothing in the Bill to ensure that that money is additional. I appreciate that the Minister cannot tie the hands of future Governments in relation to how much they will spend on public transport, but at a time when the present Labour Government are spending less Government money on public transport than the predecessor Conservative Government, there is concern about how to trust a ``promise'' of additionality from the charges. For that reason, we have tabled an amendment to ensure that there will be additional money. If the Minister can give an assurance that it will be provided by other means, we will consider that later.
<P>
Opposition Members broadly support enabling legislation that allows local councils, as part of their proposed measures to tackle road congestion, to consider such approaches in an effective, interesting, radical and innovative way. We believe, however, that they should also be given access to funds up front to improve public transport. They also need assurances that this will be additional money and will not be used by the Government to reduce their contribution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Coming from a district council that is run by a Lib-Lab pact, it does not surprise me at all to hear the Liberals paying lip service to philosophically and practically flawed transport proposals from the Labour Government. In North Wiltshire, the Liberals have recently chosen single-handedly to push, for their own ill-thought-through green reasons, a park-and-ride scheme outside Wootton Bassett, which is totally opposed by the Conservatives, the county and all those concerned.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex has convincingly argued that the introduction of either congestion or workplace charging would be yet another stealth tax on the motorist. That is precisely the way in which it would be perceived by the country at large and—especially during the run up to the mayoral elections in London on 4 May—in the Greater London area. It comes on top of the stealth taxes resulting from fuel duty imposed by the Government and the motorists will show them what they think of that in the ballot box.
<P>
My approach is not an illogical broadside against congestion or workplace charging, but an examination of three fundamental philosophical and practical flaws in the proposals. The Government's aim is not correct and even if it were it would not work. I am sad that my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex is not here, but doubtless he will follow my arguments in Hansard when he reads it tomorrow. He referred to the fact that I recently had the privilege of going with the Select Committee on Transport to Singapore to look at congestion charging, and on to Australia to look at workplace charging in Sydney. I hope that the report that will soon be presented on light rapid transit systems will reflect the experience of those places which shows that neither workplace nor congestion charging work.
<P>
In Singapore, the experience is patchy. The amount charged as one drives through the gantries is extremely low—the equivalent of 10p or 15p—so any sensible motorist who wants to go into the central area of Singapore, which is about the size of the City of London, does so perfectly happily. However, as one local taxi driver told me, Chinese people do not pay even 10p or 20p if they can possibly avoid it, so they queue for hours to wait for the magic moment when the gantry is switched off; then they all rush through it, causing congestion on the main roads.
<P>
A further problem in Singapore is that the minor roads do not have gantries and anyone who knows the way around town simply uses those to get into the small central area. That is claimed by the authorities as an advantage, because it takes the traffic off the main road and on to the side roads in the housing estates. The many people who live in housing estates adjacent to main roads into London would not necessarily appreciate the traffic being driven into rat runs down their side roads, but in Singapore that is considered acceptable.
<P>
The authorities want to have gantries on every single approach road into the centre of Singapore, but that will require an enormous capital investment, so the likelihood of their being able to do it in the near future is fairly remote. The likelihood of their being able to put gantries round Greater Singapore—a large city, the size of the Isle of Wight—is even more remote. The evidence, therefore, is that congestion charging is difficult to apply and has not worked where it has been applied.
<P>
The level of charging varies according to the speed of cars as they pass a traffic monitor. That speed has consistently decreased; cars have got slower and congestion has increased since the introduction of charging. The Singapore authorities tried to put the counter-argument, that although congestion is getting worse, it would have been worse still if it were not for charging. That is a rather Irish way to argue. The truth is that they brought in congestion charging, yet congestion has increased in Singapore. I am not certain why the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) is muttering but I will happily give way.

<P>

<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman holds the Irish in as high respect as I do.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Of course, I meant no disrespect to my close relations who are Irish. As a Scot, I naturally feel strong links with them. It is a colloquial manner of speech to say that it is an Irish way of thinking. I spent this morning interviewing a secretary who was Irish. The Irish go out of their way to make jokes against their own way of thinking, so it seems to me to be unnecessary to be politically correct. I shall continue to talk about an Irish way of thinking for as long as I remain in this place, and I shall have no compunction or conscience about doing so. The fact that the hon. Gentleman does says more about him than it does about the expression itself.
<P>
The Singapore experience suggests that congestion charging does not work and has increased congestion. When congestion charging is introduced, it can be done in one of two ways. One can make the charge very low, because one does not want to disadvantage the unemployed, the disabled and the poorly paid who may have to drive their cars into towns, even at busy times. In that case, charging does not work because everybody just continues to drive into town.
<P>
The alternative is to set the charge at a punitive enough level so that one can say to the badly waged—those common people in smaller, older and cheaper cars—``I'm very sorry, but it doesn't matter what your job is, what you want to do, or who you are, you can't come into London. You can't afford it because you are on low wages. But you, Mr. City of London merchant banker—you on £100,000 a year who has just taken a bonus this year of £2 million or £3 million from Goldman Sachs—you can afford it. And what we are going to do for you, Mr. Goldman Sachs executive, is get all the plebs off road. You happen to live in the suburbs in the south of London and you want to get into the City of London quickly, so we are going to find a way for you to do that. We are going to get the common folk off the road because they cannot afford £5 or £10 a day, but you can—not least because you charge it to expenses and are only too delighted to do so. I'II tell you another thing, Mr. Goldman Sachs executive. You are having trouble parking in the City of London. That is because even though parking is expensive—about £20 a day—it is still relatively cheap for some people. So we are going to clear space for lots of parking, so that you can park and put it down to your business expenses. We are going to impose parking charges in the City of London. Your Rolls Royce might take up two parking spaces but we will make that perfectly possible for you.''
<P>
Then Mr. Goldman Sachs turns round and says, ``Thank you very much. I don't mind, I'm perfectly happy to pay £5 or £10 a day—I am perfectly happy to pay £100 a day, it could not matter less. I am perfectly happy to pay a £1,000 a year parking charge—I would pay £5,000. It does not matter. I took a bonus of £5 million out of Goldman Sachs at Christmas and I don't care about parking charges. What I do care about is sitting on the Embankment with all those plebs. Get those people off the roads.'' That is what such people say, and that is what the Government are enabling them to do.
<P>
The Bill does not target the right people at all, because the charge is either too low, in which case it will have no effect at all, or too high, in which case it affects the wrong people. It has been suggested that it might cost as much as £10 a day to come into London. A great many of my constituents who have to drive into London would find that unacceptable.
<P>
There will be exemptions, and the Government are already getting into a real muddle over who will be exempt from congestion charging and workplace parking charging. They have said that hospitals, ambulances and fire engines will be exempt, but what about AA and RAC vehicles to help with breakdowns? They are not to be exempt; they will have to pay to come in to remove the very causes of congestion, namely the broken-down cars. Are the disabled to be exempt? Are the Government going to slap a huge charge on the disabled, who may be so disabled that they can get out of the house into their specially adapted disabled vehicle, but whom the thought of walking down the road to the station or to the light rapid transit system is wholly unacceptable?
<P>
What is the Minister's approach to the disabled? Will he allow charges to be slapped on them? He is showing a lack of concern for those who are unable to travel by any means other than the motor car. He must answer my question straightforwardly and must address his remarks to the disabled lobby, which has been making the case very powerfully. He must get the exemptions policy sorted out. In order to do that, I suspect that he will have to come up with so many exemptions for the poor, the disabled, essential workers and emergency vehicles that, he will do away with the purpose of the tax. The purpose of the tax is to stop people coming into London, but the very people that he will allow to come into London are those who need to do so least. By introducing a decent exemptions scheme, he will be allowing the congestion that he so hates to continue. The result will be rat running and the wrong people being refused admittance to cities. The proposals will achieve precisely the opposite of what the Minister wanted.
<P>
There is a second fundamental flaw in the Government's argument. Last week, I spoke to the Under-Secretary about it when he gave evidence to the Select Committee on Transport. It concerns the hypothecation of the income from the two taxes. A public relations con is being perpetrated: The Government are saying that they will raise taxes from motorists, but adding, ``Don't worry, motorists, it is all going to be okay because we will spend the taxation on improving public transport systems. You must all be pleased about that, so you will be quite happy to pay the taxes.''
<P>
There are a number of fundamental flaws in that attempted con. First, the Government are not saying to the motorist, ``We are going to produce public transport systems that you will use.'' Instead, they are telling the fat cat motorist, ``We are going to tax you £5. We shall then use that £5 to produce public transport systems that will get everybody else off the road.'' That is the curious thing about the British way of thinking about congestion. When we talk about improving public transport we do not mean, ``I'm going to give up my car and my wife is going to stop doing the school run or the trip to Sainsbury's.'' What we actually mean is, ``Let's have decent public transport systems that everybody else will so that I shall not face any congestion in town''. That is the reality behind the PR con which says, ``Do this and your public transport systems will be improved.''
<P>
It is a PR con because, almost by definition, the amount of money that is raised through the taxes will not be the amount of money that is required to provide the public transport system. The Under-Secretary admitted that under questioning last week before the Select Committee. No one knows what the income will be from hypothecated congestion charges, but it is extremely unlikely to be the exact amount of money required to put in a new transport system; it is almost certain to be much less.
<P>
Light rapid transit systems are extraordinarily expensive. The Select Committee is currently studying the subject, so I know that it costs an absolute fortune to put in a light rapid transit system of any kind. Unless the tax is gigantic, it is extremely unlikely that the sum raised will be anywhere near enough to install the light rapid transit system required. Therefore, additional money will still have to come from the Government or from other taxation. If the fuel duty escalator is continued this year, that money may again be capable of being used for particular light rapid transit systems.
<P>
However, to suggest that, because I live in Surbiton and I suddenly have to pay £5 a day to get into London, the piggy bank into which my £5 is put will produce a jolly good public transport system for Surbiton, is a total and utter PR con. There is no evidence of it at all. The amount raised from the £5 charged in Surbiton will not be nearly enough, so the Government or others will have to make value judgments as to whether the public transport system that is proposed for Surbiton is more beneficial than the one proposed for Brixton, or for elsewhere in London. The same argument obviously applies to other towns. There is no evidence of any direct linkage between the payment of the tax and the public transport system that it is alleged it will help to pay for. It is straightforward spin to say ``Don't worry chaps. Pay this tax because you will benefit from it.'' There is no evidence that that will be the case.
<P>
The people who pay a tax are often not the people who benefit. That certainly applies to the fuel duty escalator, where the rural motorist, by and large, pays the extra in petrol prices—£4 a gallon, as I saw in the newspapers yesterday. If that extra tax is used to improve public transport infrastructure, it is almost certainly spent in towns. There is no link between the payment of the tax and the beneficiaries of it; there is a dislocation between the taxpayer and the beneficiary.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) mentioned in passing that if a tax is to be hypothecated properly it must be additional. There is no way of knowing whether it will be additional, unless the Government now have a plan for what they will spend on transport over the next 10, 20, 50 or 100 years. Only if they have such a plan can they say, ``This bit is additional to that plan.'' Plainly, they do not have a plan: transport policy seems to run from year to year—or from day to day. Road systems are put in and are taken out of the Government's plans almost daily. We do not know what the baseline is, so it is impossible to work out what is ``additional''.
<P>
To say that the money is additional and will provide transport systems that would not otherwise be provided by the Government is a PR con. The Government are saying, ``We will give you something that you would not otherwise have'', but we do not know that, because the Government have not told us what they propose to do over the next five years. The principle of additionality sounds attractive in PR-spin terms, but it is wholly misleading in reality.
<P>
The important point about hypothecation—and where the transparency of the PR spin is clearly seen—is that it must be permanent. If the money is being raised from motorists for a particular purpose, it must be the purpose this year, next year, some time and for ever; it can be the only purpose of taxing motorists. I will explain why. If one can justify an extra tax on the grounds that it can be used for the direct benefit of the person who is paying it, as is the case here, it must be reasonable to say that when that person's grandchildren are still paying the tax in 100 years' time—no doubt greatly inflated—it will still benefit the motorist, not be used for another purpose.
<P>
The same argument was used by Lloyd George when he introduced vehicle excise duty. He said, ``Isn't it disgraceful that Britain's roads are falling to pieces? It's an absolute scandal. We must find a way to repair and replace Britain's roads. I am going to tax the motorist by bringing in vehicle excise duty: it will be an annual tax and all the money will be ring-fenced; it will be hypothecated.''—although I doubt that Lloyd George knew the word—``We will keep the money and use it exclusively for the improvement of Britain's roads.'' Lloyd George said that in 19-whatever, but what happened to the money? The Government now use 93 per cent. of it for other purposes; only 7 per cent. is used for roads.
<P>
Hypothecation can be justified only if it is permanent. The Greater London Act 1999 has shown that it is not. If the hon. Member for Brent, East—or, I hope, Mr. Norris—becomes mayor of London, he will, after 10 years, be able to use the money, not for transport, but for whatever purpose he chooses.

<P>

<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that if the hypothecated tax is used for a capital project rather than for recurrent expenditure, one of its great advantages is that it can be terminated?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> That argument would be correct if a transport problem needed only a certain amount of money spent on it and thereafter transport was fine for all time. However, the history of transport over the past 200 years, shows that that is not the case. Fifty years from now, the problem will not be road traffic congestion, but too many hovercraft on the river, or who knows what. It is reasonable to predict that, whatever history brings, transport problems will remain for all time. Therefore the taxation raised from transport users should be used for the improvement of transport. The hon. Gentleman's point is reasonable only if the transport problem can be dealt with and then left alone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman envisage an example—a new bus station, bridge or roundabout—where that might be the case? Does he accept that the Bill provides for that eventuality?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Gentleman cites a new bus station, like the one in my home town. The local authority is considering a £17 million improvement to its transport infrastructure—an interchange between buses and rail. I doubt that it will happen, but the good old Liberal Democrat-controlled council is proposing one. It is a fine scheme, comprising a multistorey car park and through ticketing for Chippenham, a town of 25,000 people; it would cost £17 million and be a useful amenity. Let us put up the gantries round Chippenham and raise what we can from congestion charges. If the hon. Gentleman thinks we should raise £17 million from my constituents in Chippenham to try to provide what should be provided anyway, I have to tell him that my constituents will not accept the wisdom of doing it. The only way that £17 million could be raised in Chippenham would be if the Government decided through local transport plan allocations to give that money to the local authority to spend it on something that was demonstrably useful. To suggest to the good people of Chippenham that paying £10 to get into the town to pay for a new bus station is acceptable is absurd.
<P>
The notion of hypothecation has been waved about by the Government since the election and, prior to that, by Liberal Democrats, who spoke of an extra 1p on income tax to cover more or less all their spending pledges for the next 100 years. Hypothecation is not reality, but a spin, a con trick. The Treasury has long accepted that it is a con trick and is wholeheartedly opposed to hypothecation for that reason. There is no linkage between the amount of money raised and what has to be spent.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
That brings me to a fundamental flaw in the concept of congestion charging and hypothecation of the income from it. I referred briefly to the flaw a moment ago. Everyone starts from the presumption that congestion is a bad thing and everyone agrees that it is. It is easy for the Confederation of British Industry to calculate that it costs the nation £X billion a year. No one likes congestion, including those of us who are late for Committee sittings because we have been sitting in Parliament square, and are ticked off by our Whip. There is a political advantage in saying to people, ``You all hate congestion and we're going to do something about it.'' However, people are not saying, ``We all hate congestion and I'm going to contribute to solving the problem by giving up my car''. When they say they hate congestion, they mean, ``I hate congestion because I can't use my car as I would like to.''
<P>
Let us suppose that that fundamental flaw did not exist and that congestion and workplace charging worked. I do not think that they will, but let us take the Government at face value and assume that the charges are not merely a cheap revenue-raising measure. Let us imagine for a second that people's life, habits and mode of transport are changed, thanks to the introduction of the new taxes. We now have a lovely clear Parliament square; London is clear of traffic, or it is moving smoothly through. People are moving at great speed. I was in Adelaide a couple of weeks ago with the Transport Committee. In Adelaide, the average speed of traffic through the city is 55 mph. Perhaps we can achieve that in London. By bringing in a really swingeing tax we can stop all those horrible people coming in and clear the London streets. What happens then?
<P>
I get up in the morning in Chippenham and think to myself, ``Shall I go to London by train, for which the office cost allowance people will pay my fare, or shall I get into my motor car and raise 50p a mile—or thereabouts—by driving the 103 miles to London?'' At present, I say, ``Good heavens, no!'', because driving will take me four hours. There is no possibility that I shall contemplate driving to London. I always drive to Chippenham station, park there, get on the train and Her Majesty's Government kindly pays my first-class fare, as members of the Committee know. Presumably the same thinking applies to all the business users and others with whom I travel on the train from Chippenham to Paddington on Monday mornings.
<P>
However, the moment we get rid of the congestion in London, people will say, ``I'm going to get up in the morning, get into my own private, warm space, turn on my radio and drive from my front door to exactly where I'm going. The cost doesn't matter, because I'm a well-paid, middle-ranking or senior executive. I don't care what it costs, the convenience is fantastic. Thank goodness that jolly old Government got rid of all that frightful congestion in London.'' In other words, the reduction of congestion in London will become a self-defeating prophecy: it will achieve exactly the opposite of what the Government want to do, because they will be inviting people on to the roads.
<P>
I would counter-argue that congestion carries the advantage that it gets people who do not need to use their cars off the roads. It is only because I know that London is congested that I do not use my car, but go by train. The moment that London is clear of congestion, I shall use my car.
<P>
It is the same public relations spin, so typical of the new Labour Government. They say, ``We understand, Mr. Rich, that you hate congestion. We are going to clear congestion off the roads by bringing in awful taxes. You probably won't mind, because you're middle England. We new Labour people want to get in with the middle England lot nowadays. We're not worried about the working man, disabled people or the low-waged we're more worried about middle England. You, Mr. Middle England, Mr. Mondeo man, want to drive swiftly through London, so we're going to bring in a tax at a level where you can just afford to pay it. You won't mind terribly because it means that you can drive your car easily. So, please vote for us, Mr. Mondeo man, because we are going to take all that money. It's not tax money—we're not giving it to Gordon Brown, the Chancellor, and the Treasury. We're not going to spend it on schools or hospitals. Oh no, we're going to spend it on transport infrastructure—and won't that be good, because it gets everybody else off the road! Isn't that a fantastic thing to do?''
<P>
As the Singapore experience shows, the notion of congestion and workplace charging is, both philosophically and practically, fundamentally flawed. It has been introduced by the Government, not because it will make road or public transport better—but because they believe that there are PR advantages in doing so. You have been gracious, Mr. Gale, in allowing us a sort of Second Reading consideration of the matter. All the amendments that we tabled or tried to table, but which have not been allowed for technical reasons, were designed to highlight the fundamental philosophical and practical flaws in both workplace and congestion charging.
<P>
I hope that, rather than continuing their recent easy spin, the Government will listen carefully to some of the arguments put by my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex and I and will consider fundamentally amending the legislation to take account of the needs and interests of the motorist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> A few comments, Mr. Gale, partly in response to the hon. Member for North Essex and the hon. Member for North Wiltshire. The former said that the Conservatives were in favour of congestion charging in their Green Paper but that it was only within the context of lower fuel duties. That is a somewhat illiterate analysis of the need for congestion charging, which is to target congestion rather than being a flat rate. For the record, first, the Conservatives proposed congestion charging and, secondly, they introduced the fuel duty escalator. The only difference between the two parties is that we have decided to hypothecate the revenue from the additional increases in fuel duty to public transport.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): Is the hon. Gentleman aware that when the escalator was introduced only two other countries had cheaper fuel duties than the UK—Luxembourg and Spain? The cost of fuel here is now more than twice the average in western Europe.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That is rubbish. The major increase in fuel duties was under the Conservative Administration.
<P>
I will make only a few points as others want to speak. The basic rationale behind congestion charging is that the fixed cost of the motorist's car is high in relation to the marginal costs of its usage, although it has gone up with fuel cost. The external cost of people using their cars which, incidentally, the European Union reckons is about £50 billion when health, environmental, business and congestion costs are added in, is more than the total cost of taxation for the motorist. We want, therefore, to tax the usage rather than the ownership of cars. That is already happening through the fuel duty escalator. The difficulty is that that penalises rural motorists to tackle urban congestion. That is why congestion charging is a good thing. Perhaps the hon. Member for North Wiltshire did not quite understand—and, from his expression, he still does not understand—the logic. The whole point about congestion charging is that demand is brought into line with restricted supply: usage is rationed according to the economic value. At the same time, better and cheaper public transport is provided so that people have a choice. Ultimately, the choice will be to queue, pay or use public transport. That will ease congestion and will provide finance for public transport that in this case will be front loaded so that people would see it in advance.
<P>
Contrary to what the hon. Member for North Wiltshire suggested, that system also provides a progressive scheme. The reality is that the main consumers of public transport are the old, the young and the less well off. These are also the people who tend not to have cars. Clearly, therefore, if we are putting the money into public transport, it will be progressive. The contrast between what the hon. Gentleman called the plebs and the people from Goldman Sachs is outrageous, both in its analysis and its impressions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire has been misrepresented. He did not—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is not a point of order from the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I will give way to the hon. Member for North Wiltshire, who mentioned plebs, the Irish, the Chinese, and so on. Perhaps he will explain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Gentleman is attempting a classic new Labour slur. I referred to the Chinese. He may not have been to Singapore, but he should realise that the Chinese live there and that is why I referred to them. I have already explained my reference to Irish thinking.
<P>
I was not suggesting that those people really were plebs. On the contrary, they are people of whom I think highly. I was referring to what new Labour are up to, which is allowing the Goldman Sachs man in, while keeping out those whom such a man—or new Labour—might describe as the plebs. I used the word plebs advisedly to demonstrate the distinction between the two groups.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am beginning to understand. Plebs are people who cannot afford to pay road prices and the Chinese are mean people. Incidentally, people live in Singapore who are other than Chinese—Indians and various other cultural mixes—as the hon. Gentleman should know from having been there. The Irish, apparently, cannot think properly. The reference to the Irish was that the use of the counterfactual argument, which is a well-known argument in logic—that is, it would have been great had we not done something—is not Irish at all. It is a sensible argument made by Singaporean Ministers. Clearly, if every action taken only holds down the rate of growth, it does not follow that if one did nothing, nothing would have happened. That suggestion is farcical.
<P>
Like the hon. Member for North Wiltshire, I have visited Singapore, spoken to the Transport Minister, looked at the transport authorities, seen their models and seen the whole system in action. The suggestion that there is lots of rat running, that the Chinese are mean and therefore they pay this lower price and that the models cannot be trusted is ridiculous. Twelve per cent. of Singapore is roads and these roads are kept relatively free. Modern technology is used for road pricing. Smartcards, video surveillance, satellite tracking and other systems will be in place in some of the new schemes that are emerging in Amsterdam, Oslo and elsewhere. We have seen these things work. The reality is that what we hear from the Opposition is just ignorant opportunism without any attempt to grasp the nettle and sort out this problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Yes, but I hope that this intervention will be better than the last.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The hon. Gentleman speaks with great authority on Singapore. I had lunch with the Singapore ambassador to discuss road pricing. In total contradiction to what the hon. Gentleman just said, he agreed with me that the road scheme in Singapore had driven traffic from the main expressways into the surrounding areas where there was now congestion. The scheme would have to be extended to push the traffic further and further away, which is exactly the opposite of what the hon. Gentleman said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the Singapore regime would want to abolish road pricing? Or is it simply that they would extend it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> No, my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire stated that one effect of the regime in Singapore was to push the congestion to different areas. The professor of economics who is now high commissioner for Singapore in London agreed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That says it all. The situation in Singapore is that they know that they can adjust their sophisticated scheme for time, place and vehicle. They can reduce congestion in certain areas at certain times. Clearly, they will want to extend that scheme to the whole island to avoid displacement problems. That is why we will no doubt have citywide schemes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> No, not again. There is no thought in Singapore of rolling back the scheme—instead, they will proceed with it. The selective picking of certain comments of the ambassador is outrageous because the Singapore authorities are wholeheartedly behind the schemes. They are in the front line and extending them. The technology is available to avoid rat running and will be used.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Wiltshire said that the provision will be bad for people with disabilities. We will be going out to consultation. There will be opportunities for local authorities to make exemption, which could include the disabled. The Secretary of State also has the power to make exemptions across the country, which might be considered for emergency services and so on. This is all open to consultation: we are talking about the best fit.
<P>
The reality is that we are hearing from those on the Opposition Benches an oppositionist, opportunist's view—they have this idea of having more roads, more speed and more congestion. We have heard it all before. It is not a sustainable way forward and we would end up with crisis management, as has happened in Paris. One can take a car into that city only on every odd day because cocktails of pollution have reached lethal levels. Those pollutants are endemic in Paris because this sort of action was not taken. Other major European cities are taking such action. Eighty per cent. of people in Europe live in a city. They are sick and tired of poor air quality, urban congestion, ugliness, wasted time and filth and they are taking radical action.
<P>
If we want to be in the lead in Europe, which we are, with Labour, we will consider radical solutions that meet local needs, in consultation with local business and local people to meet our overall objective of a 20 per cent. reduction in emissions—a target that the Opposition could never dream of satisfying. We will deliver and we will take the tough choices in partnership with local communities and with local business.
<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): Until the contribution from the hon. Member for Croydon, Central this had been a relatively good-natured debate. Of course, there are major differences between the two sides, but I thought that we could at least conduct the debate in a civilised way. It does not help when people describe our properly held views as ignorant opportunism. On the Irish issue, I have been married to an Irish passport holder for many years and she would have been quite happy with that particular expression, but enough of that!
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, Central is wrong on this issue. He said that the Government want to tax car usage rather than ownership. That is precisely what happens in this country because one now pays nearly £4 a gallon for fuel. We have that system already due to the huge cost of fuel. That is the tax on usage. Congestion charging is a further tax on usage. My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire spoke with great expertise as a member of the Transport Sub-Committee. It is a Committee for which I might volunteer since its members seem to travel the world: very suitable for a transport Committee and the work seems interesting.

I too have visited Singapore—as everyone else in the Committee seems to have done. Your time will come too, Mr. Gale, if you join the Transport Sub-Committee. I visited Singapore to look not at transport but at other things. I was told by my taxi driver as we sat in a traffic jam around the central area that one result of congestion charging was that it was vastly more difficult to drive around the edge of the city. It took us half an hour to go about a mile, so I could see some of the problems. My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire also pointed out that congestion charging is regressive taxation. If that is so, then all Governments have introduced regressive taxes. All Governments, however, are very aware of the dangers of such taxation. Fuel duties and congestion charges are precisely such a tax because they are paid by everyone regardless of whether they are millionaires or ordinary folk. Such taxation bears down much harder on ordinary people than on the rich.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman shakes his head. My argument is manifestly true—£4 a gallon for petrol is a vastly more significant amount to someone on a low income than it is to a wealthy city investment banker for whom £4 is nothing. Congestion charging is regressive taxation and all Governments should be aware of the effect of such taxation.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire, among others, described the fact that congestion charges do not work. The Liberal Democrats are keen on congestion charging I know, but the expression ``poodles'' came to mind when listening to their contribution. In the interest of harmony, however, I will not pursue that. The answer is that congestion charges do not work. We know that—we have seen it. The only way to make congestion charges work would be to put them up to an enormous and unsustainable amount. People's love of the motor car and their desire to travel in their own private space and not meet the hordes going to work, are so strong that they are prepared to pay hugely for it.
<P>
Los Angeles has a scheme whereby cars with multiple occupants use special lanes that are much emptier than the normal highway. Ingenious Los Angeles citizens can buy expensive replica human beings to put in their cars. The authorities got wise and decided to catch those people out with the use of a heat sensor, since the imitation human beings are obviously cold. The heat sensor worked, so what did people do? They devised an artificial human being that could be plugged into the cigar lighter and heated up. Silly as this may sound, Mr. Gale, that shows how much people are prepared to pay to be able to use their cars. Congestion charging will not work: that is its essential flaw.
<P>
Central London is one area of the United Kingdom where car use has fallen. Anyone who has lived in central London knows that it is easier to travel around Westminster than it has been for a long time. The reason is that car ownership in Westminster and central London has fallen.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Before my hon. Friend moves on from California, which I used to visit frequently, car-pool lanes there have another interesting feature. People who would normally go on public transport formed queues at the gas stations and jumped in free available seats for the one commuter driving his car, which deprived public transport of customers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> That is interesting. On my infrequent visits to Los Angeles, I do not think that I have ever seen a bus. No doubt they are there, but that is an important point. To return more parochially to Westminster. Traffic has fallen in Westminster for two reasons. One is the cost of car parking and the other is the unavailability of garage spaces. The meters in Westminster are probably the most expensive in the United Kingdom, so people have stopped using their cars to come into the city centre.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that when parking meters were introduced, the arguments that he is using now were used against them? Has he not proved that parking meters work?
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> Parking meters work not simply on the grounds of cost—although they are expensive. The problem with parking meters for long-stay motorists—the commuter motorist—is that one can stay for only two hours. That is why parking meters work—it is not the actual charge. That shows that other methods can be used to restrict traffic in city centres.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> The hon. Gentleman's argument is interesting and I realise that price is not the pure determinant of supply and demand of parking spaces and meters. He must recognise, however, that the revenue raised from parking meters contributes towards the overall solution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> Whether it contributes to the overall solution I know not; it certainly contributes to extra funds for Westminster city council as I understand it, but I have no idea how much it puts in. I take the point that meters certainly raise money. If that is the case, then the hon. Gentleman should be honest and say that congestion charging is what we say it is—a stealth tax. It is not going to reduce congestion, it is simply another way of extracting some more money out of motorists. As anyone who has been in local government, as I have, knows we have been there before: we have done it before. We know what happens when these situations arise—our grants are cut and local authority grants are cut. My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex pointed out that the transport grant has been cut. The Treasury say to local government that it is trimming their budgets or holding their budgets, and so on. That happens every year with every Government. If one whines to the Minister that one has been treated badly, one is told, ``Have you considered introducing congestion charges?'' That is how it happens. Eventually, local government is forced to introduce these congestion charges whether it likes it or not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the intervention by the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas) gave an interesting glimpse into the reality of new Labour thinking? He said that the revenue raised from parking meters here in Westminster was particularly helpful because it went into the coffers. He ignored the fact that there was no pretence at hypothecation or suggestion that the money will be used for transport, and that it will be used to keep council taxes down, run the road sweepers or whatever else. This is about raising money and that intervention makes plain what lies behind it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I agree. That is the reason for this provision—it is another new Labour stealth tax. Earlier, my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex said that Labour wanted to reduce the number of licences. I could not help but hear the hon. Member for Croydon, Central say from a sedentary position ``A good idea.''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Westminster is spending an inordinate amount on new environmental and highway schemes, which is taken from the funds that it gets from car parking, partly from public pressure for hypothecation—which, of course, is Labour's policy. The point about Singapore is that it is a small island and that physically limits car numbers. A fixed number of cars has to be allowed and people bid for the licence. That works there and so I said ``Good.''. It is not something that we would want here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I remind the hon. Gentleman that we were talking about Singapore. The intervention was before that. I agree with him. Singapore has some lessons, but it is not the best example for us because it is unique. It is a low-tax economy and that is different from our high-tax economy, particularly for the motorist here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for giving way and I congratulate him on a thoughtful speech that will help the Committee. In the light of what he said about Westminster, he appears to welcome the reduction in congestion. He acknowledged that that has come about through specific measures such as two-hour parking charges. His hon. Friends have suggested that the solution to congestion is the laissez-faire attitude that, once the roads become too snarled up, people will not come. He, on the other hand, acknowledges the benefit of taking measures to reduce congestion, although he says that charging is not appropriate. Will he confirm that he accepts the need for measures that are, in a sense, punitive on motorists as a way of solving the problem?
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> Yes. I am not suggesting that one can sit back and do absolutely nothing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> But they are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> No, my hon. Friends are not saying that at all. It is true that as congestion begins to rise, people stop using their cars. The point about Westminster is that this was an idea that worked because people have difficulty parking long term at meters and that has helped to free up the city. It has also helped those who want to shop or visit to come in their cars. It is beneficial and I would have no hesitation introducing systems that reduce traffic congestion if I could dream them up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Ah, stealth tax is the word.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> Stealth taxes are not the way and neither are congestion charges.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> The hon. Gentleman is a fascinating exponent of a modern free market economy. He seems to be saying that price is not a determinant of supply and demand. If he is abandoning that philosophy, where does he stand on any issue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I am not abandoning it. I have apparently not made it clear that if one sets congestion charging high enough, at some stage the number of vehicles coming into town will begin to fall. I understand and accept that. However, our argument is that that figure will have to be huge before people will be turned away.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex said that in Leicester £8 a day would be required for a reduction in traffic even to begin. To pursue my earlier argument, so that the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth understands, £8 is an affordable amount for a businessman or someone on company expenses, but it is not affordable to the person who drives into the city centre to work in a coffee bar or as a painter and decorator; for such people, it is very unaffordable. The market cracks at its bottom level so, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire pointed out, poorer members of society will be priced out and richer members will be allowed to have clear roads. I agree that that is not the object of the Bill, but that would be the perverse effect I will give way to the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth if he wants to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> He has been told to pipe down.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> Yes, the Whip is clearly becoming concerned about the length of the debate.
<P>
On a slightly more parochial note, the city of Newcastle upon Tyne is near my constituency. The council, which is Labour controlled, has said quite firmly that it does not want to introduce congestion charges, which is perfectly sensible in Newcastle's case. Although the conurbation of Tyneside contains about two and a bit million people, a large number of people who work in the city live in the wide rural areas that surround it and can only get to work by car. It is not practical to run a public transport system to remote rural areas in a way that would benefit people who commute daily. The council has said that it is positively against congestion charging.
<P>
Two things will flow from that decision. Newcastle will suffer on the transport grant as a consequence because of the way in which it is to be structured. The local passenger transport authority will not be able to invest money in the public transport infrastructure of the conurbation because it will not receive any revenue from the congestion charging tax. I shall be grateful if the Minister can assure me that its transport grant will not be cut as a consequence of that decision.
<P>
Furthermore, if Newcastle is forced into introducing a congestion charge, as some country towns no doubt will be because the Treasury will slowly erode other parts of their grant, perversely, rural drivers—often the least well off—who have to drive into the city to find work will be paying for the improvements to the public transport system. Some of them are already suffering from the high cost of petrol. I also believe that to be unfair.
<P>
The scheme also allows congestion charging to be imposed in areas of high tourist pressure at certain times of year. We have heard about the Lake district, Dartmoor and one or two villages in small areas in the south-west of England. Will the Minister explain how scheme that will work? Interestingly, people who go on a holiday or a day trip to the Lake district will withstand a very high congestion charge and people who go for the weekend will probably pay a £10 charge quite willingly. The local authorities in the Lake district will reap a huge amount of revenue in the short tourist season and I shall be fascinated to know what they will do with the money. There will be a limit to the amount of public transport required in a remote rural area such as the Lake district. Those authorities will find themselves the beneficiaries of a substantial income. It will be substantial because, force majeure, to reduce the number of cars in the Lake district a high congestion charge will have to be levied. A marvellous fund of riches will descend on those authorities and I am curious to know who will receive the moneys—the district council, the national park authority, or the county councils? Which authorities will benefit from such great largesse from what, in their case, is the bonus of the congestion tax?

<P>

<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> We have heard a good deal about transport and Select Committee trips. I have the honour to sit on three Select Committees. I could be in Washington, Dublin or Geneva, but I am with you in Committee Room 14, Mr. Gale.
<P>
This is a most important issue which the Government have misunderstood. I drove down from Shropshire this morning. It is clear that the way we distribute our road assets is Stalinist. One cannot escape the market. The market on our roads at the moment works by rationing in the form of a queue. We have a chronic lack of capacity in certain areas, as can be seen from the sums levied from motorists and the sums spent on our roads.
<P>
The AA considers ours to be the most heavily taxed motorists in western Europe. Since Labour entered government, the tax on the motorist for the average car has risen by £900. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) said, in some areas we have now exceeded the £4 gallon. The British Road Federation calculates that 80 per cent. of the £32 billion levied from vehicle users is used for other purposes. Contrast that with the States, where according to 1996 figures—the most recent I could obtain—total revenue from taxation is £50.66 billion and £49.3 billion is spent on the roads. That is the basic flaw in the Government's proposal. It is inconceivable to impose extra charges on motorists for the marginal cost of going into a congested area without making a significant commensurate reduction in other charges.
<P>
I spent some time working with the haulage industry in this country and I refute in the most blunt, black-and-white terms the crude statement made by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central about fuel duty. A fuel duty escalator was introduced at 3 per cent. at a time when only Luxembourg and Spain had lower fuel prices than this country. That is a fact, which Will be confirmed by the House of Commons Library if the hon. Gentleman cares to find out for himself. We now have fuel duties well over twice the average level in western Europe, and our haulage industry is in crisis.
<P>
On top of that, we have the most astonishing level of vehicle excise duty: £5,750 for a 40-tonne truck, compared with £486 in France, £328 in Spain or £308 in Portugal. Whenever those duties are discussed, the Government say that there are other beneficial tax regimes left behind by the last Government in respect of national insurance, pensions, health costs, and so on. However, I have been talking to a major haulier who I regret to say is in serious trouble after three years of Labour Government, who runs trucks in Luxembourg and the United Kingdom. His saving last year on 90 trucks would have been £1.811 million on fuel duty vehicle excise duty alone if all his trucks ran in Luxembourg; whereas, if he made a profit of £400,000 on a duty turnover of £10 million, his saving on pensions, national insurance and corporation tax, would be only £78,000. He is therefore £1.7 million worse off on fixed costs that he cannot avoid: he cannot avoid paying fuel and VED in this country. The money raised in that way is not spent on the roads, and that is the fundamental flaw in the measure. These charges are simply a massive extra tax for the marginal cost of a journey in a congested area.
<P>
It is regrettable that the hon. Member for Croydon, Central became excited about Singapore. He misunderstood what I said about the High Commissioner for Singapore, who is a professor of economics, Professor Pang Eng Fong. The lesson from Singapore is that extraordinarily high costs have been placed on ownership of a vehicle and the Singapore people are completely undeterred. The costs of owning a car are extraordinary. They are four and a half times the cost of owning a car in this country. There is the cost of owning a permit, which lasts only 10 years, to run the thing, as well as very high fuel costs.
<P>
The effect of the scheme, as Professor Pang outlined it, was successful in the main area. In the central area and on the expressway, its intention was to ensure average speeds of 34 to 40 miles an hour and that has been delivered. However, he agreed that, although the planned flow was achieved on the expressway, there was congestion in the neighbouring side streets where there were no gantries, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire explained. He said that they would be forced to extend the scheme to more areas as a result. Singapore is a small island: 10 per cent. of the land is taken by roads. The lesson is that the urge to own a care and to enjoy the freedom that it brings is very strong. Despite the most savage fiscal measures and straightforward rationing of car ownership, the Singapore authority have not been able to stop people wanting to own cars. That will continue to be the case in urban areas in this country as well.
<P>
I am concerned about the rural areas. In North Shropshire, as I may have told the Committee before, 67 per cent. of people drive to work in a car. If they drive into one of the surrounding towns, say, Wrexham, Newcastle-under-Lyme or Telford, the money levied by that local authority will be spent on public transport in that area; It will not benefit my constituents in the country areas, As my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham said, the last asset that my constituents can afford to lose is their car, because that is their means of getting to work; if they lose it they might lose their job. The measure is yet another burden upon them. There is a case for charging access to roads at a marginal cost, but that would mean dramatic refiguring of all fuel levies and vehicle excise duty. As it stands, the proposal is simply an extra burden that will affect my poorest constituents. It will also prove to be a clever wheeze to pinch local authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I have listened with great interest to the hon. Gentleman. He is right to be concerned about rural areas, but he has told the Committee that he believes it might be possible through the reconfiguration to which he referred—of excise duty and so on—to introduce appropriate measures. Will he describe to the Committee how that would work? That would be interesting because he is not ruling out such schemes, but criticising the way in which they are configured.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> There are examples: take San Diego on the I15. Between 6 am and 10 am and for five hours in the afternoon, there is a charge for access to the main freeway. The charge is flexible and varies between 50 cents and $8. It has worked and the main effect has been to spread the rush hour over a long period. However, that is acceptable because there are low taxes on car ownership. What I find unacceptable is that the Government intend to continue the outrageous confiscation of £32 billion from road users and stick an extra charge on top.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> Before my hon. Friend leaves the interstate at San Diego, one of the points about that road is that if one does not want to pay the charge, one can travel on the ordinary roads—one has a choice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Yes; that is also the case in Singapore, where one can choose to take congested back road. What is sinister is that, as in virtually every debate we have had, we find the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions scuttling out to the Treasury with its tail between its legs, having suffered yet another defeat.
<P>
The measure is another way of shunting taxation on to local authorities. I do not believe that the Government will maintain their current funding to local authorities. That is confirmed by my nearest Labour authority. In Telford recently, there was a meeting of the inward investment partnership, which debated whether to have a parking tax, as is proposed later in the Bill, or a congestion charge. It is interesting that the area will have one or the other: it cannot get away with saying neither. They said no to the parking charge for up to seven years. They also say that they do not need to impose a congestion charge, because there is little congestion. The telling quote is from Mr. Emmerson, of the council's highway and transport section, who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We would only adopt the idea if it was taken up on a regional basis at least or preferably on a national basis. Otherwise it could have a major negative effect on the economy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Businesses at the IIP meeting recognised the difficult position the council was in. Telford was in danger of losing Government transport subsidies if it failed to take the latest proposals on board.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
To sum up, I believe that this measure will do great damage. The most intelligent approach is to use the concept of marginal pricing of road access, to ration access to them and to encourage investment in key pinch areas. In reality the measure is a hidden way for the Treasury to scuttle away from grants to local government and to levy charges on the benighted motorist who comes from outside a local authority's area, who will have to pay that local authority.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should explain to the Committee that the Minister for Housing and Planning informed me at the beginning of the morning's proceedings that he would have to leave at about this time. He has courteously indicated to me and to Opposition Front Benchers that the Under-Secretary will respond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> That was typically courteous of my hon. Friend the Minister, and I am delighted to respond.
<P>
We have had a long and interesting debate, with a large number of contributions. I single out that of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central, who made an authoritative contribution. He has clearly devoted considerable attention and time to the issue; I know that he has published on the subject. His contribution raised the quality of the debate and was a genuine source of information in our discussions.
<P>
I shall endeavour to cover the many points raised by the hon. Member for North Essex, who mentioned several specific issues and attempted to launch a more general broadside against the Government's proposals on congestion charging. We had a report from him on the costs of administering such a charge. In Singapore and Oslo, which are the closest examples to us of urban road charging, both of which I too have visited, the evidence is that they have a perfectly efficient method of collecting those taxes. In my discussions with the relevant authorities in Singapore and Oslo, and in wider discussions about these matters, the issue of the high burden of administrative costs in the system has never arisen. In fact we can expect a diminution in costs when the technology improves; it promises to do so at an almost exponential rate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I will give way, even though I have much to say and I do not want to stretch the patience of the Committee by taking up an excessive amount of time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> We look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say. At this early stage in his lengthy oration, will he acknowledge that he has just described congestion charges as taxation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Yes, I did, and I do not apologise. If the hon. Gentleman wants to make something of that, he is at liberty to do so. It is a form of charging and I did use that expression. I can hardly resile from the phrase, since it is now on the record.
<P>
The hon. Members for North Essex and for Bath talked about the case for early evidence. The Government accepts the importance of that and I have frequently cited the experience of Oslo. Interestingly, before the introduction of the tolling system in that city, a lengthy road tunnel was built. The psychology is clear: the motorists who pay the toll charges could already see the evidence of their contributions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me complete this thought before I give way to the hon. Gentleman. The proposal for and acknowledgement of the need for early evidence is not denied. It will be a matter for discussion by the charging development partnership that has been established between the Government and the 25 local authorities that have expressed an interest in some form of congestion charging.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> May I too apologise for the fact that I, like the Minister for Housing and Planning, had to escape from the Committee's clutches? I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his reply on behalf of his hon. Friend. With regard to the tolling regime in Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim, the Government of Norway make no pretence that it is anything but a revenue-raising measure. It is not designed to reduce congestion, but to fund specific capital projects Will the Minister make it clear that that is not what is proposed in the Bill? The Government's proposals are taxes to try to reduce congestion. What is particularly damaging is that there is no requirement for any specificity about the allocation of revenues to particular projects. In addition, fuel duties are considerably higher in this country than in others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall come to the subject of fuel duty shortly. In both Oslo and Trondheim, the measures that have been introduced to the road systems are designed to reduce congestion and enable the smooth flow of traffic. It is true that the tolling regime provides revenues to pay for capital projects, but the objectives of the road charging system in Norway are the same as those of the British Government, namely, to reduce congestion and to provide significant new revenues for imaginative, innovative and radical improvements in local transport.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> That is right, but the Norwegians built a new road involving expensive civil engineering under a city—that was a road improvement scheme. We have no objection to tolls such as those that fund the Forth bridge or the Dartford tunnel and bridge, What is proposed in the Bill will not raise money to improve the road structure; it will simply be a tax on congestion. That is quite different.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> On the contrary. I mean to come shortly to what the loyal Opposition have intended at least with regard to congestion charging. I was going to refer to the remarks made by the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) to the point that there is nothing in the proposals to prevent investment in local roads and other forms of local transport improvement. Nothing in these measures will prevent packages at the local level involving improvements to public transport or to road, if that is what a local authority deems to be necessary. I assure the hon. Member for Hexham, who is looking through the Bill, that he will find nothing in it or in any of the declarations made by the Government on the subject to preclude that sort of possibility. I gather that the hon. Member for Salop North wishes to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The Minister should use not the word ``Salop'', but Shropshire. He will get himself into one of the deepest ancestral rows in Shropshire if he talks about Salop. He has missed the point. I have also been to Bergen and Oslo and everyone there is clear that theirs is a straightforward taxation regime to raise money for major infrastructure projects and, as my hon. Friends have said, other taxes are much lower. Shropshire has a backlog of road repairs that will cost £100 million and the car users in my constituency will get no benefit from this tax because other local authorities will levy it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I will shortly come to the benefits that will be derived by motorists living outside the immediate localities in which charging regimes are introduced. In a nutshell, the argument is that when drivers from the rural areas of Shropshire drive into adjacent towns, they will benefit from improved traffic speeds as a result of the reduction of congestion. On the roads in those urban areas they will benefit from an improved environment and from the public transport improvements that will accrue from charging systems should they choose to park their cars and use them.
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman will delve into the Bill more deeply—we shall be discussing this at a later stage—he will find that it provides for charging authorities to invest in the improvement of transport services outside the locality in which the regime applies. Motorists from areas where there are no charging regimes will benefit in a variety of ways in locations where there are such regimes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> No, because I need to make progress, if the hon. Gentleman will forgive me. I intend to come to his arguments in due course. I am mortified to discover that my favourite, the hon. Member for North Essex has departed from the Committee—not for the first time. I wanted to respond to his attempted broadside against the Government on various aspects of our transport policy. We heard the usual attack on petrol taxes from him and his colleagues have raised the same matter. I hesitate to mention the obvious fact that the fuel duty escalator was introduced by his right hon. and learned Friend, the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), then the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I also hesitate, because it is rather cruel, to point out that during that period of Conservative rule, the fuel tax increased from 7p to 42p a litre. This is a concerned and caring Government and we take these attacks on fuel taxation from the Opposition slightly hard.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In a spirit of courtesy and kindness I also hesitate to revert to the Conservative past on the subject of the Official Opposition's attitude towards congestion charging. However, I find it irresistible and I feel bound to quote from a document entitled ``Transport: The Way Forward'', the Government's response to the transport debate, published by that excellent man, the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young), when he was Secretary of State for Transport in 1996. This is what the then Conservative Government had to say about urban road pricing, under the title ``Actions for the Future''.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Local authorities clearly have a lot to do.<P>

<P>
No one can quarrel with that—it is one of the great truisms of our time. The document continues;

—one of the great clichés of our time—

But in their document, ``Local Government on the Move: a New Agenda for Local Transport'', produced as a response to the transport debate, the Local Authority Associations called for an extension of local authority powers to implement restraint policies. Specifically, they are seeking powers to implement congestion charging . . . and to restrict or tax the use of private non-residential parking.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government believes that the most appropriate package of measures for a particular area is something best determined at local level, by locally accountable politicians. It follows that, in principle, if a local authority considers that an effective traffic management strategy for its area requires more restrictive measures than it is currently empowered to implement and it is satisfied that such steps would not have an unduly harmful effect on local economic and social vitality, then it should be enabled to take that action.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
QED, and the charge of political opportunism is absolutely beyond doubt. The Conservatives were the Government who launched any number of studies into congestion charging.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): As the hon. Gentleman will know, there is a difference between having a study and implementing a charge. I have the feeling that had that charge been implemented we would have lost even more seats in 1997.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Precisely. Political cowardice prevented the Conservative Government from implementing the measure. I remind the Opposition that a former Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. MacGregor) made an interesting observation on Second Reading on 20 December on the subject of motorway tolling—a subject to which we shall come shortly. This was a Secretary of State in the previous Government who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I take a different view about motorway tolling, for which I remain a strong advocate. As I pointed out in the Queen's Speech debate, I had obtained agreement from the Treasury for the hypothecation of motorway tolling, as was made clear in the consultation document that we published. The then Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed to that. Therefore, motorway tolling is not a new concept. It is a sensible way of getting extra resources into transport . . .''—[Official Report, 20 December 1999; Vol. 341, c.573]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was the commitment of the former Secretary of State. We have heard what his successor had to say—entirely positively—about congestion charging in urban areas. Why did the Conservatives revoke these various commitments? The answer is, sheer, political opportunism of exactly the sort that we have heard this morning from Opposition spokesmen.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I may have been one of the guilty men because at the time I was the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State, but the Under-Secretary is wrong. We were responding in our normal courteous way to the blandishments of the local authority associations, which were then, of course, Labour controlled. A number of Labour authorities wished to introduce forms of congestion charging and we took the view that it was worth examining, although we had reservations, which I think you will find were also spelled out in the paper. One was the methodology of collecting the tolls efficiently; the other was that charging might not reduce congestion. We were prepared to study the proposal and we did so. We now oppose it on the grounds that such schemes simply do not work because we have had an opportunity to look at congestion charging schemes in other countries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Far be it from me to intrude in private grief, but a large number of studies into congestion charging were undertaken by the previous Government: the London congestion charging research programme led by the MVA consultancy in November 1991; research projects in Bristol in 1992; research projects in Edinburgh and Lothian in 1993; and a research project in south-east Hampshire in 1994. What did the then Government conclude on the basis of those studies? Again, the transport Green Paper to which I referred earlier, which was published by the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire, stated that the study showed that people were increasingly concerned about the impact of traffic growth on their daily lives, but accepted the need for measures to restrain their own car use if they were provided with reasonable alternatives. Those views, along with the strong opinions expressed that the expenditure should be switched from roads to public transport, coincided with some of the main messages in the transport Green Paper. QED, there is no way in which the Opposition can wriggle out of this one. They were highly committed because they recognised the compelling argument in favour of various forms of road charging. As the general election approached, sheer political cowardice led them to abandon those schemes. They ought to be ashamed of it, because the nation would not have suffered by fewer Conservative Members being elected—on the contrary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Under-Secretary describes being sensitive to the view of the electorate as political cowardice. I would suggest that the proper role for a Member of Parliament and for a Government is to listen carefully to what the electorate are saying. If he believes that not providing for congestion charging was political cowardice and that implementing it as proposed by the Government is political bravery, does he therefore accept the consequences upon the ballot box, first on 4 May here in London?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I do not think that the ballot on 4 May in London is of any relevance to this discussion, but all the evidence from surveys carried out about this subject suggests that when motorists are clearly apprised of the benefits and terms of congestion reduction and investment in public transport and other schemes resulting from charging regimes, in the majority they accept them. Local authorities are democratically elected and locally accountable. No one is saying that road charging is an easy choice. There will be extensive consultation and authorities will have to take into account the views of their local electorate. If they choose to go down that path, it will be on the basis of consultation and a clear democratic mandate.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Smith </B>(Vale of Glamorgan): Does my hon. Friend recognise that in areas with relatively small unitary transport authorities—such as Wales, which has 22 such authorities, some of them covering the same urban areas—the consultative role is vital? It is vital not just between the authority and users but between adjoining authorities; otherwise, it could result in displacement of traffic and perhaps of business investment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> With his customary wisdom, my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith) makes an extremely accurate observation. He will find that the Bill calls for that sort of consultation between authorities. The reality is that congestion knows no boundaries and that no congestion scheme can possibly be introduced without proper consultation on the potential effects and on countervailing measures to deal with any displacement.
<P>
<B>Ms Rosie Winterton:</B> My hon. Friend will be aware that the RAC is concerned that the consultation process should include its motorists. It suggests that best practice on consultation should be shared with other authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> That sounds like excellent sense. We seek the most extensive consultation on these matters. It is one of the main criteria that the Secretary of State and the Government are bound to consider in deciding whether to approve a congestion-charging scheme. We expect the most serious consultation with motorists, many of whom will be the general public in the locality, members of local organisations and also members of motoring organisations. If such wide consultation were possible in practice, we would support it, though I am bound to say—and give advance notice of it—that one can carry consultation with motorists too far. A later amendment tabled by the official Opposition provides for 50 per cent. of all motorists in a proposed charging area to be consulted, but it is difficult to envisage how—perhaps by flagging them down at the side of the road, which might be difficult and unhelpful to road congestion. We shall deal with that proposition in due course.
<P>
On the comments of the hon. Member for Bath, I hope that this does not appear to be a sort of love-in, but he made a typically forceful speech in which he advanced the central proposition that we need to create more choice if we want to justify these schemes. That is absolutely right. He raised many important issues, including additionality and borrowing. He knows as well as I do that we cannot, in practice, commit ourselves in the Bill to additionality in perpetuity: no Government can do so. I doubt whether even Lloyd George could have made that sort of commitment when he was a distinguished Liberal Chancellor. It goes without question, however, that the Government have no intention of cutting local transport investment. On the contrary, we have increased the local transport settlement for the next 12 months by 20 per cent. more than under Conservative proposals. Secondly, the hon. Member for Bath also knows that it is the Government's declared intent and commitment to increase the local transport settlement globally in the following year from £755 million to the massive sum of £1 billion a year.
<P>
Borrowing is an extremely interesting question. There are many different sources of funding for local transport investment. They vary from conventional funding and Government grant to credit approval. In future, they will certainly include the extra revenue that will come from the fuel duty fund. As the Chancellor said in the autumn, charging will generate significant revenues for investment in local transport improvements.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I must tell the hon. Member for Bath that the private finance initiative is a further route that local authorities may choose to go down. It should certainly permit borrowing against the proceeds of charging and, furthermore, we do not think that any of these various sources of funding need be at all exclusive. On the contrary, we expect local authorities to produce a package of proposals for the way in which they propose to secure investment in major local transport projects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am grateful. We can debate this subject in more detail later, but will the Minister reflect on what he has said and consider whether he is sounding remarkably like Frank Dobson?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I find that—
<P>
<B>The Chairman indicated dissent—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I totally accept your potential castigation on the Committee for pursuing that particular path, Mr. Gale. If that remark was designed as a jibe, I take it as a compliment. I am delighted to sound like my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) on that and a whole range of issues too, if I may say so, Mr. Gale, without trying your patience excessively.
<P>
Let me try to round this up. The hon. Member for North Wiltshire treated us to a philosophical disquisition. We heard the Goldman Sachs argument. I question this new pose of the Conservatives as the friends of the working man. Very soon I suppose that we will be seeing at the head of their press releases, ``The commonsense revolution for the many, not the few.'' That argument is as desperate as it is implausible. On the exemptions that were linked to the Goldman Sachs argument, exemptions will be a matter for consultation and regulation in due course and that is on the face of the Bill.
<P>
The second argument that the hon. Gentleman raised was who benefits from hypothecation. With the greatest respect, since he adverted to our exchanges when I appeared before the Select Committee last week, I thought that he betrayed a certain confusion on this matter because we were discussing, as he well recalls, the proposed fuel duty fund.
<P>
Who will benefit from investment that results from charging regimes? The motorist who chooses to use the roads. I have already spelt out the advantages that will accrue to motorists using roads where a charging regime is in place. The resulting reduction in congestion and the speedier traffic movement will have significant economic implications. The motorist will benefit from a better environment. The motorist will also benefit from the improvements in public transport that we expect to flow from these regimes because motorists from outside a charging area will be able to park their cars and take advantage of improved public transport facilities. As I said, the Bill provides for a charging authority to link with adjacent authorities on the provision of enhanced transport services, such as buses. Therefore, there is a direct link between motorists living in non-charging areas, benefits that may be expected to accrue from paying the charging charge and the road user charge, and the use of the charging area.
<P>
The argument of the hon. Member for North Wiltshire about what he described as major philosophical flaws in the Government's proposals was curious. He said that charging would not work initially. However, when it did, he said that congestion would be back in no time at all. That may be described as a no-win situation. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hexham described the Tories as the friend of the deferential man or, to borrow Disraeli's great phrase, the angels in marble. He also spoke about regressive taxation. I remind him that, if we are concerned about the least well-off in society, we should remember that they do not have access to the private car. Indeed, such people will be he major beneficiaries of the transport improvements that we expect to flow from charging regimes.
<P>
There was a lengthy discussion about parking in central London. As I recall, Westminster city council makes £100 million a year from parking charges. Indeed, the Tory councillors of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea make more from parking charges than the rest of London put together. As my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth pointed out, parking charges contribute to reducing congestion and, in a limited way, to improving highways. However, we contend that full-blown congestion charging and the hypothecation that is part and parcel of it will result in revenues being wholly devoted to transport improvements in the locality.
<P>
Finally, and—I regret—briefly, I turn to the hon. Member for North Shropshire, who spoke about road user taxes. He said that a high proportion of what he described as road user charges are used for non-transport objectives. However, the position was exactly the same under the previous Administration. I heard the same complaints from motoring organisations when I sat on the Transport Select Committee in the previous Parliament. I remind the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that this Government have scrapped the automatic escalator on fuel duty that was introduced by the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe. We have committed ourselves to a ring-fenced fuel duty fund that will be dedicated wholly to transport and which has been widely welcomed by motoring organisations.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> No, I will not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> No. The Opposition have failed in their attempt to sustain an attack on the Government's proposals on road user charging. I am confident that my brief remarks have strongly rebuffed feeble attempts to undermine the Government's proposals. I remind the Committee that, ostensibly, we are debating a group of technical amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Gale, that I did not catch your eye before the Under-Secretary's tour de force. I did not agree with his comments.
<P>
I draw hon. Members' attention to my interests as published in the Register of Members' Interests. I am a director of a family business, a subsidiary of which owns some road haulage vehicles and I am a part owner of premises with workplace parking, which may be affected under part III, so hon. Members should set any comments that I might make on it in that context.
<P>
The Under-Secretary mentioned Westminster car parking. He has stated in a written answer that about £300 million was collected from car parking in London alone. The chief executive of Westminster council told me that it collects approximately £101 million, but that that was a gross figure, about 50 per cent. of which was spent on collection, traffic wardens and so on, so such schemes are expensive to run. The £50-odd million that that council collects goes into two funds: £30-odd million must be ring fenced for transport and £20-odd million is taken into account in the standard spending assessment. Therefore, there is some loss of revenue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> There is a £30 million gain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Yes, there is, but £20-odd million is taken into account in the SSA calculations. The Government assume that that latter sum is additional income for the authority, so matters are not so clear cut as one might think.
<P>
Such schemes could be extremely expensive. Bearing in mind the discussions about raising money for public transport, resources will not be available to ensure that such transport compensates for the way in which such schemes work if they are expensive to implement.
<P>
I thank the Under-Secretary for sending us copies of ``Breaking the Logjam''—the Government's consultation paper—as it is interesting to read the comments that people have made. One of the key points made in that paper is that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>public transport must be improved to offer motorists a real choice before charging starts.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Frankly, those schemes will not get off the ground in my constituency or those of most of my hon. Friends because public transport is not an option for most people in rural areas. If that factor is taken into account in consultations, many proposals for those schemes will be rejected. The Secretary of State has to take account of that fact under the Bill.
<P>
The car is a necessity for most people. My hon. Friends have made an important point. Taxation on the motorist is regressive. We would have more sympathy for the Government's point of view if they did not have form on the matter—£32 billion raised in taxation and £7 billion spent on transport. Only 80 per cent. of the tax raised from the motorist is spent on other, perhaps important, priorities. The previous Government certainly did not spend, pound for pound, the money raised from motoring on transport.
<P>
The recent trend has been one of cuts in road schemes and increasing taxation, which is causing particular difficulty. Motorists feel hard done by. On top of all that, the Government propose a solution that involves raising more money from motorists and car parking. As my hon. Friends said, if that were being done in the context of a reduction in other means of raising money, we might have more sympathy with it.
<P>
Arguments can be made for road pricing. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham said, it is used on Californian highways, but against a background of generally low taxation on the motorist, who has choices. We are considering the creation of a scheme in which the motorist has no great choice. That will cause major difficulties, especially for those for whom motoring is an important but expensive part of their budget.
<P>
Exemptions have not been mentioned in this short debate. Clearly, the necessary exemptions must be sorted out. The Government have already said that police cars, fire engines and other emergency vehicles will be exempt. We now understand that those who work in national health service hospitals will be exempt from workplace charging—
