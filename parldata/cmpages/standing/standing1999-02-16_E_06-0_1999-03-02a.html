<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Atrincham and Sale, West): I beg to move amendment No. 118, in page 10, line 36, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) The Secretary of State shall publish within two years of the coming into force of the regulations a report setting out the impact which the regulations have had on levels of part-time working in the United Kingdom's economy.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment follows the theme of this morning's very productive discussion on the potential impact on the labour market of the changes relating to part-time work. I was pleased to hear the Minister's comments at the end of that sitting. I found them most encouraging, not only in the immediate context of the amendment but in a wider and more important sense. He suggested that Ministers understood and accepted that a significant impact on the profile of part-time working could follow from the regulations that were introduced under the clause.
<P>
The hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Healey), with whom I sit on the Select Committee for Education and Employment, is aware of my discussions on the subject. The evidence supplied to the Select Committee informed my thinking when I tabled the amendment. I am sure that I am not providing information other than that which is in the public domain but, in their submissions to the Select Committee, numerous witnesses and others suggested that the Government's proposed regulations could have a wide effect on the nature of the labour market, particularly on part-time work.
<P>
I do not for a moment imagine that it is the Minister's intention, but the measures will increase the cost to employers of part-time working. Measures that may be laudable in themselves, given their aim of increasing the rights of part-time workers, their pay and their status, will reduce employers' flexibility. There is a danger that the Government inadvertently are moving in a direction that will undermine the position of part-time workers in the economy.
<P>
It was suggested earlier that there was a clear relationship between the cost of employment and the type of employment that might be offered by employers. I am thinking especially of situations in which an employer contemplates offering additional employment to create new jobs within his enterprise, perhaps a part-time job leading to a full-time job. A decision could be taken to employ people on a part-time basis because it enables the employer to react more flexibly to fluctuations of demand, market circumstances, seasonal changes and so on.
<P>
All of those factors have for many years driven the growth of part-time working in the British economy. Members of the Committee have recognised the importance of that growth in providing employment to many people. The Government's policy could result in the loss of that flexibility and cost advantage to employers, a concern that has been raised not only by employers' organisations and by business people, but by numerous trade unions. The Transport and General Workers Union and the Association of University Teachers in particular have said that the cost benefit to employers has led to a massive growth in the part-time sector. It does not take a genius to work out that if that recent growth in part-time working has been driven by reduced costs and by greater flexibility for employers&#151;measures that may have the laudable aim of increasing the status of part-time work&#151;reducing the flexibility and increasing the costs may change the pattern of part-time work relative to full-time work.
<P>
I am sure that hon. Members will differ&#151;on opposite sides, and perhaps the same side, of the Committee&#151;on the likely effect of the proposals on the levels of part-time work and on whether my arguments are outweighed by arguments of social justice, or by whatever issues hon. Members consider important. Nevertheless, changing the regulations on part-time working will have consequences on the labour market and on the appeal of part-time work to an employer, who may be less or more inclined to offer it, or to an employee, who may be less or more inclined to seek it. All the individual measures will feed through into the labour market and affect the amount or type of work available.
<P>
I accept that my and the Government's conclusions will differ&#151;although I read in this morning's press that the Prime Minister is suggesting that we follow the United States model on the matter, a notion with which I have some sympathy. Perhaps we will shortly hear more such revelations from Ministers. However, I imagine that some Labour Members differ from the view that I and the Prime Minister hold so dearly and that many of them believe that, contrary to the Prime Minister's view, costs and inflexibility should be increased.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> Come and sit here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The Minister would have to live an unnaturally long life to see that happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): My hon. Friend is wrong. Within the next two or three years, he will be sitting where the Minister is sitting, no doubt bringing some logic back into government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful intervention. I am not sure about that, but the question of where the present Prime Minister may be sitting at that time is another matter.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. In the interim, I am sitting in the Chair and it would be nice if we dealt with the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am delighted that you are sitting in the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody, and that you are bringing such a light touch to bear on our proceedings.
<P>
To return to the precise subject of the amendment, I am sure that all members of the Committee, regardless of their political views, believe that the Government's proposals will have an effect on the labour market. Some may think that increasing the status and security of part-time work, will make it much more attractive, and that levels will increase dramatically, while others think that the increased costs and regulatory burdens will cause a dramatic reduction in the levels of part-time work. There will be some change, although it may be less marked than I have suggested.
<P>
I hope that the Committee agrees that my amendment is entirely reasonable. The Government should accept that there may be some changes in the labour market following their actions and undertake to investigate them and produce a report setting out their impact. Amendment No. 118 would provide that a report should be published
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``within two years of the coming into force of the regulations''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should be delighted if Ministers could produce a worthwhile assessment of the impact of part-time working in a shorter time scale. I have suggested a reasonable approach. Two years would give the Department long enough to undertake, collate and publish the research.
<P>
I hope that Ministers find my proposal useful, especially given the nature of the Bill and the fact that much of the detail will come in regulations. The regulations may be changed at some point in the future, so I hope that Ministers will accept that there is a strong case for such information to be produced and made publicly available. It would inform the views not only of Members of Parliament and the public, but of Ministers themselves, who may feel that it is appropriate to review the regulations, or to increase or decrease the burden on businesses that engage part-time workers. It is simply a matter of common sense, and I hope that Ministers will accept the amendment in that context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I support my hon. Friend, who made his case persuasively.
<P>
I am certain that the Government are not trying to do away with part-time work&#151;we would certainly have a different view if that were the case. However, we on the Conservative Benches are concerned that there may be unintended consequences that will impact on part-time workers and the volume of jobs. We know that the proportion of the United Kingdom population in work is higher that that in any other country in the European Union because there is a large number of women in the workplace. The economy benefits from their being in work. The vast majority of part-time workers are women and most of them want to be in part-time work, although occasionally people take part-time work while trying to find full-time employment. We want to see whether the patterns change.
<P>
I shall not give a long explanation of what happened after the Equal Pay Act 1970, but the Government introduced that Act specifically because there was a measurable margin between the pay of men and women. The unintended consequence of that Act was that the rapid coming together of those two salary levels stopped. Last year, women's pay drifted further away from men's pay.
<P>
When the 1970 Act was debated in Parliament, I was working in a factory, and I know that the company&#151;it was owned by Marconi&#151;decided to separate the work force, so that women would do certain jobs and men would do others, which it had not done previously. It did so because it knew that it would have to pay equal wages for equal work.
<P>
I am afraid that companies will decide that the way around the Bill is to say that all part-timers do a less-skilled job than full-timers and put the full-timers into a different system, even though both groups used to work side by side doing the same job.
<P>
In asking for such a report, my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) is genuinely working with the grain of what the Government wants to do. The Government do not want the Bill to have unintended consequences. A wise Government would accept the amendment; they would know that they had to consider carefully what happened in the labour market and take action if any unintended consequence had the wrong effect on the United Kingdom economy.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Sandra Osborne </B>(Ayr): I should like to make a few brief comments on amendment No. 118. In doing so, I welcome the fact that equal employment rights for part-time workers are being addressed. Like other hon. Members, I declare an interest as a small employer. In fact, I am pleased that one of the two people whom I employ is a new deal employee. I urge hon. Members to follow my example and give young, long-term unemployed people the chance of employment.
<P>
I also declare an interest as a long-term, often part-time, previous employee of small employers. I took up such work not because I was responding to market forces&#151;as the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) suggested that people did&#151;but because, as a mother, part-time working suited me best. Given the disgraceful lack of child care facilities, it was the only option open to me. Market forces did not come into my decision, nor did I welcome the fact that my terms and conditions of employment were inferior to those of many other people.
<P>
I was gratified to hear the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) say that she welcomed some aspects of the Bill, especially those on pensions, recognising that many women were disadvantaged in terms of pensions. Indeed, as well as having poor employment rights as a result of my years of working for a small employer I had no occupational pension until I became a Member of Parliament.
<P>
Although amendment No. 118 is not especially controversial, it raises the important issue of the impact on employment of part-time work. However, I do not know what the amendment would achieve. Its scope is too narrow and limited and the time scale is too short. I am not against monitoring the effects of the Bill, and I have taken on board the comments of the Opposition Members who said that that should be done. In fact, it is important to monitor the effects of the whole Bill, and I hope that all my hon. Friends agree with that. I shall explain the reasons why I believe that the amendment would not provide an adequately clear picture of the effects of equal rights for part-time workers.
<P>
I agree that continuing changes in the structure of the work force need to be monitored&#151;in that respect, the amendment is important. Better employment conditions will undoubtedly result in change. I believe that the Bill, taken with other family-friendly measures, will be particularly welcome to women. Many hon. Members have said that the largest group of part-time workers is women; and 45 per cent. of the women who presently work are part-timers. I believe that measures in the Bill will encourage more women to work part-time who are not presently in work, but that change needs to be monitored and analysed in relation to its positive benefits for women.
<P>
The Minister has outlined the various positive benefits to employers of encouraging part-time working. For instance, employers may be able to match individual working hours more closely to production requirements, but I am worried about how that could be achieved. It would certainly need to be monitored closely, as it could have negative as well as positive effects on employees. I note that the Confederation of British Industry said that the agreement allowed for considerable flexibility. I was gratified that the Minister paid tribute to the commitment, often above and beyond the call of duty, of those employed by small companies. However, that great word ``flexibility'', of which we have heard so much, should work both ways&#151;in favour of employers and of employees. It is important to consider that when debating the possible effects of the amendment.
<P>
The amendment calls for a Government report, but a great deal of information about part-time working is already available, and it must be taken into account when making an analysis. For example, although most part-time workers are women, a growing number of men are entering the part-time work force. Part-time workers earn only 70 per cent. of the average hourly earnings of full-time workers. That is another major implication of part-time working. Indeed, part-time work is concentrated in three occupations; clerical work, personal and protective services and sales together employ six in every 10 part-time workers.
<P>
Hon. Members have already spoken of the extent to which part-time work is structured in relation to gender. Although 15 per cent. of all employees have managerial jobs, only 5 per cent. of part-time workers are in management. However, men who work part-time are nearly twice as likely as women to have a managerial role. The majority of those working part-time do so through choice, but the proportion of workers who have part-time jobs because they are unable to fund full-time work has risen by 50 per cent. during the past 10 years.
<P>
I am aware, Mrs. Dunwoody, that in highlighting such matters, I have strayed slightly from the strict terms of the amendment. I am sure that many Committee members are already aware of the facts, but I believe that they are worth describing because they illustrate the many implications of part-time working for the work force. Those implications must be taken into account in any report.
<P>
As many hon. Members have stated, part-time work is already on the increase. Given that there has already been a dramatic increase, I wonder how it will be possible to identify the impact of regulations on the amount of part-time working. It will, I am sure, be possible to carry out research designed to show how we can provide part-time workers with equivalent rights to full-time workers, but the amendment will not provide enough scope for all the variables to be taken into account.
<P>
The amendment calls for a one-off report to be published within two years of the regulation's implementation. That is not adequate. First, more than one report will be required. For instance, family-friendly policies will have just as big an impact on the number of part-time workers as the measures designed to ensure that part-time workers are treated no less favourably than full-time workers. Therefore, the impact of the two sets of measures cannot be separated out. Secondly, I am puzzled that a time scale of two years has been suggested. That is not long enough to assess the full impact of the regulations. Such assessment must be coherent and long term.
<P>
I do not support amendment No. 118 because it is not satisfactory. However, I support the general call for monitoring of the Employment Relations Bill. It needs to be monitored in terms of its positive effect, and I would be interested to hear the Minister's thoughts on how, in the longer term, that important issue can be addressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West for his characteristically responsible contribution in moving the amendment. I have every sympathy with what he says. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset and to the hon. Member for Ayr (Ms Osborne) for their thoroughly sensible industry-based contributions.
<P>
Despite differences of approach, we have all identified some common themes running through our debate on the clause. The first is the need to be fair; the second is the need to have regard to the complexities and differences in the labour market; the third is the need to be as flexible as possible in interpreting legislation; the fourth is the recognition that the legislative changes that took place under the previous Government as well as economic changes have led to a considerable increase in part-time employment.
<P>
Part-time workers&#151;typically but not exclusively women and mothers&#151;have to marry their interests with those of employers who want additional flexibility in their labour force. Intervention in that process is likely a priori&#151;forgive me, Mrs. Dunwoody, but it is a useful term of art&#151;to disturb the balance sought by the market. I comment on that without heavily loading or theologising the phrase.
<P>
We need to see whether the consequences will be as the Committee imagines. If there is one underlying theme that has come out of our debate, certainly for Conservative members of the Committee, it is a fear that unintended consequences may take us to a place that we did not intend to go. Far from helping part-time workers by giving them additional rights, we may deter employers from taking people on because rights for part-time workers carry a price ticket, however great or small. The balance may shift to their general disadvantage.
<P>
I think that the Ministers for Small Firms, Trade and Industry is, of all people on the Committee, one of the most capable and best-fitted to comment on such matters. I recall&#151;the text is not in front of me, so he will forgive me if I do not quote him accurately&#151;that he wrote an article for The Birmingham Post not long ago, in which the substance of what he said was that his business was reliant on the availability of casual employment. There is an important distinction that often gets blurred between casual work and part-time work, but neither should be ruled out from the start&#151;they both have their place. I am sure that the Minsiter will acknowledge that.
<P>
The need to monitor what we do has been clearly expressed across the Committee. I do not intend to speak on that further, except to say that in the past hour or so, I have received an extremely helpful parliamentary reply from the Minister of State about the work&#151;[Interruption.] The Minister of State suggests that that is not characteristic. Provided that I am prepared to be sufficiently persistent, the Minister of State always gives me a constructive and helpful reply. The questions that we ask elicit the answers that we want to receive.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary reply is about the work of the Low Pay Commission. It is reasonable in this context to draw an analogy. I asked what the commission was doing. If I may slightly shorten the reply, the commission,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``has been asked to monitor and evaluate the introduction and impact of the national minimum wage, with particular reference to the effect on: pay, employment and competitiveness in low paying sectors and small firms; particular groups of workers such as young people . . . with disabilities and voluntary sector workers; pay structures, including the effect on differentials and different pay systems; and training.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I could not have put it better myself if I had been writing a specification for the work of the Low Pay Commission. Modestly, I seem to recall that, in the reaches of the night, we argued for such a thing 12 months ago.
<P>
We do not need the Low Pay Commission to undertake a similar analysis on part-time working, but the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West is on the right lines. We should like an acknowledgement from the Minister that it is important not merely to introduce the legislation, lay an egg, issue a press release and say how family friendly we are, but to ensure that the policies follow through into positive benefits. There are some differences of emphasis on that; there is no point in pretending that there are not. However, regardless of our approach, it must be in our common interest to ensure that the matter is properly investigated. Given that the Minister is allowing himself to make regulations of staggering potential flexibility, any unfortunate consequences that he had not anticipated can be rectified. It is a simple issue, and I hope that the Minister will give my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West a highly sympathetic response.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Wills):</B> Before I speak to the amendment, I should like to refer to the so-called interview that I gave The Birmingham Post. I would hate the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West to base his case on an interview that I have never given or, indeed, on a garbled and inaccurate account of my remarks. If he needs to know what I believe about any matter, he is always welcome to contact me, and I shall be more than happy to enlighten him.
<P>
I recognise the long-standing anxieties about part-time work taken up by the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West, who tabled the amendment. During our discussion, I have tried hard to find it a useful amendment. Unfortunately, I have failed. It is neither necessary nor helpful, for three broad reasons. First, the measure is not designed solely to increase the number of part-time jobs. An equally important effect will be to increase the quality of such jobs. It also aims to open up a wider range of part-time opportunities in areas that previously have not been thought susceptible to part-time work. A simple measure of the level of part-time work such as is proposed in the amendment would not pick up those important changes, and would therefore underestimate and fundamentally misrepresent the effect of the regulations.
<P>
Secondly, we are not aiming for a quick fix with the regulations. There is no magic bullet, and we do not think that we shall see the effects in anything like the time scale envisaged by the amendment. We expect the regulations to have an effect in the long term on workplace culture and perceptions of part-time work. We are unlikely to have concrete evidence of significant change within the first two years, so to conduct a study in that time scale would be a waste of Government resources.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I invite the Minister to comment on the fact that the Low Pay Commission has already been asked to evaluate the implications of the introduction of the national minimum wage, although the national minimum wage will not be in force for a further three weeks. I am not sure why it should be impossible for it to do so. The Minister is saying, in effect, that a long-term analysis of what he is now proposing cannot be carried out for an indefinite period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Perhaps I should repeat what I said. The clause is about changing part-time work and culture in the work place, the effects of which cannot be measured in such a time scale. It is a simple point. Cultures take a long time to change. For a study to be useful, we shall have to take stock of the situation over a longer time.
<P>
I know that the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West will take my comment in the spirit in which it is intended, but what he is proposing is methodologically suspect. There has been a long-term trend for an increase in the level of part-time work in the economy, to which members of the Committee have already referred. The rate of growth has not been constant and, over the past few years, workplace culture has been changing. For example, employers recognise that they may be unlawfully discriminating on the grounds of gender if they discriminate against part-timers.
<P>
We are not talking about revolutionary change, but reinforcing existing trends and clarity for all sides. It would be difficult to disentangle all the factors that have gone towards promoting the growth of part-time work in recent years and to establish accurately to what extent any future change in the growth rate was due to the regulations or to economic and social factors.
<P>
Conservative Members talk about the so-called law of unintended consequences. All Governments must be sensitive to that and, indeed, we are. However, when talking about the effects of legislation, we must be absolutely clear what are consequences and what are not. The monitoring proposed by the amendment would not enable that to be achieved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I cannot speak for my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West. He must decide for himself whether he wishes to defeat the Government on this issue. However, I suspect that the proposal is a probing amendment, and I hope that the Minister's script will allow him to say that the Government will take on the spirit of the amendment, undertake studies and report to Parliament on the results.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> That intervention was helpful, because it is precisely what I am about to talk about. Having outlined the problems with the amendment, we accept the spirit that was intended that there should be monitoring of the effects of the Bill. The Government have every intention of doing that. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall be keen to review the success of the part-time work provisions. We shall take a wider view of that success than his amendment contemplates.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr suggested in her cogent contribution, part-time work is monitored regularly in statistical surveys. We shall wish to consider later how best to find out the wider effects of the Bill. That will be a more productive use of resources than the report sought by the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West. The amendment would add nothing to the Bill. It would only involve Government researchers in work that would not produce useful information. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful in parts to the Minister. His response was interesting; it went a little way towards accepting the principle of the amendment, while suggesting that there was no earthly way in which the Government could establish the facts that I seek. I am still a little uneasy. He said that the amendment is not necessary or helpful. Well, I could be persuaded that the amendment, in its particular terms, is not necessary, although it is helpful if only in pushing the Government a little way towards making a concession on the issue.
<P>
The Minister said that the Government are concerned with increasing not only the level but the quality of part-time work. I recognise that objective, but our main concern is that in the quest for increased quality, there could be a price to pay in terms of the number of part-time jobs. The Minister may think that that is a worthwhile trade-off and something that the Government can live with. Perhaps we could all live with it, but that is not an argument for not finding out the figures, and the effect of the measure, insofar as it can be established.
<P>
The Minister accused me of being methodologically suspect, which cut me to the quick.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> An unintended consequence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I happily accept the Minister's assurance that it was unintended. To suggest that it is not possible to establish the information in two years is questionable. At the very least, it must be possible to get an inkling of the initial effects. I am open to suggestions.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ayr sensibly suggested that the scope of the report could be widened and that instead of a one-off report in two years' time, there should be an on-going process. In suspect that that is the remit of the Low Pay Commission in respect of the minimum age. Perhaps we could reach an intelligent conclusion that accepts that there will be consequences for the Labour market, but the information that the Government and the country need must be provided in order to form a judgment on the efficacy of these measures.
<P>
The Minister made it clear that he was prepared for an assessment of the Bill's effect on the labour market, but he did not say when such findings would be made public. In making that concession, he did not say when the detail of the Government's monitoring proposals would be available. I should welcome an assurance that those details will be made available before Report and Third Reading.
<P>
Having heard the Minister come a little way in my direction, I shall not press the amendment now. Perhaps hon. Members will want to return to the matter later, if they are permitted to do so, as it would be instructive to know the Government's monitoring proposals. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 111, in page 11, line 9, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(aa) direct the taking into account by such tribunals of the financial and other resources of the employer in assessing either any liability or compensation.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I need not spend much time on this amendment or its immediate successor. I have no particular brief for the exact words used, but the spirit of the amendment is to point out that there will be financial implications for businesses because new responsibilities will be imposed on them. I invite the Minister to show that when the regulations are drawn up, those responsibilities will be limited to a level that businesses can bear. I do not argue that there should be no responsibilities, nor that there should be no criminal liabilities. I suspect that the Minister will say that it is necessary to have a criminal liability to underpin what could be termed a civil obligation, which could be judged by an employment tribunal. We are familiar with such concepts from our deliberations on the National Minimum Wage Bill.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is obvious, in the absence of the regulations, that what I propose cannot be made any clearer. Until we have heard what sort of regulations will be proposed, it is difficult to work out even a shadow tariff of penalties. For example, it is known&#151;I have commented on it myself&#151;that the majority of obligations in relation to employment law currently inhere as much in part-time workers as they do in full-timers. There is no new obligation in terms of unfair dismissal or employment tribunals, although the scale of what is proposed elsewhere in the Bill is much greater. However, subsection (3) will clearly impose some new criminal responsibilities or liabilities. We may return to them on clause stand part.
<P>
The principle&#151;it is clear enough&#151;is that one cannot get blood out of a stone. Most employers try to do their best. Most small employers have no access to sophisticated human resources departments or in-house lawyers and do not have university graduates on tap to pick their way through the niceties of the regulations, which we have not yet seen. I shall not trespass on the Minister's concerns, but in revising regulations right up to the moment of their taking effect, Ministers must hope that everything will come out clearly.
<P>
For an employer who is acting broadly in good faith to be faced with a penalty&#151;either a civil or criminal fine&#151;that is heavy on the business, and might in an extreme case close it down, does not seem a helpful use of the process. I shall draw an analogy, which, if nothing else, may wake up Labour Back Benchers. It is rather like fining the train operators such large sums for their undoubted failures of service that they go out of business with the result that there is no service to complain about.
<P>
There is a difficult and delicate balance to be drawn. I am not saying&#151;I speak also as an employer&#151;that I want to send a signal favouring delinquent employers. Any penalty that the Minister eventually decides&#151;it is a process that is as yet unclear and incomplete&#151;should be broadly proportionate to the offence committed or the loss suffered; it should not be such as to cause the closure of the business in question. The penalty should act as a healthy discipline and not as a nuclear deterrent. I have nothing further to say, except to ask Ministers to respond in such a way as to show how they might approach the matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) looks upon amendment No. 111 as being not too important. However, I feel that the amendment is a fundamental challenge to the existing legislation as it would allow compensation to be calculated in remedy of unfair dismissal. The amendment provides that an employer's resources, including finances, should be taken into account in assessing compensation. Under clause 3(3)(a), regulations may confer jurisdiction on employment tribunals and the employment appeals tribunal to award compensation to part-time workers found to have been unfairly dismissed. If the amendment were accepted, such tribunals would treat successful applicants who are part-time workers less favourably than those who are full-time workers.
<P>
I reject the amendment and the principle behind it, which flies in the face of the objective criteria laid down in existing legislation for the calculation of compensation for unfair dismissal. Those criteria are fairly straightforward and include a basic element that equates to a redundancy payment; a compensatory element for future loss, which normally works out at an average of six months; an element for loss of statutory rights, which can be between &#163;100 and &#163;200; and a less well-known element of compensation for loss of pension rights. Those are the headings under which unfair dismissal is calculated, except in the circumstances of a special award. An award would be reduced in cases where an employee is deemed to have contributed to his or her dismissal or where benefits have been awarded up to the date of the tribunal, necessitating a clawback.
<P>
My concern is that if the principle behind the amendment were adopted for everyone, it could be detrimental to all workers who win unfair dismissal claims. Only poor managers argue that it is hard to dismiss an employee fairly. There are plenty of regulations, rules and procedures in codes of practice that enable a fair and reasonable employer to dismiss fairly an employee who has transgressed in a way that merits such a serious disciplinary sanction. The relatively innocent-looking amendment in fact threatens the principle of fair compensation for all workers, not only part-timers. It is appropriate that employment tribunals and the employment appeals tribunal have that power of jurisdiction. I shall vote against the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I understand that the hon. Member for Daventry moved the amendment a probing spirit, but it raises several difficulties, some of which my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles (Mr. Stewart) has discussed. I appreciate the concern of hon. Friend the Member for Daventry that legislation should take into account business needs, and I hope that our debates in Committee have reassured him that the Government are equally committed to ensuring that that happens. However, the amendment would present some problems.
<P>
The amendment would have a dual effect. The Government are more sympathetic to the first effect than to the second. First, it would ensure that in considering whether an employer has acted unlawfully in treating a part-timer less favourably than a full-timer, the employment tribunal or the employment appeals tribunal will take into account the employer's financial and other resources.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry is content that, in general, the circumstances of an employer will be taken into account in deciding whether the employer has acted reasonably and with justification. There is no question of exempting employers from the need to treat part-timers without discrimination. However, the employer's particular circumstances could provide a basis for objective justification for different treatment, provided the treatment is appropriate with a view to pursuing the employer's objectives and necessary to that end.
<P>
As I said in a previous debate, European law prevents employers from justifying unequal treatment solely on cost grounds. However, it is recognised in the directive that small employers have limited administrative and other resources and that legislation must take that into account. It should therefore avoid imposing administrative, financial or legal constraints that would hold back the creation and development of small and medium undertakings.
<P>
The nub of our response to that aspect of the amendment is that we shall consult on how the regulations deal with the details. As my hon. Friend the Minister of State has already said, hon. Members will have ample opportunity to discuss such matters later.
<P>
The amendment's second effect presents fundamental difficulties. It suggests that if a tribunal had already taken account of the employer's circumstances but still found his actions to be unjustifiable and unlawful, the amount of compensation that the employee received would depend on the employer's resources. I understand that this is a probing amendment, but the hon. Member for Daventry must be aware that that is quite contrary to the principles of employment legislation.
<P>
Compensation awarded for infringement of rights is not generally punitive on the employer; it is simply compensation. It compensates the individual for the loss that he or she has suffered as a result of the employer's unlawful action. If employees do not suffer much loss, they will not receive much compensation. However, if they suffer significant loss, they must receive significant compensation. Employers must know that if they act unlawfully they must pay the consequences. That is self-evident.
<P>
European law deals the final blow to the amendment. It is settled law that those whose rights in respect of discrimination under European law are infringed should be able to obtain adequate redress. the amendment could prevent that from happening. Given that we shall consult further on the first part of the amendment and that the second part presents substantial difficulties, I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That was an interesting set of replies. As always, I had a mental picture of the Minister's response. I am reassured that he has stepped straight out of central casting and said exactly what I expected him to say.
<P>
This is indeed a probing amendment, but it was intended to make a point. The Government's subsequent consultations and the unfolding tapestry of employment law must, of course, make the point that employers should act properly and that, whenever possible, disputes should be resolved informally&#151;a point that has perhaps not been made as often as it should have been so far in Committee. Nevertheless, if push comes to shove and employers lose a case before an employment tribunal, they have to be in a position to pay the penalty. If such resources are not available, the employee's problem will not be solved.
<P>
I was interested in the remarks of the hon. Member for Eccles, because I respect him and his knowledge of the matter. He rightly notes that, in principle, a special case of compensation would be created that would be different from that which generally applies to full-time employees. The key-note of the clause&#151;subsection (1)&#151;sets out the objective that the regulations should apply ``no less favourably'', and may at least create a consideration under which that would be difficult to do.
<P>
The amendment was tabled to provide an opportunity to rehearse the fact that not all employers who make mistakes, or who in extreme cases are delinquent, have resources that enable them to meet the full demands of what the Minister described.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman join me in saying that employers should make a decision during the disciplinary process about whether they can afford a tribunal award? Considering the headings that I outlined, it is clear to employers before the tribunal whether they can afford it, and it is relatively easy to estimate the potential award. I fundamentally believe that we in Parliament collectively need to raise awareness among employers about the disciplinary grievance procedures that we have been addressing so that they will know when and where to make a sensible decision, rather than waiting for the tribunal and finding themselves in the position that the hon. Gentleman outlined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I cannot possibly dissent from the hon. Gentleman's sentiment. Throughout the process, it is better that such a wrong should not take place, and, if it does, it should be stopped by agreement at the earliest possible moment. I realise that his experience will not be confined to, but may be concentrated in, bigger firms with the resources that I referred to, so I remind him that there are small firms and small employers. They find themselves&#151;they should not, but they do&#151;in a tribunal process that they little understand. They become uncomfortable with, or in extreme cases nurse a genuine grievance about, the deliberations and awards made by the tribunal, and then may not find it easy to meet whatever liability or compensation is deemed appropriate.
<P>
It is a difficult matter. In the context of the proposed quadrupling of the limits on unfair dismissal, there is no easy recourse&#151;no pot of gold from which those requirements can be met. The Minister needs to think about that in building up the regulations. I readily concede to both him and the hon. Member for Eccles that people should display and strive after the best practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there are two main problems with the amendment? First, a variable penalty would be practically unworkable and would lead to variations in the assessment of tribunals across the country for exactly the same cases, let alone different cases. Secondly, there would be an incentive for small businesses to compartmentalise themselves into different limited companies in which the assets of one company that employed a lot of people would enable them to minimise the penalties that they pay. That would open the doors for distortions in the marketplace.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am no lawyer, but I doubt whether a business would get away with what the hon. Gentleman raises in his second point. I understand his first concern about this probing amendment, a concern that mirrors that of the hon. Member for Eccles. For all those reasons, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 112, in page 11, line 15, after `who', insert `knowlingly'.
<P>
I now hope to beat the record for brevity in speaking to amendments. Three categories of persons might be liable under the regulations to a criminal charge. That may mean individuals, organisations of employers or organisations of workers who had comitted an alleged offence. That is perfectly understandable. The regulations cover people standing in relation to those persons as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an agent, principal, employee, employer or officer of a person who commits the offence''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That again seems acceptable, because there must be a relationship between them. If they are being asked to do something illegal, they should have the opportunity of making representations, or if they have colluded, they will have no defence on the ground that they were not the principals who initiated the offence.
<P>
The third class of persons is described simply as a person
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``who aids the commission of the offence'' ''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps such persons should be included in the regulations, but the test under the Bill is one of strict liability, whereas the amendment suggests that they should have some intention of aiding the offence. There should be a degree of collusion and understanding between the person who is behind it and the person who aids it, rather than there being some purely accidental circumstances in which a court might find that the person has strict liability because, even if he did not intend to commit the offence or even if he intended the opposite, he had aided the commission of the alleged offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising an interesting point. No doubt he is aware that the clause is based on previous discrimination legislation and the amendment would go some way towards reflecting its exact wording. I want to make it clear that we envisage a very limited use of the power to create a criminal liability, reflecting the provisions under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Under the Act, someone who knowingly aids an unlawfully discriminatory act in general will be treated as himself discriminating unlawfully.
<P>
However, a person will not be treated as acting unlawfully if he reasonably relied on a false or misleading statement by another person that the discriminatory act would not be unlawful. However, the person who made that false or misleading statement will be committing a criminal offence if he or she ``knowingly or recklessly'' made it. Members of the Committee will see that the situation in which there may be a criminal offence is very narrowly defined.
<P>
Nevertheless, to accept the amendment would be confusing. The relevant section of the 1995 Act says that a person commits an offence if he ``knowingly or recklessly'' makes a false statement. It is likely that we would want to follow that line in regulations. But, if we put the word ``knowingly'' in primary legislation as proposed by the amendment, there would still be power to specify in the regulations that the action must have also been committed ``recklessly''. The result would be confusing. Either the power would not be used, so ``recklessly'' would not be a limitation and there would be a slightly greater chance of committing an offence or the limitation ``recklessly'' would appear separately in the regulations. The regulations would not then reflect the wording of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and there would be a danger that employers would be unclear about the exact extent of their liability.
<P>
To avoid such confusion and make things as clear as possible, we intend to have all the details of the operation of the liability, including any necessary definitions, together in the regulations. They will therefore reflect the spirit of the amendment and be in line with previous discrimination legislation. I know that some members of the Committee are concerned about details of the legislation being in regulations. However, that has real advantages, which my hon. Friend the Minister of State outlined in the debate on maternity and parental leave. It will allow employers and others to find all the information in one place; it will also allow a full consultation exercise to ensure that we take account of the views of those who will have to use the legislation. I assure hon. Members that the regulations in this case, too, will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure so that hon. Members will have an opportunity to debate them before they are introduced. I hope that in the light of that, the hon. Member for Daventry will be reassured and will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I and those who advise us will read carefully what the Minister has said. Subject only to that reserve, he is clearly acting in a spirit of reasonableness, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We have had a series of extremely interesting debates on matters arising out of the clause. I flag up for the Minister's consideration several points that have not been the subject of a specific amendment, and to which he might like to respond at a later stage, if not now.
<P>
Representations have been made by engineering employers and others about the importance of proper advance consultation even before the regulations are presented in draft form. It is at least implicit&#151;it would be nice to hear the Minister make it explicit&#151;that he intends to hold such consultation. If the Bill is to work, it is important that the regulations be drafted effectively and that all sides be involved in the consideration of them. For the avoidance of doubt, I make it clear that consultation is already specifically provided for in subsequent clauses in relation to codes of practice. It is important that it be available for the regulations.
<P>
The second point relates to the interaction of criminal proceedings and civil proceedings at an employment tribunal. I am worried that circumstances may arise in which matters have to be stayed at the employment tribunal for a period for the criminal procedure to be discharged. The hon. Member for Eccles shakes his head, but it is important to consider that, because we do not want a long delay. As the Minister will know, the normal provision is to take cases to the employment tribunal, or make application, within three months. The last thing that people want when they have lost their jobs is a further hook in the process that results in a long consideration.
<P>
Subsection (3)(e) refers to the regulations making
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``provision about notices or information to be given, evidence to be produced and other procedures to be followed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is unexceptional in itself. I failed to notice, and to table a probing amendment, but the clause should contain a provision to deal with what procedures are to take place or penalties imposed by default if the employer does not follow the procedure. The regulations need to specify whether that is a separate offence and how that will be taken into acount in other proceedings.
<P>
Subsection (3)(f), which I mention only because their Lordships tend to get excited about such matters, is a provision to amend the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 almost at the will of Ministers. I am aware that those are both consolidation measures, and it is useful to have the entire matter in one compendium. I presume that it is included simply to embody whatever now slots into the consolidation measure. If that is all, it would be helpful for the Committee to know.
<P>
Subsection (4) contains references to regulations that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``make any provision which appears to the Secretary of State to be necessary or expedient''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I make the point to the Minister, because it is always nicer to hear his response, that we do not want gold-plating. If we must go further than the Council directive, Ministers should come clean and explain why. They have done so in their explanatory notes in relation to pay, which is presumably the main area of departure from the directive, although perhaps Ministers will qualify that.
<P>
The final provision&#151;clause 18(4)(c)&#151;states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for the purpose of any matter dealt with by the framework agreement or for the purpose of applying the provisions of the framework agreement to any matter relating to part-time workers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I presume that that is in relation to pay, and I should like the Minister to confirm that. Some employers' representatives&#151;not including the CBI&#151;may not be entirely happy with the procedure whereby negotiations take place behind closed doors and the solution is then read across automatically into British legislation. I do not want to go heavy on that provision now, but it is necessary to remind the Committee that there is potential for problems.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
To summarise, we understand the Government's intentions and objectives in seeking to harmonise the terms and conditions applicable to part-timers with those of full-timers. The clause both recognises and reinforces the growing importance of part-time working to our society and economy. We do not want to oppose the clause in principle, but we have set out some genuine considerations on its operation and the ability of businesses to cope with the regulations both administratively and financially. I hope that Ministers who now speak the language of being friendly to business, as well as being friendly to families, will remember the excess costs on business.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I do not wish to prolong the clause stand part debate, but I am keen to make a point. It is important to note that the impact on small businesses, especially very small ones, will be much worse than the impact on large businesses. That could be why larger businesses are quite comfortable with some of the Bill's provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Once again, my hon. Friend is on to a very good point. We have to consider the impact of the clause across the piece for business, and the particular and differential impact on smaller businesses. I do not often quote myself, but I referred to the concept in the press as an example of regressive, back-door taxation by regulation that hits small businesses more then larger ones.
<P>
The cost for business needs considering, as do the implications for the family. No one wants those who genuinely seek part-time employment to be priced out of the labour market as a result of the changes. That is why we had the constructive debate on monitoring. I shall not advise my hon. Friends to vote against the clause in principle, but we have reservations, and I hope that Minister will bear them firmly in mind when introducing the regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall be brief in the interests of moving along this evening. I want to make a couple of points and to address one or two of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
The measure aims to end the view that part-time work is a second-class option. It promotes part-time work as an essential part of a flexible labour party&#151;[Laughter]&#151;I mean market, and a flexible Labour party, too. Flexibility is not encapsulated in a crude freedom to hire and fire. It has benefits for both workers and employers. Employers are better able to react to the business cycle and changes in demand, and workers can balance their work with their other important family commitments.
<P>
Many employers already make use of part-time work to cover peaks in demand, to tailor working time more accurately to the nature of the task, and to recruit and retain valued staff who cannot, or prefer not to, work full-time. However, it is often thought that only a limited range of jobs can be done part-time, so employers do not take full advantage of the benefits. Many people see a move towards working part-time as a step down in their career and an end to their promotion prospects.
<P>
Clause 18 provides power for the Secretary of State to make regulations to ensure that the terms and conditions of employment of part-time workers are no less favourable&#151;I can confirm that that includes pay&#151;than those of their full-time colleagues.
<P>
The measure will send an important message to workers and employers. Treating part-time workers the same as full-time workers will show everyone that they are equally valuable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall press on, if I may. If people realise that they can move fluently between full-time and part-time work and that they can continue to advance their careers, they will be more willing to do so. Employers will then have the extra flexibility necessary to structure their businesses in a way that will allow them to meet demands more efficiently. We believe that that culture change will also benefit the economy as a whole; it will improve the commitment and productivity of the work force and thus the competitiveness of firms.
<P>
<B>Mr Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> No, I shall continue, because we have a lot to get through.
<P>
The measure fits in with the other family-friendly measures that we have already put forward. We have spoken about parental responsibilities and about enabling people to balance their work commitments with family life. However, I should make it clear that, in addition to those with parental responsibilities, 10 per cent. of workers care for another person, and they will be unable to give the required care if they work full-time. Such people will benefit from the measures that we propose in clause 18. An increasing number of people who want to work part-time also want to undertake some form of part-time study. All such people will be helped by the measure.
<P>
The regulations issued under the powers in clause 18 will fulfil the United Kingdom's obligation under the European Union directive on part-time work. That directive was negotiated between the European social partners, and it is already widely accepted as a useful framework. The measure will not create burdens for UK employers, although I am happy to confirm that discussions with employers will take place. We believe that the measure will not result in significant costs.
<P>
Surveys show little discrimination against part-time workers, but we need to make sure that it does not start. The measure sets a minimum standard of protection for all part-time workers. It recognises and allows for the fact that there may sometimes be good reason for treating comparable employees differently. The regulations will make it clear that that will not be unlawful provided it is properly justified.
<P>
The provisions will also make things easier for the conduct of efficient business, because part-time workers will no longer have to try to prove indirect sex discrimination to gain equal treatment, as has been the case until now. That will make employers' obligations much clearer and it will reduce the need to resort to tribunals.
<P>
We shall be working on the draft regulations over the coming weeks. In them we shall set out our detailed proposals for implementing the EU directive. We shall take account of all the views that we have received, including those expressed by the Committee, and further informal soundings will be made of all interested parties, including the social partners.
<P>
As with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's undertaking to consult on the regulations on maternity and parental leave, we shall take full account of all comments on part-time working. We shall consult publicly on the draft regulations. I shall ensure that all members of the Committee are sent copies of the consultation document. We aim to ensure, as far as possible, that all sides are content with the final regulations. We intend them to come into force in April 2000, as required by the part-time working directive.
<P>
We realise that employers will need time to adjust to the new measures and that they are keen to have early information on them. We shall therefore publish the draft regulations in the first half of this year. We shall them allow two or three months for consultation. That will enable the final version of the regulations to be laid before Parliament in the autumn, which will give us a significant period before they come into effect. I commend clause 18 to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<H4><center>Clause 19</center></H4>
<H4><center>Part-time work: code of practice</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> Somewhat unusually, I rise to support the clause&#151;or at least the spirit in which it was proposed. I do that partly to make the Minister of State feel more uncomfortable, and partly to support the way in which the debate was presented by the Under-Secretary&#151;or perhaps we should call him the unpaid secretary. I am not sure how to describe him, but we ought to do our best to ensure that he gets paid on the basis of our input into the Committee. I recall that draftsmen get all sorts of things from Acts of Parliament, so perhaps we should move in that direction.
<P>
Much of the Bill effectively says that there is a right way for employers to deal with employees. The clause tackles this as it should. We should make it known to employers that we shall publish a code of practice, and that employees will be able to go to them and say, ``There is a code of practice here, boss, but I don't think you are keeping to it. I might decide to walk out and go to an industrial tribunal to say that, because you haven't kept to the spirit of the code, I have been constructively dismissed.'' That sort of practice gets us out of the nit-picking regulations which require people to have a law degree, a degree in industrial relations&#151;perhaps even a Ph.D&#151;to enable them to understand what, as employers, they are supposed to do to abide by the letter of the law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I agree that on the face of it, clause 19 seems perfectly unobjectionable. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset, as an experienced parliamentarian, can guide me because I am a little puzzled. Given that the purport of the clause is unobjectionable, why does line 1 state that the Secretary of State may issue codes of practice? Why not ``will''&#151;the word that my hon. Friend substituted for ``may'' when describing the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> That shows that my hon. Friend is reading the clause to the letter. I am upset that the word is ``will'' rather than ``may''. I understand that we do not want the Secretary of State to be prosecuted&#151;well, some of us might&#151;so we give him a permissive power. I assume, and take on trust&#151;I am not sure that I should, but I do because of the charming way in which the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry dealt with the clauses&#151;that he will use the powers that Parliament gives him and introduce the provision. That surely is the right way to deal wth problems in the workplace. We suggest to employers that there is a right way to go about things and that the statute book already enshrines clear remedies that people can use for unfair dismissal. Perhaps we could have saved ourselves a great deal of time if a similar type of clause for all the issues for which the Secretary of State might introduce codes of practice had been dealt with in that way. We might have been doing other constitutency work instead of going through the clause line by line on account of our concern that, if we make criminals of employers, they will not be quite so keen to employ people. We are united in wanting to enable people to be employed, and under sensible conditions.

<P>

<B>Charlotte Atkins </B>(Staffordshire, Moorlands): I support the clause, and the idea of codes of practice. Consultation will ensure that we examine and demonstrate our best practice. We will demonstrate that part-time workers deserve dignity, rights and access to both holiday pay and sick pay. They should not be treated as second-class employees.
<P>
Most people are happy to work part-time, but they should not be exploited simply because it fits in with domestic, caring or other arrangements. I believe that there should be a level playing field for full-time and part-time work so that the economy can find the most efficient distribution between them. There should not be a second tier that is rewarded less well. No economic good can come out of making part-time workers a cheap alternative to full-time workers. The code will demonstrate that the world of work is changing and that the nine-to-five, Monday-to-Friday generation is passing. The future of work will be much more about a flexible labour force and part-time workers.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I have listened respectfully to the hon. Lady, but given that she believes that the codes of practice will give formidable benefits to workers and companies, can she&#151;I am sure that she is close to the Minister&#151;enlighten me on why the clause says that the Secretary of State ``may''&#151;not will&#151;``issue codes of practice''? It is a simple question to which there must be a simple answer.
<P>
<B>Charlotte Atkins:</B> The simple answer is that the clause predicts that he may issue codes of practice; I am sure that he will do so, because that is the sensible way forward that the Government are adopting.
<P>
The number of people in part-time work has doubled over the past 25 years and increased in every area of the economy. It is beyond belief that Opposition Members think&#151;as they seem to&#151;that part-time workers do not care as much about their careers or their futures as full-time workers. Part-time workers should be able to fulfil their potential as much as full-time workers, but that is difficult because part-time workers often do not have the access to training and management development that many full-time workers enjoy. Part-timers are increasingly seen as disposable, so companies do not invest in their skills. That is a huge waste of human potential, especially as 80 per cent. of part-time workers are women. Women have a great potential in the work force&#151;particularly since girls are doing so well at school, tremendously outperforming boys&#151;but it is not being fully exploited.
<P>
I would like equal rights for part-time workers because many more people would then take up part-time work. People would move between full-time and part-time work and back again at different stages of their lives, which would create a society in which people could broaden their choice between working and engaging in other activities. I fear that society is increasingly divided between families that are work-rich and income-rich, but leisure-poor, such as those consisting of two parents who are working full-time&#151;working all the hours that they can, in fact&#151;and the unemployed, perhaps single parents or couples with children, who are leisure-rich but income-very-poor. Neither side of that divide is ideal. Both situations have devastating impacts on family life and both would be helped by the availability of part-time work, which would afford all types of families relief and ensure that the family receives the attention that it deserves.
<P>
Increasing the availability of part-time work would involve additional costs, but they would be offset by increased productivity and job security. Part-time workers frequently see their position as insecure and do not invest in the future by increasing their skills, taking extra courses or giving up their time to develop their skills. They do not expect the employer to assist them with doing so. The codes of practice should explore the development of part-time work, not least because increased part-time working would save the state money. Instead of subsidising sweatshop employers&#151;interested only in employing people on the cheap&#151;we would enable more and better part-time jobs to be created. Instead of seeing poorly-paid, poorly-skilled staff doing part-time jobs, the work force would be motivated and people could choose to work part-time for part of their lives. They could switch between part-time and full-time work without being concerned about the loss of seniority or poorer conditions of work. I certainly support the clause and look forward to promoting best practice in part-time work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Opposition have absolutely no interest in treating part-time employees as having no merit or as second-class citizens. That has not been in the nature of the amendments that we have moved. If she thought that that was so, I am sorry, but it was certainly not our intention. In many circumstances, they are admirable employees of great value&#151;possibly even disproportionate value&#151;to their firms, and good employers will recognise that. The issue is how best to deliver the policy.
<P>
I do not dissent from many of the admirable sentiments that the hon. Lady has expressed, nor from those which have been expressed previously. My hon. Friend the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) made a speech that could be encapsulated in Winston Churchill's famous one-liner, ``To jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war.'' Of course, it is much better that people should talk to one another and raise grievances as early as possible and in the least intrusive and offensive manner possible, and that grievances should be resolved before they escalate into major disputes. Any code of practice that smoothes out the areas of disagreement, expresses good practice and encourages both sides of industry to take their responsibilities seriously at both organisational and individual level is welcome.
<P>
My comments on the clause fall into two categories. If I may, I shall make one brief comment on clause 20&#151;the supplemental clause. I ask the Minister to say a little more about Government thinking on the dissemination of codes of practice. I am talking about not only their formulation but how widely they will be available. Will they be available on the internet? Will they be distributed widely in the workplace? What will the cost of the exercise be? I ask those questions in no querolous sense; it is important to think about how such things can be done most effectively.
<P>
I shall register only one note of slight dissent. For all the Government's efforts, what has happened under the working time directive and the national minimum wage regulations has clearly not yet been exemplary. We need to inform everyone so that they understand where they are in advance.
<P>
My second comment relates to formulation of the codes. We have already referred to the fact that it has been said explicitly that consultation with the social partners will be required. I have no problems with that. To save time on the supplemental clause, I want to make the point that it states that the Secretary of State shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consider any representations made to him''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that he will be able to publish at least a summary of those representations, which is normal Government practice, rather than simply keeping them to himself and making his own judgment.
<P>
The scope of the clause presents slightly more of a problem. The CBI, which is broadly in tune with the proposals, expresses a note of reservation&#151;I put it no higher than that. It says that clause 19(1)(c) is extremely wide, as it requires guidance on
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the flexible organisation of working time taking into account the needs of workers and employees''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could include all aspects of working time, including annual hours arrangements and shift working, as well as the part-time issue itself. The CBI has a point. Others have suggested that it may be sensible functionally to produce the code on the main issues and to provide separate guidance notes, not with the same status as the code, on issues of concern, perhaps for particular industries with certain customs and practices. I am not asking the Minister for a definitive ruling on the issue, but he may like to consider it.
<P>
I come now to the point that has been troubling me all day and to which I do not know the answer. There have been occasional references to job sharing. I am not clear whether a jobshare is one job that is divided into two, or two persons working part-time to make up one job. The guidance code may also wish to clarify that. Given that job sharing is a growing practice and potentially very valuable and helpful, we must encourage it and not seek artificially to restrict it.
<P>
It is a good idea to have codes; it is a good idea to talk about the common objectives of the Committee. I commend the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The clause that we have just debated deals with statutory requirements for the protection of part-time workers and clause 19 provides the other half of the equation. Its aim is to encourage good practice in the workplace and I assure the hon. Member for Daventry that we shall disseminate it as widely as possible, including on the internet. As he is aware, we have a target of 1 million businesses being signed up to the internet by 2002.
<P>
The code of practice envisaged in the clause is a necessary and useful complement. It is part of our aim to change the culture of the workplace and to promote part-time work as an important element in the flexible organisation of working time, as my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) said. The development of voluntary part-time working will have benefits for employers and employees alike.
<P>
Some of the main issues that must be considered in the promotion of part-time work are set out in the part-time work directive, although it does not specify any solutions. For example, clause 5 of the framework agreement sets out some of the situations that employers should take into consideration when dealing with part-time workers. A code of practice will enable us to fulfil our obligations under the directive without placing unnecessary restrictions on employers.
<P>
Members of the Committee will be aware that existing codes of practice deal with other areas of discrimination, such as disability. Employers as well as employees have welcomed them as important aids in helping to ensure that they meet the requirements of the law and in providing advice on good practice. Similarly, the code of practice on part-time work should give guidance on how companies and workers can get the most out of flexible working. It will also clarify employers' responsibilities under the regulations and give recommended methods for meeting the more exhortatory of the directive's provisions. It will not have to restrict itself to the directive though, and it will be able to give guidance on problems that might arise, which are not covered in the directive.
<P>
However, it is important that the code provides maximum flexibility to take account of circumstances peculiar to specific sectors or firms. Our current view is that it could usefully cover how collective or work-force agreements might do that. As with other codes of practice, the code will not in itself be legally binding, although it will be possible to refer to the code in a tribunal case when that is relevant. Firms will be able to use the code as a guide to establishing their own procedures, but they will also be able to take account of their own circumstances to work out what is best for them and their workers.
<P>
The Government intend to consult widely when drawing up the code. That will mean that organisations and those people who will be most directly affected by it, who already have experience in that sector and who will be using the code, will be able to shape its contents. That will make it widely acceptable and ensure that it properly represents current best practice. That is essential if the code is to be respected and if it is to achieve its aim of a long-term change in the culture of attitudes towards part-time work, which we all want to achieve.
<P>
We hope to issue the draft code at the same time as we consult on the regulations, so that the two can be seen side by side. That will enable us to achieve the right balance between matters that properly need to be made binding by regulation and those that are best suited to be incorporated in a code of practice.
<P>
I think that everyone agrees that the code of practice will be a useful tool for employers, and that it will encourage those who may not have considered part-time work to see that a flexible approach could benefit them as well as their employees. I hope that hon. Members will support clause. 19.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I wish to advise the Committee that the code of practice to be made under clause 20 will, as the Bill is presently drafted, be made by negative resolution. We shall table an amendment to make that an affirmative resolution, on the principles set out in the previous debate. Hon. Members will appropriately be able to debate what will be a new form of code of practice in employment law.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister, as always, is helpful. We now have all that on the record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I rose previously to congratulate Ministers for putting the explanatory notes in a format that showed how the Bill would look. While trying to write some amendments to clause 28, I noticed that on page 60 of the explanatory notes we are supposed to see how clause 5 will read. Clause 5 has had added to it the words from the Bill from subsection (3) on page 15, but those words have not been added to the explanatory notes. I know, Mrs. Dunwoody, that you are not able to do anything about that now, but I know also that the Minister will have heard my words, and I hope that he will produce an amended version of the explanatory notes so that we can read it properly when we come to that point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, it is not a matter for the Chair. Indeed, when I first entered the House, nothing quite so helpful as notes on clauses was ever provided. One had to be a Minister of the Crown to obtain notes that explained what Members were supposed to be debating. Of course, we were made of sterner stuff. I thank him for raising the matter. I am sure that he will have been heard.
<H4><center>Clause 21</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to confer rights on individuals</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I thank the Minister for that helpful concession.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Is the hon. Gentleman still talking to the point of order, or does he intend to move the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 113, in page 13, line 5, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, but only insofar as the individual is a worker within the meaning of section 14.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 115, in page 13, line 9, leave out `workers' contracts or'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I did not take part in that vignette, helpful though the point of order was. I shall say no more about it, nor do I wish to detain the Committee.
<P>
In speaking to the two amendments, I seek to draw out Ministers' thinking on clause 21. We see in the Bill a tendency that we noticed in the National Minimum Wage Bill; it extends the interpretation of the word ``employee'' rather more widely to cover a group of differing persons, who may be regarded as employees and may in certain cases be called workers&#151;even, as my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham said sotto voce, when they are not. Those people are clearly working and may be under the instructions of another, and their working arrangements may be very much like employment but without a contract; however, they are not employees.
<P>
The explanatory notes are quite helpful as they list some of the considerations that may apply, and those considerations are germane to our debate. I note particularly the reference to the clergy. Although it is probably not appropriate to talk at length about the position of the clergy, particularly with these rather narrow amendments, I have to say that I have some anxieties about it. For the purposes of employment law, the clergy are treated as office holders under God, rather than employees. Given that many have lost the parson's freehold, they are subject to the orders of others without necessarily enjoying the associated employment rights. That is, perhaps, a matter for another occasion; I flag it up merely as an example.
<P>
I understand that the Government want some order and consistency. In fairness, they propose to take an order-making power and, therefore, in due course to expose those regulations for our consideration. That may be the best way to proceed, given that it is a difficult area.
<P>
Amendment No. 113 is designed to confine the definition of ``worker'' beyond the employment relationship to include the list in clause 14, which we debated some time ago, but no further. That seems a reasonable list, and if Ministers are minded to go further, they should explain why.
<P>
On amendment No. 115, a concept exists, about which I do not know much&#151;I am not sure that even if I were a lawyer I would know much about it&#151;that refers to persons as parties to workers' contracts or to contracts of employment. I know what a contract of employment is, but I am not sure that I know what a workers' contract is. As I showed with the example of the clergy, the problem is that no workers' contract exists, at least on earth. It is precisely because of such anomalies that Ministers are trying to find a common definition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I have no desire to lead my hon. Friend astray, but it is important to be clear about the categories of worker with which the amendments deal. Is he aware that only a matter of a week, or at most, two weeks, ago, the hon. Member for Middlesbrough (Mr. Bell), representing the Church Commissioners, assured me that the clergy would be treated equally to everyone else for the purposes of the Bill? His understanding seemed to be that they were regarded as employees for its purposes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This is an extremely interesting and, if I may say so, rather gob-smacking observation, of which I was not previously aware. Those of us who survived deliberations on the National Minimum Wage Bill will recall that at an extremely late hour&#151;approximately 12 noon&#151;in this very Room, I produced Harvey on employment law, which made it clear that the clergy were not employed but were office-holders under God. The Minister may have something to say about that today. My inclination was not to debate it today, but perhaps to return to it at a later stage. Without going into detail, I am making one or two further inquiries myself, sight unseen of the Second Church Estates Commissioner's remarks, which I am grateful to my hon. Friend for having reported to the Committee.
<P>
However, the point can be used helpfully as an example of a wider point. Some relationships go beyond the simple contract of employment, and are acknowledged in clause 21 and in the explanatory notes as the sort of matters that the Government are tackling&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentlemen accept that the clergy are employed not by God but by the Church, and are officers of the Church?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have greatest respect for the good Lord. I hope that he will not be too intimately involved in our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is not for me to decide the nature of the employment relationship, but it has not hitherto been the practice of the British courts to treat the clergy as employed persons. That gives rise to certain implications that we may wish to debate another time. The clergy are merely an example of a number of such cases. The fact that they are exceptional is acknowledged by the fact that they are singled out for mention in the explanatory note.
<P>
I do not necessarily suggest that it is improper to expand the concept beyond the narrow employment relationship to some related circumstances, one of which has just been mentioned. It is important for Ministers to be clear about where they are going and where they intend to take the process. We are concerned, for example, about the potential to trespass on genuine arrangements of self-employment that are conceptually different.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will accept that these are probing amendments on the nature of the expansion of that relationship, which we are seeking to define and confine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Hope (Corby):</B> Clause 21 is long overdue and will be welcomed by thousands&#151;perhaps hundreds of thousands&#151;of casual and temporary workers. I urge the Minister to resist the two Opposition amendments.
<P>
Clause 21 gives power to the Secretary of State to confer employment rights on individuals, and it will remove the many inconsistences and uncertainties, to which the hon. Member for Daventry alluded, about who is protected by employment rights. It will allow the Government to take action to clarify those employment rights and will ensure that the law reflects the considerable diversity of working relationships in our modern labour market.
<P>
We know from our surgeries that too many people are in contracts that can best be described as bogus self-employment. Significant numbers of economically active individuals, such as agency and home workers, are either uncertain about whether they qualify for employment rights or fail to qualify for most, if not all, employment rights. In Corby, and elsewhere, that has led to a two-tier work force. Many enjoy employment rights, but rather too many do not, including a growing number of young people who are starting work for the first time and who are the most vulnerable to abuse.
<P>
The position is wholly unsatisfactory on two counts, which is why we must resist the amendments. The insecurity and uncertainty of people who do not understand employment rights are a barrier to labour market flexibility. It is the fear of not being sure about what someone's job might entail, the contract that he might have, or the rights that he might be qualified to enjoy that prevents employees from moving freely between jobs and into different working relationships.
<P>
Why should the protection afforded by employment rights legislation be denied to workers who are economically dependent on a work provider? Why should unscrupulous employers and agencies be allowed to drive a coach and horses through the protection rights that are afforded to other workers?
<P>
Clause 21, as it stands, is important. I affirm the point made by the hon. Member for Daventry before we all get the wrong end of the stick. It is intended that the new powers will not be extended to the genuinely self-employed. The clause deals with the grey zone that has grown up over the past 20 years. It is intended to extend employment rights and to stop current and further abuses. There will not be changes to the circumstances of those who are genuinely self-employed.
<P>
I urge the Government to resist the amendments because they would deny employment rights to many people and limit the option at a later state for the Government to extend rights to categories of workers such as members of the clergy, if the outcome of consultation was that that was the right way forward. Indeed, if accepted, the amendments would restrict the option of extending these employment rights not just to the clergy but to registration officers, share fishermen, merchant seamen, members of the armed forces and police officers. We do not want to restrict that option.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked a few moments ago, and it was a rhetorical question, why anyone should be denied the rights that the clause intends to provide. Does he believe that the clause regards members of the clergy as employees? If he does not, but believes that they should be protected, why does he hide behind the veil of future consultation? Why has he not tabled an amendment concretely to ensure that members of the clergy are afforded the protection that he believes they need and deserve?
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hope:</B> The hon. Gentleman obviously has not read the clause. The clause is about allowing the Government the opportunity to confer individual rights following the widest consultation, which will include a range of people. It is the widest consultation and it will be a crucial part of the process that the Government enter into.
<P>
In effect, the amendents would perpetuate an iniquitous two-tier system of individual rights to work. There would be one set of rights for one category of people and no rights for the rest. Hundreds of thousands of people who deserve protection would continue to be unprotected. We must resist the amendments to ensure that all workers, other than the genuinely self-employed, enjoy the minimum standards of protection that the legislation is intended to provide.
<P>
Finally, I urge the Government to consult widely on the details of the changes to make sure that we get it right, something that the Conservatives failed to do on a range of legislative changes that they made in government. The powers in clause 21 will give so many people the protection of employment rights that the Conservatives denied them for too many years and would continue to deny them were the amendments accepted today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I understand the concerns that have given rise to these amendments, but I hope that I can allay them by giving the Committee an unqualified assurance that the Government have no intention of using the new power introduced in clause 21 to extend employment rights to individuals who are genuinely self-employed or who are excluded from their coverage for perfectly sound or logical reasons.
<P>
The definition of ``worker'' in clause 14 may well serve as an appropriate basis for extending the coverage of other rights where that is at present unduly restricted. However, I am unable to accept amendment No. 113 as it would have a number of undesirable consequences. First, it would place too great a restriction on the flexibility of the new order-making power. While the Government certainly want to rationalise the coverage of employment rights as far as possible, we also recognise that it may still sometimes be appropriate for different definitions of ``worker'' to be used for different purposes, depending on the substance of the right in question.
<P>
Secondly, if the amendment were accepted, certain categories of individuals who are currently excluded, either implicitly or explicitly, from the coverage of particular employment rights&#151;including, for example, members of the clergy, registration officers, share fishermen, merchant seamen, members of the armed forces and police officers&#151;could not have those rights extended to them under the new power. In saying that, I do not suggest that the Government would necessarily wish to use the power for any of those purposes. That will depend on all the relevant policy considerations in each particular case, and on the&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> No. I am sure that I am about to enlighten the hon. Gentleman. If I do not, I will give way. The action that we take will depend on the relevant policy considerations in each case and on the responses that we receive in due course when we consult publicly on the uses to which the new power should be put. However, we certainly want it to be broad enough to encompass such groups of individuals in priniciple.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I know that the Minister will confirm that the hon. Member of Corby (Mr. Hope) has not even read the clause because it makes no reference whatever to consultation. He will no doubt better advise himself later.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that the principle of equity is not based merely&#151;or even substantially&#151;on a head count, but on the concept of rectitude and fairness? Does he believe, irrespective of future representations, that clause 21 should apply in principle to members of the clergy&#151;yes or no?
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am always fascinated by the hon. Gentleman's philosophical excursions&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> It is a simple question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I will resist the temptation to engage with him in a philosophical debate. What we are trying to achieve is perfectly clear. We are taking on a new order-making power and we will consult publicly about the uses to which it should be put. I hope that that is clear even to him.
<P>
Finally, we do not wish&#151;if the hon. Member for Buckingham would pay attention, he might be interested to hear this&#151;to prejudge the outcome of the public consultation exercise. My hon. Friend the Minister of State set the tone for these discussions by being remarkably accommodating and open and I am going to continue in the same way. We do not wish to prejudge the outcome of consultation by adopting at the outset one particular definition of worker as the model to be used in all cases, which would be the practical effect of the amendment.
<P>
Similar issues are raised by amendment No. 115, and for similar reasons, I cannot accept it. The effect of the amendment would be to prevent us from extending employment rights that rely on the concept of workers' contracts to categories of individuals who may not currently count as workers for those particular purposes.
<P>
The rights in question include, in particular, the right not to have unlawful deductions made from wages, rights under the working time regulations and rights under clause 14 of this Bill. The types of individuals who may not count as workers include members of the clergy, registration officers, share fishermen, merchant seamen.
<P>
I should stress again that the Government have as yet taken no firm policy decision to extend any or all of those rights to any or all of those categories of individuals. We certainly believe that no one should be denied the protection of employment rights without good reason, but we need to take into account all relevant policy considerations in each case&#151;and, of course, all responses to the public consultation document that we are committed to publishing.
<P>
Clearly, though, it is important that the new order-making power should be flexible enough to enable us to extend such rights to such individuals if all concerned agree that it would be sensible to do so. Amendment No. 115 would create a significant obstacle to achieving that.
<P>
In addition to the full public consultation to which I have already said that we are committed, I should remind the Committee that the power in the clause will be subject to affirmative procedure, giving full opportunity for scrutiny and debate. I hope that, in view of the explanation and assurances that I have given, the hon. Member for Daventry will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> First, I shall deal with the remarks of the hon. Member for Corby by saying that I felt&#151;and not for the first time&#151;that he produced a travesty of the Opposition's case. There is no need to interpret our probing amendments as likely to deprive up to 500,000 people of long-sought employment rights. We are not trying to do that. Our amendments are intended to smoke out the fact&#151;and the Minister with his welcome bedside manner has effectively confirmed it&#151;that the Government have no settled policy but are going to consult on what that policy should be and on which persons should be included. It seems that the hon. Member for Corby, myself and others will have an opportunity to have an input and I hope that we do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> My hon. Friend should correct for the record what the hon. Member for Corby said about people who are employed through employment agencies being able to break their conditions of employment. It is known, as I am sure that the Minister accepts, that people on temporary contracts through employment agencies have more rights than those who are employed on temporary contracts with full-time employers. The travesty that the hon. Member for Corby continues to repeat is not correct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I found those exchanges interesting and we shall have an opportunity to return to them on clause 28.
<P>
We have established that the Government seek an order-making power, which will be preceded by consultation and a document giving some indication of what they want, which they will then bring back to us for consideration. That is not perfect because we have some genuine concerns of principle. They are enshrined in the amendments, which suggest that Secretary of State should not have an unlimited order-making power allowing him to decide that x, y and z are employees and that they can be covered by an order. I agree that if that were the case, the Government would say that they must act reasonably and that such decisions will be subject to judicial review, but the provision offers the Secretary of State an open cheque book to define a worker in any way he wishes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the previous intervention illustrated that the law is an inconsistent shambles? The clause attempts to apply the law more equally in a wider field. The Government's strategy is to move forward gently, consulting as they go, with the clear intention of providing basic rights for almost everyone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I do not think that I would have used the words which the hon. Gentleman used, nor those in the explanatory notes. It is clear that commercial practice and the requirements of individuals and their employers&#151;to use a shorthand term&#151;have changed over the years. Anomalies have developed and if the Government could make a judgment of Solomon to resolve them in a single definition, I would welcome it. I am simply saying that there is no point starting from the assumption that the whole matter is loaded against the individual or that it is a shambles and then importing a definition that is more offensive or unrealistic than that which it would replace. That is my concern about workers' contracts.
<P>
The purpose of the lead amendment is to minimise the number of separate definitions. The Minister argued&#151;I understand why he did so&#151;that he might need different definitions for different purposes. It is no part of my purpose to promote inequity or withdrawal of rights when there is a good reason for a difference. If we could have a common format stating who is covered by employment rights, as in clause 14, at least we would have a common basis and fewer opportunities for confusion or dispute.
<P>
I shall not go to the stake on that. Our debates have been interesting in drawing out the tensions and obtaining some assurances from the Government on how they will deal with the matter. I am a little concerned that their minds are so obviously not made up that we do not even know what they might be considering, but that is far better than having loaded the course in advance.

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman want those rights to be extended to the police? Clause 14 covers that and I presume that the amendment would exclude the police from having such rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The whole point is that we need to discuss the reasons for including or excluding anyone. The Government have said that they want to do that and I am content with the procedure that the Minister has now set out. I accept what he said in principle and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
