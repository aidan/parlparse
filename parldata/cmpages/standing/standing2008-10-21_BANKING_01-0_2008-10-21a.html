Chairman:</b> Before we begin, I have a few preliminary
announcements. Members may, if they wish, remove their jackets during
Committee meetings. Will all Members please ensure that all mobile
phones, pagers and other electronic devices are turned off or on to
silent mode? If something goes off while on silent mode, I ask Members
to switch it off or, if they are going to answer it, to leave the
Committee
Room.</div><a name="08102132000007"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a money resolution and a Ways and Means resolution in connection
with the Bill, and copies are available in the room. I remind hon.
Members to give adequate notice of amendments. As a general rule, my
fellow Chairmen and I do not intend to call starred amendments,
including any starred amendments that may be reached during an
afternoon sitting of the
Committee.</div><a name="08102132000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
the Committee will consider the programme motion on the amendment
paper, for which debate is limited to half an hour. We will then
proceed to a motion to report written evidence, and then to a motion to
permit the Committee to deliberate in private in advance of the oral
evidence sessions. I hope that we can deal with that
formally.</div><a name="08102132000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">Assuming
that the second motion is agreed to, the Committee will move into
private session. Once the Committee has deliberated, the witnesses and
members of the public will be invited back into the room and our oral
evidence session will commence. If the Committee agrees to the
programme motion, it will hear oral evidence this morning and this
afternoon. From Thursday, we will revert to the familiar process of
clause-by-clause scrutiny of the
Bill.</div><a name="08102132000010"></a>

you for your helpful guidance, Mr. Hood. It is a pleasure to
see you presiding over us today. I am sure that all members of the
Committee will benefit from your guidance, and that of Mr.
Gale, as we proceed through the scrutiny stages of the Bill. We had an
encouraging Second Reading, which reflected the widespread support, on
both sides of the House, for the principles and much of the content of
the Bill. However, I appreciate that there are issues of detail that
deserve full consideration, and I look forward to addressing those in
Committee.</div><a name="08102132000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
14 October, the House agreed a programme motion that provides for the
Committee&#146;s proceedings to conclude on 18 November. On 16
October the Programming Sub-Committee agreed a programme resolution for
the Committee. The resolution provides for oral evidence to be
presented in two sittings today. It also provides for discussions of
the Bill to take parts 4 to 7 first, minus clause 157, which relates to
part 1. We will then take parts 1 to 3&#151;that is, clauses 1 to 154
plus 157; and then part 8&#151;that is, clause 234 to clause 240,
plus any new clauses and schedules.</div>
<a name="08102132000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
explained at Second Reading, the ordering is primarily to provide
additional time to bring forward drafts of some of the key documents,
including the code of practice for the special resolution regime,
required under clause 5. I hope that hon. Members find the arrangements
set out in the resolution satisfactory.</div>
<a name="08102132000014"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08102132000394"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): I welcome you to the Chair,
Mr. Hood. We look forward to working under your
chairmanship, and that of Mr. Gale and, for a brief spell,
Mr. Illsley.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 3</div><a name="08102132000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister said in his opening remarks, there was broad support for the
Bill at Second Reading. There was also a commitment, on our part, to
ensure that the Bill has a smooth passage through the House and the
other place, to enable it to reach the statute book before the Banking
(Special Provisions) Act 2008 expires in February 2009. We are grateful
to the Minister for arranging the reordering of the consideration of
the Bill, because we believe it is important that there is time to
study the draft code of practice and the principal regulations
underlying this Bill prior to the debate on part 1. It would be helpful
if the Minister were to indicate when he expects the draft code and
regulations to be published, because that would clearly impact on the
speed of consideration in Committee.</div>
<a name="08102132000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite the
broad support for the Bill, there are areas that we will want to probe
in detail between now and 18 November. I am sure we can do that and
ensure proper scrutiny of the
Bill.</div><a name="08102132000017"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08102132000395"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): Some members of the Committee
might be disappointed that the Liberal Democrats are not represented by
the sage of Twickenham on this occasion. We will be led by my hon.
Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) who is
unfortunately out of the country at the moment. He has appreciable
experience of both retail and investment banking. We have no objection
to or difficulty with the programme motion as this is an important and
highly technical bit of legislation.</div>
<a name="08102132000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
representations made by the banking industry and others recommend a
holistic approach. People are concerned about what may be caught up in
the code of practice or secondary legislation. I welcome the
Minister&#146;s assurances that as much as possible will be put
before the Committee during its deliberations and as much inkling as
possible will be given about the future secondary legislation that
follows in its wake.</div>

Pearson:</b></i> I should like to make a brief introductory
statement. The Banking Bill to be scrutinised by the Committee is being
brought forward during challenging times for financial markets and
economies across the world. The Bill is one important part of a package
of action and reform to improve the UK system for ensuring financial
stability and protecting depositors. I am encouraged that the Bill
received cross-party support on Second Reading. It was disappointing
that the Leader of the official Opposition seemed to go back on that in
his speech to the City on Friday, which showed a complete lack of
judgment and sought to play party politics rather than act in the
national
interest.</div><a name="08102132000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08102132000398"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Chairman:</b> Order. Carry on,
Minister.</div><a name="08102132000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> The measures in the Bill are designed to
form a permanent reform of the UK framework. I want to emphasise that
it is the result of a comprehensive process of consultation, which we
could discuss in more detail, including three consultation
documentations issued jointly by the Treasury, the Bank and the
Financial Services Authority. We have consulted with key industry
players and experts, many of whom we shall hear from later today. We
have had valuable input from the House&#146;s Select Committee on the
Treasury. We want to get the reforms
right.</div><a name="08102132000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
say from the outset that the measures in the Bill represent a
proportionate and sound package for reform. However, we shall go into
Committee with an open and consultative frame of mind. The Government
have made the correct decision in taking the past few months to develop
the legislative package, including publishing some of the key clauses
in draft, for public debate and scrutiny over the summer. The Bill will
provide a sound enhancement to the framework for financial stability
and depositor protection. I am happy to take questions on any aspect of
the
Bill.</div><a name="08102132000033"></a>

the questions should be limited to matters in the scope of the Bill. To
assist me and the Committee, both questions and answers should be brief
and succinct&#151;then we shall get more questions and
answers.</div><a name="08102132000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
1</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000401"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> How did the Minister seek to reassure stakeholders
in the Bill? How have issues around creditor rights and so on been
dealt with, given the pressure to ensure that the Bill is passed
quickly but also that legitimate concerns are being answered? How has
the Minister sought to reassure interest
groups?</div><a name="08102132000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I want to make two points in response, the
first on consultation generally and the second specifically on creditor
rights. As I indicated, there has been extensive public consultation:
three rounds of formal public consultation, a number of stakeholder
workshops and meetings in February, July and August 2008 and the
publication of draft clauses for the most complex part of the
Bill&#151;the special resolution regime. During those consultations,
we had more than 200 responses from a mixture of stakeholders,
including banks, building societies, insurers and bodies representing
citizens, consumers, workers, businesses, legal insurance professionals
and credit unions. I believe that the Bill has been consulted on
extensively.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div><a name="08102132000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
particular reference to creditors&#151;the hon. Member for Fareham
talked about them&#151;we have paid very close attention to
stakeholder feedback from the latest round of consultation. For
instance, in response to that feedback we have created in the Bill a
framework for a range of creditor safeguards to protect set-off and
netting arrangements and to protect creditors in the event of a partial
transfer. We will continue to engage extensively with stakeholders over
the coming

recognise that creditor rights is a very important issue, and that is
one of the reasons why I announced on 9 October the establishment of a
new expert liaison group to help to prepare the secondary legislation
for the special resolution regime. The Committee will be aware that a
number of the key elements of the safeguards will come in under
secondary legislation. The expert liaison group will be formed from
representatives of the banking sector, legal experts and members of the
authorities, and I have written to industry experts inviting them to
participate in the group. As I have said previously, I hope that we can
work effectively together to co-produce the secondary legislation that
will be required to ensure that we get it
right.</div><a name="08102132000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
2</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000402"></a>Mr.

draft
regulations?</div><a name="08102132000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> We hope to publish the draft code of
practice next Thursday, which should be in time for consideration in
this Committee the following week. As I have previously indicated, I
hope that we will be able to provide the detail in terms of the
principles that will guide the secondary legislation, but I do not
think that we will be at the stage with the expert liaison group of
having written that legislation. That would be premature, but we will
intend to make available all the key policy questions and principles
behind the
legislation.</div><a name="08102132000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
3</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000403"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> How will you ensure that those principles are made
available before the Committee gets to the relevant stage of the Bill?
It is important that there is proper parliamentary scrutiny in this
place as well as in the other place, and the earlier we have sight of
those principles the better informed the scrutiny
process.</div><a name="08102132000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>I will endeavour to get the
code published in draft and available by next Thursday, and we will do
our best to provide the principles sufficiently in advance of
discussing the clauses to which the secondary legislation will relate.
I want to emphasise that we see the expert liaison group as playing an
important role in helping us to define the secondary legislation, but
that that legislation will come before the House in due course and be
scrutinised in the usual thorough
way.</div><a name="08102132000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
4</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000404"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> If the Bill had been on the statute book earlier,
how would the Government&#146;s response to the banking crisis of the
past few months have been
different?</div><a name="08102132000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> The Chancellor has made it clear that the
Government and the authorities need to act generally across the system,
as well as having the tools to be able to intervene appropriately in
individual cases in order to preserve the financial stability of the
system. It is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>clear that we have been operating under the Act that we passed in
February of this year, but a lot of the actions that have taken place
have been in the spirit of this Banking
Bill.</div><a name="08102132000325"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">The
Bill provides both general and specific measures to enhance the
resilience of the UK financial system for the future, including powers
through the special resolution regime for the UK authorities to take
decisive action where individual banks are at serious risk of failing.
We have seen how that has happened. The Bill will provide a wide range
of permanent measures to strengthen the UK framework for financial
stability and for depositor protection. That is why it is important to
have the Bill on the statute book by the time the Banking (Special
Provisions) Act 2008
expires.</div><a name="08102132000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
5</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000405"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> So you believe that the Bill provides a framework
in which the actions that you took over recent months would
fit.</div><a name="08102132000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> Certainly, the actions taken over previous
months would be compatible with the framework that we have. It is a
permanent framework which improves and safeguards creditor
rights.</div>
<a name="08102132000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
6</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000406"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Clause 4 sets out the five objectives. Can the
Minister rank them in order of priority,
please?</div><a name="08102132000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I do not intend to do that. The five
statutory objectives set out in the legislation explain the purpose of
the regime. The SRR provides five tools as well, which can be used by
the authorities. The objectives provide guidance for the authorities,
Parliament and market participants, on how the special resolution
regime powers will be used. By putting the powers on the face of the
Bill we have ensured that Parliament can hold the authorities to
account if they believe that any action has, or has not, been taken in
accordance with the statutory objectives. You have to see the
objectives as a whole rather than say that one has more importance than
the other. They are all important.</div>
<a name="08102132000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102132000407"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Why is maximising the amount available for
distribution to creditors not an objective of the Bill in this
regime?</div><a name="08102132000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> The objectives are obviously high level and
concerned with ensuring the stability of the financial system and the
ability to take action. I would not want anything to be said that would
detract from the importance of maximising the amount available to
creditors in the event of default . But there are wider objectives, in
terms of stability of the financial system.</div>
<a name="08102132000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
7</b><a name="08102132000408"></a><b class="B">Sir
Peter Viggers</b> (Gosport) (Con): The Bill introduces a
concept of a bridge bank as a kind of intermediary. What is the
advantage of having such a bridge bank over ordinary
nationalisation?</div><a name="08102132000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> We believe that it is potentially an
important additional tool. The special resolution regime gives a number
of different options. There is the option of transfer through private
sector purchase, the option of the bridge bank, and the option of
temporary public ownership. We think that there are instances where it
might not be possible to transfer assets and property to private sector
purchasing, but it might be possible to make a transfer to a bridge
bank on a temporary basis, which could then be moved into the private
sector at a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>subsequent date. We think that it gives flexibility to be able to act in
the best interests of financial stability to deal with a situation
where there is a failing bank or building
society.</div>
<a name="08102132000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
8</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000409"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> The nearest analogue to the present
situation is Lloyd&#146;s of London in the 1990s, where toxic assets
were reinsured in a kind of spiral, so that nobody quite knew the value
of the assets. What Lloyd&#146;s did was to identify and isolate the
toxic assets. Did you think of using such a model?</div>
<a name="08102132000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> As I understand it, in many ways, what is
proposed in this legislation could allow that to happen. It is
certainly possible under this legislation to transfer some assets to a
bridge bank or through private sector purchase and to retain assets
that might be regarded as toxic in a residual company, which would then
be subject to the bank insolvency procedure in the legislation. I do
not know whether you would like to add anything to that,
Emil.</div>
<a name="08102132000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Emil
Levendoglu:</b></i> Just to say that in cases where assets
and liabilities had been left behind in the residual company, it would
be the bank administration in part 3 rather than the insolvency
procedure in part 2. The Minister is absolutely right to point out that
the partial transfer possibility allows for a split between good and
bad assets.</div>
<a name="08102132000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
9</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000410"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> The Bill seeks to reduce the impact on
depositors of a bank entering insolvency. Does that mean that the
interests of other creditors will be
disadvantaged?</div><a name="08102132000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> No, it does not. The Bill does not introduce
depositor preference and the statutory order of priority of creditors
remains unchanged. Any payments to depositors will be made by the
Financial Services Compensation Scheme rather than from the assets of
the failed
bank.</div><a name="08102132000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
10</b><a name="08102132000411"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): May I ask
about the bank administration procedure under the Bill? Why is it
necessary, and what is wrong with the existing
arrangements?</div><a name="08102132000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> We certainly believe that it is necessary,
and part of this answer goes to the last but one question about a
bridge bank. We see bank administration procedure as being used when
the stabilisation option being used is that of a partial transfer
generally to a bridge bank. After the partial transfer, the residual
bank is likely to be insolvent, and the bank administration procedure
is designed specifically to deal with the insolvent residual bank. It
will allow the insolvent residual bank to continue providing essential
services to the transferee. The administrator will have statutory
objectives to ensure the supply of essential services and facilities to
the private sector purchaser or to the bridge bank, and to rescue the
residual bank as a going concern or to wind up its affairs. It should
be seen as something that will operate at the same time as a partial
transfer either to a bridge bank or until a private sector purchase
takes
place.</div><a name="08102132000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
11</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000412"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Would the use of the administration procedure as
you describe it mean that jobs would be lost in the residual bank?
Would the administration procedure mean a running down of the residual
bank?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div><a name="08102132000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> It is not right to speculate in the
circumstances. In essence, we intend the bank administration procedure
to be used whenever an insolvent residual bank results from partial
transfer. In many ways, the regime adopted will be very similar to the
normal insolvency
regime.</div><a name="08102132000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
12</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000413"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> So you would not describe administration as a fire
sale of
assets?</div><a name="08102132000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> It is not right to say how the administrator
would want to pursue its duties. The administrator would certainly have
objectives for ensuring the supply of essential services and either
rescue it as an ongoing concern or wind up its affairs. It would
normally want to do that in the best possible way. If it can rescue the
bank, it will want to do that and, if it is to wind up its affairs, it
will want to do that in a responsible and appropriate
manner.</div><a name="08102132000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
13</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000414"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b><b class="B"> </b>If you had had the powers at the time of
Northern Rock, is it conceivable that you would have tried to address
Northern Rock in the way that you have described and use the
administration procedures?</div>
<a name="08102132000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> We made the judgments about Northern Rock at
the time and, without getting into party politics, they were not
necessarily supported by all political parties. We believed it right
that Northern Rock should enter into temporary public ownership. We
thought that that decision was in the best interests of all concerned,
and we remain of that view. As you will be aware, Northern Rock has
paid back more than half of the funding provided to it already and we
look to it to continue to do well in the
future.</div><a name="08102132000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
14</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000415"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The administration method that you describe sounds
similar to what has been done with Bradford &amp; Bingley. Will you say
whether that is a fair characterisation so we can understand that, in
practice, the Bradford &amp; Bingley model is similar to the
administration procedure set out in the Bill? Why did you adopt that
approach then, but not with Northern
Rock?</div><a name="08102132000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> The Bradford &amp; Bingley approach is
consistent with the approach in the legislation. It is not for me to
speculate about Bradford &amp; Bingley, or to explain it. I am here to
explain the Bill and what it will
do.</div>
<a name="08102132000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102132000416"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> It is just that it is helpful for us to understand
what it will look like in practice. You would not disagree with the
Bradford &amp; Bingley model, with a partial transfer to Abbey of the
deposit
holding?</div><a name="08102132000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I would certainly say that the approach
adopted in the Bradford &amp; Bingley case is completely consistent
with the legislation.</div>

are completely transparent, and not causing undue panic as a result of

stage where we believe we have got the general principles of the Bill
and the detail of the special resolution regime right, but a lot of the
operation of the special resolution regime will depend on secondary
legislation. We have been clear in the consultation documents to date
about the general principles of the SRR. We have noted
stakeholders&#146; concerns about it, and that is one of the reasons
why we set up the expert liaison group, so there is a great commitment
there to working in partnership with those who have interests in the
legislation. We want to be as open and transparent as possible, which
is one of the reasons why, during the Committee stage next Thursday, we

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102132000418"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> But you do recognise the anxiety there, that leaks
of one kind or another will create more problems than you originally
started
with?</div><a name="08102132000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102132000419"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> You do recognise the problem that if a degree of
transparency causes panic in the market, to some extent the special
resolution regime will not work as perfectly as it
might?</div><a name="08102132000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> Let me come on to that point. There is first
the point about getting the legislation right, and then how it will be
implemented if it is thought right to do so in the future. On that
latter secondary point, we have been clear in the legislation that it
is the responsibility of the Financial Services Authority to take the
decision to initiate the special resolution regime. It is the Bank of
England&#146;s responsibility to decide which tool to use, and its
implementation of that option must be presented to the markets in a
single step. I agree that any period of uncertainty surrounding these
processes could undermine the resolution of a failing bank. That is why
it is important that the authorities work closely together on this, and
why although there are clear roles and responsibilities&#151;and
rightly so&#151;there will be close working between the three
authorities.</div>
<a name="08102132000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
16</b><a name="08102132000420"></a><b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): I want to ask
some questions about the regime for depositor protection. To what
extent do you think that in setting up the enhanced scheme, the
Government have abandoned the idea of moral hazard and consumer
responsibility, by diversifying the risk across
investments?</div><a name="08102132000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I do not think that we should abandon the
principle of moral hazard, but the actions taken in the past to ensure
stability were right. As my hon. Friend will be aware, the FSA recently
increased the compensation limit to &#163;50,000. It is currently
consulting on reforms to the scheme. We have made it clear that the
Government will do whatever it takes to ensure that depositors have
confidence in their savings, and that is the right approach in the
current circumstances. However, you should not assume that, by saying
that, we have completely abandoned the concept of moral hazard, because
that would be the wrong thing to
do.</div><a name="08102132000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
17</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000421"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> When Mervyn King came to see us he said that a
scheme like this, if the banks were to pre-fund it, would amount to
tens of billions of pounds, which he called
&#147;non-negligible&#148;. Since then, to maintain confidence in
the banking system has cost more than 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>that&#151;it has been hundreds of billions. What modelling have you
done about how much would actually be needed for the scheme? What kind
of bank collapse would it be able to deal with? Could it deal with an
HBOS? What size of bank? When will you publish the draft
regulations&#151;there are some in clauses 155 onwards, but I mean
more detailed ones?</div>
<a name="08102132000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I will let Emil answer the question about
regulations, but I will say something about the broader approach. When
the Governor of the Bank of England came to speak to you, he did so in
slightly different times. Many of us have been living these events day
by day, and the unprecedented crisis that we saw in global financial
markets meant that we had to take unprecedented action, and rightly so.
That is why the Government have said that they will do whatever it
takes when it comes to deposits, and that is why we have seen the bank
capitalisation programme and the money going in to ensure liquidity and
support inter-bank lending. Many other countries have adopted that
approach across the world, and it has been the right one to try to
bring stability to the financial system.</div>
<a name="08102132000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
18</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000422"></a>Ms

deal with? How much money would you expect to be in the kitty, and
where would it come from?</div>
<a name="08102132000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> It is not helpful to talk about what size
collapse there might be&#151;that is not a place we want to go to.
Emil, did you want to say something about regulation?</div>
<a name="08102132000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Emil
Levendoglu:</b></i> Absolutely. As Ministers have made clear,
the power to pre-fund the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, in
part 4 of the Bill, is taken as a power to be used in the
future&#151;the medium to long term. This would not be the
appropriate time to introduce pre-funding, and there is no plan to
introduce draft regulations until a decision has been taken as to
whether to proceed with pre-funding. That will be at some point in the
future when market conditions have changed.</div>
<a name="08102132000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
19</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000423"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> What&#151;improved or got worse? That is a
serious question. If the decision is to be taken in the future, at what
point would that happen?</div>
<a name="08102132000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> Perhaps I can reply to that. The Government
will make a decision, in conjunction with the FSA and the Bank of
England, as to when the economic and financial circumstances might be
appropriate to make progress with pre-funding. As Emil said, we want to
make that decision before publishing
regulations.</div>
<a name="08102132000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
20</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000424"></a>Ms

funded?</div>
<a name="08102132000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian

21</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000425"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> May we go back to depositor protection and the
variations in it? When Northern Rock began to have difficulties, the
compensation scheme changed and went up to 90 per cent. It went up to
&#163;35,000. Recently, protection increased to &#163;50,000 and
now offshore depositors in failed Icelandic banks are told that they
are totally protected. Can you point to a genuine practical
compensation limit, or is it a case-by-case decision being made by the
Government?</div>

Pearson:</b></i> The Financial Services Authority has a
&#163;50,000 compensation limit. As you will be aware, it is
consulting on possible variations to that limit and that remains our
position. In the extraordinary circumstances that we were faced with,
we thought it right to say that the Government would do what it takes,
and to ensure that no retail depositors of Icelandic banks lost their
money. We still think that that was the right decision to ensure public
confidence in the banking system in the United
Kingdom.</div>

we are taking can get them back to work and get them lending the money

<a name="08102132000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously
there needs to be some global regulation. A lot of ordinary people feel
that there has almost been criminal negligence here. What can we do to
prevent these sorts of things happening in the future? We are seeing
large amounts of taxpayers&#146; money being used to prop up the
banking system. It must never be allowed to happen again. I appreciate
that we need to act quickly, but we also need to get some
responsibility back into the banking
system.</div><a name="08102132000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">:</b></i> I think there are a number of
different points. First, on what my hon. Friend calls the strike of
capitalism, which we tend to call inter-bank lending, the Government
have provided &#163;250 billion to support inter-bank lending. We
believe that we will make a difference and we are already seeing a
reduction in LIBOR rates. So there is an indication that this is
working. Clearly, the operation of this special resolution regime only
happens in exceptional circumstances. We hope that the legislation that
we will discuss in detail in due course will never have to be used, but
it is important to have that framework of legislation in place so that
we can take decisive action and give a framework of confidence to banks
and building societies as well for the
future.</div><a name="08102132000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other point that I would want to make is about the enhanced role that
we are giving to the Bank with regard to financial stability. We see
that as being an important part of the Bill. The Bank has always played
a role in financial stability, but the proposals in the Bill build on
what is done to date and provide it with a high-level statutory
responsibility for contributing to the maintenance of financial
stability. We see that as one of the ways in which we can say that we
have learnt lessons from recent events and are building a more robust
system for the future.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102132000429"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Just so there is no doubt, I think that the Treasury
team have been running around like a load of headless chickens. They
have been lurching from one set of goalposts to another. So I take a
slightly different view from the hon. Lady. May I refer the Minister to
the Banking Bill regulatory impact assessment? Paragraph 1.192 says in
big red
lettering:</div><a name="08102132000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Banking Bill will enable the FSA to collect information from firms that
the FSCS requires (and share this with the FSCS) before
default.&#148;</div><a name="08102132000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why?</div><a name="08102132000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> First of all, I should like to pay tribute
to Treasury, FSA and Bank of England staff for the actions they have
taken to ensure the stability of the UK financial system and to deal
with the crisis, which has not been of our manufacturing, but started
in the United
States.</div><a name="08102132000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102132000430"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> That is open to
debate.</div><a name="08102132000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> You say it is open to debate and I know that
your leader wants to airbrush out of history the facts of the sub-prime
crisis in the United States and that most countries across the world
are taking similar action to us because they are in similar situations
due to the combination of the credit crunch and high oil and food
prices. I do not think there is much debate. I think there is a very
small minority opinion that does not accept that there has been and is
a global financial crisis.</div>
<a name="08102132000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to what you say about the regulatory impact assessment, I refer you to
clause 162, which allows the FSA to make rules allowing it to obtain
information that the FSCS may require to carry out its work or prepare
for payment of compensation. The FSA is working with the industry to
establish how customer-level information can best be provided to the
FSCS and on what basis compensation is calculated. The FSA&#146;s
plan is to consult on new rules in due course and in line with its
statutory obligations. This will include a cost-benefit analysis of any
new rules. I think that that covers the point that you are
making.</div><a name="08102132000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
23</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000431"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Mr. Chairman, I think the Minister said
&#147;customer-level&#148; in that answer. I am trying to
understand why that customer information is wanted in advance of a
collapse. The nearest comparison I can think of is a collapse of a
travel firm where ABTA will, immediately after the collapse, get the
information about the customers who are travelling and then refund. Why
do you want customer-level information to go to a Government agency
before the
collapse?</div><a name="08102132000102"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> Perhaps I may ask Emil to
answer.</div><a name="08102132000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Emil
Levendoglu:</b></i> The FSCS will not necessarily require
customer-level information prior to collapse in order to take a view as
to what work is needed to prepare for payout. It may need to see the
sort of information held by the institution so that it can judge how
quickly it can prepare for payout in the event of the firm collapsing.
The point about customer-level information relates to the work around
ensuring that depositors get fast payout and the question of the single
customer view has come up in consultation and also in the Treasury
Committee&#146;s report. The question of how customer-level data are
provided in the event of a payout is one that the FSA
is  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>working on with the industry to work out the best possible solution. So
customer-level data may not be required prior to
default.</div><a name="08102132000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
24</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000432"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Finally, Mr. Chairman, we have already
touched on it but there is the matter of funding this compensation
scheme. I link it again to the travel industry, where the funding is
put up by the travel companies and paid into a fund so that it is there
for when a company collapses. It is very strange that we are treating
bankers with kid gloves and not making them contribute. Last year, one
of those banks made &#163;9 billion. Are we talking one thing for
bankers and another thing for other
companies?</div><a name="08102132000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I understand the point that the hon.
Gentleman is making. However, it remains our view that pre-funding at
this stage would not be appropriate. We do believe that in different
times there should be pre-funding&#151;we have said so on
record&#151;and it is why there are powers to do this in secondary
legislation. We do not think it right to go down that road at the
moment.</div><a name="08102132000106"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Emil
Levendoglu:</b></i> Of course, the industry does contribute
in the event of a deposit payout. In the current arrangements, it
contributes after the payout rather than before. It is not the case
that the industry does not contribute to the cost of
payout.</div><a name="08102132000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
25</b><a name="08102132000433"></a><b class="B">Mr.

enhance the stability of the financial systems of the United
Kingdom.&#148;</div>

more?</div><a name="08102132000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian

Committee that the Bill gives the Bank of England responsibility for
oversight of the payment system. The Bank of England also has
responsibility for taking action under the special resolution regime,

probing more on how we prevent getting into a situation in which the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
28</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000436"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> How is the Bank supposed to do
that?</div><a name="08102132000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> The Bank has always played a key role in
financial stability. In recent years, its court of directors has sought
to engage further with the Bank in overseeing such objectives and their
effectiveness. The Bill puts in additional responsibility for financial
stability. It is right 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div>for a new legislative objective to underpin that. This approach
recognises important differences between monetary policy and financial
stability, which we shall probably discuss in a moment. It allows the
Bank strategy to deal with changing market circumstances. We shall
obviously discuss with the Bank how it implements its enhanced
responsibilities.</div><a name="08102132000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
29</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000437"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Indeed, that is set down in the Bill. The strategy
is co-devised with the
Treasury.</div><a name="08102132000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
were comparisons on Second Reading to the Monetary Policy Committee,
which is an Executive committee&#151;it decides interest rates. The
Bill gives a committee the power to make recommendations, to give
advice in various areas and to monitor the activities of the Bank at
various points. It is not an Executive committee&#151;is that
right?</div><a name="08102132000118"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> There are a number of different potential
models. We see the financial stability committee as different from the
Monetary Policy Committee; it certainly does not have Executive powers
in the same way. That is not to say that there are not executives on
it; our proposals are for the financial stability committee to include
executives. Equally, we do not see the financial stability committee as
like a company&#146;s remuneration committee, which would consist
completely of non-executives. The Bill&#146;s hybrid approach, with
the committee having both independent members and executives on it, is
the right one. In many ways, the analogy is more with how Government
might run a Department or Cabinet Committee, rather than with a private
sector or Monetary Policy Committee
model.</div><a name="08102132000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
30</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000438"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Is there no difficulty having the effective chief
executive of the Bank chairing a committee to which the Bill gives the
power to monitor his activity? The Governor certainly has Executive
functions. Is there no conception of possible conflicts in that? I
would have thought that they were
obvious.</div><a name="08102132000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I do not
see&#151;</div><a name="08102132000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102132000439"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Even with the excellent Governor that we have.
Having a robust conversation about how the powers were exercised is not
the role of the committee. Its task is to monitor within the Bill. How
can it have that debate with the person or persons who carry out that
function actually chairing its
deliberations?</div><a name="08102132000122"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I do not see the conflicts that you suggest
are there. It is more a case of ensuring that we have robust debate
within the financial stability committee and that it has
responsibilities for contributing to the maintenance of financial
stability. It is a sub-committee of the court, and the accountability
mechanisms are through the court. I do not see a problem with it being
chaired by the Governor of the Bank of England. Indeed, there are many
strengths in ensuring that that takes
place.</div><a name="08102132000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
31</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000440"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> It is not entirely clear within the Bill whether it
does always report through the court. You may wish to reflect on the
precise wording of clause 216. There are elements when the court is
referred to and there is an obligation to report through it, but there
are others when it seems to communicate to whoever it feels so inclined
to do.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div><a name="08102132000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I will certainly take that point away and
see whether the legislation, as drafted, fits with our intention as the
Government. Undoubtedly, this is an issue that we can talk about when
it comes to scrutinising the
Bill.</div><a name="08102132000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
32</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000441"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Just to help the Committee, will the Minister look
at proposed subsection 2B(2)(a) of clause 216? It refers to a
recommendation through the court of directors, but the rest of the
clause appears to consign its thoughts into a vacuum of wherever it
thinks those functions should be best directed. Where did the idea of
the financial stability committee come from? The Select Committee
probed that, and no one put up their hand, said that it was their idea
and that they thought it was
great.</div><a name="08102132000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> With respect, my best answer is that it
emerged.</div><a name="08102132000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102132000442"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> A ghostly apparition in the room appeared above
someone&#146;s
head.</div><a name="08102132000128"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> It emerged. It now has a broad measure of
support.</div><a name="08102132000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
33</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000443"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Can the Minister define what he means by financial
stability? It is not defined in the
Bill.</div><a name="08102132000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> It is deliberately not defined in the Bill.
We see the concept of financial stability as being a high-level one. To
define exactly what you mean by that would get you into lots and lots
of
difficulties.</div><a name="08102132000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
34</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000444"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> But does that not make it rather difficult for the
Bank to fulfil the obligation if only a high-level concept is
undefined?</div><a name="08102132000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> The Bank is sophisticated enough to deal
with high-level concepts and to assess its responsibilities against
them
appropriately.</div><a name="08102132000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
35</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000445"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> But surely it should be made clear in the Bill,
which we shall scrutinise, to the wider public what the Bank&#146;s
remit in respect of financial stability is, rather than relying on the
Bank to know the meaning of financial stability, and for it perhaps to
emerge from some discussion. Should it not be in the
Bill?</div><a name="08102132000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I do not believe that a detailed definition
in the Bill would be helpful. That is a debate that we can hold when we
reach that part. Nor do I think that there any difficulties in the Bank
of England&#146;s interpreting its responsibilities when it comes to
financial stability. I am sure that you can ask it the
question.</div><a name="08102132000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102132000446"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am sure that I
will.</div><a name="08102132000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> Would you want a detailed definition of
financial stability on the face of the Bill so that you can be told how
to operate? I suspect that it would not find it helpful, but it is
undoubtedly a question that you can ask the
Bank.</div><a name="08102132000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
36</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000447"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> One of the criticisms levied at the tripartite
arrangements was the lack of clarity about who took the lead and who
took responsibility for certain issues. Does not leaving a broad
description of financial stability out of the Bill give rise to the
same sort of challenge in the future?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div><a name="08102132000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> No, I do not believe that it does. Overall,
the Bill is very clear about lines of responsibility and
accountability, whether it be the special resolution regime or the
enhanced statutory responsibility for financial stability that we are
giving the Bank of
England.</div><a name="08102132000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
37</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000448"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Governor himself, in his evidence to the
Treasury Committee, gave a definition of financial stability. Why have
you not incorporated that in the
Bill?</div><a name="08102132000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> As I said, perhaps you can ask the Governor
whether he believes very strongly that there should be a definition in
the Bill. We do not feel inclined to have one, and we think that there
are good reasons for not going into specific detail about what is meant
there. Undoubtedly, one of the purposes of these evidence sessions is
to gather evidence, which can help us to form our deliberations when we
come to the detailed consideration in
Committee.</div><a name="08102132000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
38</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000449"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> In relation to financial stability, the Minister
referred in his helpful opening statement to the recapitalisation of
the banks, which would fit within the framework that we are
discussing. There was an injection of &#163;37 billion in shares;
have the terms and conditions of those share offerings been determined
and when is it likely that the share issues will take
place?</div><a name="08102132000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>When I made my introductory
remarks, I made it clear that the Banking Bill was part of a range of
reforms and actions that we are implementing as a Government. We have
taken action with regards to recapitalisation of the banks. The package
of measures that was announced included &#163;37 billion for bank
recapitalisation, an increase in the special liquidity scheme to
&#163;200 billion, and &#163;250 billion for debt guarantees to
support inter-bank lending. That is a big package in anybody&#146;s
book. The details of the individual negotiations are not in the remit
of the Bill, but the Government are acting in the usual transparent way
in that
area.</div><a name="08102132000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
39</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000450"></a>Mr.

question. Are those terms and conditions finalised, and when will the
money be injected into the
banks?</div><a name="08102132000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> My understanding is that the terms and
conditions have been finalised; deals have been done with the banks and
the information is publicly available. I think that it is available in
the House of Commons

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
40</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000451"></a>Mr.

I thought that it was as the Minister said because I have looked at
those documents. However, under questioning yesterday, the Prime
Minister said that the terms and conditions had not been finalised, so
I am trying to find out whether they have
been.</div><a name="08102132000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
42</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000453"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> I have a general, simplistic question.
Decades ago, regulation of banks took place behind closed
doors&#151;the Governor&#146;s eyebrow and pressure brought to
bear&#151;and banks got regulated. Did you, as a Minister, seeing
this massive tome, wonder whether it would be possible to make
regulation much simpler, and just authorise the Bank of England to do
what is necessary to regulate and control, and to ensure the security
of the banking system? Were questions asked about whether all this
detail was necessary? It is absolutely certain that we will be back in
a year&#146;s time with a banking (amendment) Bill and, I suspect,
the following year and the year
after.</div><a name="08102132000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>Sometimes people hark back to
the days when they knew their bank manager&#151;when if they ran a
business they just had to go to their bank manager and say, &#147;I
need a bit of money&#148;, and it would get sorted out. Perhaps they
also hark back to the days when the Bank of England regulated more
informally. I think that the world has changed. Modern regulation is
very different from the regulatory regimes that were in operation in
the 1950s and &#146;60s. The whole world&#146;s financial markets
have changed quite dramatically.</div>
<a name="08102132000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The decision
we took in 1997 to bring all the different regulators together was the
right one. It is interesting to note that many other countries have
adopted our approach. I remember working for a company whose members
were regulated by FIMBRA, LAUTRO and IMRO. There was a range of
different regulatory bodies. Bringing them together in one body
covering not just banks and building societies but insurance and other
areas is a model that has been copied around the world. I think that it
is the right one. I know that there has been debate about this, but I
believe it is the right approach to adopt. In the current climate, to
suggest that we can rip that up and have light or little regulation is
not what people expect. It would not be the responsible thing
to do.</div>
<a name="08102132000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I add a
last word about the details of the agreements? I am advised that only
very minor details are still to be settled on the agreement between the
banks in question and the Government, so the information in the Library
contains all the substantive detail involved.</div>

left?</div><a name="08102132000154"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian

a matter for the banks and the relevant
authorities.</div><a name="08102132000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
44</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000455"></a>Geraldine
Smith:</b> You may not be able to answer this, but do you have
any idea how long it will take for the banks to get back to normal and
start lending money properly to business and things? Do you think that
the recession we could be heading into is caused by the financial
situation with the
banks?</div><a name="08102132000156"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> That is going a bit broader than
consideration of the Bill, but let me say a few words on it. That is a
real question for many of our constituents. It is very difficult to
give a straight answer. There has been a global financial crisis. We
know that it started in the United States with problems in sub-prime
lending. We know that until recently it has been exacerbated by high
oil and food prices. That has produced a challenge for financial
institutions and economies right across the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div>world. We have seen the United States taking action. We have seen
Germany, France and Italy do so. Only recently we have seen the
recapitalisation of ING. We have seen announcements that Sweden is
taking action to bring greater stability to its banking system, too. We
are all taking action. We are all desperately trying to get bank
lending going again. There are some signs that it is
working.</div>
<a name="08102132000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
45</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000456"></a>Geraldine
Smith:</b> If the banks have been recapitalised, surely there
should be no excuse not to lend money
now?</div><a name="08102132000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>I am optimistic that we have
turned the corner with regard to bringing stability to the financial
system as a result of the actions that we have taken, and that others
have taken following our lead. We cannot say that we are out of the
woods yet, but, as I said on Second Reading, we are on the right path.
The fact that others are following a similar path gives us signs for
encouragement. There are clearly big concerns about the impact it has
had and will have on our economies, which is one reason why the
Government are looking at taking a range of actions to support people
and businesses through difficult times. The best thing that we can do
is to have a Government who are on the side of people and businesses,
and trying to take prompt and decisive action to support
them.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102132000457"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Time is catching up with us. I call for the last
question.</div>
<a name="08102132000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
46</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000458"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> This is a general question. Clearly, the public
are going to have high expectations of the Bill as being able to
prevent the kind of catastrophe that we have seen in recent months.
What do you say to people who say, &#147;Well, actually what happened
was down to some dysfunctions in some banks that were not properly
regulated or managed by the people who were supposed to be doing so.
So, how is the Bill going to make a difference and which particular
measures are going to make a difference?&#148; What do you say to the
public?</div><a name="08102132000161"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> Let me be clear: even at the risk of stating
the obvious, the Bill cannot stop sub-prime lending in the United
States. It puts together a permanent regime for dealing with a
situation in which banks are failing
and&#151;</div><a name="08102132000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
47</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000459"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Hang on. You say that it is not meant to outlaw
sub-prime lending in the US, and obviously it cannot do that, but it is
supposed to make the banks here spot when some of that sub-prime
lending is bundled up, packed over here and cannot be dealt with. That
is where we came in.</div>
<a name="08102132000163"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> One of the things that is certainly in the
Bill, which we have just been talking about, is an enhanced role for
the Bank in ensuring financial stability. Financial stability should
take into account some of the things that my hon. Friend is talking
about. Clearly one piece of legislation cannot do everything. I hope
that I have been very clear that this is one part of a package of
reforms and actions that have been taking place. I also want to
emphasise the enhanced supervisory framework that the Financial
Services Authority has been adopting. We have learned lessons from
Northern Rock, and I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div>suspect that there are further lessons that we need to learn as a result
of the global financial crisis, but I am confident that the legislation
is robust and is needed to ensure that we have a permanent regime in
the first
place.</div><a name="08102132000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
message to all of us is that we need to understand the global nature of
international monetary markets better, and to understand that one needs
a global response to regulation. The Prime Minister has been pushing
for that for the best past of a decade or more. When he was Chancellor
of the Exchequer, he said that there needed to be greater co-ordination
globally on financial markets and institutions. I do not think that we
currently have the institutional arrangements that will be needed,
which is one of the reasons for a lot of the interest and activity that
has taken place in that area. It is not part of the Bill, but it is
part of the learning experience that we have all been going
through.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102132000461"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Welcome. Our first question is from
Mr. Mark Hoban.</div>
<a name="08102132000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
48</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000462"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> These questions are addressed to the
representatives from the Bank of England. The Governor said that it was
more important to get the special resolution regime legislation right,
rather than rush it through to a fixed timetable. To what extent are
you convinced that the Bill gets it
right?</div><a name="08102132000173"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nigel
Jenkinson:</b></i> As the Governor also said, he thought that
by October the Bill would be in a sufficient position to be scrutinised
extensively by Parliament&#151;a process that is now under way. We
believe that the Bill is in such a state. We strongly support the
current Bill and think that it is ready to be taken
forward.</div>
<a name="08102132000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
49</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000463"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Governor argued that the Bank should have the
ability to pull the trigger on a failing bank. What benefits do you see
from that
approach?</div><a name="08102132000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nigel
Jenkinson:</b></i> That is a debate which has taken place in
the past; it is not a proposal that is currently in the Bill, where it
is clear that the FSA will pull the trigger. But the Bank can, and
will, make recommendations in particular cases. That is the debate we
have had and a decision has been made. We will wish to operate under
the framework that is now in the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div><a name="08102132000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
50</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000464"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> But the Bill talks about the FSA consulting with
the Bank before it pulls the trigger. Do you think you need a much more
formal process for making recommendations to the FSA about whether a
bank should be placed under the
regime?</div><a name="08102132000177"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nigel
Jenkinson:</b></i> Further information will be published. We
are working with our colleagues in the FSA and the Treasury in terms of
revised memorandums of understanding protocols on how the new
arrangements will work. As I have stated, under those arrangements we
will be able to make recommendations; there will be good information
sharing between the FSA and the Bank of England and we will be in a
position to make such recommendations, but it will be the
responsibility of the FSA to make the actual decision. I do not know
whether Tom wishes to say anything on that.</div>
<a name="08102132000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">.</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">
Huertas:</b></i> I very much agree with my colleague from the
Bank of England&#151;both on the way that the process would work, and
that in the Bill there is a provision for the FSA and the Treasury to
recommend to the Bank the resolution tool that would be adopted. That
is a solution that we heartily endorse.</div>
<a name="08102132000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
51</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000465"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Under the terms of the Bill, you may lack the legal
power to pull the trigger, but do you not have a de facto power to pull
the trigger? If a bank came to you, looking for help to enter into
liquidity or some other form of financial assistance, the fact that you
can refuse would, by necessity, place the bank in the special
resolution regime.</div>
<a name="08102132000180"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nigel
Jenkinson:</b></i> The particular issue of which the FSA
would have to take account&#151;and they will take account&#151;is
whether a bank is continuing to fulfil the threshold conditions for
regulation and/or the likelihood of being able to improve the position.
If a bank came to the Bank of England seeking additional liquidity
support and liquidity assistance, that is undoubtedly something that we
would be talking to the FSA about, and the Treasury too, in respect of
finding the right approach for that particular
bank.</div>
<a name="08102132000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
52</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000466"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> But presumably if you said that you could not
provide liquidity assistance to a particular bank, that would
effectively pull the trigger?</div>
<a name="08102132000182"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nigel
Jenkinson:</b></i> It depends on the circumstances. Together
with the Treasury and the FSA, we would have to make a decision about
whether to provide liquidity assistance in those particular
circumstances. It is not clear that there would be an issue of
liquidity in all cases. For example, there might be a case where a bank
had poor capital levels that the FSA was concerned about. That factor
might lead the FSA to believe that the bank was failing to meet its
threshold conditions and, consequently, could be a candidate for the
special resolution regime. Not all cases would necessarily go along the
lines that you suggest.</div>
<a name="08102132000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102132000467"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> No, I am sure that is the case.</div>
<a name="08102132000184"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Huertas:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>Indeed, some of the
considerations that I imagine our colleagues at the Bank have under
review are the need to provide liquidity under the conditions outlined
in the Red Book revisions, and the wish to avoid the possibility of
stigmatising any bank that sought liquidity under those conditions. The
question  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>of liquidity provision to banks should be seen generally. It is not
always with respect to emergency liquidity
assistance.</div>
<a name="08102132000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
53</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000468"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> No, quite. Mr. Jenkinson, you are the
director for financial stability. What does &#147;financial
stability&#148; mean?</div>
<a name="08102132000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nigel
Jenkinson:</b></i> For my interpretation I can do no better
than quote the Governor when he was asked that question by the Treasury
Committee. We consider a situation of financial stability to be one
where the financial intermediation mechanism works normally, where
households and corporates can mediate their savings into real
investment in the economy at home and abroad, and where the payment
system operates normally. It is a situation where intermediation works
well, where people have confidence in the system and where the payment
system operates well. That is a reasonable working definition, although
there are clearly many definitions of financial
stability.</div>
<a name="08102132000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
54</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000469"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Yes, but do you think that it would be helpful to
define financial stability in the Bill? Clearly, the Bank will be held
to account on its ability to deliver financial stability. At the moment
that is a high-level concept, which is undefined in the Bill. How can
we hold the Bank to account if there is no definition, even along the
lines that you have outlined?</div>
<a name="08102132000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nigel
Jenkinson:</b></i> I do not personally think that it is
necessary to have a definition of financial stability in the Bill. We
produce regular reports, with which I hope that you are familiar. For
example, we will continue to publish our financial stability report in
which we give our assessment of the risks and vulnerabilities to the
financial system, state whether we think that there are threats to
financial stability or the likelihood of financial instability and
discuss what can be done to remedy that position and improve the
resilience of the financial system. I do not think that it is necessary
to have a definition of financial stability in the legislation, but in
terms of a broad working definition, we would subscribe to the one that
I have just set out.</div>
<a name="08102132000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
55</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000470"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> You talked about the financial stability report,
and your organisation was one of those that pointed out some of the
issues that were building up in the economy. What tools do you have to
implement your responsibility for financial stability?</div>
<a name="08102132000190"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nigel
Jenkinson:</b></i> We have a number of tools. First and
foremost is the one that you referred to in terms of the role of the
central bank as the ultimate supplier of liquidity in the economy. That
is a crucial role for central banks and is very important in
determining financial stability. As Tom Huertas has indicated, we have
just undertaken a review of that function and put out a new document
about how we will conduct our liquidity operations.</div>
<a name="08102132000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The role of
payment systems and financial infrastructure is an area of crucial
importance to the financial system, and one in which the Bank has
particular responsibilities. The Bill goes further in providing it with
statutory responsibilities. There will also be responsibilities in the
Bill for the functions of the special resolution authority. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>More broadly, in the financial stability report, we aim to provide an
assessment of where we believe there to be risks and vulnerabilities in
the financial system, and set out what policies and changes can be
adopted to try to improve the resilience of the financial
system.</div>
<a name="08102132000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">We provide
advice to the Financial Services Authority, for example, on some
aspects of the prudential regulation framework. We participate in a
range of international committees, such as the Basel Committee, the
Financial Stability Forum, and the committee on payment and settlement
systems, which set standards to try to strengthen the resilience of the
financial system. Across a wide range of areas we can exercise the
responsibility set out in the Bill, to try to improve financial
stability and to strengthen the protection and enhancement of financial
stability.</div>
<a name="08102132000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
56</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000471"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> It seems to me that you lack the ability to
intervene to maintain our stability. If you go back to the issue that
was identified about growing levels of debt in the economy, what tools
are at your disposal to affect
that?</div><a name="08102132000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nigel
Jenkinson:</b></i> As I have already indicated, we have
policies in respect of liquidity, which is absolutely central. It is
another area, but clearly the Bank has important monetary policy
objectives in terms of the responsibility to set interest rates in line
with the inflation target. As regards the regulatory framework, we can
and do get involved in some aspects, such as the liquidity framework,
in which I am personally involved on an international committee. The
pure regulation and supervision of banks, however, is clearly
delineated to the FSA, which is
fine.</div><a name="08102132000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
57</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000472"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Tucked away on page 105, clause 222, extraordinary
bank immunity has been given to the Bank of England; it cannot be sued
for any acts or omissions it commits. Why has that been tucked in
there?</div><a name="08102132000196"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> It is an immunity that we had when we were
supervisor, which the FSA also has as a supervisor. As we are getting
the more formal roles in financial stability set out in the Bill,
including roles in the special resolution regime and the oversight
functions of payment operations, it seemed sensible for us to have the
same statutory immunity as the FSA and other regulators. It is not
totally unusual in the sense that you mean
extraordinary.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
58</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000473"></a>Mr.

retrospective to anything that the Bank has done in the
past?</div><a name="08102132000198"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> I would need to think about it, but I should

59</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000474"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I would like the FSA to answer this question: do you
think that the public would be surprised, having had the biggest
financial crisis for 100 years, with runs on banks and banks nearly
going bust and being nationalised, if the regulatory bodies immune
themselves from being sued? Would not the public think that rather
strange?</div>
<a name="08102132000200"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr

public duties, with respect to compensation that might be due to
shareholders there is provision in the Bill for such compensation. It
is in that area that shareholders and

the particular agencies directly for
damages.</div><a name="08102132000201"></a>

clearly the ability of the supervisory authorities to take necessary

Peter Viggers:</b> The tripartite arrangements left the Bank
of England with general responsibility for financial stability, but put
the supervision of individual banks upon the FSA. Now the Bank is to be
charged with a range of new responsibilities relating to bridge banks,
private sector purchaser tools, partial transfer tools and so on. How
will it ensure that it has the resources and the expertise that it will

duty?</div><a name="08102132000204"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nigel

need, obviously we will have to ensure that we have the right staffing
in place. We have a strong staff already in place. In some areas we may
seek to bring in people with additional skills&#151;for example, to
fulfil some of the tasks in the special resolution authority. It is
important that we have a strong working relationship with the FSA. I am
very confident that we have such a relationship and that we can
continue to strengthen it further. It is important to have access to
the information that we need to fulfil that responsibility. I believe
that we can and will undertake the responsibilities that we are being

supervisor. What steps can you take, short of what has been described
as the nuclear option of the special resolution regime? What range of
measures do you have available, short of
that?</div><a name="08102132000206"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nigel
Jenkinson:</b></i> I shall ask Tom to comment on that. As you
indicate, we very much hope that the use of the special resolution
regime will be a last resort prior to institutions getting into a
position where they are failing to meet their threshold conditions and
it is not very likely that they can remedy that. There is obviously a
strong role for supervisors working with the banks to try to remedy
that position. When institutions are getting under stress the Bank will
be thinking very hard about planning. Should the worst case happen in
terms of special resolution, we will be increasingly involved as
institutions get under stress. We will be providing advice to the FSA,
but I think that Tom should talk about the regulatory
tools.</div><a name="08102132000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">.</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">

the past year, in a rapidly deteriorating economic environment not all
remedial measures can be as successful as we would hope. Institutions
may come to the point where a resolution has to be implemented, and the
type of co-operation that Nigel has described has been very
instrumental there, as well as working with the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme to effect a prompt and orderly resolution. We
anticipate that the passage of the current Bill would allow that type
of situation to
continue.</div><a name="08102132000208"></a>

individual banks and financial institutions to have an awareness of the

on its
toes?</div><a name="08102132000209"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nigel
Jenkinson:</b></i> We already have close contacts with many
financial institutions through our operational role. As the operational
arm of Government in respect of the financial system we have an
operational framework, which we try to build on, to improve our
understanding of what is going on. In terms of financial market
developments, we have in recent years significantly enhanced what we
call our market intelligence function, which is led by my colleague,
Paul Tucker, the markets director. We will need to put additional
resources into our analysis and understanding of individual financial
institutions, particularly when there are perceptions that those
institutions are getting into stress conditions or when financial
market conditions, in general, are getting into stress. It is important
that we share the information that we collect from our market
intelligence and that we share the analysis that we undertake on risks
in the financial system and individual institutions with our colleagues
in the Financial Services Authority, and that they do the same with
us.</div><a name="08102132000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a matter of making sure that we are working together positively and
co-operatively from time to time, and perhaps challenging each other
constructively. I am confident that we can build and develop such a
relationship, and none the less make it absolutely clear that we are
not duplicating the work of the FSA and that the delineation of
responsibilities is very clear; the FSA is responsible for
implementation, supervision and regulation and the Bank is responsible
for the functions set out in the Bill. I believe that we can do
that.</div>

trigger mechanism. There is an argument that there is a risk of
regulatory forbearance because, in a sense, triggering the regime would
be a sign of regulatory failure. Do you accept that? If so, how would
you guard against it?</div>

Huerta</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">s:</b></i> I do not think that it has
been a realistic possibility. In the UK, in particular, the market is a
very stern disciplinarian. The market moves quite quickly to bring to
everyone&#146;s attention institutions that have difficulties and to
force the hand of the authorities to deal with those institutions. The
only way in which forbearance might be exercised is by the provision of
very large and extensive amounts of
liquidity.</div><a name="08102132000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
65</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000482"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Is the trigger mechanism sufficient? Clause 7 on
page 4 sets out two conditions and then there is the consultation
process. One condition is whether or not the bank satisfies the
threshold and the second condition is a judgment call as to whether the
bank might be able to recover. Applying those two conditions, would you
have picked up Northern Rock, for
example?</div><a name="08102132000218"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">.</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">

66</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000483"></a>Ms

others have pointed out in various testimonies, not having had
available a special resolution regime certainly bound the hands of the
authorities in dealing with that particular
institution.</div><a name="08102132000221"></a>

yes to that. The possibility of preventing a bank run would be greatly
enhanced, but I would find it difficult to sit here today and
say&#151;indeed, it would be difficult for anyone&#151;that the
possibility of preventing a bank run is absolutely banned. The overall
prospect of the Bill, which allows us to deal much more promptly with a
failing bank situation and to resolve it in a manner that protects
depositors and strengthens the ability of the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme to pay out to depositors, is a much better place
than where we were in September 2007.</div>

back to a Select Committee, which can say, &#147;What were the

72</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000489"></a>Mr.

potential bank runs and panic? Clearly a balance needs to be struck
between transparency regarding the special resolution regime and not
inducing panic among the public. Could I ask the FSA in
particular&#151;I will be grateful for the thoughts of the Bank of
England, too&#151;what your communication strategy will be regarding
measures taken under the special resolution regime? How are you going
to avoid

Huertas:</b></i> It is very important that the decision about
whether the trigger should be pulled is closely co-ordinated with the
solution that is to be adopted, and that a communication strategy be
developed at the same time, so that all three things are done together
as a piece. Unfortunately, we have had the opportunity for a good deal
of practice in that regard. The importance of that overall co-ordinated
approach has been very much driven home and that is something we expect

so, about the various developments in this crisis, has been that
practically every interesting bit of information has been revealed by
Robert Peston on the BBC News. To what extent has that been a major
difficulty for the FSA and the Bank of England&#151;that control of
the story appears to be in the hands of Robert Peston rather than the

Todd:</b> You were sitting at the back when the earlier
questions were asked, so I can run through them 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>briefly. It is clear from the Bill that the financial stability
committee is not an executive committee. It has a hybrid scrutiny and
advisory role. Is that your
understanding?</div><a name="08102132000240"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> Yes, it is a committee of the court. I shall
go back a stage: if functions are given to the Bank, as the Bill does,
they are initially exercised by the court of directors or the board of
directors, and it is likely that the court in any circumstances would
have wanted to create a sub-committee. There is already an informal one
at the Bank called the financial stability board. The financial
stability committee would be a natural thing for the court itself to
create to help it carry out the functions. The financial stability
functions are significantly different in how they affect the Bank from
the monetary policy
functions.</div><a name="08102132000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
monetary policy functions take monetary stability and deal with that
quite separately. Just dealing with the risk-free interest rate does
not affect a lot of the activities of the Bank. Monetary stability is
much
broader.</div><a name="08102132000242"></a>

<a name="08102132000243"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> The Governor said that to the Treasury
Committee. But it does affect the way in which the functions are
managed. It goes to the balance sheet. It goes to risks, and it goes to
controls. It also goes to decisions that the court will have to
take&#151;for example, about the lender of last resort, transactions
outside the normal course of business, collateral swaps that would not
be within the normal delegations to the Governor and the executive. The
court would need to be consulted and to decide on them. That is why a
financial stability committee is something that the court would create,
and give executive
functions.</div><a name="08102132000244"></a>

77</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000495"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Good. I have that. The Bill, as I explored earlier,
is not absolutely clear about the relationship between the financial
stability committee and the court. It is in certain respects, but not
in other aspects. Would you welcome a clarification of the clear
subsidiarity of the financial stability committee or do you feel that
allowing it to float free to some extent is desirable&#151;as appears
to be the intent of the Bill, as
drafted?</div><a name="08102132000245"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> The Bill requires the court to create the
committee. It does not completely flow free. A clause enables the court
to delegate functions to it. It is very likely that the court would
want to delegate, for example, short-run immediate transaction
decisions to it. There is already a transactions committee at the
court, so they could be rolled together. The functions in the Bill are
to recommend financial stability strategy to court, which will decide
and then advise.</div>

heard the exploration as to the role of the Governor. He is designated
as the chair of the financial stability committee, yet part of the

combination of roles, is it not?</div>

powers&#148;.</div><a name="08102132000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
interpret that as a scrutiny function normally carried out by

Footman:</b></i> That is, in a sense, why I wanted to stress
that the function is given to the Bank. Typically, the court delegates
to the Governor, as the executive, a range of functions, but reserves
certain decisions to itself. It is reasonable for the committee to
advise the executive and also to exercise some of the functions that
the court reserves to itself, and it would do so. It is also likely
that there would be oversight within the committee. The fundamental
oversight process&#151;this goes back to the 1998 Act&#151;is the
court, or the non-executive of the court in what is called NedCo, which
reviews the Bank&#146;s performance in delivering its various
activities, with the exception of monetary
policy.</div>

past.</div>
<a name="08102132000257"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> At least four of the non-executive members
would be members of the financial stability committee, and would
require the skills, abilities and knowledge to exercise that function.
The remaining nine members&#151;or eight if you take out the chairman
of the FSA, who is usually on the committee&#151;would review the
performance of the Bank in its financial stability role. You are right:
expertise and ability would be needed in that as

Todd:</b> There is a reference in the Bill to co-opting other
non-voting members. I hope that is a means of recruiting those who are
not necessarily UK citizens, but have valuable experience of financial
stability issues. Of course, the Bank already has someone from the
Scandinavian banking system who, even before this happened, advised it
on stability issues, presumably based on the experience of nearly 20
years ago. Is that the kind of model that is envisaged regarding the
use of that power?</div>
<a name="08102132000261"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> That is one possible model. The other
simpler point about co-opting is that the executive directors of the
Bank are not formally members of the court. They would also need to be
co-opted, but could be from outside or inside the Bank
establishment.</div>

about moral hazard many 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div>times on television. I think I understood what he meant&#151;we do not
want irresponsible lending and we have to bear the consequences of the
risks we take. On the other hand, although we have talked about a
&#163;50,000 limit to depositor protection, we all know that it is
effectively 100 per cent. We have seen that with Northern Rock and the

in the design of financial regulation and the operation of the
financial authorities. The Governor is right. It is important to look
hard at what incentives the systems of regulation and supervision
entail with regard to the behaviour of participants in the financial
system. On the specific issue of deposit insurance, the Bank view is
that there is merit in a risk-based, pre-funded system of deposit
insurance. The opportunity and the powers to implement it are clearly
set out in the Bill, should the Government decide to do so. However,
given current financial circumstances, the decision has been taken not
to adopt that measure now, and it will be a decision for Government in
the future. It is important to think hard about the respective
incentives in terms of how the system is designed. It is important to
think about moral hazard issues.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
85</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000504"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I am not quite clear. Let me give an example. Were
the Government right to protect all retail depositors with the
Icelandic banks? At that time, the scheme said that deposits of up to
&#163;35,000 were protected. That is where it should have come in.
People who had money above that amount should have lost it. That is the
moral hazard aspect&#151;people who went to an Icelandic bank that
gave a higher rate of return were taking a moral risk. That is not what
happened; the Government rushed in and said that we must protect
everyone. There might be somebody who is very rich and had &#163;5
million in an Icelandic bank. Such a person is protected the same as
somebody with only &#163;35,000. Does that not drive a coach and
horses through the idea of moral
hazard?</div><a name="08102132000266"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nigel
Jenkinson:</b></i> The Government took the decision last week
and that was a decision for Government. You raise an important question
about whether there is a hard limit in the longer run. In the current
stressed circumstances and conditions where people do not have much
confidence in the financial system, a strong case can be made that it
is important to retain and protect depositor confidence. That is the
decision that the Government took last week. In other circumstances,
under more normal financial market conditions, where suddenly a bank
gets into particular difficulties on its own, it is possible to make a
different decision. In terms of financial stability, it is important to
look at the conditions of the time. That was a factor behind the
Government&#146;s decision last
week.</div><a name="08102132000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
86</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000505"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Nobody 13 or 14 months ago would have expected a
bank to fail. No one anticipated that the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>have to step in to repay depositors. Will Ms Minghella set out what
lessons the FSCS has learned over the last year and what changes it
needs to make to adjust to the new financial
climate?</div><a name="08102132000268"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Loretta
Minghella:</b></i> I would start by saying that it has been
very clear over the last 13 months how important it is for people to
know what compensation will be available to them and to be confident
that that can be paid quickly. The FSCS has always dealt promptly with
the failure of smaller credit unions and deposit takers. We have the
experience of dealing with about 35 of those and an MP thanked me the
other day for dealing with his claim very quickly. He is joined by many
thousands of people who have had that
benefit.</div><a name="08102132000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over
the last year we have also been able to participate, thanks to the
Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, in much larger-scale rescues.
For example, in the case of Bradford &amp; Bingley, we paid &#163;14
million overnight so that 2.5 million people went to bed on 28
September banking with Bradford &amp; Bingley and woke up on
29 September banking with Abbey. That was a tremendous
result in terms of consumer protection. That was only possible because
of the provisions of the 2008 Act, which is why it is terribly
important to us that the Bill goes through. It will allow that kind of
thing to happen in the
future.</div><a name="08102132000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is not the only kind of scenario that we will face. There will be
circumstances in which payouts will be necessary for larger numbers of
people than is contemplated in smaller credit union failures. We must
be able to speed up payment. Eight measures must be taken to help speed
up payment. Four are delivered by the Bill and four can be delivered by
changes to be made to FSA rules, which Tom might want to comment
on.</div><a name="08102132000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will speak about the measures contained in the Bill. Those are allowing
us early access to information about firms before they fail, assistance
from the liquidator in the event of a failure to prioritise the payout
of depositors, a streamlined process that will not need all the forms
that go backwards and forwards between us and the claimants&#151;in
other words, no forms and deemed assignment of rights&#151;and
immediate access to the liquidity that we need to pay people promptly.
Those are the four changes that the Bill will deliver. We have realised
how important they are in delivering consumer
confidence.</div><a name="08102132000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are four sets of changes under the Bill that will also help us:
simplifying the eligibility criteria, ensuring that banks have the data
that we can use immediately to pay out showing a single view of each
customer and what they are owed, the need not to set off
people&#146;s loans against their deposits before they are paid out
and streamlined arrangements for people to open new accounts with other
banks, so that they can pay their compensation cheques into them if
necessary. We have learned over this past year how important all those
things are, and that is why we support the
Bill.</div>
<a name="08102132000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
87</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000506"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> You talked about how you were able to transfer
money overnight to Abbey, straight from Bradford &amp; Bingley. How
long do you think it is right for customers to wait until they can
access their accounts, if the situation is not that a bank&#146;s
assets are being transferred to another bank, but that a bank is going
insolvent? Is it one week, two weeks, or longer?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div><a name="08102132000274"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Loretta
Minghella:</b></i> Tom may wish to comment on that, because
the FSA has been running some research about consumers&#151;what they
need, and what they believe will give them the confidence that they
need. I think a period of a week or two is what we are looking at,
which is why we are aiming for a seven-day payout for the majority of
what people are owed, with the balance, if necessary, to follow a few
days later. Obviously, there will be some cases of hardship even so,
but we think that is realistic and would meet the needs of the majority
of people.</div>
<a name="08102132000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
88</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000507"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> What are the principal barriers to a seven-day
payout?</div><a name="08102132000276"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Loretta
Minghella:</b></i> I have set out the eight things that need
to change, and I would say that missing out one or two of them would
probably defeat the whole object, so we commend to Parliament the list
of changes as a whole. One of the key things will be having the right
data from banks at the point of failure and knowing that those data are
reliable, which is why we need to be in earlier. Part of the reason why
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation can pay out quickly is that
three months beforehand, it starts the preparations towards payout. The
FDIC works with the firm&#146;s data&#151;it runs through them, it
tests them, it explores them and it does dummy payment runs&#151;to
make sure that when the button is pressed and it goes into payout mode,
the process will be reliable.</div>
<a name="08102132000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The data have
to be there, they have to be tested and reliable and they have to fit
the compensation scheme rules as they currently stand. If we have to
pay out everybody except so-and-so, we must be able to identify who
that so-and-so might be. If we have to set off loans, we need to know
what to set off; if we do not have to, all well and good. The data are
crucial and we have been working with the FSA and consultants to
examine the whole business of the speed of payout, to see how it can be
delivered most efficiently. Tom may want to say more about
that.</div>
<a name="08102132000278"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">.</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">
Huertos:</b></i> We are very much working on that. There is a
trade-off between speed and accuracy. On balance, for the broad number
of depositors there should be much more emphasis on speed. It may
involve a bit of overpayment, but with respect to the broader social
objective of ensuring that the depositors get access to their money
quickly, we would come down on the side of taking the risk that there
is a bit of inaccuracy and potential overpayment, in order to get the
speed in
place.</div><a name="08102132000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
89</b><b class="B"><a name="08102132000508"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Just going back to Ms Minghella&#146;s comment
about the FDIC in the States going in three months before the button is
pressed to make the payments, how would that work in the context of the
regime we are talking about? If a bank was to go into the amber zone of
heightened supervision, would you expect the FSCS to become involved in
that situation, to prepare the ground in case a bank goes into the
special resolution
regime?</div><a name="08102132000280"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">.</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">
Huertos:</b></i> One of the provisions in the Bill is the
ability of the FSA to request the information that could be passed on
to the FSCS, so that it would have the type of information that it
requires should payout become necessary, so that the speedy payout can
be achieved.</div>

judgment in the broad area of heightened supervision. More generally,
we are looking at what aspect of the data banks need to keep with

insured.</div><a name="08102132000283"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Loretta

the FSCS and the tripartite authorities to work closely together in

need that information in advance&#151;of particular customers. When
the button is pushed, the deposits of each customer will have varied
from the earlier information. Why on earth do you need that information
in advance? In the travel industry, the information is not required in
advance&#151;it is required in a format, so that it can be

interested in whether Ms Minghella or Dr. Huertas have any particular
amounts&#151;we are not interested in individuals from that point of
view, but in making sure that the process works smoothly from day one.
It is going to be one of the jobs of the FSCS to give advice on whether
the payout could be activated speedily enough, or whether it would not,
because of the status of the system, and some other special resolution
tool might need to be chosen. That is what the FDIC does&#151;it
works with the particular systems of the institution, testing them to
make sure that they will work effectively on the day and that the data
that should be there are there in the right form. It is not a prurient

not popular with banks. The Governor talked about the need to build up
such a fund, but if there was a decision to go with that, it would take
some years to provide the level of funding needed. What are your views

Huertas:</b></i> With respect to the fund, it is important to
remember that the deposit guarantee promise needs to be backed by the
full faith and credit of the Government. If it ever got to the point
that the deposit guarantee promise was limited to the size of the fund,
the exhaustion of the fund and the removal of any type of deposit
guarantee for the remaining depositors would be a severe threat to
