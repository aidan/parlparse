<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Regulation of pesticides</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.33 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ben Bradshaw </B>(Exeter): The Bill is about freedom of information and public safety. Clause 1 deals with three matters: first, openness; secondly, one aspect of enforcement; and, thirdly, secondary legislation for Northern Ireland. On openness, there is general agreement that the public should have access to information about pesticides to respond to their growing concern. It is hoped, in most cases, to allay that concern.
<P>
The problem under the current law is that the public have access to only about 40 per cent. of the 340 pesticides that have been approved. Since 1986, when pesticide regulation was made statutory, all new pesticides have been reviewed properly. However, only a minority of the ones that were already in use before then have been so reviewed. The Bill will remove the barrier to access to information on such pesticides. Most of the enforcement aspects are dealt with in clause 2.
<P>
Clause 1 extends the power to local authorities to seize and dispose of pesticides. Certain powers were given to local authorities in 1989, but that was not one of them; it is presently left to the Health and Safety Executive. The clause also makes secondary legislation possible for Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Norman Baker </B>(Lewes): May I say on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. George) that the Liberal Democrats welcome the Bill, as it provides more access to information about pesticides. The hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw) knows that consumers are most worried about the older pesticides, which are subject to less rigorous testing and therefore most likely to give rise to complaint. It is important that those older pesticides are brought within the system.
<P>
Subsection (3) gives Ministers the power to consider making information available to the public. I am a little surprised that the information is not automatically made available. The Bill gives Ministers an enabling power, but there is no guarantee that they will use it--although I am sure that the Minister of State will tell us that that is his intention. Nevertheless, some legislation is passed but not acted upon, so many provisions subsequently remain dormant. Why is subsection (3) worded like that, instead of allowing information to be provided immediately to the public?
<P>
I query the amount likely to be charged. It is clearly important that the amounts charged for access to information under subsection (3) are not set at a level that would effectively disbar people from access to that information.
<P>
I seek clarification on whether access to information provided under the Bill, will be granted under the same conditions as is access to information on pesticides under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985. Under the 1985 Act, permission was given to interested parties to access information; but some parties who may have been thought to have had a significant interest, such as Friends of the Earth, were refused access. It is important to clarify whether access to information will be free to anyone who wants it, and that it will not be curtailed by officials or Ministers. Apart from those queries, I support the principle of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Exeter on presenting the Bill to the Committee. I also congratulate you, Mrs. Roe, on your appointment as Chairman.
<P>
The hon. Member for Exeter knows that the Bill was prepared by the previous Government and that the present Government were anxious that it should become law. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman took it up when he got his place in the ballot.
<P>
The Bill makes several advances in the provision of information, so the hon. Gentleman will not be surprised that I do not intend to oppose it. However, I have a couple of questions on clause 1, particularly subsection (3), which deals with the release of information on older products that have not yet been reviewed by the Pesticides Safety Directorate. The objective of the Bill is that inquirers can see information on those older products if they have not yet been reviewed.
<P>
I understand that, if a pesticide has not yet been reviewed, the PSD might not hold all the necessary information on it. Manufacturers are required by law to inform the PSD if any negative information on a pesticide emerges from trials or research, but other information might not be in the PSD's hands. I am not sure whether inquirers will have access to that information, or only to information that is available through the PSD's reading room procedure, established under the Food and Environmental Protection Act 1985.
<P>
The hon. Member for Exeter has referred to charges, but what costs will be incurred in providing information? In other words, what are the costs that must be recouped by charges? I understand that few individuals or organisations use the reading room facility, so I assume that the cost of that provision is low. I want reassurance that there will be no significant demand on manufacturers to provide vast quantities of information in advance, on the off chance that someone, somewhere might want to see it. The history of access to such information is that not many people want to look at it, although it is right that they can do so.
<P>
I am anxious to ensure that the industry is not burdened with huge unnecessary costs--not huge in industrial terms, but significant nevertheless--if information is not demanded. Can the hon. Member for Exeter, or perhaps the Minister, tell us what costs are incurred in providing such information and, therefore, how a reasonable charge, which does not deter research, will be calculated?
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> I, too, congratulate you, Mrs. Roe, on your chairmanship of the Committee. I apologise on behalf of my hon. Friends for not providing a quorum at 10.30--[Interruption.] It is the Government's function to provide a quorum. That is our duty, even in a Committee on a private Member's Bill.
<P>
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter on securing a place in the ballot and taking up this Bill, which has been around for a while, as the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) said.
<P>
Two central points have been raised. The Government fully support my hon. Friend's Bill and we shall do all that we can to facilitate its progress through the House and the other place. The intention is that information held in the public sector--that is, by Government--will be more available than hitherto. However, people will still have to go to the manufacturers to find out information that we do not hold.
<P>
I have been to the Pesticides Safety Directorate, but I was not conscious of being pointed to a reading room. Last week, I visited the Advisory Committee on Pesticides in York, as I am visiting all the advisory committees.
<P>
We shall make available all the information that is requested of us. There is no justification for not making available any information that we hold. I am afraid that people will have to ask manufacturers for information that we do not hold because of former processes. If people are having difficulty in obtaining information on pesticides that they think companies should make reasonably available, I should like to know about it.
<P>
Cost is always a thorny issue when dealing with freedom of information. I have been fobbed off with various arguments over the years by both Labour and Conservative Ministers. We intend to fix charges at no more than the cost of supply. Generally speaking, that will be the cost of photocopying--large administration costs will not be involved.
<P>
The phrase used in the Bill--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the cost reasonably attributable to the supply of the information''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
has been chosen to replace the old phrase, ``the reasonable fee'', because it is tighter. The phrase ``the reasonable fee'' could be used by the party holding the information to load on administration costs. We do not intend that to happen; we intend the charge to be the cost of supply, which should be in most cases--I do not know of any exceptions--the cost of photocopying, and possibly that of postage. We do not intend add-on costs--the normal overheads--to be included.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jonathan Sayeed </B>(Mid-Bedfordshire): One of the costs is the cost of the reading room, as well as that of photocopying and postage. Why have a reading room at all? With the advent of the internet, the Government could cut costs considerably if they put the information on the internet. The Government would know by the number of hits on a site whether there was a demand for more information. Costs could be kept down and the Government would achieve their objective of more open government.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I shall certainly consider that and take advice. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is putting far more information on the internet as the weeks and months go by--that is not an implied criticism of the previous Government:
<P>
The reading room is in York, which I have found to be an incredibly easy place to get to. I can get to York from London quicker than I can get from London to Birmingham. In my experience, trains on that line not only run on time, they arrive early. The reading room facility may be useful for people who want to browse the paperwork, and providing it will not be that onerous. I understand that the Pesticides Safety Directorate has an incredible number of overseas visitors who trawl through the paperwork in the library. The hon. Gentleman's point about the internet is wholly valid, and I will certainly ask the Pesticides Safety Directorate to consider it if it has not already done so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradshaw:</B> My hon. Friend the Minister has answered most of the queries raised. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire asked about charges to industry. The onus will be on the Government to collate the information. The Government and industry have expressed their willingness to work together to do that. We hope that information that is not currently available--which the Government do not hold--will become available as industry works with Government. The industry realises that it is in its interests to be more open about older pesticides.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bradshaw:</B> This clause is about making enforcement effective. It will make three simple improvements to bring the enforcement regime more in line with that of the Health and Safety Executive. The first is to introduce an element of flexibility. At present, once an enforcement notice has been issued it cannot be withdrawn, varied or reissued. The clause will allow enforcement notices to be withdrawn and, if necessary, reissued to take account of new circumstances--a new building, for example.
<P>
The second improvement will be in gathering information. At present, an inspector is allowed only to ask someone to volunteer information. The clause will give the inspector power to question an individual and to obtain a signed statement. That individual will be allowed to nominate someone to be with him at the time of the interview and the statement that the individual gives will not be used against him in a court case, except one for perjury.
<P>
The third improvement is about gathering photographic information. At present, inspectors can photograph only documents, books and records. The Bill will allow them to photograph or video anything that they might need to help in their investigation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George </B>(St. Ives): My hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker) and I support clause 2, as well as clause 1, because we believe that the Bill is uncontroversial. We need to stick closely to the precautionary principle and ensure that local authorities make every check if they suspect that illegal pesticides are being held in their district. With the beef on the bone restrictions introduced before Christmas, we are concerned about giving local authorities further responsibilities without giving them extra resources to undertake investigations. Greater staff and resource time will be needed for local authorities to fulfil the functions that we want them to carry out, and we are worried that they are not being given resources commensurate with that task. Nevertheless, we support the extension of such responsibilities to local authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sayeed:</B> I have a question about proposed new section 2A(4), which refers to someone not being
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``excused from complying with a requirement''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I want to make it clear that it has been framed to encourage people to tell the truth. Will the Minister confirm that it does not means necessarily that they will not be prosecuted, but that what they say at the interview cannot be used for the purposes of prosecution except in a case of perjury?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am not a lawyer, although we are all law-makers. Obviously, people will be expected to tell the truth, which is the point about perjury. People are not duty bound to incriminate themselves; I assume that other evidence will be required by inspectors to facilitate a successful prosecution, which cannot take place simply on the basis of an interview with the person involved. If I am wrong, no doubt I shall be advised of that pretty quickly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradshaw:</B> I can cite the example of an employee being a useful interviewee. Under existing rules, an inspector has no right to ask for an interview with an employee, who might be intimidated by the presence of a colleague or boss. That would be useful in getting information, but clearly an employee would not want to say anything that would incriminate him.
<P>
On the matter of expense and trading standards, I accept the political point about the difficult financial straits of local authorities. I spoke at some length to my local trading standards officer, who is also the national representative for his profession. He is happy with the measure and says that it is not a question of expense--although every department in local government would like more money--but that, as the law is currently drawn, inspectors are not allowed to be effective in their jobs. There is no point in giving them powers if they are not effective. They have the resources to do it and they want to do it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Austin Mitchell </B>(Great Grimsby): I sincerely congratulate my hon. Friend on a welcome and necessary Bill. He has made his mark only a short time after arriving in the House.
<P>
As chairman of the all-party photographic group, I welcome the legislative provision to take more photographs, but I wonder how it will be used. The Bill requires that pesticides can be marketed or used only if they are safe for people and the environment. The provision to take photographs and videos brings to mind the spectacle of enforcement officers--trading standards officers--crawling through cow pats to film sheep dips to ensure that the necessary protective gear is being used. It is a photographic fantasy that involves trading standards officers extending their skills. How will the provision for obtaining photographic evidence, presumably of the application of pesticides, be used in practice?
<P>
<B>Mr. Sayeed:</B> The question I asked the Minister is important, particularly given the regrettable advent of courts being able to determine the purpose of a Bill on the basis of what a Minister says. If the Minister cannot give a clear answer today, I should be grateful if he would do so on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I was going to say that I would check the matter before Report, but I have received advice. The last sentence of the helpful note that I have received states that what I was saying was broadly right. The powers to question given in the Bill are designed to be similar to those given in the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. They enable an inspector to get information from a reluctant employee, which may help in taking action against an employer. I hope that that is sufficiently clear if it is subject to interpretation in the courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> May I pursue the point further? I did not often receive notes such as the one the Minister has just received when I was a Minister; they usually said that I had to correct something urgently. The Minister did not address the key point to which my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed) drew attention. As I read it, the clause says that an individual cannot refuse to answer questions on the basis that he might incriminate himself. However, if an individual makes a statement and incriminates himself by admitting, for example, that he bought some weird chemical that had fallen off the back of a lorry, that admission cannot be used in court. The clause states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a statement or admission made in complying is not admissible in evidence''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Someone cannot refuse to answer the questions, but the answers he gives cannot be used in evidence. Given what the Minister said, I am puzzled about what the clause achieves or is trying to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The notes on clauses are helpful in that regard. I shall in any event clarify the matter after our proceedings and, if need be, write to members of the Committee. If anything in the Bill needs to be corrected, I shall table an amendment or ask my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter to do so. Schedule 2 of the 1985 Act describes the powers that an inspector may use to investigate an alleged offence. An inspector can ask only for information to be volunteered and has no power to require it to be given. Schedule 2 does not include the power to question anyone who is believed to have information that may assist the investigation and require that person to sign a statement.
<P>
The power to question currently exists under section 20(2)(j) of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. It is useful in ensuring that as much information as possible is obtained at the earliest opportunity. The Bill will provide inspectors with the same powers to question under the 1985 Act as under the 1974 Act.
<P>
I am not aware of any problem in using the powers under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act, but it is important to avoid a situation when the witness may be intimidated by the presence of an employer. If members of the Committee want me to elaborate on any legal points in the Bill or to provide any useful information, I shall do so.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Sayeed:</B> I am sorry to keep referring to the same point; perhaps I am straining on a gnat's tail. I understand that what a person says is not admissible in evidence in a prosecution unless it is obtained and backed up at a later stage, in which case it can be used in evidence. The provision does not make that clear and it would be a good idea to redraft it. The measure could be liable to legal challenge and given the propensity of the courts to interpret the law as they increasingly and regrettably do, the clearer our law is, the better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire makes a fair point. As I said, the statement cannot be used in a prosecution unless it is found to be untrue--in which case, it is perjury. I assume that a person's words or statement would not send the inspector on a fishing expedition, but would give him a direct line to the necessary evidence to carry out a prosecution. The person making the admission or giving the statement would not be open to prosecution, but at least enough information would have been offered to ensure that the correct person could be prosecuted. However, I take on board the hon. Gentleman's argument. The provision could be open to dispute and I shall take further advice on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradshaw:</B> I was about to respond to the point about scrambling through the undergrowth to reach a sheep dip, but my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) has left the Room.

<B>Mr. Bradshaw:</B> I thank you, Mrs. Roe, for your excellent chairmanship. If I do something like this again, I hope that the proceedings will go as smoothly. I thank hon. Members for turning up.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Diana Organ </B>(Forest of Dean): It is no disrespect to you, Mrs. Roe, that in my haste to make a quorum in Committee I passed in front of you. I apologise.
