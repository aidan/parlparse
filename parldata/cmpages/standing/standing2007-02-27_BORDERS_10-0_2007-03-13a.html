							<a name="07031377000296"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Joan
Ryan):
						</b> Welcome to our proceedings, Mr. Amess.
It is my pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. I was concluding
the first 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 310</div>part of my remarks on unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, and the
hon. Member for Rochdale was seeking to intervene. Does he still wish
to avail himself of that
opportunity?</div>
					
					<a name="07031377000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07031377000297"></a>
							<b class="B">Paul
Rowen</b> (Rochdale) (LD): I am glad that you have joined us
for our deliberations, Mr. Amess. Does the Minister not
accept that far better arrangements could be made than using
immigration and nationality directorate officers? She talked about the
current consultation. If there is a requirement to deal with
unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, would it not be better to deal
with them through social services or local authorities, which have
expertise in dealing with young
people?</div>
					
					<a name="07031377000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031377000298"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b> It is important to bear in mind that we are not
talking simply about children or children in care. We are talking about
children with limited leave, who therefore have a relationship with the
immigration service and the IND. I have made the point that immigration
officers and IND officials who deal with such children are specially
trained. I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point on board. It is
important that the IND is involved in such situations for the reasons
that I have given, but it is equally important that the officers are
specially
trained.</div>
					<a name="07031377000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Current
reporting arrangements for asylum seekers do not generally expect
individuals to travel further than 25 miles to report. The amendment
tabled by the hon. Member for Ashford dealt with that distance. If
there is no reporting centre within 25 miles, we will find alternative
arrangements&#151;we could, for example, require the person to report
to a local police station or other identified location. We anticipate
that similar policy currently applying to asylum seekers would apply to
those with limited leave who are required to
report.</div>
					
					<a name="07031377000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07031377000299"></a>
							<b class="B">Damian
Green</b> (Ashford) (Con): I am grateful to the Minister for
giving way, and for her clarification of what she expects to happen to
those who live far from a reporting centre. Can she give us a rough
idea of how many people would be affected by such a policy? How many
people does she expect will find themselves reporting
regularly?</div>
					
					<a name="07031377000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031377000300"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b> That point came up in the evidence sessions. I said
that we expect the numbers for foreign national prisoners to be
small&#151;possibly tens rather than hundreds. I cannot give an exact
figure for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, because we are not
suggesting that every unaccompanied asylum-seeking child will be
subject to the conditions, but around 1,960 grants of discretionary
leave at initial decision were made for that category in 2005, so the
number would be somewhat less than that. I hope that that acts as a
guide to the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
					<a name="07031377000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
reporting residency, it is clearly not in our interests to force
individuals to live in an area where they could not report to the IND
or where it would be impossible for them to find work. If an individual
wanted to find work in another location, the residency condition would
ensure that they kept us informed of where they were moving and, in
some 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column311" />Column number: 311</div>cases, our approval of the new address would be required. Once they had
moved, reporting conditions would be modified accordingly, so that they
could report to a reporting centre nearer to their new home.</div>
					<a name="07031377000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">As to the terms of
residency&#151;I am dealing with amendment No. 129 now&#151;we will
grant leave with residency conditions only where that is justified by a
need for close monitoring of an individual. We have no intention of
applying residency conditions to refugees, students or work permit
holders, as some non-governmental organisations have alleged. We have
already discussed that in relation to students. In the first instance
we may apply the residency conditions, as I said, to certain
asylum-seeking children, with a view to improving child protection, as
well as facilitating their removal at the age of 18.</div>
					<a name="07031377000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is evidence that children
go missing from care, and we want not to take on but to complement the
valuable work done by social services. Granting leave with reporting
and, where needed, residency conditions, should mean that a
child&#146;s absence is noted at an early stage. I think that what I
have said covers some points that the hon. Member for Hertsmere made
about unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. We should be able to
notice an absence early, and establish the reason for it, in which case
all reasonable steps to locate the child could be
taken.</div>
					
					<a name="07031377000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031377000301"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> The hon. Member for Ashford has mentioned the
distance of 25 miles, but I want to suggest the practical example of an
unaccompanied child asylum seeker in Rochdale being required to travel
to Salford, where the centre is. I should feel much happier about the
amount of disruption to the child&#146;s routine if the immigration
officer would come to a centre in Rochdale, rather than have the child
travel across the conurbation, with disruption to their education,
among other things. Would the Minister consider something like that as
an acceptable reporting
arrangement?</div>
					
					<a name="07031377000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031377000302"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b> I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a yes or no answer
for every possible circumstance, but I can, I think, give an assurance
that we intend to be, as the law indeed requires, reasonable. We intend
to be flexible and we do not intend to create huge disruption and
difficulty in the life of a child in the circumstances in question. We
would seek to work closely with a social worker and with social
services and the local authority, to ensure that we could achieve as
smoothly as possible, with the minimum possible disruption and maximum
possible protection for the child, our aims of protecting the child and
subsequently preparing them for removal, on their becoming an adult. I
hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman. As to the notion of 25
miles, although I understand that the amendment is probably a probing
one, we would never put something so precise in the Bill, as I am sure
hon. Members
realise.</div>
					<a name="07031377000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that it is right to maintain closer contact with older children whose
leave is about to expire. That will allow us to ensure that appropriate
arrangements are made for their removal from the UK, or for further
applications for leave. We make no apology for seeking to return young
people who no longer qualify for leave when they reach the age of 18.
Sending children 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 312</div>without genuine asylum claims to the United Kingdom in the hope that
they will establish a footing for the rest of the family in this
country is an abuse of the asylum system, and is exploitative of the
child. Returning those who have been sent in that way, when they reach
adulthood, will discourage that unacceptable practice.</div>
					<a name="07031377000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also intend to apply the new
powers to foreign criminals, of whom we have said less in debating this
clause. They are an important category. I think that monitoring foreign
criminals who cannot be removed at present because of legal barriers,
with a view to their eventual removal, is clearly in the national
interest.</div>
					
					<a name="07031377000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07031377000303"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): Presumably those people
will be of some interest to the police, having been recently released
from prison. The Government already have powers to require them to
report to the police. Would it not be more appropriate for them to do
that, and for the police then to inform the immigration and nationality
directorate of their whereabouts, so that the police would know where
those convicted criminals
were?</div>
					
					<a name="07031377000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031377000304"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, and we
would indeed always encourage our agencies to work together in
co-operation for the best outcomes. It is important that we apply the
measures to the group in question sothat we can effect removal
as soon as possible. That condition is also important because this
period should not count towards settlement&#151;a point that has been
little discussed but which is important to the clause and those
categories.</div>
					
					<a name="07031377000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07031377000305"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
James Clappison</b> (Hertsmere) (Con): I am with the hon. Lady
on that latter point. They should not count towards settlement for the
purpose of staying four or five years in this country. With reference
to the case just mentioned by the Minister, of foreign criminals and
the desirability of having a condition of residence for them, would she
tell us what the sanction is for breach of that
condition?</div>
					
					<a name="07031377000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031377000306"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b> If my memory serves me correctly, the sanctions are
a fine of up to &#163;5,000 and a prison sentence. They will operate
as an effective deterrent to anyone who seeks to avoid meeting the
conditions on their leave.</div>
					<a name="07031377000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I know that
Liberty has said that residency conditions could breach article 8,
&#147;Right to respect for private and family life&#148;, and
article 11, &#147;Freedom of assembly and association&#148;, of the
European convention on human rights. The hon. Member for Ashford was
seeking reassurance on those concerns. I can assure him that that is
not the case. Some interference with articles 8 and 11 is permitted
when it is in accordance with the law in the interests of the
permissible aim of the state and when it is proportionate to that aim.
Case law has established that the maintenance of effective immigration
control and public safety are permissible aims and that decisions taken
pursuant to those aims should be proportionate in all but a minority of
exceptional cases.</div>
					<a name="07031377000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to amendment No. 86, tabled by the hon. Member for Ashford,
and the question of reporting to Parliament on the operation of clause
16, I have some 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 313</div>sympathy with what he said about the need to report to Parliament on
these matters. We intend to be open about the operation of this clause
and about the work of the new border and immigration agency as a whole.
In this instance, I do not think that effective post-legislative
scrutiny would be best achieved by the requirement of an individual
report, which, from the wording of amendment No. 86, would be a
one-off.</div>
					<a name="07031377000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that these amendments were probably written before our new clauses on
the independent inspectorate were tabled. The introduction of that
inspectorate will ensure that Parliament can scrutinise the work of the
new agency. The remit of the independent inspectorate will include a
number of key themes relevant to the operation of the border and
immigration agency, including practice and procedure in making
decisions, consistency of approach, the information it provides and the
treatment of those that use its services. The inspectorate will report
annually to the Secretary of State, who will have to lay that report
before Parliament. Therefore the terms of the independent
inspectorate&#146;s remit meet the objectives of the amendment and I
hope that, following that reassurance, it will be
withdrawn.</div>

							<a name="07031377000307"></a>The

						</b> Before I call the hon. Member for Rochdale, I

						</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s reassurance
on some of the amendments that we have tabled today. However, it is a
pity that the consultation is, as she said, still ongoing yet here we

							<a name="07031377000309"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> If we are not to have a clause stand part debate, I
wish to respond to the Minister&#146;s remarks about my amendments.
In a sense, there is a reflection of the problem with our debate on
this clause: it is almost happening on twin tracks that do not meet
each other. The Minister is dealing with the current Government
intention of the clause, which is to deal with foreign prisoners or
former prisoners and unaccompanied children, but that is not what the
Bill says; as the Minister has honestly admitted, the Bill could be
used for different and much wider groups of people&#151;indeed, it
could be used for any group of people.</div>
					<a name="07031377000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments tabled by the
hon. Member for Rochdale and I sought in part to pin down this or
future Governments on what this clause could achieve. It is worth
pausing to think about that, because the Minister has acknowledged that
the provision could be applied to anyone. It has already been
stretched; in the original regulatory impact assessment it was supposed
to apply only to foreign prisoners, but Ministers then briefed the
various interested bodies that it would also apply to unaccompanied
asylum-seeking children. So, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div>even before the Bill was discussed the purpose of the clause was being
expanded. Who can tell how it will be expanded in the future?</div>
					<a name="07031377000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The breadth of the clause means
that the use of the powers could not simply be confined to the two
particular groups that I mentioned. In their present form, the
provisions could be used to impose a curfew requirement on anyone,
including someone who is here as a refugee and who has been a model
citizen.</div>

							<a name="07031377000310"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b> In fact, it is not possible to impose a curfew or,
as has been suggested in other places, electronic tagging, because
those measures can apply only where we have the right to detain. We do
not have the right to detain those granted limited leave. I hope that
that helps the hon. Gentleman.</div>

							<a name="07031377000311"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> I am grateful for that response. I am not sure that
&#147;a condition about residence&#148;, which is what paragraph
(v) provides for, cannot be interpreted as, &#147;To be at that place
of residence at a particular time of day, every day&#148;. I accept
the Minister&#146;s assurance, but the Bill does not make that point
obvious.</div>
					<a name="07031377000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also wish
to consider the practicalities. I do not agree with all the arguments
about the clause that the Refugee Council has advanced, but some are
powerful, specifically those relating to unaccompanied minors. It makes
the valid point that there is no evidence to suggest that minors are
more likely to abscond than any other category of non-nationals; on the
contrary, it is in their interests not to abscond, as they are
overwhelmingly likely to be dependent on support from social services
for their daily bread.</div>
					<a name="07031377000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, if, as a result of
the review process, a negative decision is made, it would clearly be in
the individual&#146;s interests not to abscond in order for them to
pursue their appeal. It is difficult to see what additional benefit is
gained by the measure we are discussing or how it would significantly
expedite removal when the unaccompanied minor turns 18. At best, it may
well have no impact on unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and at
worst it will harm them.</div>
					<a name="07031377000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister will be aware that
the Refugee Council argues that if any extension of such powers is
necessary, they should accurately reflect their intended targets and
the international human rights standards by which the UK is bound. She
has assured us that certain articles of the various human rights
conventions are not breached by the clause, but she will also be aware
that that is a controversial view. It is a general principle of human
rights law that where individuals are lawfully within a state, they
should enjoy freedom of movement and residence in that state. That
principle is contained in article 2 of the fourth protocol of the
European convention on human rights and in article 12 of the
international covenant on civil and political rights of 1966, which the
UK signed and ratified. It is arguable that parts of the clause could
stretch those particular protocols if not breach them altogether. The
Minister spoke about article 8 of the ECHR, which relates to the right
to respect for private family life and home. She has clearly had advice
that the provisions do not breach it; I hope that she is right about
that, not least for the taxpayer&#146;s sake if we have to fight
cases on it.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 315</div>
					<a name="07031377000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I return to the
practical point. As long as the intended targets of the measures are
not reflected in the clause, we are in danger of allowing through
legislation that is wide open to function creep, that unpleasant
phenomenon that we have mentioned in several debates. We have seen it
happen: section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 was infamously used
against Mr. Wolfgang, the 82-year-old heckler at a Labour
party conference. I am sure that when Ministers passed that
legislation, they did not intend to use it against hecklers at Labour
party conference or people who shout, &#147;Nonsense!&#148; at
Ministers.</div>

						</b> I am feeling particularly generous this afternoon.
I suspect that if they had wanted to, they would have found other means
of imposing their will on such people. Indeed, with the vote coming up
tomorrow, I suspect that they would end up using those means against
their own colleagues.</div>
					<a name="07031377000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a serious point here.
We have seen a notorious example in recent times of function creep in
some serious legislation. It is worth the Committee pausing to consider
whether we are giving too much power to Governments and laying
ourselves wide open to the possibility of the legislation being used
against people in ways that Ministers explicitly tell us that they do
not intend now. We can see that happening and we should not allow it to
happen. We should pass properly defined legislation that aims at
specific targets, does what it is intended to do and does not allow
these Ministers or any future group of Ministers to do things that the
Committee cannot possibly anticipate. On those grounds, I regret that
the Minister has found herself unable to accept any of this group of
amendments. I know that you feel that we have discussed the issues
sufficiently fully not to have a debate on clause stand part,
Mr. Amess, but I urge my hon. Friends to vote against the
clause.</div>

					<a name="07031377000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
far we have been talking about increasing the restrictions that are
placed on people who are granted limited leave to remain. The amendment
seeks to improve the situation of asylum seekers who have limited leave
to remain. At the moment, an asylum seeker who is granted leave to
remain while their appeal is considered is prevented from seeking
employment and must rely totally on benefits. It is an important
principle that people should have the dignity of being able to support
themselves. Engaging them in gainful employment would also offset some
of the cost of keeping them.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 316</div>
					<a name="07031377000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would have a
number of benefits. We discussed underground employment and people
being exploited by unscrupulous employers. That would not happen were
asylum seekers able to work legally. Furthermore, it will be much
easier to keep tabs on such people if they were in
employment&#151;their biometric visas would ensure that details of
that employment and other information was recorded properly on the
system. That would be far better than having them work unofficially for
unscrupulous employers and subject to no control, or not working at all
and burdening the state.</div>
					<a name="07031377000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are seeking to ensure that a
person could seek employment within two months of their asylum appeal
being lodged. That would be welcomed by taxpayers who support them at
the moment and by asylum seekers
themselves.</div>

was referring to the initial application for asylum. Within two months
of the date on which the process is started&#151;when the asylum

seek employment. Those employment rights would continue until the

							<a name="07031377000318"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b> I accept that the hon. Member for Rochdale is of the
view, policy-wise, that asylum seekers should be allowed to work.
However, his amendment refers to persons granted limited leave and so
would not apply to asylum seekers. I understand what he is getting at,
but this would be the wrong place to make such
provision.</div>
					
					<a name="07031377000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031377000319"></a>Mr.
Blunt:
						</b> It would help the Committee if the Minister
explained such granting of limited leave to remain. Clause 16 is aimed
at people to whom the Government would not want to grant leave to
remain, and whom they are in fact attempting to remove&#151;foreign
prisoners whom the Government are attempting to deport. Where does
their formal leave to remain in the United Kingdom come from and who
grants it? Will the Minister explain the legal position so that we can
form a view of the merits of allowing such people to
work?</div>
					
					<a name="07031377000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031377000320"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b> I am happy to provide that clarification, although
we have been discussing the matter for a considerable time so I am
slightly concerned that Members still are not clear. As we said, one
group to whom the limited leave applies consists of foreign national
prisoners whom we want to remove&#151;the hon. Gentleman is
absolutely right about that&#151;but cannot, owing to legal barriers,
usually in relation to the situation in their country of origin. As he
said, another group consists of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children,
who, for the most part, we cannot return to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 317</div>their country of origin because we cannot establish good reception
arrangements. We must put their care and safety first.</div>
					<a name="07031377000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Students and a number of other
groups also have leave, but not asylum seekers&#151;because they are
asylum seekers! Those granted limited leave might well have gone
through the asylum process and been rejected or found not to have a
founded application. However, for whatever reason, we might not be able
to remove them, but must grant them limited leave according to their
human rights, and under the convention and other such legislation.
However, we want to place restrictions on that leave; and we want to
ensure that that limited leave does not count towards settlement. For
instance, national prisoners will get six months limited leave if they
make a claim under the European convention on human rights. On that
basis, they would achieve limited leave, although others would need to
satisfy or challenge a number of other legal conditions in order to
achieve
it.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07031377000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">When moving the
amendment, the hon. Member for Rochdale referred only to asylum
seekers. As a matter of policy, the Government do not consider that
asylum seekers should normally have a right to work. We believe that it
is important to maintain a distinction between legal migration for
employment, and asylum&#151;the latter being for people who seek
protection.</div>
					<a name="07031377000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
already said how the amendment would apply if we were to allow people
granted limited leave to remain to seek employment after two months.
First, two months seems a rather arbitrary time. I am not sure why it
was selected. However, it would undermine immigration control by
narrowing the circumstances in which limited leave to remain could be
granted, subject to employment conditions. The hon. Gentleman mentioned
benefit entitlement. Suffice it to say that that, too, is not really a
matter for us but for the Department for Work and
Pensions.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031377000321"></a>Mr.
Clappison:
						</b> I have some sympathy with the amendment,
because some asylum seekers have talents that could be used to the
advantage of the country. However, as we were warned this morning by
Migrationwatch UK, we need to keep in mind the firm distinction between
economic migration and claims for asylum. Is not the real solution to
speed up the asylum process as much as possible and then to use the
talents of those who have been recognised as having a genuine asylum
claim? Is it not regrettable that, for many years now, the process has
been so very
slow?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031377000322"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b> Indeed; and speeding up the asylum system is the key
to our approach. In fact, we are having some success. The hon.
Gentleman will know that, with the national asylum model, the
end-to-end process is much more effective than previously. It has made
a substantial difference in the time that it takes for cases to go from
initial claim to completion.</div>
					<a name="07031377000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I say to the hon. Member
for Rochdale that clause 16 does not introduce any new restrictions on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 318</div>the employment of persons granted limited leave to remain? As I said,
the amendment would narrow the circumstances in which leave could be
granted, subject to employment restrictions. It could achieve the
opposite of what he seeks, although I understand the point that he is
making.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031377000323"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I should like to put a couple of scenarios to the
Minister to explain when the amendment might apply. At the moment, we
have a number of people from Zimbabwe and Iran who, for various
reasons, are not able to go back to their own country, but they have
not been granted asylum; in the case of Zimbabwe, the process has been
frozen. If a nurse or a doctor from Zimbabwe who was perfectly well
qualified was in that situation, would it not make sense for them to be
able to work and thus be of benefit to this
country?</div>

return is entirely available. However, the hon. Gentleman will know

Government returning people to Zimbabwe; and we await the outcome of
the latest

McCarthy</b> (Bristol, East) (Lab): On a similar point, there
are a large number of people from Somalia in my constituency. We have a
situation in which many of those people are failed asylum seekers, but
there are few forced deportations to Somalia&#151;about half a dozen
over the past few years. The political situation in Somalia gives cause
for optimism for a few weeks and then suddenly everything goes
drastically wrong again. As the hon. Member for Rochdale said, people
who are highly skilled and can make a real contribution are, at the
moment, making no contribution at all and are in limbo. In some cases,
they have been in limbo for many years. Will the Minister explain what
we should do with people in that
situation?</div>

							<b class="B">John
Hemming</b> (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD): Unsurprisingly, I
suppose, I rise to support the amendment. A difficulty raised by the
Transport and General Workers Union and the trade unions in the
evidence sessions is that employers who are in the twilight zone like
to stay there. They like to employ undocumented workers who have no
right to work because they have no rights and therefore cannot enforce
any employment rights. An issue that has been raised and needs to be
addressed is the complex situation that exists in terms of immigration
and employment law and the lack of a one-to-one relationship between
the two. If we are aiming to introduce legislation on the basis of
evidence rather than mere assertion, there is a merit in considering
that issue in relation to the people who have a right to be here and
work. It is clear that some people have a right to be here to study.
Then there are the people about whom we are not quite sure; and then
there are the people who should not be here, and obviously if they
should not be here, they should not have a right to work. We need to
consider this evidence-based question: is it really helpful to tell
people, when we do not know whether they have a right to be here or
not, that they cannot work? Would it be better to say, &#147;No,
let&#146;s not have those people as a burden on the state.
Let&#146;s not have the taxpayer look after them. Let&#146;s say,

relates to the point made by the hon. Member for Bristol, East: people
who have no right to be here, but whom the Government cannot remove
from this country. They may well not be entitled to benefits and cannot
work and are therefore left to destitution or criminality. I am

Green:
						</b> We have no objection to the clause in principle.
The aim is to clear up the problem of failed asylum seekers becoming
destitute while awaiting their appeal hearings, which is clearly a
sensible course of action. My amendment would allow those who have been
given permission to appeal out of time to be treated as an asylum
seeker, by leaving out paragraph (b). It seeks to add fairness and some
degree of justice to the system, because the clause seeks to exclude
from the definition of asylum seekers, and therefore from support,
those who have permission to appeal out of time.</div>
					<a name="07031377000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that the Minister
will treat the amendment as a probing amendment, because I am puzzled
as to how it can be the case that the Government can give someone
permission to appeal out of time and yet say that, while they are
appealing, they are not seeking asylum. On the surface, that seems
contradictory; if there is some legal point that lies underneath the
surface, I would welcome clarification from the Minister. However, as
it stands the clause appears to be slightly contradictory. The state
has recognised that the process on the particular individual&#146;s
decision is not completely over, although they are clearly, at this
stage, on the last knockings of the appeal process. However, as long as
they are recognised as being in the appeal process, it seems, on the
surface, to be straightforwardly unfair that they should not be
recognised as an asylum seeker. As I say, I wait with bated breath for
clarification from the Minister as to why that should be, but as it
stands the clause seems to be straightforwardly self-contradictory and
unfair.</div>

							<a name="07031377000351"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for tabling his probing
amendment. It would perhaps be useful if I were to explain the
situation to the Committee for the purposes of clarity and
scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07031377000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman knows that the clause seeks to maintain the status quo,
whereby we can make available asylum support for those individuals who
have had an initial decision refused and are awaiting their appeal.
Previously, that was always the case, but it has been called into
question in the courts and it is currently stayed in the House of Lords
while we are seeking to legislate in order to clarify the
position.</div>
					<a name="07031377000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we cannot
continue to pay asylum support during that period, we would have to
consider making available support under section 4 of the Immigration
and Asylum Act 1999, which is accommodation and a voucher method of
payment. It has never been our intention that we should move towards
that situation while someone is still in the process of an asylum
application. That support is aimed at those who have exhausted all
means of appeal in the asylum process, but are not able to be removed
at that point in time. Clearly, we would not wish for those individuals
to be destitute and therefore there is the provision of support under
section 4 of the 1999 Act. That support should not apply to people who
are between the point of initial application and appeal.</div>
					<a name="07031377000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason that the amendment
is worded as it is, and also with reference to Government amendment No.
109&#151;a technical amendment&#151;is related to the fact that we
do not only provide support under
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 322</div>section 95 of the 1999 Act. It is also in relation to those who would be
covered by schedule 3 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
2002, which does not only cover asylum applicants.</div>
					<a name="07031377000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our problem, and the reason for
the wording, is that those who are refused at the initial decision have
a grace period within which to apply for appeal. That grace period is
10 working days, and if they put their appeal in within that period
there is not an issue. We wish to ensure that that applies also to
those covered by schedule 3. If it does not, there will be a gap in the
system for some who do not put in their appeal. Even if they make an
appeal immediately it will take some days to process, so there will
still be a gap during which they have no means of support. One can
imagine the cost to the system of people having to go through a process
of applying for section 4 support for a week before going back on
section 95 support. It would be expensive and chaotic and certainly
would not provide people with the support that they need on a timely
basis.</div>
					<a name="07031377000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
ensure not only that people apply within the 10 days and that we apply
the same 10-day period to schedule 3, under which there is no grace
period, but that those awaiting appeal can still be defined as asylum
seekers for the purpose of support and that both those receiving
section 95 support and those covered by schedule 3 have the grace
period of10 working days within which to make their
applications. If we were to extend that to out-of-time applications
beyond the 10 working days, there could be an indefinite period in
which we would be paying asylum support while somebody considered
whether to make an
application.</div>

							<a name="07031377000352"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister not just for giving
way but for her explanation of what is, she will agree, a tortuous
process. I am still concerned whether those who receive support under
one provision or another, or successively under more than one, might
fall down any cracks. They may feel that they are legitimately in the
system, even if they are not pushing it as she has just described, but
find themselves unable to receive support under any of the relevant
provisions. If there are people in that situation, are there likely to
be
many?</div>

							<a name="07031377000353"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b> Our clear view is that the clause will cover the
situation and that we will not have the problem to which the hon.
Gentleman refers. In fact, the clause is about ensuring that such
cracks do not exist and that people have appropriate and adequate
support.</div>
					<a name="07031377000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 109 would mean that at the end of the process, if an
appeal is upheld and it is found that a person should be given refugee
status, that person will have a 28-day period in which their asylum
support will continue to be paid while they move from the National
Asylum Support Service to the usual system and seek accommodation and
support by other means. Those whose appeals are not granted will have
21 days in which they will still receive asylum support before they
either should make arrangements to leave the country voluntarily or, in
some cases, qualify for section 4 support. The clause simply maintains
the status quo; it does not seek to achieve anything else. It covers
exactly the point that the hon. Gentleman made, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column323" />Column number: 323</div>and ensures that there are no cracks through which people can fall. It
covers the situation for asylum seekers across the board between the
initial application, appeal and immediately following
appeal.</div>

							<a name="07031377000357"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> My proposal deals with the issue of failed asylum
seekers, which the Minister touched on earlier. It is important to
understand that at present when someone has gone through all the
stages, section 95 support ceases, the National Asylum Support Service
sends them a letter, they are given notice to quit and then they are
effectively left destitute.</div>
					<a name="07031377000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would have no problem if the
IND were able to cope with the number of asylum seekers and made
provision for them to be removed from this country once their claims
had been dealt with. However, the written evidence from the Still Human
Still Here group shows that there are about 285,000 failed asylum
seekers still in this country who do not receive any support from the
Government, and if the present rate continues&#151;we remove one
asylum seeker every26 minutes&#151;it will take 14 years to
remove them.</div>
					<a name="07031377000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all
know of people whose asylum claim has failed, and many of them are
hugely tragic cases. There are people in my constituency from Somalia,
the Congo, Iraq, Iran and Zimbabwe whose asylum claim has not been
successful, for various reasons. Support is withdrawn and the
Government use destitution to try to deal with
them.</div>

							<a name="07031377000358"></a>Mr.
Jackson:
						</b> I have some sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman
is saying; I, too, encounter such cases in my constituency. If I am
being cynical, I sometimes think that the decision to remove people
goes in political cycles. A year or so ago, a huge number of Iraqi
asylum seekers, some of whom had not even exhausted the appeals
procedure, were removed to the St. Ives holding centre in
Cambridgeshire and invited to choose their in-flight meal for the
journey back to Baghdad without recourse to the system. However, some
people have exhausted a very comprehensive legal system. Surely, the
hon. Gentleman realises that if they refuse to leave, having exhausted
the system at great cost to the Exchequer and to the taxpayer, they are
in fact undermining the validity of the system for more deserving
cases?</div>

							<a name="07031377000359"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point about the
extent to which people might have been involved in the system but, with
respect, that is part of the problem. As such people have been here for
so long, rather than ensure a speedy removal, the Government resort to
the quite inhuman tactic of trying to get people removed by forcing
them into destitution.</div>
					<a name="07031377000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">If such people were arrested by
an immigration officer and steps were taken to remove them speedily,
the argument might have some validity. In my surgery, I have told
people bluntly that they have exhausted the system and have no right to
remain in the country. That might well be upsetting and worrying for
those people, but unfortunately I am only one Member of Parliament and
cannot change the law for particular cases, so I have told them that
they should be removed. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column325" />Column number: 325</div>That would be fine if they were speedily removed from the system when a
decision is taken.</div>
					<a name="07031377000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Generally, this country has
high international standards in how we treat people, and a reputation
for and record of sympathy to asylum seekers. I object because the
tactic&#151;it must be nothing other than that&#151;of using
destitution as a means to try and force people
back&#151;</div>

							<b class="B">Chris
Mole</b> (Ipswich) (Lab): I am following with some interest
the points that the hon. Gentleman is making, but given that a fair and
due process has been pursued, does he not accept that there is
ultimately an onus on the individuals to remove themselves as much as
on the state to discharge the functions that he
describes?</div>

							<a name="07031377000361"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I accept some of what the hon. Gentleman says, and
people in my surgery have actually said that they must do that.
Equally, two wrongs do not make a right and the state has certain
duties and responsibilities in how we treat people. Resorting to
forcing people underground and having them sleep rough on the streets,
rely on charities, forage through bins or whatever to survive is not an
acceptable way to proceed in this day and age.</div>
					<a name="07031377000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are 283,500 asylum
seekers whose cases have all been lost with no right of appeal. Given
that fact and the IND&#146;s current rate of removal, we need to be
doing something on that issue. I cannot believe that the proposed
approach would be possible, but it might be acceptable if the
Government were to start sorting those cases out right away. What is
not acceptable at the moment is using destitution as a technique. In
our fair, just and civilised society we should not be practising
it.</div>

							<a name="07031377000362"></a>Kerry
McCarthy:
						</b> I want to make a few quick points. I accept the
argument that if people have exhausted all avenues of appeal, there is
perhaps a pull factor if life is made too comfortable for them here.
There have to be some measures that encourage them to return
voluntarily. The other day, I met the International Organisation for
Migration, which seems to be doing some good work in providing people
with resettlement packages in their home countries. I return to the
point that I made when we debated the previous clause, about people who
have exhausted all avenues of appeal but who come from countries such
as Somalia, to which it is difficult for them to return at the moment.
We are doing neither forced repatriations there nor voluntary ones,
which are also difficult.</div>
					<a name="07031377000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am concerned that the
Minister has made several references to people in such situations being
entitled to section 4 support, but there seems to be a very low take-up
of such support. In response to a question I asked recently, I was
told, I think, that the figure was 250 people in the entire south-west
region; it may have been 270. That includes not only Bristol, but
places such as Plymouth, Swindon and Gloucester, so the number must be
a tiny percentage of failed asylum seekers not receiving any support.
Why does the Minister think that take-up is so low and what does she 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 326</div>think is happening to people who are not getting section 4 support? The
answer must be that they have either gone underground and are relying
on the charity of friends or family, or have resorted to criminal
activity because they have no other alternative.</div>
					<a name="07031377000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">What analysis has the Home
Office done of the idea that destitution encourages people to return
voluntarily? I have written to the Minister recently about the work of
the Hotham Mission in Australia, which has been taking the opposite
approach in assigning caseworkers to work with asylum seekers. Its
evidence seems to be that following such heavy intervention, more than
85 per cent. of all asylum seekers who have been refused places leave
the country voluntarily on the final decision. The Minister and I are
in correspondence about this matter at the moment, but the argument of
those involved would be that with such intervention&#151;providing
some support and working with families&#151;asylum seekers are much
more likely to return home than go underground and escape the system
altogether.</div>
					<a name="07031377000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
where are we with the section 9 pilot schemes that have been running
and in providing support to children rather than families as a whole? I
understand that the Department is due to report on the outcome of those
pilots soon. It would be interesting to know when the results will be
published.</div>

							<a name="07031377000363"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> New clause 15 gives rise to a deep and important
debate on a clash of principles, each of which is entirely reasonable.
The first is that one should not use destitution as a tool of public
policy. All of us would clearly agree with that. The second is we
should not have a system that will create more demand for asylum at a
time when we know that the vast majority of asylum claims are not true
ones. Anything increasing that demand would itself have bad effects not
only in terms of the system clogging up again, but in encouraging evil
people such as human traffickers to try to use the asylum system. I
recognise the good intentions behind new clause 15, but it is a counsel
of despair, because it says that we need to change the law in response
to what is an administrative failure. That failure, as the hon. Member
for Rochdale rightly pointed out, is the sheer length of time it still
takes to get through the system.</div>
					<a name="07031377000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">In answer to one of the
previous debates, the Minister said the Government are doing better
than they used to do with the speed of getting applications through
from beginning to end. That may be true. In the aggregate, she will
know well that in certain individual cases it is definitely not so, in
some cases to an horrendous extent. I suspect that we have all
encountered in our constituencies people who have been waiting four,
five or six years and longer and who seem to have disappeared off the
radar as far as the Department is concerned.</div>
					<a name="07031377000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless, there are only
two big competing moral principles. One is to say that the process will
always be chaotic and that it will always take so long that people will
be forced into destitution, perhaps for long periods. Destitution in
this case normally means relying on the charity of good people and good
institutions around the country. I am sure we have all met such people.
I had a particularly eye-opening day in Leeds with some of the
organisations there. I met 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column327" />Column number: 327</div>some people who felt that they had been lost by the system and who
wanted work. Some of them, who came from Somalia&#151;this was
recognised by the hon. Member for Bristol, East&#151;said that they
could not go back home. They wanted to work but were not allowed to;
they could not receive benefits, so they were living off charity and
doing voluntary work.</div>
					<a name="07031377000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, that situation is
unsatisfactory, but the solution is not to pass laws accepting it as a
permanent feature. The solution is administrative, not legislative; it
means getting down the amount of time involved in getting from the
beginning of the process to the end, not just on average but for
everyone. I accept that that is not going to happen overnight. As the
situation has built up over time to be as catastrophic as it has been
in recent years, it will take the current Home Office Ministers some
time to make an impact, helped as they
are&#151;fortuitously&#151;by the worldwide and particularly
Europe-wide reduction in the number of potential refugees. We all know
that the peak came in the early years of this century, when the Balkans
were in such a terrible state. The end of that Balkans situation has
had many good effects, one of which is that far fewer people are
seeking asylum across borders inside western Europe.</div>
					<a name="07031377000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless, however bad the
situation is now&#151;and it is bad&#151;I do not think that new
clause 15 and the thinking that lies behind it are the solution. The
solution should be administrative, not legislative. For once during our
consideration of the Bill, I must part company with the hon. Member for
Rochdale.</div>

							<a name="07031377000364"></a>John
Hemming:
						</b> The hon. Member for Bristol, East said that we
need to think again. She referred to evidence from Australia. We should
be looking for evidence on the most effective way of handling the
asylum process. If people are rejected and have been through all the
appeals processes, they clearly have no right to remain in the country
and should go. Is it best to say to them, &#147;Disappear, we
don&#146;t want to see you&#148; or to keep some track of where
they are so that they can eventually be removed through an
administrative process? At the moment we have a process that says,
&#147;Disappear: go and work in the twilight economy or whatever. Do
what you want. We want to pretend that you don&#146;t exist.&#148;
Then, with a bit of luck, some few years down the track, somebody from
the IND might find where a person is and try to get rid of them,
although they will probably just zap across to somewhere else in the
country.</div>
					<a name="07031377000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
start looking at evidence. The experience in Australia is that such an
approach is not the best way of achieving the outcome that we wish to
see: if somebody has no right to stay here, they are not here. From an
administrative point of view, the current approach does not work. The
issue raised by new clause 15 needs a little more attention than simply
saying &#147;It won&#146;t
work.&#148;</div>

						</b> Like other hon. Members, I have a great deal of
sympathy with the sincerity of the views articulated by the hon.

the issue is one of principle, which is why Conservative Members cannot
support the amendment.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 328</div>
					<a name="07031377000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite earlier comments such as
those of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere about the skills of
certain asylum seekers, as I have tried to explain throughout our
consideration of the Bill, the problem is simply that we do not have
enough reliable data and information on which to base a decision as to
whether to support such a proposal. I think that the principle is very
important. In the absence of hard evidence, rather than anecdote, we
cannot reward criminality, which is effectively what the new clause
would do. It would reward people who may well be seriously involved in
criminal activity such as drug dealing, people trafficking and so on.
There has to be a finality in the system. We pride ourselves on the
fact that we have a fair, transparent, robust and humane system that
people are obliged to go through when they seek asylum&#151;when they
are in fear for their lives or in fear of
torture.</div>

					<a name="07031377000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have all had
such cases. I had a case last year, where a man who was born a Muslim
and who had converted to Christianity was being returned to Pakistan.
That was a heart-rending decision for many people involved. I felt
desperately sorry for him. He had exhausted every avenue and, despite
the comments and support of the churches in my constituency, he went
back. I prayed that he was safe and able to continue in
safety.</div>
					<a name="07031377000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">These are
difficult decisions. However, by agreeing this amendment we would
entrench a hard core of people who have exhausted our system at great
cost to the
taxpayer.</div>

							<a name="07031377000366"></a>John
Hemming:
						</b> I have a question of principle for the hon.
Gentleman. If he were shown, from the Australian experience, that such
a measure would make it easier for the IND to remove people who have no
right to be here, would he support new clause
15?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031377000367"></a>Mr.
Jackson:
						</b> The evidence given by the immigration lawyers a
couple of weeks ago, during a robust exchange, was that the way to
offset this problem was to deport people quickly. I am a fair person.
The Government have gone in the right direction, after the calamitous
situation in 2002 when we had hundreds of thousands of failed asylum
seekers, and they have reduced that number. However, as a point of
principle we cannot embed and entrench
criminality.</div>
					<a name="07031377000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no
reason to dispute the views expressed by the hon. Member for Bristol,
East, although generally the Australian example is a tough one and
Australia probably has the toughest immigration laws in the world. I
should be interested to see the information that the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Yardley mentioned. However, at the moment I support the
Government&#146;s resistance to the amendment. There has to be
finality in the system and if we do not accept and respect that, we
undermine the genuine people who are fleeing from persecution, terror
and threats to their life and liberty. No Committee member would want
to support
that.</div>
					
					<a name="07031377000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031377000368"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b> If we agreed to new clause 15, it would replace
clause 17 with a different provision. The proposed new clause seeks to
end destitution for refused asylum seekers in the UK. I accept and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column329" />Column number: 329</div>understand the motivation of the hon. Member for Rochdale in relation to
that. His proposal is supported by a range of refugee and other
organisations. It would also make changes to the health care
entitlements of unsuccessful asylum seekers. I shall try to deal with
the two matters separately, although I acknowledge that there are
strong links between
them.</div>
					<a name="07031377000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand the
concerns about asylum support that gave rise to the new clause, as do
other Committee members. None of us wish to see people living in
destitution. However, the Government cannot support a proposal that
would maintain asylum support, potentially indefinitely, for those who
have made an asylum claim and had it and any appeal rejected and have
chosen not to return voluntarily. In such circumstances, the harsh fact
is that people who do not need our protection have chosen to be
destitute. Returning home is a clear alternative for
them.</div>
					<a name="07031377000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Support under
section 4 of the 1999 Act is available for those who are taking all
reasonable steps to return home, while that return is being arranged.
My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East asked me about the figures
in relation to section 4. The last published figures show that more
than 6,500 failed asylum seekers are currently getting section 4
support. That is a not insignificant number. We inform all those whose
section 95 support is to be terminated of the availability of section 4
support, but they need to meet the criteria. Those who could make a
voluntary return will be supported only if they are taking all
reasonable steps to do so. The support is also available where there is
some temporary barrier to
return.</div>
					<a name="07031377000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those making a
voluntary return are also eligible to receive the world-leading
reintegration assistance that is provided by the International
Organisation for Migration on behalf of the Home Office. Our system of
asylum support is fair. It ensures that support is available to asylum
seekers who would otherwise be destitute from the moment when they
claim asylum in the UK until their claim is determined. It ensures that
those who appeal against an immigration decision flowing from the
refusal of their asylum claim within the clear statutory limits will
continue to be supported during the course of that appeal.</div>
					<a name="07031377000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The level of support provided
includes adequate accommodation, where requested, and cash to meet
essential living needs. It would not be right for UK taxpayers to be
asked to fund on a potentially indefinite basis people who are choosing
not to return to a home country that has been found to be safe for them
to live in.</div>
					<a name="07031377000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might
be helpful if I were to give an idea of the sorts of sums that we are
talking about. The cost of supporting a single asylum seeker is
approximately &#163;106 a week&#151;that takes account of the fact
that not all of those who are destitute and seek support require our
accommodation&#151;which equates to &#163;5,500 a year. Supporting
even an extra 1,000 unsuccessful asylum seekers on that basis would
cost an additional&#163;5.5 million per annum; the cost
would be an additional &#163;55 million for every 10,000 or so people
supported.</div>
					<a name="07031377000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">That money
could be used to fund a variety of other important Government
initiatives. Instead, the new 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column330" />Column number: 330</div>clause proposes that we use that money to provide support to people who
have been unsuccessful in their asylum claim and who are unwilling to
make a voluntary return home. We have a long and proud tradition of
granting asylum and humanitarian protection to those who are fleeing
persecution and torture. Unquestionably the tradition must be
maintained, but the Government believe that, in doing so, it is also
our job to preserve the integrity of the asylum system. It is vital
that the system does not appear to be the subject of abuse. This is not
about meeting a target for the sake of it; it is about doing the right
thing, which is working towards the departure from the UK of those who
have no right to be
here.</div>
					<a name="07031377000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are always
looking to improve our processes. That includes doubling our
enforcement and compliance resource and expanding our activity by
2009-10. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East said, we are in
correspondence about measures in Australia. We are, rightly, always
interested to learn about how things are managed in other countries and
about the success of such measures. We are also always willing to learn
from them.</div>
					
					<a name="07031377000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our new asylum arrangements for
total case ownership will mean that one named officer will be
responsible for the case from the point of claim through to the point
of integration or removal. The case owner will be responsible for all
aspects of the claim&#151; asylum decision, support, appeal and
removal. That does not mean that it would simply be appropriate to
provide ongoing asylum support in all cases until removal is achieved.
We have clear targets for the case owners dealing with asylum claims
that focus on the conclusion of the case, rather than simply on making
a decision or on getting a case through the appeals process. Those
measures touch on the administrative measures that the hon. Member for
Ashford has talked about and demonstrate why we have achieved
considerable improvements in the system. Our commitment is to grant
asylum to or remove 90 per cent. of new asylum seekers within six
months by the end of 2011, having ramped up performance in the
preceding years.</div>
					<a name="07031377000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is all part of our work to preserve the integrity of the asylum system.
The new clause would certainly not help us to achieve that aim.
Furthermore, it might have a damaging effect, given that it would
provide a significant pull factor for asylum seekers who come from
beyond the European Union and those who enter it illegally and work
their way up to the northern states. If a person could make an asylum
claim and be supported indefinitely on the basis that they managed to
enter this country, that could have a significant impact beyond our
borders. We could not contemplate supporting
that.</div>

							<a name="07031377000369"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I have been carefully following the
Minister&#146;s argument. I thank her for giving way, but cannot let
her remark about indefinite support go by. We are clear that it would
be support until the person was removed. In our view, the issue is
about dealing with the administrative stuff as well as the other
issues, not about indefinite support. That is an important
principle.</div>

Ryan:
						</b> I accept that the hon. Gentleman does not view the
process as never ending. However, support 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 331</div>until removal would make a significant change to asylum policy, would
have a significant financial impact and would still be a significant
pull factor, as point of removal is not determined. The difficulty that
I have outlined certainly still
applies.</div>
					
					<a name="07031377000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have talked about some of the solutions&#151;the administrative
solutions and the strengthening of our borders. Another key point to
bear in mind is how we work in the European Union with our partners;
that is also helping us to reduce the number of illegal entrants and,
therefore, asylum seekers.</div>
					<a name="07031377000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that it is
simply a matter of there being less pressure; circumstances around the
world change, but colleagues from Spain and Italy talk about the
pressure and illegal immigration problems that they are experiencing on
the southern maritime border. We are working with them in Frontex, the
European Union border agency, to try to deal with such asylum
seeking&#151;not least because large numbers of people at sea in
boats are at terrible risk, and some lose their lives. That kind of
co-operation is also extremely
important.</div>
					<a name="07031377000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Across
the piece, we have taken clear and determined action to deal with
illegal entry and the level of unfounded asylum seeker application. The
hon. Member for Rochdale will know that applications are at their
lowest level since the early to mid-1990s. Those measures are having an
impact and are the ones that we need to pursue to continue to deal with
the situation.</div>
					<a name="07031377000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn
to health care, which is an important part of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s new clause. The new clause would change the current
entitlement to health care for those who have been unsuccessful in
their asylum claims. As announced in our recently published enforcement
strategy, we intend to shut down inappropriate access to
services&#151;those that are privileges intended for those in the UK
legitimately. At its simplest, that is an issue of
fairness.</div>

important. However, despite difficulties, it is important that we
tackle that issue.
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column332" />Column number: 332</div>
					</div>
					<a name="07031377000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the review, I
say to the hon. Member for Rochdale that it would be inappropriate to
make changes at the moment. The basic humanitarian needs of failed
asylum seekers for health care are met already. They receive free
treatment in accident and emergency departments and for many infectious
diseases such as tuberculosis. For other life-threatening conditions,
and in order to prevent any conditions from becoming life-threatening,
they will receive appropriate treatment regardless of their ability to
pay. Treatment will not be withheld or delayed. Charging issues will be
sorted out subsequently, and trusts have the discretion to write off
debts if it would not be reasonable or cost-effective to pursue
them.</div>
					<a name="07031377000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In
conclusion, although I understand the motivation behind the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s new clause, we cannot agree to the measure for
supporting failed asylum seekers. It would be a dangerous measure that
would drive a coach and horses through our policy and desire to deal
with the issue using other means that are showing results and must be
pursued. As I said, I think that we should await the outcome of the
review.</div>

							<a name="07031377000373"></a>
								Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I listened very carefully to the Minister and in
particular to her last point about the provision of health care.
Nevertheless, we believe that a clear principle is at stake here. The
remarks of the hon. Member for Bristol, East are pertinent to the
argument. Failed asylum seekers might face a choice between
homelessness and destitution, and going back home to face uncertain
circumstances that might be life-threatening. In my experience, getting
them to agree to go home voluntarily is difficult. I dealt with a case
last year in which we persuaded someone to go back to south
America&#151;not directly, but via another country, because they were
concerned about arriving at the main airport and then being arrested by
the police of that country. Through support from the organisations that
the Minister mentioned, we managed to get an agreement for the family
to return by a circuitous route. That illustrates the point that the
hon. Member for Bristol, East, made: one can enable that outcome if one
gives appropriate support.</div>
					<a name="07031377000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The new
clause makes it clear that we are not seeking an open-ended commitment;
we want support to be provided until removal. That allows time for the
administrative process to sort out the matter. At the moment, there is
no incentive for the IND to sort out the process for the huge numbers
that will remain in the country, even under the new policy. New
proposals are needed, along the lines described by the hon. Member for
Bristol, East, to provide that support. I am pleased that more people
are using the process, but 5,500 or 5,600 is a small proportion of
failed asylum seekers. On that note, I give notice that at the
appropriate time, we will want to press an amendment regarding the new
clause.</div>

						</b> We are now moving on to enforcement procedures. The
two amendments that stand in my name seek to deal with those measures,
in the first case by ensuring that any officer who attempts to make an
enforcement has a proper warrant. This is part of the probing process;
I want to establish from the Minister the process by which the
provisions will operate. Secondly, I seek to ensure that the officer is
properly designated, as we discussed earlier.</div>
					<a name="07031377000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions are important.
Exercising those powers without the benefit of a warrant would set a
dangerous precedent. I want the Minister to explain the purpose of the
provision, and I want to ensure that the people involved are properly
designated.</div>

							<a name="07031377000390"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> The amendments standing in my name fall into two
categories. Amendments Nos. 88, 89 and 91 are all similar in intent to
the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Rochdale, because
amendment No. 88 would require the arresting immigration officer in
part 6 of the 1999 Act to be a designated officer under the terms of
the Bill. Amendment No. 99 is consequential on that amendment. In
relation to immigration officers being able to seize cash, amendment
No. 91 would insert &#147;designated&#148; into part 5 of the
Proceeds of CrimeAct 2002.</div>
					<a name="07031377000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have just heard, the
amendments take us back to different clauses and earlier arguments
about the extension of powers to immigration officers. In particular,
they refer to the adequacy of training in what we all acknowledge is a
difficult job, the officers&#146; suitability for the job, and
underlying all that, the required level of public confidence in the
system. Like the hon. Gentleman, I shall be interested to hear the
Minister&#146;s views on whether it would be more suitable to give
those enforcement powers to highly empowered designated
officers.</div>
					<a name="07031377000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 93 addresses a different problem about the cash that can be seized
under the clause. The amendment says
that</div>
					<a name="07031377000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the designated
immigration officer shall deliver the seized cash to a constable within
48 hours of its
seizure.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07031377000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would also
enable the constable to whom the cash was delivered to treat it as cash
seized by him under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. In practical terms,
it would require an immediate handover of cash from the immigration
officer to the police, and its effect would simply be to save taxpayers
money.</div>
					<a name="07031377000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The police
must quite rightly go through tightly drawn and rigorous procedures
when handling cash that they have seized during the course of their
work. Given those procedures, the expertise of the police and the
amount of cash that passes through their hands, few problems arise from
such administration, for which we should be thankful. Amendment No. 93
would allow the police to continue the difficult and sensitive work
that they do well and in which they are experienced, and the Government
would not have to set up a parallel system for immigration
officers.</div>

Green:
						</b> As I was saying, the job of handling seized cash is
done perfectly competently by the police already and amendment No. 93
seeks to prevent the necessity of setting up a parallel system for
immigration officers for two reasons. First, as has been observed, any
change is difficult for the Home Office. Secondly, because of the
bureaucracy that is inevitably and rightly involved in such a sensitive
area of operations, for which proper checks and systems are absolutely
vital, it would be expensive and unnecessary to set up a parallel set
of checks. I commend amendment No. 93 to the Under-Secretary, as well
as the previous amendments about using only designated immigration
officers to exercise the new powers.</div>

Ryan:
						</b> Clause 18 will amend the Immigration and Asylum Act
1999 to give
an</div>
					<a name="07031377000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;immigration
officer the power to arrest without warrant a person
whom&#148;</div>
					<a name="07031377000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">he or
she</div>
					<a name="07031377000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reasonably
suspects has committed an offence undersection 105 or
106&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07031377000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">which are about
seeking to obtain asylum support by making false or dishonest
representations. The clause will also ensure that the same powers that
allow an immigration officer to enter premises to arrest or search and
seize relevant evidence will apply to that type of offence. Giving
immigration officers a power of arrest for those offences will enable
them to pursue independent operations against asylum support fraud,
which is as the Government intend. The measure is an essential part of
the immigration and nationality directorate&#146;s deterrence policy
against what are, as everyone will agree, serious offences, which can
involve a significant amount of money. Immigration officers have held
powers of arrest, entry, search and seizure for a number of criminal
offences since the introduction of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.
The powers came into effect on 14 February 2000 so, rather than giving
new powers, the clause applies existing powers to offences under
sections 105 and 106 of the 1999 Act.</div>
					<a name="07031377000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like, however, to
reassure the hon. Gentleman about the exercise of this power. As I
said, it is comparable to existing powers of arrest that are exercised
without warrant. For example, officers have the power to arrest for
fraud under section 14 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of
Claimants, etc.) Act 2004. It is right that an officer can arrest
without warrant, because that is a serious offence and in certain
circumstances officers need to be able to act quickly.</div>
					<a name="07031377000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Only immigration officers who
have the appropriate training will be able to exercise the power of
arrest. That is a point of concern to Opposition Members, and I wish to
reassure them about the level of training that officers receive. It is
provided by Centrex, a non-departmental government body that works with
the police. That training is therefore undertaken on the advice of the
police and with their involvement. I am satisfied that it is
appropriate. It consists of a three-week arrest course and equips an
officer to search premises and persons and arrest individuals in
accordance with the Police and Criminal EvidenceAct 1984. It
covers a conflict resolution model and safety training, which must be
refreshed annually.</div>
					<a name="07031377000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The training presents greater
difficulties than hon. Members are perhaps aware of when they suggest
that immigration officers are not able to act independently. They are
given appropriate powers, training and oversight. Some of the issues
that we are discussing are not operational priorities for the police,
and the Association of Chief Police Officers is not concerned about the
powers being given to immigration officers because there is appropriate
training and oversight. It is not as straightforward as it might sound
to effect an arrest, seize evidence in order to effect a prosecution
and ensure that that evidence is handed over rather than retained by
finding the appropriate constable. It might sound straightforward but
it can in fact be problematic.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column336" />Column number: 336</div>
					<a name="07031377000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">If immigration officers have the
appropriate training and the police think the powers being given to
them are appropriate&#151;they are not new powers; they are just
being applied to the offence in question and the seizure of evidence
related to it&#151;we should agree to the clause and ensure that our
immigration officers can work effectively against relevant
fraud.</div>
					<a name="07031377000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said, immigration officers already have fairly extensive powers of
arrest for fraud, illegal employer activity, illegal working,
facilitation, failure to report, deception, illegal entry and other
offences. That is just a sample. About 40 per cent. of enforcement
officers are now arrest trained, and a much smaller percentage of
immigration officers at the borders have such training. By 2008, we
expect all officers to be arrest trained. If not everybody in a team is
arrest trained, there must be police support in the team. If all its
members have received arrest training, it can operate independently of
the
police.</div>

Green:
						</b> This is a fascinating practical point. As the
Under-Secretary said, there are currently two tiers: those who are
arrest trained and those who are not. How much extra training will the
arrest trained immigration officers need to become designated
immigration

Ryan:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman refers to designated immigration
officers. That might be where there is a problem in the drafting of his
amendment. I am not clear whether it is unintended or not. It
says</div>
					<a name="07031377000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;designated
under section 1 of the UK Borders Act
2007.&#146;&#148;</div>
					<a name="07031377000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">If his
amendments applied, the only immigration officers who could have these
powers would be those who are designated to detain at port. Whereas the
immigration officers that we are talking about, and the powers we wish
them to be able to use in relation to asylum support fraud, are not
necessarily at port at all. According to the Government, the
designation is that they will be designated as arrest
trained.</div>
					<a name="07031377000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
exercising the power of seizing evidence would also undergo training
with the Assets Recovery Agency. We need to be cautious about not
confusing the use of the term &#147;designation.&#148; Those
officers will be arrest trained in the manner that I have just
explained as they are to exercise exactly these powers in relation to
the other offences that I outlined. However, according to these
amendments, and as we have discussed previously, only those
officers</div>
					<a name="07031377000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;designated under section
1 of the UK Borders Act
2007&#146;&#148;</div>
					<a name="07031377000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">could carry
out this power of arrest, which are those designated to detain at port.
That would not make
sense.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031377000414"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> We could argue that point. However, is the
Under-Secretary saying, in response to my original intervention, that
the designated officers can just be designated and that if they are
already arrest trained, they do need any extra training to become
designated officers at
port?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031377000415"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b> No, I am not referring to designated officers at
port with the ability to detain. The provision refers to teams of
immigration officers who carry out 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column337" />Column number: 337</div>enforcement activities, not necessarily at a port at all and who are
able to arrest in relation to an immigration offence.</div>
					<a name="07031377000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of officers designated
at port, the purpose of that designation&#151;as I understand
it&#151;is that they can detain individuals for up to three hours who
are not necessarily being detained in relation to an immigration
offence and who may be a British citizen. That is somewhat different.
If the hon. Gentleman is asking about the training for officers at
ports who are exercising the powers that he refers to under clauses 1
to 4, I would have to undertake to write to him. That is not the same
as the powers being discussed in this clause nor would these
immigration officers receive the same
training.</div>

Hemming:
						</b> It shows an element of confusion in the drafting
of the Bill that a person needs to be designated for the purpose of
clause 2, but not for the purpose of arresting. There is no statutory
distinction. Each of those are functions for which one is trained. One
presumes that one is a superset of the other; that designation is a
superset of arrest. However, one would expect some clarity from the
Government on
that.</div>

Ryan:
						</b> I do not think that there is any confusion in the
drafting of the Bill. It is meant to be read clause by clause and
section by section, and if that is done, it is not in the least
confusing.</div>
					<a name="07031377000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Designation at port relates to
the power of an immigration officer to detain an individual at
port&#151;not necessarily in relation to an immigration offence and
not necessarily a foreign national. That is the significant difference
between the powers of immigration officers and the powers of the police
in relation to the issue that we are discussing. The offences relate to
immigration matters, not to anything else. The only situation in which
the powers might be applicable to a British citizen is when somebody
somehow facilitates fraud relating to asylum seeker support. There is a
significant difference in the powers and they do not overlap in the way
that the hon. Gentleman was concerned about.</div>
					<a name="07031377000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Limiting cash seizure powers to
officers designated under regulations would restrict the application
and use of the powers. In particular, amendment No. 91 would limit the
exercise of the power to designated immigration officers at ports in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In effect, unless someone was at a
port, the amendment would make it impossible to seize the evidence
relating to the
offence.</div>

Green:
						</b> The Under-Secretary has either just confused me or
illuminated an extraordinary point about the first part of the Bill. I
assume that once someone has been designated an immigration officer at
a port, they do not stop being designated just because they are not
working at a port. Presumably, it is not true to say that a designated
officer will never be away from the port when they could still possibly
be making arrests and seizures of cash.</div>

Ryan:
						</b> The officers to whom I am referring are not
designated officers at port; they are immigration officers who have
been specially trained in arrest procedures. That is not necessarily
the same as being a designated officer at port. A designated officer at
port may well have had arrest training, but an arrest trained
immigration officer operating outside the port is not necessarily a
designated officer at port. Designation as a term does not apply
outside the port, as outlined by clauses 1 to 4, which the Committee

significantly increasing enforcement activity and that is why, across
the board, we want all our enforcement officers to be arrest trained so
that that they can undertake specified activities and the required
level of enforcement.</div>
					<a name="07031377000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a number of
safeguards in relation to the powers that will give some reassurance to
the hon. Members. For example, subject to regulation made under section
4 of the Police and Justice Act 2006, the powers will be subject to
regulation and scrutiny by the Independent Police Complaints
Commission. That is a strength. The Immigration (PACE Codes of
Practice) Direction 2000 will also apply to the use of the powers. A
strong safeguard and scrutiny process is therefore in place. As I said,
only officers who have had the appropriate training will be able to
exercise the powers, and safeguards will be employed to ensure that
they are used correctly. The powers will enable us to continue to ramp
up our enforcement activity, ensure that it is effective and meet our
commitment to deal with fraud of this kind. That probably covers all
the points that I wish to
make.</div>
					<a name="07031377000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, it is
important to bear in mind that we are not giving new powers to
immigration officers, but simply applying them to a different set of
offences. The powers have operated well and without problems since
2000, which means that we should be confident to move forward and allow
immigration officers to use the same powers in relation to this
offence.</div>

seeking to extend the use of trained officers in this area.</div>

for Ashford that there is a little confusion about designation. I
understand the point about clauses 1 to 4, but what safeguards are
there to ensure that any immigration officer involved in a seizure,
arrest or search has gone through the required training? I thought that
the point of the term &#147;designated&#148; in clauses 1 to 4 was
to ensure that those safeguards were in place, and I think a similar
provision would have been pertinent in this clause, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column339" />Column number: 339</div>albeit for a different reason. However, I am happy to accept the

there will be no new appeals and a very narrow basis on which an

drives a coach and horses through what the Government intend. In that
case, we might need another immigration Bill because of not dealing
properly with earlier measures. A later clause on the sale of assets
comes readily to mind; in previous immigration legislation, the
Government allowed themselves the power to seize assets but not to
dispose of them. That is being dealt with in the Bill, but there could
nevertheless be exceptions.</div>

					<a name="07031377000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 132 is slightly
different. In my experience of dealing with applications to enter the
country it can happen, for genuine reasons, that the applicant is
unclear about the operation of the system and does not provide the
necessary evidence in a form that allows the officer to make a
decision. I readily admit that even though a case may have been
formally determined, once one asks an officer to reconsider it,
especially if it is at a port, he will do so if one can demonstrate
that the applicant has not presented all the required information. The
problem is sometimes that the many people who make money offering
advice about completing the forms are the least able to advise
properly; they take lots of money from people and then give them poor
advice.</div>
					<a name="07031377000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
132 would allow natural justice to apply if there was evidence that
what was needed had not been explained properly or not fully made
clear. Another example comes to mind. The Department for Education and
Skills keeps a list of what might be deemed allowable UK courses for
those coming into the country to study who have qualifications from
their own country. I have come across cases in which the course for
which the applicant is qualified is not on the Department&#146;s
list, but once one engages in conversation with the Department, it
concedes and accepts that the course is allowable.</div>
					<a name="07031377000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that that may well
come under the narrow point about exceptions in clause 19, but
amendment No. 132 would allow a little leeway so that people can
demonstrate in a positive way that they meet the criteria. I do not
want them to be admitted if they do not meet the criteria. I merely
want to ensure that when people submit applications, they are given
every opportunity to put forward their best case. Otherwise, as usually
happens, they will be forced to make another application, and if the
increases in costs go through it will be a considerable burden to those
seeking to come here to study.</div>
					<a name="07031377000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister will
take the amendments in the spirit in which they were intended. I seek
to ensure that the new system is allowed to operate properly before
being overtaken by events.</div>

						</b> As the hon. Gentleman said, the Bill is intended to
make much clearer the points-based system by which people can apply for
extended leave to remain or the right to come here to work or study. I
understand his points about clarity, but perhaps I can offer him some
reassurance.</div>

					<a name="07031377000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment would extend the circumstances under which
a tribunal would be prohibited from considering new evidence, although
that might simply be a problem with the wording&#151;I accept that it
is a probing amendment. I think that his intention was to allow the
tribunal to consider evidence that was not submitted with the original
application if the applicant was</div>
					<a name="07031377000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unclear about the conditions
required&#148;</div>
					<a name="07031377000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">and if
the</div>
					<a name="07031377000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;failure to consider
new evidence would be in clear breach of natural
justice.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 341</div>
					<a name="07031377000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why is that problematic? Because
it would make the evidential rules in points-based system cases very
vague. The key consideration would be what the applicant knew, so
different rules of evidence would apply to different applicants. That
approach could be seen to reward applicants who could show that they
did not know what the rules required, while penalising those who took
care when making their applications. Any applicant who did not supply
evidence on time could claim that he was unclear about the
requirements. That would present a difficulty with the whole aim of the
system. People could take a chance on the judge believing them and
letting them submit further evidence with their appeals. We are trying
to ensure that appeals are not simply an extension of the application
process, but the intention behind the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment
means that late evidence could still be submitted at appeal.</div>
					<a name="07031377000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the system, the majority
of people will apply online. We will stipulate what evidence is
required so that it is clear and there can be no misunderstanding as to
what is needed. If an applicant is unable to provide a piece of
evidence, in exceptional circumstances, we will give advice as to what
evidence can be submitted instead. That should not present a problem
with late evidence. With online applications, there will be tick boxes
and if applicants cannot tick them to say that they can submit what
they need to, they will be told that there is a problem and that they
need to submit a certain document. If they are unable to do that, they
will be told to take different steps or to make contact. It will be
clear what evidence is required, what replacement evidence can be
provided when the necessary evidence cannot be produced and what to do
if there is still a
problem.</div>

Rowen:
						</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
explanation, but given what we learned in the papers last week about
the operation of a similar system for medical graduates, I am not sure
that this system will take account of all the circumstances. I return
to the example that I gave about qualifications. When the relevant box
is ticked, the system does not necessarily accept the stated
qualification. What route would an applicant then take to prove that
that qualification was acceptable? If the computer is not satisfied
with the application, it will reject
it.</div>
					
					<a name="07031377000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031377000428"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b> As I have said, it will be clear exactly what is
required for each tier. If an applicant still has difficulties it will
be possible, ultimately, to make contact, but we want a clearer, more
streamlined system. We want to stop the situation in which the appeals
process is simply an extension of the application
process.</div>
					<a name="07031377000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it is very
clear what evidence should be submitted with an application, I do not
think that there can be a reason that is acceptable at appeal for an
individual to appear suddenly with the evidence that they were asked to
submit at application. Of course, that will not stop people having the
ability to reapply, as long as they are in time to do so. If they
submit an application but do not provide the evidence that is requested
and have their application refused, if they are in time they can submit
a further application and that application will not be prejudiced by
the outcome of the previous 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column342" />Column number: 342</div>application. That is the appropriate measure, as long as it is
absolutely clear to the applicant what is being asked of
them.</div>
					<a name="07031377000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, we
want to ensure that there are a number of safeguards and clause 19
already contains a number of safeguards that will ensure that we do not
cause an injustice, which covers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s other
point.</div>
					<a name="07031377000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where IND case
workers believe that a document is not genuine or valid, the applicant
will be able to submit evidence to try to rebut that allegation and
thus clear their name. In those circumstances, for example, it is
possible to submit further evidence. However, where an applicant is
trying to demonstrate that they meet the clearly stated requirements,
it is not appropriate that further evidence should be given at appeal.
Application is about deciding, on the evidence that the applicant has
submitted, whether a decision can be made. Appeal is about deciding, on
the basis of the evidence that the applicant has submitted, whether an
unfair or wrong decision has been made. At the moment, appeal is often
used simply to submit evidence that should have been submitted with the
initial application and we want to move away from that situation. In
order to do so without creating injustice, we want to make it
absolutely clear to applicants exactly what evidence they need to
submit.</div>
					<a name="07031377000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding the
point that the hon. Gentleman raised about difficulties with different
qualifications, he will be aware that in tier 1, for instance, which is
for highly skilled migrants, the only measure is the qualification at
degree level. So, it is absolutely clear; if you are a highly skilled
migrant, the qualification is a degree, and what is the level of the
degree? In tier 4, for students, qualifications are assessed by
colleges themselves, not by the IND.</div>
					<a name="07031377000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman asked about
people who apply to study at colleges that are not on an approved DFES
register, but which are added to the list after an application is made.
That question seems to be connected with applications for entry
clearance. If an applicant was using the pre-checking online system
prior to making an application, it would be clear to them that their
application would be refused. In that situation, the applicant would be
clear that they should not be applying until the college is added to
the register. That is the way that the system should work. So the
pre-application online system will assist individuals in not submitting
an application that will be refused, by making it absolutely clear
whether or not they meet the criteria.</div>

Rowen:
						</b> I am grateful for the Under-Secretary&#146;s
explanation, which is important to the operation of the system, because
hon. Members need to understand how it will operate. If I may, I shall
give her two other examples of cases that I have dealt with in which
the current system allowed the appeal and therefore allowed migrant
workers to come into the country. In one case, which I dealt with last
year, a number of stonemasons were allowed into the country to carry
out some work. They were allowed in because they were to be working on
a local mosque and we were able to show that although a British
stonemason might have the qualifications to be a stonemason, they would
not be able to carve the Arabic words that were wanted on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column343" />Column number: 343</div>the front of the mosque. That to me was an example of a case in which
the qualification is there and is equivalent to a qualification that
exists in this country, but someone could say that extra evidence has
to be shown, which is the ability to do
that&#151;</div>

Ryan:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. Amess. It is not the
intention of the points-based system that where there are skills gaps
and specialist skills are needed, we are unable to avail ourselves of
those specialist skills. Of course that will be possible through the
points-based system and we would want to ensure that that was the case.
There are situations in which individual skills are required and we
need to be able to and will take account of
those.</div>
					<a name="07031377000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
136 would mean that instead of being laid down in primary legislation,
the circumstances in which new evidence would be excluded in an appeal
would be contained in regulations. Parliament could not amend such
regulations, so there would be a significant reduction in parliamentary
scrutiny of the proposed changes to the appeals process. Also according
to the amendment, we would have a statutory obligation to consult
stakeholders before regulations could be
laid.</div>
					<a name="07031377000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondary
legislation would make the appeals system more complicated; our
long-term goal is to simplify legislation. Parliamentary procedures, as
we have seen during proceedings on this Bill, give interested parties
plenty of opportunities to make their views known throughout the
legislative process. The involvement of stakeholders is possible at a
number of points in the process. For instance, Ministers met 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 344</div>representatives of the Immigration Law Practitioners&#146; Association
before the Bill was introduced, and ILPA, along with other interested
organisations, gave evidence at the recent public evidence session at
which the hon. Member for Rochdale was present. Such groups can also
lobby MPs, expressing their views on proposals in a Bill and offering
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07031377000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
shown in the course of proceedings on this Bill just how much
involvement stakeholders can have, so I see no additional benefit from
the latter aspect of amendment No. 136. Overall, the amendment would
reduce parliamentary scrutiny of the changes to the asylum and
immigration tribunal&#146;s jurisdiction, without improving the
opportunities that stakeholders have to contribute to the law-making
process. I hope that the hon. Gentleman has had sufficient reassurance
that he feels able to withdraw amendment No. 136 and not to press
amendment No.
132.</div>

						</b> I am grateful for the Under-Secretary&#146;s
response. However, our debate has demonstrated that we have not had
sufficient chance to discuss how some of the measures will apply.
Clearly, many more issues will arise when the Bill is put into
operation. By tabling the amendments, I sought to give the Government a
little longer to consider some of the issues. I am happy to withdraw
them, because I think that case law will instead be made through the
AIT. The Government might think that they have produced a cast-iron
case that does not allow any exceptions, but I suspect that the reality
will prove to be otherwise. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
