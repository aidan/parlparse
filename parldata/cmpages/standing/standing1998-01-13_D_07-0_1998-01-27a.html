</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I think that we all express some relief at having moved on from clause 1. We undertook an exhaustive--although not exhausting--consideration of the general issues raised by the Bill; we now come to some of the more detailed issues. There is a clutch of such issues in the present group of amendments, which, for shorthand, we can describe as piece-work amendments.
<P>
I want to stress at the outset that there is no hidden agenda behind the amendments because doubts have been expressed about that. There is also no agenda behind congratulating the hon. Member for Stevenage (Barbara Follett) on her Team's doughty, although possibly politically incorrect draw on Saturday. We shall see what happens later. I am sure that the hon. Lady was pleased, just as most of the general public were excited. The thought it right to congratulate the hon. Lady's team, but I promise not to go on about it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hope not, since I support the other side.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I anticipated precisely that, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
There is nothing sinister about the amendments; they are very much in the spirit of the Minister of State's remarks at the end of our previous sitting about the importance of getting things right in practice. Conservative Members accept that point and that the purpose of the regulations--when they appear--is to be non-discriminatory. We would like the Bill to be statically neutral and, to borrow an economist's phrase, dynamically neutral. Through this enabling Bill and the regulations that follow, the Government hold be able to cope with the whole pattern of payment and remuneration ranges that exist between employers and their workers The Government should not drive changes in those patterns unless there are good economic reasons for them. We would not wish a settled pattern of remuneration--whatever it is--to be changed as a result of some quirk or anomaly in the regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): My hon. Friend has told the Committee that there is no hidden agenda, but I have to disagree. Our consideration of the Bill is like ``Hamlet'' without the Prince of Denmark. We do not know what national minimum wage we are talking about. That is the hole in the heart of the Bill. Incidentally, while my hon. Friend is preapred to ingratiate himself with people from Stevenage, he should think of the calamity that has befallen West Bromwich Albion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I fully understand the reasons for my hon. Friend's intervention--my team licked his by four goals to nil. He should show more humility and respect.
<P>
To respond positively to my hon. Friend's remarks, I should say that Conservative Members have no hidden agenda and that it is for the Government to say whether they have one. To pick my hon. Friend's remarks up hastily and before he misconstrues what I have said, he is entirely right to say that we do not know the minimum wage rate. We do not even have a set of Government recommendations for the Low Pay Commission. I have been searching for those like a shipwrecked mariner looking to the horizon for a sail. Everybody else has made representations; indeed, the commission undertook only yesterday what teletext described as its final consideration of the concerns of a number of important persons. Yet, to repeat a phrase that was used earlier, there is no Ark Royal: we have had no statement of the Government's position. [Hon. Members: ``Where is it''] Indeed, I leave my hon. Friends to speculate.
<P>
We have no agenda for restructuring the balance between piece work and salaries or hourly and weekly rates, nor do we want them to be rebalanced except for good industrial reasons. It is not part of our agenda to advocate sweated labour or the use of piece work to achieve that. Certain hon. Members may want to draw the Committee's attention to low rates of pay for certain employment. I shall listen with interest to such comments. For example, in their submission, home workers talk about weekly rates of &#163;46. I wonder why some people are persuaded to work for such rates when a visit to any jobcentre in my constituency would enable them to find manual work, which may not be particularly skills-demanding or intellectually challenging, paying rates considerably in excess of that. We come to our consideration of the current structure with clean hands.
<P>
With her knowledge of the textiles industry, the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber), if she were here, would rightly remind us, as do the notes on clauses, that a range of structures are in place. The issue is not simply whether we pay by the piece or by the hour. Perfectly reasonable arrangements such as guaranteed fallbacks or hourly rates, which can be set by reference to averages, can be negotiated by both sides and are designed to reflect a particular industrial situation.
<P>
Piece work is more important in some industries than in others. I have closest knowledge of agriculture. There are huge differences from the situation I described in a previous sitting in relation to hours. I pointed out that it was by no means unusual for skilled workers to be paid not by the week, but a monthly salary on an annualised basis and to do such work as is required for the operation of the farm. That is a huge change from a few years ago. Within the same industry, however, skilled or manually dextrous people who are, for example, potting out plants--speed is of the essence--may be paid by the piece.
<P>
In its evidence to the commission, the CBI emphasised the importance of payments-by-results systems, which is another way of describing piece work, to maintaining competitiveness. It referred to the knitting system, with 35,000 sewing machinists being paid, on average, between &#163;4.20 and &#163;4.30 an hour, although the industry minimum is &#163;3.20. The CBI states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The piece rate payments have consistently proved critical both to the industry as a means of ensuring good productivity as well as to the employees in boosting their earnings. The industry has found that PBR is the most effective way of managing performance.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The evidence continues that other techniques have been considered, but have not achieved the desired result of competitiveness.
<P>
The CBI warns that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if companies do re-structure their payment systems they risk falling productivity and lower morale, which would in turn hit competitiveness.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That may not be the case in every industry, and it is unlikely to be so. The statement does, however, reflect the fact that a payment-by-result system may be effective in specific cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): Will my hon. Friend speculate on how companies will respond to the circumstances that he described? He spoke of circumstances in which the minimum wage rate was set at more than &#163;3.20. In such circumstances, either companies would consolidate average bonus payments by result into a basic rate higher than &#163;3.20, which would cause a loss of incentive for productivity, or the basic minimum rate would increase, while payment by result would be payable on top of the national minimum wage, which would lead to higher unit costs and a loss of competitiveness. Which course of events does my hon. Friend believe will occur, or does he believe that both are likely?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My short response is that I do not know. The answer will depend on the regulations. I hope that any company that has time to look at the Committee's debates, and to consider the argument's structure and the Low Pay Commission's examination of the matters involved, will not rush to conclusions and will give its own input. My hon. Friend is right--such circumstances would have either or both of the effects that he described. Either the Bill will make no real difference, and a basic rate will consolidate, under which nobody will be better off and incentives will be depressed, or the wage will include some reflection of the piece-work system that may well rebound on differentials.
<P>
I am extremely interested in an answer published in today's Hansard, given by the President of the Board of Trade in response to a question about differentials asked by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood). The Opposition continue to probe that matter, because we have not yet received the answers. The right hon. Lady states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Pay differential between groups of workers is a matter for them and their employers to determine in the light of their company's particular circumstances. However, I am sure that, as part of its consideration of the wider economic and social implications of the National Minimum Wage, the Low Pay Commission will consider any effect on pay differentials when formulating its recommendations to Government.''--[Official Report, 26.01.98; Vol. 305, c. 57.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Commitee will return to that matter when it considers the commission.
<P>
I shall draw my preliminary remarks--rather than those adddressed specifically to the amendments--to a close. The Opposition are not interested in changing industrial structure through the enabling provisions of the national minimum wage, largely because we are not in favour of the concept of a national minimum wage. We realise the risk that the wage runs of affecting sometimes perversely, differentials and the complex and various structures of industry.
<P>
Equally, the Opposition would not like the debate to be caricatured to suggest that we are in favour of sweated labour. The only time that I have ever seen manual workers physically dropping with exhaustion was when I went some years ago to Ceausescu's Romania, before things really got to their bottom. If I had a little more time, a better knowledge of the spoken language and a great deal more pluck, I would have taken those workers away. I have never seen such a deplorable sight. Nobody wants such things to happen, and nobody wants piece work to be used to achieve that sort of situation in industry.
<P>
The Opposition, and all members of the Committee, wish to establish a reasonable and proper parallel in Government policy, between sets of measures that apply to or bite on piece work, payment by results, or other non-hourly remunerative systems, and the hourly rate.
<P>
Amendment No. 14 is about piece work. Amendment No. 98 is more general and deals with remuneration that is dependent on a worker's performance. That can include payment by result more generally, bonuses and other kinds of pay. It might even include a debate on gratuities, which I am sure that you would not wish us to have, Mr. Atkinson. I pass over that except only to say that it is encompassed within that general concept. Two other amendments in the group tabled by Liberal Democrat Members deal with home workers and overlapping employment. I shall listen to the debates on those issues and may wish to return to them.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The essence of the amendments that we tabled and our approach to them is our concern, already expressed, that in formulating the concept of a national minimum wage, which is tied to or expressed as an hourly rate, for hours worked in a pay reference period, there are bound to be difficulties with other kinds of remuneration which are not so tied. The Government's exercise is to second-guess a series of market arrangements. In the past, it has been a matter for private bargain between employer and employee how pay and remuneration has been structured. They now have at least to flow through a gateway which is called an hourly rate for hours worked in a particular pay reference period. Given that parts of the remuneration--by definition, if it is piece work--are not tied to an hourly rate but to some measure of performance, some means must be found for fitting different cases to that template. I repeat that the first amendment is about piece work; others encompass a wider bonus or payment by result system, and gratuities.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will consider our comments carefully because it will be crucial to get these matters right in the regulations if, to use her colleague's phrase, the concept is not to be discredited by some anomaly or problem. The first problem is that some employees naturally work harder than others. Even when employees are equally assiduous, some are more effective than others. I suspect that if we had a needle-threading competition, however hard I tried, with the assistance of my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor), I probably would not do quite as well as the Minister. It might of course depend on whether I was wearing my glasses. I realised that the onset of at least middle age, if not senility, had taken place when I first had to thread a fish hook and found it easier to do so without than with them. We all have different strengths and abilities. There are no doubt some things that I can do better than the hon. Lady. I might even say, modestly, that I can draft amendments better.
<P>
In similar work conditions, even if one assumes a similar degree of motivation and effort, some people will be better than others at carrying out tasks, especially repetitive tasks. That may be fine for employers. It may also be fine for employees who may get a better rate of pay and, assuming that the quality is maintained, contribute more to value added than less productive colleagues. That is a natural difference. But what about motivation? We all know that within a given labour force of more than one or two there will be considerable variations in how people feel about their work. That may depend on whether they have had a row with their boyfriend, whether they do not like their boss, whether they have read something that they did not like in the newspapers about what the Government had done to them or whether, indeed, they thought that the Government were taxing them so much that they had to work harder. Those considerations apply to people who are paid by the piece. Some will try harder, others will not: I bet that the former will resent the latter freeloading or getting the same pay for different results or attainments.
<P>
You, Mr. Atkinson, will remember the parable of the labourers in the vineyard. When the people who had worked an hour were paid the same money as those who had worked through the heat of the day, the latter were not too pleased. There is a long-standing perception that people work in different ways.
<P>
I wish to float two further matters before the Committee. First, people's performance varies over time.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> My hon. Friend touched on an interesting theological matter. Can he reconcile the parable of the workers in the vineyard with that of the talents? I have never been able to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend tempts me on to thin theological ice. I have a daughter who is a theologian by profession: I am sure that she would enlighten my hon. Friend.
<P>
The parable of the talents is based on the fact that the talents were not allocated evenly. I doubt that even the Government, for all their talk about equality of opportunity, will be able to engineer people socially so that they all have the same talents, even though, as I hope, they may be able to offer appropriate opportunities later.
<P>
The personal element of the parable of the talents is that two of the protagonists did their best with the talents that they had been given, whereas the third hid his and did not get on very well. There is a variety of industrial and social situations.
<P>
I wanted to raise two other points. First, a person's performance may be contingent on various factors that may not be within the employer's control. For instance, there may be a breakdown in plant, or supply. The hon. Member for Amber Valley, who has now joined us, was a keen union negotiator and will have experienced such problems. One hopes that payment-by-results systems take into account circumstances--arising through incompetence or through factors outside management's control--in which a willing labour force is not able to work because the work is not there to be done.
<P>
Such eventualities must be borne in mind in the formulation of any minimum wage hourly rates derived from payment-by-results systems. I am not sure how that should be done. I would not rush to exempt employer culpability and management failure within the context of the minimum wage. However, in other circumstances--such as major supplier plant breakdown--it would be unreasonable to insist on the payment of the minimum wage.
<P>
Secondly, people are occasionally unwell, indisposed or perhaps off work as a result of an accident. I shall return to the matter when we discuss disability, but I want to consider the case of a person, paid by the unit or by result, who has injured a couple of fingers and who now wants to go back to work. It is likely that for the first week or two of re-employment, that person will not be able to work at his normal rate. On the other hand, it may make sense--economically, because he wants to work, therapeutically, because it may help him to recover the use of his hand, and socially--for him to get back to work.
<P>
In such circumstances, that individual may find that he is able to attain only half the standard rate of output. If an average rate has been struck by agreement, which is consistent with the national minimum wage, he may not be paid the national minimum wage while he is recovering. The choice is either to pay him separately on an hourly rate, which means that he will be paid more than his counterparts for the same level of output, or to stop him coming back until he is fully recovered. That is unfortunate, because the provisions would be a deterrent to people's perfectly reasonable wish and aspiration to return to work. I hope that the Government will consider such a situation.
<P>
To summarise, the difficulty is of the Government's own making. They have prescribed against the grain of the market for a national minimum wage and they will set that by reference to an hourly rate for hours worked within a pay reference period which allows for salaries to be translated back into an hourly rate. That is still the most typical type of employment and will probably continue to be so.
<P>
However, they have failed to take account not just of piece-work systems--the subject of the lead amendment--or of payments by results more generally, but of the huge range of reasonable bargains that are struck within the free economic system. They will run up against generic differences in translating piece work into an hourly rate and, as they have acknowledged, they will have to think of ways of translating average performance, rather than individual performance, into an hourly rate equivalent.
<P>
I suggested that there may be times when the performance over time either of the group of employees or of the individual employee varies for entirely reasonable and understandable reasons. It would be foolish if the Government were to draft their regulations without those considerations in mind. They would score an own goal and risk discrediting the national minimum wage that they want.
<P>
As I said, the amendments are designed not to subvert the Bill or to create an artificial advantage but to probe the issues. We need a debate--a first reading, as it were--for the regulations that will in due course be drawn up and consulted on. We have raised the issues with the best of intentions and we need an assurance that the Government take them seriously. They must find practical ways of resolving them which will not have perverse or unfortunate consequences, either for industry's costs or for the individual employee.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): Good morning, Mr. Atkinson. I want to address my opening remarks to amendment no. 14, which deals with the serious issue of the relationship between the measurement of piece work against an hourly rate. It is difficult for the Government or any body else to resolve that.
<P>
I am sure that many of us are familiar with the well-established principles, in industry and elsewhere, for measuring piece work through time and motion studies and the like. I believe that most people have now come to an agreement on that in terms of its fairness or otherwise. As the measurement and payment of work has progressed over the years, that has been a matter of much debate.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I want to discuss how we treat home workers, who are invariably paid on a piece-work basis. Perhaps the Minister will dwell on the comments that have been made by the National Group on Homeworking, which clearly has a great interest in this subject. I support greater protection and fairness for home workers; as a group, they have been largely ignored by employment legislation over the years and they deserve justice and fairness. I am concerned, however, about whether the Bill can provide a sensible mechanism for giving home workers the rights to which they are surely entitled without becoming so cumbersome and so expensive to operate that the system breaks down through its own inertia.
<P>
I agree that amendment No. 14 is a probing amendment. I want to know whether the Government think that the Bill should include mechanisms by which piece rates can be fairly established, monitored and enforced in the context of the national mimimum wage. Does the Low Pay Commission have the scope to consider recommending mechanisms for the implementation of the time and motion studies with which we are all familiar from industry? Would such studies be valuable in trying to establish fair home worker piece rates?
<P>
Is it feasible for the Low Pay Commission to support fair time and motion studies to ensure that home workers get value for their labour and that employers get value for money that they pay for that labour? Do the Government believe that such mechanisms are the right way forward to ensuring that the average home worker can earn the national mimimum wage? I am sure that we share that aspiration. I look forward to the Minister's response to that.
<P>
Amendment No. 74, which is in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter), is designed to probe what protection workers have if they are employed by more than one employer. Such workers will invariably be part-time or home workers.
<P>
We know that there is a huge variation in home workers' hourly rates. The available information shows that variations exist throughout the country. A national survey by the National Group on Homeworking shows that on average, the hourly rate paid to home workers was &#163;1.60. As the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) said, home workers take home &#163;46 a week on average. In Calderdale, however, home workers earn as little as 70p an hour. In Nottingham, three quarters of home workers earn less than &#163;2 an hour and in Kirklees, there are home workers earning 82p an hour. That is a pretty sorry state of affairs.
<P>
We must be able to identify how to treat those home workers who have more than one employer. A home worker could pack pairs of tights for part of the week--we have evidence that the rate of pay for that is 60p an hour--and also do clerical work at, I should hope, a substantially better rate. How will the rate of pay received by workers with more than one employer be determined under the Bill and the regulations? One employer might pay well over the national minimum wage whereas another might pay substantially less. What mechanisms will ensure that all employers pay at least the national minimum wage? I look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
There is a case for strengthening the regulations with regard to home workers if they are to receive the same employment rights and protection as those in the workplace. Many employers do not even admit to employing home workers. Therefore, they are far less likely to grant them their legal rights. There is a strong feeling among home workers and their associations that the Low Pay Commission should be able to recommend a rigorous and systematic registration and enforcement strategy with serious penalties for non-compliance. How will the Government address that problem?
<P>
Which employer in the employment chain is responsible for ensuring that a home worker receives the national minimum wage and his legal employment rights? There are many examples of contractors employing sub-contractors who in turn employ home workers in the chain of production. There is a case for those employers having a joint and several responsibility for the home worker at the end of that chain receiving both proper protection and the national minimum wage.
<P>
Home workers are often insecure--they fear for the continuity of their employment. Many worry that their work could disappear with the introduction of the national minimum wage, because employers will have to decide whether they can continue with what are in some cases unscrupulous employment methods. Such employment may no longer be tenable because of changes in the law. The registration of employers should be considered to ensure that that escape route is unavailable to those employers who wish to continue to exploit home workers. Through the Bill, we must remove from those people the fear of unemployment. Again, I should like to hear the Minister's view.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): The hon. Gentleman wants to remove the fear of unemployment through legislation. Can he give an example from history of unemployment being rendered less likely by legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I thought that the ranks behind me might be stirred. I am not an historian; I am a politician and I am dealing with the present, not the past.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In response to my hon. Friend, the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green), the hon. Gentleman owes the Committee a slightly more articulated description of the link between legislation and unemployment. In almost the same breath, I was going to ask whether he would enlighten the Committee a little more about whether he has done any studies of the likely compliance cost of a regulation that is structured in such a way and of the likely response to it of those involved in home working. Whatever feelings he may have about its merits, I wonder about its feasibility and the response of some less scrupulous people to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention because it goes to the heart of the remarks that I made on amendment No. 14. I want to pose that very question. How can the Low Pay Commission ensure that, under the regulations, home workers receive fair treatment and their entitlement to a national minimum wage without a structure of monitoring and enforcement? That opens up the question of how such a structure would be organised, what it would cost and where the money would come from. It is important to ask what level of monitoring and regulation would be needed and how it would be provided.
<P>
I want to address some remarks to amendment No. 75, which is in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare. The amendment concerns the way in which the regulations will deal with overtime payments to home workers and the variable hours that they may work in a given period. The main point is that the days are long past when home workers--often housewives--worked at home for a few hours a week doing some relatively menial and usually repetitive task to earn an extra bit of pin money or to have some extra disposable income to make life a little better. In many cases, home work is now a full-time occupation and the moneys earned are an essential part of the family income. We should, therefore, see home workers in a different light from that in which we have seen them in the past.
<P>
The main issue is that many home workers work excessive hours--sometimes long into the night--to complete their piece work. That brings us back to the relationship between piece work and the national minimum wage. The average home worker earns &#163;46 a week, but does so by working 36 hours a week. That is pretty close, by anyone's calculation, to being a full working week. We are not talking about working a couple of hours in the evening to earn a bit of extra cash.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that many people engaged in home work have other, parallel domestic responsibilities, such as child care, which necessarily make it difficult to measure the number of hours that they apply specifically to work? That very flexibility makes home work attractive to people who might otherwise be unable to enter the labour force.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I listened with great care to the hon. Gentleman's intervention, and he recognises some of the difficulties that are attached to home work. The hon. Member for Daventry said in his opening remarks that it is within the choice of a home worker to go to the local jobcentre and get a better job with better pay doing manual work. The point is, however, that home workers are often tied to the home because they have other responsibilities, such as the care of children, which prevent them from accessing the free labour market and enjoying a better rate of pay in the same way as those without such domestic responsibilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am following the argument with interest. Does not the hon. Gentleman concede that the fact that there may be overlapping responsibilities would at least give rise to considerations as to whether any national minimum wage should be rebated because non-remunerated child minding, or some other domestic or other responsibilities, are carried on in parallel. The argument can be put both ways.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> That is an interesting point. It could lead to a discussion on whether to pay mothers or fathers who stay at home to look after their children. However, I do not wish to stray into that area, Mr. Atkinson, or even to test your patience on a Tuesday morning. I hope that I will be able to cover the essence of that intervention and develop it later in my remarks.
<P>
The point has been made that home workers are often mothers--or, indeed, fathers--caring for small children who are unable to move outside the home to seek better remunerated employment in the labour market. Let us consider an example of working conditions experienced by home workers which I hope will answer the question raised in recent interventions. I have a quote from one home worker whose name, sadly, I do not have. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Last week I couldn't finish the work. They brought three jobs--one urgent. I couldn't do it in one night--I had to leave some and they took it away next day. I spend more hours than they think sometimes. If it's urgent I work into the early hours of the morning.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a direct quote from someone who gains their income from home work. It illustrates the difference between those in the work place, with the usual employments rights and concerns, and those who have to bend as best they can through working at home.
<P>
The Government should demonstrate in this debate that they are considering how the Low Pay Commission and subsequent regulations can address the probability--in many cases the reality--of home workers suffering employment conditions which would be totally unacceptable if they were in the work place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Huw Edwards </B>(Monmouth): It is a pleasure to be called to speak in this debate on the national minimum wage. I was interested in the comments of the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey). I commend him on his speech and on the fact that the Liberal party is now committed to the national minimum wage. When I was in this House six years ago I was involved in debates on a minimum wage and the Liberal party at the time was against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The Liberal party--or Liberal Democrats, as I prefer us to be called--has discussed at great length, in a very open forum, the pros and cons of a national minimum wage. The key issue is that we believe that there should be a national minimum wage. However, the debate is about the mechanism of introducing it, which is why we believe so strongly that regional variations should be considered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> Regional variations are not the point of the amendment. We could discuss that another time. I am happy at the moment to restrict my comments to the speech of the hon. Member for Eastleigh and, less so, to that of the hon. Member for Daventry. He does not want any protection in place for home workers; indeed, his party does not want to see any protection for any workers in this regard, because it is fundamentally opposed to having a minimum wage at all.
<P>
I have been impressed by the contributions to the debate of the Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry, my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney). I regret that he is unable to be here today. I understand that his wife is not well, and we wish both her and him the best.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In response, may I say that we wish to be warmly associated with the hon. Gentleman's remarks? We entirely understand, and are very grateful to the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry for taking on the whole burden of the Committee today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comments. It is also a pleasure to be sitting on these Benches with my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Pond). There must be few people in this country who have campaigned as ceaselessley for the national minimum wage as he has. He has had a tremendous influence on many other people--researchers, campaigners and those in trade unions--in achieving this aim.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> No with the greatest respect, I have waited 20 years for this opportunity and am not inclined to give Conservative Members more than an extra minute or two. I may be more generous later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way on the tribute he paid to his hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham?
<P>
<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> The hon. Gentleman--very appropriately and in the proper collegiate and comradely spirit--was paying tribute to his hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham and his long campaign for a minimum wage. In the course of that tireless, ceaseless campaign, did the hon. Member for Gravesham ever unburden himself as to how much the minimum wage might be?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is a narrow clause, and I hope that all hon. Members will keep within it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> I am mightly relieved, Mr. Atkinson, that you have reminded the Committee that the rate for the minimum wage is not under discussion just now.
<P>
All hon. Members know that the conditions for home workers cannot be divorced from the general pay and conditions of low-paid workers. The protection needed by home workers is the same as that needed by all workers. It is to the Government's credit that the Bill covers homeworkers.
<P>
The protection for homeworkers has been slow in coming. The House of Lords established a Select Committee in 1888 to examine what was then called outworking. If the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) cares to listen, he will hear me pay tribute to a great former member of his party. In the first decade of this century, the then Liberal Government were examining the question of low pay and introducing the wages councils. The President of the Board of Trade was Sir Winston Churchill--a Liberal at the time despite his tendency to switch horses--who famously said that, without some form of protection, the good employer would be undercut by the bad employer and the bad employer undercut by the worse. The hon. Member for Daventry does not need to go to Romania to find bad employers: he can find them anywhere in this country, even in Daventry.

<P>

<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> Hon. Members are jumping up and down like ninepins, even though there are not nine of them.
<P>
In 1906, the wages councils provided some measure of protection, but many home workers would have been blissfully unaware of that. I know that because, about 15 or 16 years ago, I worked in a west London pub and I did not know that wages councils covered such work, nor whether the &#163;1.75 an hour that I earned was the rate that they laid down.
<P>
In 1978-79, a private Member's Bill was introduced by Mr. Frank White, giving protection and employment rights to home workers. Other Members of Parliament supporting that Bill included Jack Ashley, Jim Callaghan and Betty Boothroyd. However, in 1979, the Conservative Governement cam into power and ensured that the protection that existed for many workers would be removed. By 1993, protection under the wages councils was removed for all but agricultural workers.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Eastleigh said, the nature of homeworking has changed. The traditional profile of home working was in packing, assembly work and the manufacture of garments and Christmas decorations--the sweatshop of the bargain basement. However, in the past 15 or 20 years, the rise of new technology has led to new forms of home working. New piece work jobs--making circuit boards, word processing, teleworking and so on--have been created and are performed by people in the home. All those people are now included in the broad remit of home working. As is widely known, most home workers are women who have children. One in two home workers comes from an ethnic minority. According to the national survey to which the hon. Member for Eastleigh referred, home workers on average work 36 hours per week, for &#163;46.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> I shall not give way at the moment.
<P>
It is important to realise that that figure is based on research carried out in 1991 and 1992. Recent research, published in 1996, shows that the average pay of home workers may now be as much as &#163;3. That does not show employers' great generosity, but the changing nature of home working, and the way in which new forms of home working have developed. Those new forms of home working are not in the sweated trades with which such work has traditionally been associated.
<P>
Home workers usually incur costs that factory workers do not. They are often excluded from health and safety legislation, and often have to work to intolerable deadlines, and spend long hours doing tedious repetitive work for which many people believe that women have a special aptitude.
<P>
I am reminded of a quotation from a former Welsh Office Minister, who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Whether driving buses or operating computers in the office, and so on, a woman is on an equal plane with a man for any job. In some circumstances, she is better placed. Just ask Hitachi and other electronics firms that want to have components put together. The small fingers then come into their own.''--[Official Report, 2 March 1987; vol. 111, c. 628.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those were the words of a Welsh Office Minister, opposing minimum wage legislation in the 1980s. It is peculiar that such arguments are never used about microsurgery. It is never said that women have a particular aptitude for microsurgery because they are specially dextrous.
<P>
It will be to the Government's credit that home workers will be included in the national minimum wage. The measure is universal, and will give protection to women with children, to women from ethnic minorities and to women in general.
<P>
There is no work ethic that is the same as the work ethic of the low-paid, especially that of home workers. I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I want to respond to one of the many disparate points made by the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards). He said that the average wage for home workers has markedly increased during the past few years, as different types of home working have arisen.
<P>
I put it to him and to the Committee that that point is a prime example of how the minimum wage will provide artificial protection for workers who receive low pay. The changing nature of markets and of work is a guarantee that in the real world, the wages of the low-paid will increase.
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> It just occurred to me that under certain definitions it could be said that Bill Gates, who started his work in a garage, was a home worker. Presumably, all members of the Committee would agree that he has since been well remunerated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes the point very dramatically. The hon. Member for Monmouth also seemed to imply with his attach on repetitive and boring work that such work is not fit for workers in Britain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The hon. Gentleman did not give way much to others. I shall finish my point, and then give way, showing greater generosity than he did.
<P>
Britain is exporting such jobs precisely at the same time at which British home workers are moving up the wage scale. Two of the hon. Gentleman's examples exemplify the reasons why a free, flexible labour market advances the interests of the low-paid and does not simply export their jobs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> I did not imply that such work was not fit for British people. I was simply suggesting that they should receive fair remuneration for doing such work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept the logical consequence. If the economic product of those jobs can justify only low wages, such jobs will be exported to low-wage economies, in countries such as China. Those jobs may disappear; indeed, some have. The chairman of the Low Pay Commission made the explicit point that some jobs are better not done. So far, the Government have skilfully avoided committing themselves on whether they share that view.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend will have noticed that I have tabled for tomorrow a question to the Secretary of state for International Development. We shall probe the equity of imposing the national minimum wage outwith these shores in relation to aid programmes and contracts for which the Government are paying. If the argument is so compelling and it is right to have a national minimum wage in this country, it is not self-evidently equitable to deny people who are involved with this country but are outwith the jurisdiction the benefits--or otherwise--of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. We would be exporting a mechanism that would destroy jobs and make employment less likely. We can improve the Bill by tabling amendments restricting the application of the national minimum wage as much as possible.
<P>
I want to put to the Minister a series of questions that I hope will be cleared up. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry has made it clear that the amendment is a probing one, but it goes to the heart of one of the problems with the Bill. We have already heard that the Government want a simple national rate with no variations by region, for age or for small firms. We have also heard that wages councils regulations were often not known to large numbers of workers who were covered by them, and that the stark simplicity of a single national minimum wage rate will bring people into the net and allow them to enjoy its alleged benefits.
<P>
The clause--45 lines of regulations--simplicity is a chimera. The amendment would tie down the Secretary of State so that the uncertainty provided by discretion would not become too great. Piece workers and home workers would thus have greater certainty. The amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry refers to piece workers, who represent those who are paid in unorthodox ways that do not fit in with the normal arrangements of those in regular salaried employment.
<P>
The notes on clauses make an understated point, saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The regulation-making power needs to be particularly flexible so as to cover a wide range of possible permutations and a wide range of working situations.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Indeed so. There is a degree of desperation in the listing of the many types of remuneration and ways of earning a living.
<P>
Such complexity is unnecessary, will be costly and could be extremely damaging. Labour Members may be surprised by an illustration from the west midlands Low Pay Unit. Such units are not often quoted by Conservative members. I congratulate the honourable Member for Gravesham, if it was he, on thinking up that name. That device made a pressure group sound as though it had some official status--a simple but brilliant way of campaigning. The group clearly had no official status, but in a burst of social entrepreneurship it appears to have sub-divided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chris Pond (Gravesham)</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am more than happy to give way to the honourable Gentleman if he will answer the question asked by my honourable Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor). Did he at any stage while he was running the Low Pay Unit say what the national minimum wage should be?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> I cannot take credit for the name--that was given by the current Minister for Welfare Reform, my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), my predecessor at the Low Pay Unit. I would not want to take the credit for that act of genius.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The hon. Gentleman is characteristically generous, but also characteristically silent on what he thinks the national minimum wage should be.
<P>
<B>Mr John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): I understand my hon. Friend's desire to elicit a response from the hon. Member for Gravesham on the figure that he favours, but does my hon. Friend, who is a keen student of history, know whether the hon. Member for Gravesham has expressed support for a particular figure? If so, is he inclined today to repent for that?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman responds to that, I remind hon. Members that this debate is not about the level of the minimum wage.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am more than usually happy to accede to your reminder, Mr. Atkinson, because the honest answer to my hon. Friend's question is, ``I don't know''. I have the feeling that I am not going to be enlightened by the hon. Member for Gravesham.
<P>
With reference to the complexity and resultant added costs for business arising from the regulations under the clause, the submission to the Low Pay Commission from the west midlands Low Pay Unit states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``By excluding hours and patterns of work from the list of explicitly protected characteristics, then there is potential for these disadvantaged groups to end up with lower levels of minimum wage protection than other workers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Essentially, it demands greater and more detailed regulation. Labour Members may well regard that as a price worth paying, but the Minister should say explicitly whether that is one of the aims of the Bill.
<P>
Do the Government think that it is worth having much greater micro-regulation and checking of business so that those workers who fall into the difficult categories of piece workers and home workers are properly covered by the regulations? Are they prepared to do that? Have they done a proper compliance cost assessment? It is important for businesses to be able to plan and to know, whatever rate is decided on, to what degree of regulation they will be subject. It would be irresponsible for the Government to continue without giving business the details of that regulation.
<P>
The west midlands Low Pay Unit also pointed out that excluding groups of workers such as piece workers or allowing them to fall through the gaps
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would fly in the face of the spirit of the National Minimum Wage as a measure for providing greater equality within the workforce.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So one purpose of the national minimum wage is to provide greater equality within the work force--that is an interesting proposition. Would the Minister use that as a measure of success for the national minimum wage? Should the various groups of workers, such as piece workers and home workers, who are remunerated in unorthodox ways be given greater equality? The Government have made it clear that they want the wages of such workers to rise--otherwise the Bill would have no purpose--but the explicit aim of greater equality in the work force has not yet been addressed. I think that it should be.
<P>
Similar points are made by other offshoots of the empire of the hon. Gentleman for Gravesham. The hon. Gentleman will be glad to hear that the Scottish Low Pay Unit makes a point with which I almost completely agree. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The legislation should, wherever possible, avoid the cumbersome systems which prevailed under the old Wages Council orders.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Some of those orders, which related specifically to groups such as piece workers, were inevitably complicated. The unit says that the systems
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``operated to the detriment of workers by creating a degree of ambiguity within which their true entitlement could be deliberately concealed.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, the Scottish Low Pay Unit comes at the problem from a particular direction and assumes in that quote that there are many rogue or cowboy employers who deliberately do down workers such as piece workers because of the system's difficulties. I would not necessarily agree totally with its analysis. It makes the specific point, however, that workers in industries with largely unorthodox methods of pay might be particularly vulnerable to rogue employers. Again, we encounter the underlying point that the Government need to tell us what degree of regulation they are prepared to countenance to ensure that all workers in the various industries that we are discussing are properly covered.
<P>
The other particularly relevant information that the Scottish Low Pay Unit provides is a list of types of compensation that should be specifically excluded from the calculation of the minimum wage for the workers we are considering. The list includes: compensation for previous underpayments; reimbursement of expenses; loyatly payments for seasonal workers; shift allowances and anti-social hours payments; allowances for purchase or maintenance of tools and equipment; and tips, gratuities and service charges. Those are the practical types of payment that such workers will get. It would be interesting and useful for the Committee to know whether the Minister agrees with the Scottish Low Pay Unit that such payments should be specifically excluded from the calculation of a national minimum wage.
<P>
The amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats on home workers have similar, but also different effects. The National Group on Homeworking deals with the detailed prescriptions that it thinks are needed to protect home workers in a practical way. It makes seven specific points, to which I hope the Minister will address herself in her reply.
<P>
The group's first point is that there is a need for provision in the Bill for fair time and motion studies to set piece rates. I would be interested to hear what plans the Government or the Low Pay Commission have to set such time and motion studies in operation to meet that demand. Or do the Government think that such information is already available and that special time and motion studies do not need to be set in place? If we need special studies, it would help the Committee and employers of home workers if the Minister could give some idea of their overall cost. It is equally critical to know who is likely to bear that cost? We already know that the food industry is bearing the cost of the imposition of the Food Standards Agency. We should know whether employers are going to bear the cost of any studies into the ways in which they pay their workers, which may be introduced as a method of checking whether they obey national minimum wage regulations. That may have an indirect effect on the wages those employers are able to pay.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that if, following investigation, a business is found to be complying exactly with the law, the cost should be borne by the state and not the business which, as has been proven, has not offended against the law?
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I completely agree with my hon. Friend on that point. I dare say that if that is the way that things are going, he and I are likely to be disappointed. I think it extremely unlikely that any Government who imposed those extra costs on businesses would resile from imposing them simply because the business was shown to be obeying the law and behaving properly, as I expect the overwhelming majority of businesses already do and will continue to do, even when they have to face the problems that will be created by the national minimum wage.
<P>
The other point was that provision should be made for home workers' overheads. Home workers have special overheads, unlike those who go to a place of work where heat and light are provided by an employer. The National Group on Homeworking recognised that. It makes the point that home workers do not pay just for utilities but also telephone bills. The group believes that provision should be made in the Bill for home workers' overheads and suggests a 10 per cent. premium above the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I do not wish to anticipate the next amendment, but does my hon. Friend agree that a perfectly rational solution in relation to the problem is to deal with this issue in relation to the national minimum wage in the same way that it is dealt with by the Inland Revenue in relation to tax? A home worker should be allowed to offset part of the cost of maintaining and running his home against his income for income tax purposes. That should also be allowable in calculating the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That certainly seems to be a sensible, neat and consistent solution. Therefore, I expect that it will not be adopted.
<P>
There are other groups of workers who are not often regarded as piece workers but who may fall into categories in which, at one stage of their career, they will be subject, under certain calculations, to the national minimum wage. I am thinking particularly of barristers' pupils. People always think of barristers as working in an extremely high-paid profession, and assume that the Bill and this part of it in particular has nothing to do with them. In many ways, that is not the case. In competing for good young barristers, some chambers offer proper salaries. However, the majority offer a very small amount of money--almost a scholarship--and then pay the pupil barristers small amounts of money per case. Clearly, given the hours worked, pupil barristers work for a lot less than any national minimum wage. It would be perverse if a side effect of the Bill would be effectively to remove the small amount of money available through those scholarships simply because many sets of chambers could not afford to pay the full rate. They would be willing to try and help pupil barristers in their early years when they do not earn much money, but would be legally prevented from doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Has it occurred to my hon. Friend tht the researchers employed by certain Members of Parliament might fall into that category? They work very long hours for relatively nominal sums of money but they do something which they enjoy and which will further their future careers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is a good point, which my hon. Friends may wish to develop.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Before my hon. Friend leaves the question of pupil barristers--about which the Minister will also be interested--let me ask him whether he has noticed that the Inland Revenue has recently standardised the treatment of those various honoraria and scholarships, which are now all treated as income for the first time? Has he also noticed the disturbing development according to which the Revenue has proposed taxing fees on a cash basis which would have extremely unfortunate consequences for young barristers, especially those coming from non-privileged backgrounds?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. I am not sure how far, Mr. Atkinson, you would allow me to dilate on it.
<P>
The point about tax is directly relevant. The Inland Revenue moved to tax such honoraria when it noted that their use had grown in response to a market need for barristers. One effect of the Bill might be to render such honoraria impractical, and I hope that the Minister, who has considerable legal expertise, will consider that.
<P>
The single theme linking the illustrations that I have given is that there is a tension between security for the low paid, which the Bill is intended to secure, and the practicalities that force the Government to give the Secretary of State as much flexibility in regulations as possible. The amendments make that tension clear. If passed, they would restrict the Secretary of State a little, by making the Bill cover in some detail the circumstances of piece workers and home workers.
<P>
The Government should ponder where they stand with regard to that tension. Labour and Liberal Democrat Members believe--erroneously--that complete security for workers can be achieved through legislation. The opposite end of that continuum is complete flexibility, which the Government reject. The Minister should make the Government's position clear when she responds to the amendments.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> I begin by thanking all hon. Members for their expressions of support for my hon. Friend the Minister of State, and I welcome especially the remarks of the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
The debate has been interesting. I welcome the conversion of Conservative Members to the need to ensure good working conditions for home workers, and to the need to enforce the national minimum wage effectively. It would be churlish to say that that conversion has come a little late in the day, but I welcome it anyway.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Daventry said, after all the time spent on the important discussion of clause 1, it is a relief to get to clause 2, the effect of which I wish to clarify. The notes on clauses explain the intention behind the clause, but it will do no harm to repeat the explanation.
<P>
I emphasise that clause 2 does not deal with setting the rate for the national minimum wage: you, Mr. Atkinson, pointed that out a couple of times this morning. The power to set the hourly rate is contained in clause 1. Nor does clause 2 cover the amounts workers should be paid or the benefits that they receive: it does not interfere in pay arrangements.
<P>
Clause 2 provides a power for the Secretary of State to determine which elements of pay and benefits count when assessing whether a worker has received the national minimum wage. That is an important difference. The clause also enables the Secretary of State to determine whether, and to what extent, payments for work at different times and rates can count towards the calculation of whether a worker has received the national minimum wage. I emphasise that the clause is designed to provide a means of determining how to calculate a worker's hourly rate of pay to enable that to be compared with the hourly rate of the national minimum wage in the many circumstances in which an employee may be working.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The clause refers to no fewer than 13 factors in respect of which regulations shall be made. In their submission to the Low Pay Commission, will the Government offer a view on one or more of those factors?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman tries again to tempt me, but I am a hardy soul--I shall resist. He will take great pleasure in seeing the evidence and find it impressive reading.
<P>
The clause is framed in such a way as to enable flexibility; indeed, that is necessary. Hon. Members have dwelt on the number of working patterns in this country. The note circulated by my hon. Friend the Minister of State last week illustrated the range of pay and benefits that the regulations will have to deal with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The Minister may recall that I have already raised this point, but it relates most closely to the clause. The Minister of State's note on remuneration did not refer to pension payments. Does she regard them as part of remuneration? How will they be treated in relation to the national minimum wage?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> My hon. Friend the Minister of State made it very clear that the note was meant to be helpful with regard to some of the definitions of remuneration. Much as the hon. Gentleman might invite me to do so, I shall not second-guess the Low Pay Commission. What would have been the point in giving the commission this important job if the Government--or, indeed, the Opposition--were to second-guess that vital undertaking?
<P>
As anyone who knows me will testify, I am usually a trusting soul, but I suspect that the amendment has been tabled to ensnare me into making a commitment that a particular element of pay will or will not be included in the definition of remuneration. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) has tried to do just that, which shows that one cannot be too trusting in the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am prepared to concede that the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, characteristically ingenious though it was, was designed to ensnare the Minister. However, I simply invited her to say whether the Government will submit evidence on those points. I am not asking her to tell me the Government's view; I simply want to know whether the submission will cover those matters. Would that be another example of second-guessing? If so, why are the Government making a submission?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> It is not for me to say, Mr. Atkinson, but that was a lengthy intervention. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not be so impertinent as to want me to answer before a view has been submitted to the Low Pay Commission. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his honesty because he has confirmed my suspicion. He made a clear attempt to entrap me, which I shall do my best to resist.
<P>
As the Committee will have seen from the Department's note on remuneration, this is a complex matter on which we have asked the Low Pay Commission to advise us. The hon. Member for Daventry made several interesting points, and I accept that he wanted to raise genuine issues. I feel sure that the Low Pay Commission will deal with them.
<P>
It is good to see that Opposition Members are keen to ensure that, by tabling amendments, they make the Bill adhere to the principle of universality. They clearly want the Bill to be able to deal with piece workers, workers with more than one employer, home workers, and employees who earn performance pay. On that subject, the hon. Member for Daventry mentioned threading a needle, but I have to confess in all honesty that I would be no better at it than him. I am afraid that I am at the stage where I need glasses, but I am too vain to get a pair. I would not beat the hon. Gentleman in that sense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am not an optician and I am not asking for any commission, but I would be delighted to recommend a solution as a result of which I have been able, for the first time in quite a number of years, to look down and up and see my notes and members of the Committee simultaneously. That has transformed my life.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> You will be grateful to know, Mr. Atkinson, that I shall not dwell on that point, but I shall certainly see the hon. Gentleman later, as they say.
<P>
Clearly, the Government and the Opposition agree about universality. That is why the Government have already provided for the Bill to do exactly what the amendments propose and why they are unnecessary.
<P>
On amendment No. 14, the Government of course want to be able to cater for piece workers. Many of them work at home and they are among the most vulnerable workers. My hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth made an impassioned and erudite speech in which he examined the history of legislation on such workers and the position of the most vulnerable. Such workers tend not to have representation. As we heard on Second Reading, some of the rates paid to piece workers are pitiful. One of the examples that we were given was of a machinist who earned 8p for each pair of trousers sewn. That is something that we want to end.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> There is no doubt that home workers who are paid on piece rates are some of the most vulnerable workers. Does the Minister accept, however, that vulnerability in this case means vulnerability not only to exploitation, but to loss of employment? Such work will be the most likely to go altogether if the minimum wage forces the piece rates that are paid to home workers above the economic value of their work.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not defending the paying of 8p a pair--I hope that no Member of the House would do that. Quite apart from everything the Bill will do in terms of social justice, it will mean that there is a floor below which wages cannot fall. Let us make no mistake--many companies that rely on home working and piece working pay workers at a level that is a credit to them and which aids their competitiveness. A floor will, however, ensure that an area exists in which there is no competitive disincentive for people to pay proper rates.
<P>
The Bill already does what amendment No. 14 proposes. Clause 2(2)(c), which is the subject of the amendment, already makes it possible for regulations to specify how to calculate, for example, an hourly rate for piece workers and any others whose remuneration is not on a time basis so that it can be compared with the hourly rate of the national minimum wage.
<P>
With regard to amendment No. 74, we have already discussed--
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I will not give way at the moment because I want to make some progress.
<P>
We have already discussed the statuses of employers at some length under an earlier amendment. You will be relieved to know, Mr. Atkinson, that I do not intend to re-open that issue. Of course I am pleased that the hon. Member for Eastleigh is keen to ensure that the Bill covers circumstances where a worker works for more than one employer in two or more different jobs. We recognise that changes in the labour market mean that there are workers in such situations. I am pleased to inform the Committee that the Bill already caters for such workers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Where?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I was not sure whether that was a sedentary intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Yes, it was.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> It was difficult to know whether the hon. Gentleman was standing, but I think that we have heard enough heightist jokes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Those in glass houses--
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Exactly. If the hon. Gentleman will tame his patience, all will be revealed to him.
<P>
Under clause 1, a worker is entitled to receive the national minimum wage from his or her employer. The employer is the person for whom the worker works. If the employee has two jobs, he or she is entitled to have the national minimum wage from each employer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I do not seek to trap the Minister, but is she saying that that would apply if the employee was employed simultaneously? The employee could be retained on a salary by one employer while doing piece work--marking GCSE scripts, for example--simultaneously.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Absolutely. Such situations may appear complex, but there are very many examples. An employee who is working for more than one employer simultaneously would be entitled to receive the national minimum wage from each of his or her employers.
<P>
There is no difficulty in calculating a worker's hourly rate of pay whether he or she works for one or more than one employer. Clause 2 provides the means to do that for a variety of working arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I think that the Minister has just dropped a clanger, to judge by the expressions on the faces of Labour Members at the back of the Room. Am I correct in understanding that an employee would be entitled to claim the national minimum wage from more than one employer at one time for work in respect of the same period?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Yes, of course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> For work in respect of the same period?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Let me give the hon. Gentleman an example. It is common in London for someone to do a job, for example, at a place where there is more than one employer. If there is a working relationship in which more than one employer is involved, if each employer has a separate contract of employment with that employee and each pays national insurance contributions and tax contributions in respect of that employee, and if it is recognised that there are two employers, then of course the employee would be entitled to the national minimum wage from each of them. We are dealing with the circumstances in which an employee would do separate pieces or work for those people, perhaps during the same working day. There is no contradiction and the solution is simple.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> To prevent all doubt, let us assume that a worker has two employers, each of whom pays in relation to parts of a pay reference period. Would it be possible for an employer paying less than the national minimum wage in relation to some part of that pay reference period to argue that he had no legal responsibility to make up what he pays to the national minimum wage if the worker's other employer was paying above the national minimum wage? Would it be possible to take an average of the rate paid by different employers in respect of one worker?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman and his colleagues confuse the matter. We are talking about one worker with more than one employee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Employer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful. We are talking about one worker with more than one employer who, under separate contracts of employment, is entitled to receive the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> May I finish? I shall then give way one final time, even though that might displease the Whip. The clause is quite clear, and I hope that I have explained the matter fully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I wish to ask a genuine question about a person who works for two different employers in the same hour. In an earlier sitting the Minister of State gave the example of a security guard who works all night for a low rate of pay. Many security guards in such circumstances do not have to do anything. [Hon. Members: ``No.''] They are obliged to sit there all night, but they have time on their hands and some take on additional piece work. An employee may work for two employers simultaneously: would that employee be entitled to claim the minimum wage for both those tasks, if they performed in the same hour?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Yes. Let me give the example of an employed childminder, who possibly works for several different employers. In one hour, she--childminders are usually female--may look after four children, two of whom belong to one family and two to another. In that period, she looks after all the children simultaneously, but she is employed by both sets of employers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> So she could claim for each.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Depending on the contract of employment, which may or may not include a shared arrangement, she could claim the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I will not give way again. Conservative Members have got into enough difficulty with the clause. I am a helpful and trusting soul, and I have aided them as much as I can.
<P>
The question of home workers is important, and I share the determination expressed by the hon. Member for Eastleigh that the Bill should cover it properly. When we reach clause 32, we shall see that it deals specifically with home workers' problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, I wish to make progress.
<P>
I do not object to the principles underlying amendments Nos. 14 and 74. Just the opposite: Labour Members have long campaigned for the rights of home workers not to be disadvantaged by employment legislation. The amendment, in common with the others, is unnecessary. Clause 2 does not specifically refer to home working and neither does it refer to any other specific type of working practice. It is not necessary for it to do so. It provides a framework. It is an enabling clause which gives the Secretary of State the powers necessary to make regulations that deal with the matters that the amendment seeks to address--the treatment of overtime payments to home workers, and that of the hours that they work.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 98 proposes that the regulations under clause 2 should also deal with performance pay. The hon. Member for Daventry dwelt on that point. It will probably come as no surprise to the Committee that I agree that the Bill should be able to deal with performance pay, and that I believe that it already does. Clause 2(2)(c) covers cases in which remuneration is paid on a non-time basis. Clause 2(4)(a) provides a power to deal with performance pay.
<P>
I said that all would be revealed to Opposition Members. While I appreciate the thrust of all four amendments, I ask the Committee to resist them. They are unnecessary because the Bill already caters for what they propose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clive Betts (Sheffield, Attercliffe) rose in his place and claimed to move, That the Question be now put.</B><P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I am always open to instruction and to learning more about the ways of the House. I am not aware of any mechanism to move the closure of a debate in Committee, although I know that a closure can be moved on the Floor of the House. I am prepared to exhibit humility, and to take your counsel, Mr. Atkinson, on this matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. If such a motion were in order and were put, would it be debatable, and if so, on what terms?

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> May I start on a note of consensus by saying that I heartily agree with the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor)? I am afraid that the excitement of a Division has done nothing to warm me up. I am struck by the thought that while we are discussing the pay and conditions of the most depressed in society, as the Minister would have it, there must be a regulation that prevents employees from being kept in near-freezing conditions. However, I am certain that the House of Commons will be exempt from it. I can only express my admiration for the Government Whip, the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts), who is in his shirt sleeves, and wonder whether there is any truth in the rumour that Whips are cold-blooded animals. [Laughter.]
<P>
The purpose of clause 2, as the Minister said in reply to the previous debate, is to provide for the regulations which will be necessary to calculate whether, in any particular case, the minimum wage has been paid. We referred in earlier debates to the substantial dependence that the Bill has on regulation-making powers. However, I think that everyone accepts that in this case, the matter is extremely complex and will properly be dealt with by regulations.
<P>
Clause 2(4) deals specifically with what constitutes part of a person's remuneration and what does not. As drafted, the subsection provides extraordinarily wide powers for the Secretary of State. It could almost be said that the clause could be construed as a wrecking clause, because under it the powers of the Secretary of State are so wide that they could be used to change the effect of what appears elsewhere in the Bill. If so, that would concern not only us but, I suspect, Government Back-Bench Members.
<P>
The clause gives the Secretary of State full power to include or exclude any individual element of remuneration from consideration when calculating whether the minimum wage has been paid. Is this an innocent provision, in that the Government have simply not considered the use of existing definitions of remuneration? In that case, I hope that at the conclusion of the debate the Government will accept the compelling logic of the definitions which already exist elsewhere and accept the amendment. Or is there a sinister motive behind the wide powers given to the Secretary of State in the subsection? Is it the Secretary of State's intention to use the powers to manipulate the effect of the Bill to the Government's liking?
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In previous sittings, the Minister of State surprised me, and perhaps others, by his approach to the question of tipping, about which he was quick to shoot down the comments of Conservative Members. I thought that it was widely accepted that gratuities would be taken into account when calculating the minimum wage, but the Minister of State enthusiastically and determinedly disabused me of that option. That leads me to wonder whether there is an unwritten plan to treat other elements of remuneration in ways that may be counter intuitive. Later, I shall illustrate my unease by using the specific examples in the notes on clauses.
<P>
Amendment No. 26 would achieve two purposes. It would reduce the Secretary of State's discretion, and thus the scope for manipulation of the effects of the Bill. It would also ensure fairness by ensuring that specific items of remuneration would receive the same treatment for the purposes of calculating the minimum wage and for income tax and national insurance purposes.
<P>
At face value--on an innocent interpretation of the inclusion of the subsection's wide powers--it would appear administratively convenient at least to consider harmonising the Inland Revenue's definition of remuneration with that used in the Bill. It would also allow certainty and consistency for employers and employees, and a further advantage would be that employers are already familiar with the Inland Revenue's complex codes and regulations.
<P>
In my opinion, anything that removes an unnecessary regulation-making power from Government must be good. The innocent interpretation of the Government's intentions makes it clear that the power to define whether individual items of remuneration should be included is unnecessary.
<P>
It would be grossly unfair if remuneration recognised as such by the Inland Revenue were to be taxed in the hands of the employee. It may be counted as part of the gross remuneration in calculating the employer's liability for national insurance contribution, but it is not allowed to be counted when calculating whether the employer has met his obligations under the Bill.
<P>
Equally, it would be grossly unfair if a deduction regarded by the Inland Revenue as allowable for income tax purposes--that is, a necessary expense incurred by the employee in the course of employment--were to be treated differently in calculating the national minimum wage. The Inland Revenue rules have evolved over many years and sometimes are complex. It would be onerous, costly and inconvenient for the Secretary of State to duplicate those regulations. No doubt, some elements would be missed and the regulations would have to be revised. The Inland Revenue provisions offer a perfectly acceptable and comprehensive solution to the problem, and there is no reason to invite the Secretary of State to start with a clean sheet of paper and begin again.
<P>
As a matter of principle, we do not believe that the Secretary of State should have discretion to include or exclude individual elements of remuneration. The tips issue is not a sideshow. In certain industries and sectors of employment, whether tips are to be included in remuneration will be critical to the effect of the Bill on employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend is making an interesting case. Does he agree, in the light of the Minister's clarification in response to the truncated debate on the previous amendment, that a circumstance could arise in which an employer of, for example, waiting staff would be required to meet the full range of the national minimum wage while, given that the customer was also in some relationship with that waiter, any remuneration that was given in Inland Revenue terms, by way of a tip, would itself have fully to replicate the national minimum wage on top? It might therefore be safer to give no tip at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I am sceptical about whether a customer in a restaurant could ever be regarded as an employer of the waiter in question, but the point is valid in principle.
<P>
There is a potential unfairness of outcome in excluding tips--I use tips as an example to illustrate my argument, but it would also apply to other components of remuneration. It is possible that if tips are excluded, those staff who were in direct contact with the tipping public would be able to earn substantially more money while being nominally on the minimum wage than can others working for the same employer but without the benefit of direct contact with tipping customers.
<P>
At the extreme, absurd outcomes could arise. Doormen at high-quality hotels often earn substantial amounts through tips. Someone earning perhaps &#163;10, &#163;15, or &#163;20 an hour in tips could still claim the right to have the minimum wage paid by his employer. That confusion would disappear if the Inland Revenue's definition of remuneration were used as the baseline in the Bill. That definition is clear: if an employee receives tips in the course of his employment, those tips will be treated as taxable remuneration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that amendments Nos. 26 and 27 are not only consistent with but are arguably required by the criterion of simplicity, to which the Government have already signed up? The Government's opposition to the amendments fly in the face of their commitment to simplicity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is exactly right. Simplicity, convenience and common sense would dictate opting for a definition of remuneration that is already in every day use and well codified. If the Government decline to do that, we can assume only that they intend to manipulate that definition to achieve an outcome that is not immediately apparent from the Bill.
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to the example of the United States, a country that is often cited by Ministers in aid of their case. There is a specific provision in the United States to the effect that in employments where tipping is commonplace and employees can expect to receive tips routinely in the course of their employment, the employer may pay at a lower rate--I believe that it is currently 50 per cent. or 60 per cent. of the minimum wage--on the basis that the difference between the two will be made up by the gratuities received by the employee. I am not suggesting that that should be entirely at the discretion of the employer--it would clearly be necessary to demonstrate that that money was being made up in gratuities--but there is an established Inland Revenue practice to deal with tips, among other forms of non-conventional remuneration.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the absence of such a provision could give rise to an inequity? Somebody who received the national minimum wage on an hourly basis would be remunerated at a considerably lower level than somebody whose national minimum wage was topped up with tips, even if his work was of equivalent value?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is right. There is a further possible outcome. I suspect that most diners in restaurants recognise implicitly that the staff who wait on them may be relatively low paid and that tips are a significant part of their remuneration. There is an implied obligation to tip. The proposed application of the Bill may make people less likely to feel that obligation, which may work to the detriment of those employees.
<P>
	Mr. Green rose--
<P>
	Mr. Bercow rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way under so much competitive pressure. Has he considered the further point that the proposals will be to the deteriment of individual waiters and of manners and courtesy in restuarants? If restaurant owners have to pay a national minimum wage, the percentage of the tip that goes to the waiter may be reduced or eliminated altogether. That will get abroad and people will tip less generously because they will think that they are merely increasing the restuarant's profits, rather than rewarding an individual waiter. That would remove the element of individual customers' generosity and is hardly likely to improve relations and, therefore, standards of service in restaurants. At the margin, that could have an effect on the tourist industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank my hon. Friend, who makes an interesting point. I am mindful of your ever-watchful eye, Mr. Atkinson, and I shall move on from the subject of tipping, which we have already discussed. I used tipping merely to illustrate the case.

I draw the Committee's attention to the notes on clauses, which suggest that the powers granted to the Secretary of State could be used to

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``include or exclude . . . commission, bonus payments, performance pay, overtime pay, skill, shift, night, on-call or unsocial hours payments''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A much wider issue is at stake than was suggested by the earlier part of our discussion, which focused on tips. Surely the Government do not seriously propose to exclude items such as bonus payments, performance pay, overtime pay, skill premiums, shift payments or night shift premiums. Taken at face value, such a proposal would strike at the heart of what is apparent from the Bill. Amendment No. 26 would remove any uncertainty about such issues in the minds of employees and employers by taking away the Secretary of State's apparent discretion to include or exclude various components of remuneration at will. By dealing with the issue now, we may avoid a situation in which, between the conclusion of the Bill's legislative passage and the introduction of the minimum wage, employers and employees are implicitly invited to conspire to restructure remuneration to suit their individual purposes. I do not think that that is what the Government intended when they drafted the provisions. If it were not for the helpful notes on clauses that the Department of Trade and Industry prepared, it would never have occurred to me for a moment that the intention of the paragraph is to give the Secretary of State the power to exclude that wide range of elements of remuneration, some of which are important to the total remuneration packages of many workers.

<P>
The exclusion of performance and bonus payments from the calculation of the minimum wage would threaten the incentive systems in many industries. I do not believe that the Government's purpose or desire is to restrict employers' ability to incentivise their employees through such payments.
<P>
An even more sinister outcome is suggested in the notes on clauses, which state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``They may also include or exclude particular deductions from wages, e.g. in respect of tax and national insurance.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State is to have power, by regulation, to turn the national minimum wage into a national minimum net wage. That, surely, cannot be the intended outcome. If the Secretary of State is to have such power, we must debate it now. The implications of a national minimum net wage are dramatically different from and more serious than those of a national minimum wage.
<P>
If the Secretary of State were to decree that the net wage would be taken into account after disregarding tax and national insurance deductions, apart from the obvious macro-economic effect at any of the levels which have been suggested, what would be the effect on fairness between individual workers? A person's tax and national insurance status--I mentioned the point in a previous sitting in relation to over-65s who do not pay national insurance--will depend on personal circumstances.
<P>
If a national net minimum wage were introduced by virtue of the powers that will be conferred on the Secretary of State, the employer would be forced to take into account the circumstances of the individual employee, because they would affect the cost of employing him. That would be a negative development which would be unfair in its impact and onerous for employers and employees alike.
<P>
Surely that is not the intended outcome, yet I can be guided only by the Bill and the notes that have been helpfully provided by the Department of Trade and Industry. We are told that tax and national insurance contributions are among those deductions which may or may not be included or excluded, according to the decision of the Secretary of State.
<P>
Benefits in kind are mentioned at clause 2(4)(b). They are a significant element of the total remuneration package in certain industries, including some with high percentages of lower paid workers. I am thinking of catering, including hotels and tourism, in particular. Most often, benefits in kind in such cases will include meals and accommodation. The Inland Revenue has complex rules in place to put a value on such benefits. There is no legitimate reason for having a separate system for doing that.
<P>
The Bill gives the Secretary of State the power to determine the valuation of benefits in kind and the extent to which they are to be taken into account. The amendment would take them into account to the extent to which they are used to calculate an individual's taxable emoluments--neither more nor less--and, for the purposes of calculating the minimum wage, would value them on exactly the same basis as for income tax and national insurance purposes.
<P>
If one agrees that the income tax system deals with such matters in a way that is widely accepted as broadly fair and equitable, there can be no reason to suggest a different system for calculating the minimum wage. Different defintions of remuneration for different purposes would lead to chaos in the workplace.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> If the Government were to opt for widespread exclusions of benefits in kind and so on from the calculation of the national minimum wage, would not even the most fair-minded person conclude that their principle motive would not be to boost an employee's remuneration but to punish the employer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> That is possible. I prefer the more charitable interpretation that all the clause's possible effects have not been considered. I can understand how a Secretary of State may think, ``Give me very wide powers. I know what I intend to do and I won't abuse them or use them to undermine other parts of the Bill.'' However, Secretaries of State change. We may not always have our charming and well-intentioned incumbent. The Opposition are not privy to the Government's intentions for the regulation-making powers under clause 2. Although we understand why the Government must use regulations to deal with such complex matters, we cannot be expected always to assume that the Government's exercise of those powers will remain uniform, as we have no indication of what the Government intend.
<P>
The possible exclusion or limitation of inclusion of benefits in kind that could flow from using a treatment different from that applied by the Inland Revenue would create a grossly distorting effect. Moreover, it would amount to an invitation to employers and employees to indulge in obfuscation.
<P>
For example, a domestic employee might be provided with living accommodation in exchange for a certain number of hours of work a week. That employee might have other employment at the same time. Who on earth will be able to control how many hours that person works? If the employer and employee regard the treatment of the living accommodation element as unfair in the calculation of whether the minimum wage has been paid, they will conspire together to ``adjust'' the number of hours being worked. In those circumstances, it will be virtually impossible for anyone to check.
<P>
The limitations on the Secretary of State's discretion elsewhere in the Bill are intended to prevent discrimination between sectors. However, the effect of restrictions that might be placed on benefits in kind under the powers in this clause would be highly discriminatory. Certain industries have a greater propensity or tendency than others to remunerate employees partially through benefits in kind. A factory worker is unlikely to find that living accommodation comprises any significant component of his remuneration, but someone in the hotel industry is extremely likely to find that it does.
<P>
I was tempted to wonder whether the Government were hoping to avoid a backlash from low-paid workers who receive benefits in kind which are not fully valued, declared and taxed. Undoubtedly, there are large numbers of workers, throughout the economy, who receive the benefit of benefits in kind and are not taxed on the full value.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend refers to workers in this category. Am I not right in thinking that the P11D--the statement by an employer of expenses or benefits in kind paid on behalf of an employee--cuts in at &#163;8,500 a year? It might well embrace some low-paid workers by excluding them so they are not picked up by the present system?

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My Hon. Friend is exactly right: the P11D threshold is &#163;8,500. But whether individual workers are caught by the provisions for taxation of benefits in kind at present does not alter the fact that the framework for determining whether an element of remuneration is in principle taxable already exists.
<P>
I was wondering whether the Government, by giving themselves the power to exclude or include certain benefits in kind--to deal differently with such matters than they are dealt with under the tax provisions--were intending to avoid a backlash from workers who find that a cosy little arrangement is disrupted because under the national minimum wage provisions the employer and employee have different interests when considering the counting and inclusion or otherwise of benefits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point. If the definition of remuneration for these purposes were to differ from that for tax purposes, might not the impact of a national minimum wage be to distort the way in which employers remunerate their employees in practice, moving from benefits in kind to consolidation in the minimum wage. Different treatment may render employees liable to higher tax payments than would otherwise be the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is exactly right. Throughout industry there are many informal arrangements involving benefits in kind, perhaps of a minor nature. Who knows a bar worker who does not occasionally have a drink? [Laughter.] Are all benefits in kind declared? The hon. Member for Lincoln (Gillian Merron) thinks that that is amusing. I invite the Committee to consider the potential scope for disruption to good relationships between employers and employees.
<P>
<B>Gillian Merron </B>(Lincoln): Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting having a national minimum drinks Bill rather than a National Minimum Wage Bill? That is the reason for our merriment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the hon. Lady for that clarification. Perhaps my example was not particularly good. A moment's consideration will confirm that we are potentially creating a situation in which the interests of employer and employee, in looking at every trivial incident as something which could be considered a benefit in kind, are different. Do we really want the employer to include every minor provision as something to be counted against his obligation to pay a minimum wage? Harmony between employers and employees should be taken into consideration.
<P>
Will benefits in kind which are decreed by the Secretary of State not to be part of remuneration continue to be a deductible cost in the employer's accounts? The two conflicting definitions--one for the minimum wage and one for tax purposes--will, if introduced, surely lead to a challenge being mounted against the Inland Revenue definition of any particular element of remuneration if it is established elsewhere in legislation that it is treated differently.
<P>
Finally, I should like to draw attention to another important point. The wide discretion for the Secretary of State--
