is a pleasure to be back under your stewardship, Mr. Cook. I hope that

this programme motion will help us to ensure proper and full scrutiny

of the remaining clauses of the Bill. It gives us an extra nine hours

of scrutiny. At the start of the Committee proceedings I welcomed my

right hon. Friend the Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith), the former

Minister for Schools, who is now the Secretary to the Treasury. I

praised her talents as captain and top goal scorer for the Labour team

on this Committee. I am pleased to say that her talents have been

recognised by the manager, who has quite rightly promoted her from the

championship to the premier league. I should like to take the

opportunity to record my thanks and those of the entire Committee for

her superb contribution to our deliberations to date.</div>

<a name="06051012000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before welcoming my right hon.

Friend&#146;s replacement to these Benches, I want to acknowledge

another member of the team whose talents have also been rightfully

recognised. Owing to an injury tomy hon. Friend the Member

for Brigg and Goole(Mr. Cawsey), my hon. Friend the Member

for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw) played as a good substitute

last week. He has now been promoted to be a full-time, paid player on

the Front Bench.</div><a name="06051012000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">You

may have wondered, Mr. Cook, how our team would cope with the promotion

of two of our key players. Where would we find a replacement with the

required intellect, charm, experience, knowledge and eloquence? Failing

to find such a person, but following his dazzling performance in the

conference league of rural policy in DEFRA, I am delighted to welcome

to the Committee my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Jim

Knight). He has been justly rewarded with the captaincy of our team.

Finally&#151;I like to offer little-known facts about members of the

Committee&#151;I point out that my hon. Friend is a keen tennis

player. Like me, he is member of the Lords and Commons tennis club. We

have played doubles together. I look forward on this occasion to being

Tim Henman to his Andy Murray.</div>

<a name="06051012000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051012000578"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): It is a

pleasure to welcome the Minister for Schools, the hon. Member for South

Dorset, to the Committee and to congratulate him on his promotion. I

have always admired his principled stance on issues such as the Iraqi

war. His promotion would be well deserved on that basis alone. I am

sure that he will enjoy the Department for Education and Skills just as

much as he enjoyed being at DEFRA, if not more so.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column672" />Column number: 673</div><a name="06051012000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Congratulations are also due to

the right hon. Member for Redditch. It is unfortunate, but nevertheless

true that all the people I have shadowed over the years have been

promoted. I think the contrast with me makes them look good. The

problem is that after about a year in their new posts people realise

that they were over-promoted and they are sacked. I believe that the

right hon. Lady will be the exception that proves the rule. She is a

very capable and accomplished Minister and it has been a pleasure

working with her over the last year. I am sure that she will do very

well in her new role as Chief Whip.</div>

<a name="06051012000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to say a few

words about the motion before us. It is uncontroversial. After 14 long

sittings we are still only a quarter of the way through the Bill. We

are now at clause 42 out of 167 clauses and 18 schedules. This is an

important as well as a substantial Bill. So far some 563 amendments

have been tabled. Admittedly a large number of those are Conservative

amendments, but there are a number of Liberal amendments, some

Government amendments and many tabled by the hon. Member for Bury,

North (Mr. Chaytor), who has also made sure that we are fully

conversant with the arguments behind them.</div>

<a name="06051012000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Considering the importance of

some of the issues under discussion, I do not think that there have

been any unnecessary or unduly long debates. The Bill has 10 parts,

which vary enormously from issues relating to the duty of education

authorities to provide a diverse system to those of choice and

arrangements for a new trust school or a competition for a new school.

It covers the abolition of school organisation committees, the vexed

issue of school admissions&#151;that is always controversial when

there is a shortage of good school places&#151;and new powers to

close bad schools more quickly. There are parts on the school

curriculum and entitlements to study certain subjects; the

incorporation of the earlier School Transport Bill into this Bill;

school meals; and school discipline. The latter incorporates the

recommendations of the Steer committee. Finally, there are provisions

on parenting orders and 47 clauses relating to the inspection regime

and the merging of a number of child-related inspection bodies under

the &#147;Every Child Matters&#148; agenda.</div>

<a name="06051012000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was therefore not unexpected

that the programme motion, which we voted against on Second Reading,

would not be adequate to ensure that all the components of the Bill

received the necessary scrutiny. We are as keen as the Government to

ensure the smooth passage of the Bill to the statute book in a timely

manner. That is why we will not oppose the motion, and we hope that we

make good progress over the next three

days.</div><a name="06051012000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051012000579"></a><b class="B">Sarah

Teather</b> (Brent, East) (LD): I congratulate the right hon.

Member for Redditch on her promotion, which I suspect is long overdue.

I am a relatively junior Front-Bench spokesperson, but she is one of

the most talented Ministers I have worked with, even if I have

disagreed thoroughly with almost everything that she has said. I

congratulate her

wholeheartedly.</div><a name="06051012000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

welcome the Minister for Schools, the hon. Member for South Dorset, to

his new role. I have great sympathy with him for the busy weekend that

I suspect he has had, because I was reshuffled just a week before 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column673" />Column number: 674</div>Second Reading and I know that this is a big Bill to get to grips with

in a short time. The right hon. Member for Redditch is a tough act to

follow, but I am sure that he will do very

well.</div><a name="06051012000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">We, too, voted

against the programme motion on Second Reading, because we suspected

that the time allowed in Committee would not be adequate to scrutinise

the Bill. We will nevertheless support this motion and do our best to

be as brief as possible, as we have at all times, to ensure that we can

complete our deliberations by Thursday as

required.</div><a name="06051012000048"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000580"></a>The

Minister for Schools (Jim Knight):</b> May I say what a

pleasure it will be to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cook? I shall

briefly respond to the kind words that have been said. I emphasise

&#147;briefly&#148; because I am mindful that we are discussing

programming and the need to get on with things.</div>

<a name="06051012000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is my first opportunity as

the new Minister for Schools to say how pleased and honoured I am to

take on the role. At the heart of it is the aim to raise standards in

our schools and ensure that we personalise and individualise the

service to make it better for every child, building on this

Government&#146;s excellent

record.</div><a name="06051012000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a

pleasure to follow my right hon. Friend the Member for Redditch. As

everyone has said, she is a tough act to follow. She has done an

excellent job. We are yet to debate the clauses on discipline, but I am

sure that her understanding of the matter will be used well in her new

role. I look forward to working with my doubles partner, the

Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, my hon. Friend the

Member for Corby (Phil Hope), and to serving on a Committee with such a

wealth of expertise. My reading over the weekend, to which the hon.

Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather), referred, taught me that there

was such experience and expertise, which is

daunting.</div><a name="06051012000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is the

third Standing Committee on which I have been the Minister during this

Parliament. I hope that my experience of rights of way and, most

recently, common land law, will be used to the full. In the Commons

Bill we are repealing legislation that goes back to 1285. I do not

think that we go back quite so far in this case, but I will be mindful

of the historic nature of the Bill and the difference that it will make

to every child in this

country.</div><a name="06051012000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

put and agreed

to.</i></div><a name="06051012000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051012000581"></a><b class="B">Mrs.

Nadine Dorries</b> (Mid-Bedfordshire) (Con): On a point of

order, Mr. Cook. I beg your indulgence in making a point of order at

the start of our discussions. During our last sitting, on Tuesday, the

then Minister for Schools may unintentionally have misled the

Committee. As recorded in <i class="I">Hansard</i>, when the Minister was asked

whether city academies had a responsibility to take children with

special educational needs, she

answered,</div><a name="06051012000513"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;yes they do

have to.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i>

2 May 2006; c. 638.]</div><a name="06051012000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fact,

city academies do not have to take children with special educational

needs. They have the right to refuse to take such a child; a parent

does not have the right to name an academy and neither does the local

education authority.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column674" />Column number: 675</div><a name="06051012000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The DFES sent a letter to all

chief education officers on 15 November which stated that where the

academy is of the opinion that</div>

<a name="06051012000514"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the child&#146;s attendance at

the school would be incompatible with the efficient education of the

other children&#148;</div> <a name="06051012000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">there

are no reasonable steps that could be taken to prevent that

incompatibility, and consequently it does not consent to its being

named in the child&#146;s statement, the local authority should not

name the academy. That is because academies have the right to say no to

any child with special needs. Therefore, the Minister&#146;s answer

to the question should have been &#147;No.&#148; City academies do

operate selection; they need to take only those children with special

educational needs whom they choose to take.</div>

I will write to the Committee setting out the situation in full; the

that</div><a name="06051012000515"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if an Academy were

to refuse to admit a child following a SENDIST decision and seek

support from the Secretary of State for their position, I think it

Academy to admit the

child.&#148;</div><a name="06051012000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will

give the Committee statistics that show that3.3 per cent. of

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000590"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> You will not let me range too widely on the point,

Mr. Cook, because I am responding to what the previous Minister said,

but there is an argument that the Bill goes a very long way towards

increasing the scope and powers of the adjudicator. Indeed,

adjudicators will need to be wise people to deal with all the extra

things that they have to do as a result of the Bill. The new Minister

may want to focus on that for a moment. However, I do not wish to stray

from proper consideration of what the previous Minister said about the

amendment. The new Minister will have read that his predecessor

acknowledged that there was no desire to encourage vexatious

complaints, which is precisely why we believe that they should be

covered in the Bill. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will intervene on

me to give some feel for the number of complaints currently heard, the

percentage that is agreed, and whether adjudicators believe that they

are vexatious. The Minister obviously does not want to intervene, but

no doubt he will come back to us on those

matters.</div><a name="06051012000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was not

entirely convinced by the previous Minister&#146;s argument that

omitting such provisions from the Bill would not lead to a trend of

unacceptable objections. This Minister no doubt appreciates that people

make their case based on particular personal reasons&#151;we have all

had that in our constituencies. A parent, or even a group of parents,

may be unhappy with the arrangements at a school, but their case is not

always based on a clear, empirical argument; sometimes it is based on

all kinds of other things, and it would not be right to go down the

road of clogging the system with unnecessary

objections.</div><a name="06051012000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was

the case made by the Opposition, and the previous Minister replied. At

the outset I said that the amendment was a probing one. For that

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000597"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> I want to speak briefly to amendments Nos. 450,

451, 217 and 452&#151;I am conscious of the time pressure, but the

clause is an important one. Amendments Nos. 450 and 452 are essentially

technical amendments that would clarify the operation of banding

arrangements in England and Wales. They are so technical that I am not

sure I can explain precisely how they would clarify the arrangements,

but my assistant assures me that they will, and it would be helpful if

the Minister could say whether and how he envisages arrangements will

vary between England and

Wales.</div><a name="06051012000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

451 calls for specific reference to the importance of balanced intakes

as a definition of the purpose of banding, and amendment No. 217 would

require the local authority to agree any new banding arrangements. The

advantage of clause 43 is that it builds on the current banding

arrangements in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, which

permit schools to band from within the group of pupils making

applications to the school. It has generally been agreed that that is a

very restrictive form of banding, because the group is self-selecting.

Certain schools have an intake or applicant group of exceptionally high

ability, and therefore banding within that high-ability level does not

necessarily give a broad distribution of pupils, because of the

self-selective nature of the

intake.</div><a name="06051012000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">In clause 43

we have three new forms of banding, two of which will be generally

welcome. I have some queries about one of them. First, schools will now

be able to band in accordance with the national average distribution of

ability. Secondly, they will be able to band in accordance with the

distribution of ability within the local authority in which they are

situated. Thirdly, they will be able to band in accordance with the

distribution of ability of the applicants to their own school and one

other school. It remains to be seen why it is only one other school and

what the implications will be for the nature of the intake of the

school that chooses to band.</div>

<a name="06051012000095"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000598"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> As I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

amendment and argument, he is suggesting that banding should be

effectively separated from applications. That would perhaps lead to the



<div class="Column"><a name="Column678" />Column number: 679</div>circumstance where the admission rate for a school bears no relation to

the choice of local people about that school. Is that possible in

practical terms?</div>

<a name="06051012000096"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000599"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> It is in the nature of banding that it implies

some limitations on the exercise of pure parental choice. It goes

without

saying.</div><a name="06051012000097"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000600"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The hon. Gentleman misses my first point. The

banding arrangements in the clause, which he describes as better than

the 1998 Act, link banding to applications, so the school is making a

judgment about applicants and people who have already expressed a

choice. What the hon. Gentleman is describing, as I understand it, is

banding that is dissociated from such choice. That might lead to an

extraordinary situation in which a school was obliged to band before it

knew who wanted to go to the school, and it might not be able to draw

people from the relevant bands if they did not exercise the choice that

the school hoped they would.</div>

<a name="06051012000098"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000601"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> I think that I understand the point now, but it

relates to the provisions in clause 43. Under the arrangements that I

am describing the situation that the hon. Gentleman described would not

arise because banding would be used only as an over-subscription

criterion, so pupils would already have made their application to the

school before the banding arrangements were brought into play. I do not

think that his point is valid for that reason.</div>

<a name="06051012000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issues to which I wish to

draw attention are as follows, starting with amendment No. 217. If a

number of schools within a local authority area are allowed to band

according to any of the three criteria or methods in clause 43,

together with the method that still applies in the 1998 Act&#151;that

is, banding from within the pupils applying to the school&#151;there

is inevitably the possibility of a large number of schools within the

same local authority area choosing different banding systems. I

question whether this is going to lead to efficiency in the

administration of admissions or to a multiplicity of different tests

being taken by pupils. It is a legitimate criticism of our system

already that pupils here are tested to a far greater extent than those

in many other countries. The banding arrangements described here would

be likely to result in even more tests being taken by children as part

of the process of primary to secondary

transfer.</div>

The banding allocation has been fulfilled. That means that theremainder of the community of maintained schools has to take far morechildren with special needs than thoseacademies.</div><a name="06051012000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000605"></a>Mr.Chaytor:</b> I think that that is a question for the Ministerto answer. His earlier reply on the proportion of children with SEN,with or without statements, and the proportion who get free schoolmeals, probably answers the hon. Lady&#146;squestion.</div><a name="06051012000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">There areproblems inherent in the clause. It raises the prospect of a largenumber of schools within a local authority area choosing differentmethods of banding. That would mean children who wish to apply to anumber of schools having to take several different tests.</div><a name="06051012000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Neither the clause, the Billnor the skeletal code of school admissions specifies the number ofbands considered to be best practice. I know that the Specialist Schoolsand Academies Trust has either made a statement or distributed acircular to its member schools suggesting that a 10-band system wouldbe the preferred model. That would gain a general consensus amongschools interested in banding, but it is not made clear in the clause.The option is therefore open to schools to adopt a five-band orthree-band system. The arrangements are inclined to lead to greatercomplexity, administrative confusion and an increase in the number oftests that children transferring from primary to secondary schools willhave to take. Many Labour Members would strongly encourage bandingsystems as a means of getting a fairer distribution of intake, butlocal authorities should approve banding systems and have a role inco-ordinating them to iron out the potential administrativeinefficiencies.</div><a name="06051012000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">AmendmentNo. 451 demands a &#147;balanced intake&#148; of pupils. It isimportant to clarify the nature of intakes. As defined in the clause,banding refers simply to ability, not to other means by which a broadand balanced intake can be achieved. It does not refer to a genderbalance, so it is possible that a school could operate a banding systemand still have gross inequality between boys and girls. That wouldobviously depend on the availability of single-sex education elsewherein the neighbourhood, but it is a possibility. Slightly moreworryingly, a school could operate a banding system and still havegross inequality and a lack of balance in the proportion of childrenfrom different religious or ethnic groups. The concept of balancedintake needs to be put into the Bill, to demonstrate the objective thatthe Government seem to be moving towards: a fairer distribution ofpupils in our schools, not just in terms of academic ability but interms of a wider social mix and a gender, religious and ethnicbalance.</div><a name="06051012000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051012000606"></a><b class="B">Mr.James Clappison</b> (Hertsmere) (Con): The hon.

It continuously stresses the importance of admissionsauthorities using the admissions process to avoid the worst excesses ofsocial and ethnic segregation. The hon. Gentleman and other members ofthe Committee will know that that is not an easy matter. He will alsobe aware of the enormous dangers if we, by default, allow ouradmissions system to make our schools increasingly segregated alongreligious and ethnic lines. I cannot give him an answer. My amendmentsimply flags up the importance of ensuring that our schooling systemavoids becoming more and more segregated. We all know the dangers towhich that canlead.</div><a name="06051012000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000608"></a>Mr.Gibb:</b> Amendment No. 94 looks like a technical draftingpoint, but it seeks to make an important point on the power of a localauthority, as the admission authority for a maintained school, over thequestion of whether a school adopts a banding arrangement. Clause43(1)(b), which inserts proposed new subsection (1A) into the SchoolsStandards and Framework Act 1998, sets out the three types of bandingthat a school can adopt. Those are based on the ability range of theapplicants, the current type of ability selection permitted by law, orthe two new ones: the ability range of the local authority area and theability range across the age group in England as a whole.</div><a name="06051012000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 43(1)(d) insertsproposed new subsection (2A) into section 101 of the 1998 Act. It saysthat where local authorities are the admission authority, the authoritycan introduce banding only if the school&#146;s governing bodyagrees. It seems that the requirement applies only to the arrangementsin proposed new subsection (1A) and not to arrangements on the statutebook in section 101. The purpose of the amendment is to maintain thatsafeguard for the section as a whole so that all three types of bandingarrangement will require the authority of the governing body and cannottherefore be imposed on a school by the localauthority.</div><a name="06051012000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspectthat the amendment may not be necessary, but I want to put on therecord how important it is to ensure that local authorities cannotimpose a banding arrangement of any sort on a school without theexpress approval of the governing body. On banding in general, theGovernment should tread that route with extreme caution. It is born outof the left&#146;s obsession with the intake of a school and thenotion that the quality of a school is determined by its intake ratherthan by the quality of its teaching and leadership.</div><a name="06051012000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Results will in part bedetermined by the intake, but whether children achieve their fullpotential and emerge from the school as fully educated as their abilityallows will depend absolutely on the quality of the teaching, the headteacher and the ethos of the school. Most parents simply want to beable to send their children to the local school and they want the localschool to be good. That aim should be the objective of policy and notsome complex form of bussing arrangements, where a bright child isdenied access to her local school because the quota for her abilityrange has already been filled, forcing her to spend an hour or more aday travelling travel across town, away from her friends, to anotherschool that is short on her ability group.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column681" />Column number: 682</div><a name="06051012000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">That bears all the hallmarks ofthe worst social engineering experiments of the 1960s and &#146;70s,which is presumably why it is so popular with Lord Hattersley.

However, I amuneasy with the concept of banding and with the idea of moving childrenover wide distances, often away from their community. I am far moresympathetic to the idea of lotteries. I am happy for local authoritiesto have freedom to experiment with different methods and to see howthey work, but I agree with the hon. Gentleman that if we are to usebanding, it needs to be used across a wide area. If schools are allowedto use banding in small areas, middle-class schools could easily removethe ability of other schools to join in the system, and socialsegregation could beworsened.</div><a name="06051012000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000610"></a>Mrs.Dorries:</b> I want to refer to the effects of banding onchildren&#146;s special educational needs, and I shall quote somefigures from schools that operate a banding policy. Obviously, they arecity academies, and the effect of the banding policy on children withspecial needs is that such children have to travel out of the boroughto receive their education. In Southwark, the academy at Peckham takeschildren with special needs at a level of 28.7 per cent.&#151;aboveits banding requirement of 18 per cent&#151;but the local maintainedschool, Kingsdale secondary, takes 65.6 per cent. and Bacon&#146;scollege takes 33.87 per cent. So the maintained schools take far morechildren with special needs than academies, and I could list academyafter academy&#151;though I am sure you do not want me to,Mr. Cook&#151;for which the figures stack up the same. That isbecause of the banding system. Academies do not have to take childrenwith special educational needs. When they do, and once their quota isfilled, the children have to travel further. From the point of view ofsuch children, I oppose banding. They suffer more than mosteducationally, and banding would make thatworse.</div><a name="06051012000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schools shouldreflect the community in which they are based, and not be sociallyengineered to look the way a political party wants them to look. TheConservative Administration did things wrong with education, as I amsure that this Government are doing now and as every Government will infuture, but we should plan education on a long-term basis, rather <div class="Column"><a name="Column682" />Column number: 683</div>than on the basis of short-term ideology. We should think about how itwill look in 20 or 40 years&#146; time for the children of thefuture.

Member for Bury,North has given to it, but I agree strongly with the reservationsexpressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis andLittlehampton (Mr. Gibb). Applying banding too rigidly and putting toomuch emphasis on it carries real dangers for parents and children. Twoexamples spring to mind. First, there is the danger of thinking thatthe only way to improve a school is to change its intake, as the hon.Gentleman implied, rather than examine the quality of leadership andteaching, the school&#146;s ethos and everything else that makes agood school. There is a danger that rigid, mechanistic application ofbanding doctrines causes those steps to beoverlooked.</div><a name="06051012000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I paytribute Wroxham primary school in my constituency, which I visitedrecently. Not that long ago, and with exactly the same intake, it wasmoving in the wrong direction, but with different leadership anddifferent teaching it has achieved excellent results which are nearlythe best in Hertfordshire. It has, I understand, had advisers from No.10 beating a path to it to see what can be done to turn a schoolaround. As I said, that was with no change whatever to thatschool&#146;s intake. I am sure that hon. Members on both sides ofthe House know of similar examples. If the first thing we looked at wasa school&#146;s intake, we would not draw lessons from it, so we needto consider other things first.</div><a name="06051012000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second problem with bandingthat springs to mind&#151;in particular the wider from of bandingadvocated by the hon. Gentleman, which is not just banding by abilitybut according to religion, membership of ethnic groups and otherfactors&#151;is that parents simply will not go along with it. Theywill go to ever more elaborate and extreme measures to avoid therigidities of banding being imposed on them. They have gone to theextent of moving to different areas and taking the extreme step ofeither they or their children having to travel substantial distances togo to school. That is simply not the way to get parents into schools.The way to attract parents to schools is to provide good schools withgood teaching and good leadership. That is what parents are lookingfor, and that is what will get them beating a path to the door of theschool.</div> <a name="06051012000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">There areadditional dangers from the social segregation that the hon. Gentlemanadvocates. It could in some cases lead to even more movement away fromurban centres to more development in the countryside. It is a dangerouspath to go down, and is too rigid an approach. It could be entirelycounter-productive and have the opposite result of what is planned. Ihave a distaste for social engineering, and would much rather providepeople with opportunities and good services in the firstplace.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column683" />Column number: 684</div><a name="06051012000123"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000612"></a>JimKnight:</b> In responding to these interesting amendments, Ihope that it will help if I make a few initial comments about theclause as a whole, to put it into context.</div><a name="06051012000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 43 enacts our WhitePaper commitment to make pupil banding easier to implement and to giveadmission authorities the flexibility to adopt the most appropriate form of banding for their circumstances. To right a misunderstandingthat has been referred to in Lord Hattersley&#146;s article, bandingis by no means going to be compulsory. The provision enables individualschools to band, or provides for two or more schools to adopt jointbanding arrangements. In addition, it enables them to band and securean intake that is representative of the range of abilities of allapplicants to the school, or an intake that reflects the local area orthe national ability profile. Provision in the 1998 Act already permitsadmission authorities for schools to introduce banding of the firstkind that I referred to, and we are looking to extend that.</div><a name="06051012000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 94 proposes thatwhere the admission authority for a school is a local authority, itshould be required to consult governing bodies before introducingbanding to admission arrangements. However, local authorities mustalready consult the governing bodies of community and voluntarycontrolled schools before making any changes to a school&#146;sadmission arrangements. So, if the local authority wishes to introducebanding on the basis of applications made for an individual schoolalone, it would, under current legislation, have to consult thatschool&#146;s governing body.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000613"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b><b class="B"> </b>I know of two comprehensive schools in inner

west London that are very similar. One uses banding and the other does

not. There is at least a suspicion that the school that uses banding

may do so to increase the academic excellence of pupils entering the

school, because it can work out how clever its pupils are before it

offers them a place. There is at least the risk that banding can be

criticised not just because of social engineering, but because it makes

schools less

comprehensive.</div><a name="06051012000540"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15

am</div><a name="06051012000127"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000614"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> We have certainly been mindful of that risk, which

is why we are seeking to introduce fair banding, so that it reflects

the whole ability range. We have set out elsewhere in the Bill that

there will be no new selection by ability. Once the ability assessment

has been made for banding, schools cannot then cream off the best

scores of ability within each band. They will have to take evenly,

according to the criteria within each band which are set out in the

legislation. I hope that that helps the hon.

Gentleman.</div>

<a name="06051012000128"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000615"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> On a point of clarification, after the assessment

process, will young people and families know what band they fall into?

Will they be given that information or will it be confidential? If it

is intended to be confidential how do we ensure that families do not

find out that

information?</div><a name="06051012000129"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000616"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I understand that the information is not disclosed

but I will reflect on the hon. Lady&#146;s point in 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column684" />Column number: 685</div>respect of whether safeguards are needed. The substantive point is that

the information is not disclosed.</div>

<a name="06051012000130"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000617"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> Does the Minister agree that under the banding

system he described, schools will turn into a sort of McDonald&#146;s

of education? All schools will perform the same because they will have

the same social, academic and special needs intake. There will be a

levelling out of schools&#146; performance throughout the UK. Will

not the schools all look the

same?</div><a name="06051012000131"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000618"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I suggest that the hon. Lady visits Greenwich or

Lewisham, which are not far from here, where there is banding across

the borough, and she will see that there is diversity in the schools.

We are offering more flexible banding arrangements to improve choice,

which is a key driver in improving standards in schools. That is at the

heart of the Bill. It is the opposite of what the hon. Lady might

describe as the McDonald&#146;s approach. I am not a great fan of

McDonald&#146;s in

schools.</div><a name="06051012000132"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000619"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The Minister gives two suburban examples of

Greenwich and Lewisham, both of which I know extremely well as I was

brought up in south-east London. What about an area that is less

densely populated? Would that mean bussing children over a wide area in

order to achieve the mix that has been described, particularly with the

addition of the two extra kinds of banding proposed in the

Bill?</div>

<a name="06051012000133"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000620"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I was born in south-east London but, like the hon.

Gentleman, I represent a largely rural constituency and I have asked

the same question myself. The reassurance I had, which is logical, is

that banding is not compulsory; for example, it would be inappropriate

if a school was on an island, as is the case with a school in my

constituency. We are considering situations in which schools are

over-subscribed, and ensuring, through local determination, that the

arrangements are appropriate for such schools. If I am allowed to

continue with my comments, I will set out how the structure might work

to bring that about.</div>

<a name="06051012000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the adoption of the

existing form of banding has proved uncontroversial, it is appropriate

for governing bodies to have a say in the adoption of new forms of

banding, especially as it may alter the profile of the school&#146;s

intake and effectively widen its catchment

area.</div>

<a name="06051012000135"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000621"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I was slightly concerned about the Minister&#146;s

statement that the local authority, as an admission authority, would

consult a governing body rather than the governing body having to

approve a system of banding, as I thought was the case with the first

type of banding. Can the Minister assure me that the governing body

will have to approve any system of banding proposed by the local

authority and that it is not just a consultation process which can then

be

overruled?</div><a name="06051012000136"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000622"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> As I shall go on to describe, the use of the

admission forum is crucial. The admission forum 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column685" />Column number: 686</div>will produce an annual report; there will be a consultation process and

there is the right of appeal to the schools adjudicator. That provides

the safeguards that the hon. Gentleman wants. I shall try to sketch it

out a little further as we go

on.</div><a name="06051012000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now to the

helpful amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North.

Amendment No. 217 proposes that governing bodies which are their own

admission authority&#151;foundation and voluntary aided

schools&#151;should have to ask the local authority&#146;s consent

before introducing banding. Of course, they should have to consult;

they are already required to when considering any change to admission

arrangements. We shall make that clear, but we do not agree that a

local authority should have a veto on whether schools introduce

banding.</div><a name="06051012000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot see

why the introduction of something that will ensure a more comprehensive

intake into voluntary aided or foundation schools would be considered

undesirable by the local authority, so that it would need that local

authority&#146;s consent. However, as the introduction of banding

will come within the annual admissions consultation process that I have

just described, local authorities, other schools and the local

admission forum will all have the right to lodge an objection with the

adjudicator if they disagree with the adoption of banding or with how

the admission authority intends to operate it. I hope that my hon.

Friend will agree that his amendment is

unnecessary.</div><a name="06051012000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to

amendments Nos. 450 and 452. In response to my hon. Friend&#146;s

opening comment, I should say that the provisions would make no change

to the position in Wales; they apply only to England. The amendments

would result in our having to retain the existing position in

England&#151;any admission authority wishing to introduce banding has

to do so through the formal statutory proposal process.</div>

<a name="06051012000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Statutory proposals must be

published when local authorities and governing bodies propose to open,

close or expand a school, but we do not think it appropriate to

continue to require them to go through that route to introduce banding.

As banding constitutes an integral part of a school&#146;s admission

arrangements, approval of its introduction sits better within the

existing admissions process, which I have described. That gives all

schools and local authorities an opportunity to make comments and go to

a schools adjudicator if they disagree. I hope that that reassures my

hon. Friend that the admissions consultation process, like that for

statutory proposals, offers plenty of opportunity to discuss and

comment on proposals to introduce banding, as well as the right of

objection. </div><a name="06051012000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,

amendment No. 451 would ensure that all banded intakes were

&#147;balanced&#148;. I assume that my hon. Friend&#146;s

intention is to ensure that no ability group is over-represented in a

school that bands its intake. That is unnecessary because the clause

already ensures that the intake of a banding school is balanced in that

it represents all levels of ability across applicant children, the

local authority area or the ability range nationally.</div>

<a name="06051012000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, my hon. Friend may

intend to ensure that a banding school achieves a balanced intake from

among its applicant children. It is important that we should allow

schools the flexibility to band across the profiles that I have

described, as well as across the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column686" />Column number: 687</div>ability profiles of applicants. That will, for instance, encourage

schools situated in areas of traditionally high academic attainment to

send a positive message: that they are there also to serve less able

pupils, who might not gain entry if the school simply banded across the

ability range of local residents.</div>

<a name="06051012000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there is a problem

with adding the word &#147;balanced&#148; to that part of the

clause. The word would be open to interpretation, which could lead to a

conflict of interpretation with other provisions in the clause that

require the pupils admitted to be representative of all ability

levels.</div> <a name="06051012000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it were

not disallowed by another part of the clause, a school with five bands

could, for instance, achieve a &#147;balanced&#148; intake by

admitting a very small minority of its pupils from the highest and

lowest ability bands and the bulk of its pupils from the middle range.

That would ensure that it did not have to take many pupils of

below-average ability, provided that it did not take many pupils from

the highest ability group. We want to see an even&#151;I shall not

use the word &#147;balanced&#148;&#151;distribution across the

ability range. We seek to ensure that schools achieve such an intake by

taking abilities across all bands. The amendment could also lead to

conflicts of interpretation within the clause, as I have said. I hope

that, on that basis, my hon. Friend will not press the

amendment.</div> <a name="06051012000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

response to a couple of other points made, I should say that we will

set out in the code that it is good practice for local authorities and

admission authorities to choose similar approaches, such as a common

test, to banding and testing. The admission forum will consider and

facilitate that.</div>

<a name="06051012000146"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000623"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The Minister just said that he will state in

guidance that local authorities should adopt a similar practice on

banding, but in reply to my earlier intervention he made it clear that

he shared my concern that if a similar approach were adopted in rural

areas, it would lead to the bussing of children across very wide areas.

That seems to be a

contradiction.</div><a name="06051012000147"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000624"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman may have

misunderstood me. I was referring to the testing arrangement, on which

we will seek guidance so that there is some conformity. My hon. Friend

the Member for Bury, North was concerned about the effect of having a

multiplicity of

approaches.</div><a name="06051012000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the

matter raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, a

governing body would have to approve new forms of banding. It would be

consulted on existing, norm-based banding and could object to the

adjudicator.</div><a name="06051012000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope

that I have responded to all the points made in the debate and that, on

that basis, hon. Members will not press their

amendments.</div><a name="06051012000150"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000625"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I listened very carefully to the Minister&#146;s

responses, and I am afraid that I am not reassured by them,

particularly the last. There is a very good proposed new subsection on

page 33 that says:</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column687" />Column number: 688</div><a name="06051012000519"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If the admission

authority for a maintained school in England is the local education

authority, the authority may only make such provision for selection by

ability as is mentioned in subsection (1A) with the consent of the

governing body of the

school.&#148;</div><a name="06051012000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words,

the three types of banding in proposed new section 101(1A) of the

School Standards and Framework Act will require the authority of the

governing body.</div> <a name="06051012000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern,

which the Minister has confirmed and which led to me to table amendment

No. 94, is what will be done about the admission arrangements in

section 101(1) of that Act, which allow schools to select applicants

from each level of ability. It appears that such banding can still be

imposed on a school by a local authority, with the mere safeguard of

consultation. We shall therefore press amendmentNo. 94 to a

Division. The Government should seriously consider it, because it is an

anomaly for existing provisions to allow such imposition to occur when

the clear intention of the Bill is that the governing body should give

consent.</div><a name="06051012000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are

concerned about the notion of banding. It is social engineering, and if

allowed to proliferate in the admissions system it could lead to some

horrific problems in certain areas of the country. We shall therefore

also vote against clause stand

part.</div><a name="06051012000154"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000626"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s

clarification on the points raised in the debate, and particularly for

his emphasis on the importance of consultation and the sharing of

information. Banding is a sensitive issue, and should not be imposed on

any admission authority. Nor should any authority seek to take a

decision on banding in

isolation.</div><a name="06051012000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not

wish to reopen the debate on the importance of intake compared with

other factors in school improvement, but I refer Conservative members

of the Committee both to the evidence given to the Education and Skills

Committee yesterday by Ofsted on the impact of a school&#146;s intake

on its overall chances of improvement and to the written evidence

provided by Professor Gorard of York university, who is one of the

country&#146;s leading experts in the field. I do not wish to

continue that debate, except to say that the debate on the significance

of intake has well and truly been won. That is why clause 43 provides

banding systems not as something to be imposed but as a useful

option.</div><a name="06051012000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two

crucial contradictions in the Conservatives&#146; arguments. On the

one hand they are quick to criticise the intake of certain schools

defined as comprehensive as being highly selective by mortgage, but on

the other hand, when a means of alleviating that level of selection is

introduced, such as banding, they oppose it. Quite frankly, they cannot

have it both

ways.</div><a name="06051012000541"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30

am</div><a name="06051012000157"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000627"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> That point is quite easy to address. The reason we

said that mortgages were becoming the new school fees is that it

highlights the drastic shortage of good school places in this country.

The National Audit Office says that 23 per cent. of secondary schools

are underperforming&#151;that is the problem. We raised the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column688" />Column number: 689</div>issue of application by mortgage and house price in order to highlight

the severe shortage of good schools. Increasing the number of good

school places should be the objective of every member of the Committee

and of the Government.</div>

<a name="06051012000158"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000628"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> Of course, and one of the most effective means of

increasing the number of good school places is to address the chronic

problem of grotesque inequalities of distribution of able pupils

between schools, as the clause attempts to do. However, with regard to

the position taken by the Liberal Democrats, I do not understand why

they oppose banding on the basis that it may result in certain children

travelling further to school, when lotteries, which they support, would

have the same

effect.</div><a name="06051012000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not

arguing that because banding is in the Bill I therefore welcome it. I

do not think that anyone argues that it is a straightforward matter,

and it has to be done with regard to local circumstances and with the

maximum degree of consensus. The question of balanced intakes will not

go away, however. Perhaps the best answer to the Opposition&#146;s

concerns is that the code contains provisions stressing that admission

authorities that choose to band will not be allowed to select further

by ability on the basis of the individual scores of pupils within the

band. They will have to use other over-subscription criteria to select

between pupils within the

band.</div><a name="06051012000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that

that is the key to creating a balanced intake in the broadest

sense&#151;one that has regard to the social class background of

individual pupils, and to their religious affiliations and ethnic

minority origins. Other forms of over-subscription criteria for

selecting pupils from within each ability band would be extremely

helpful in achieving a broader and more balanced

intake.</div><a name="06051012000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

parents&#146; support for banding, we have to accept that it is not a

new and revolutionary idea&#151;it has a large measure of support

among many schools and local authorities and it has operated in many

parts of the country for many years. By and large it has a high level

of support where it operates, because most parents accept and

understand that a fair distribution of pupils between schools is one of

the key mechanisms by which the quality of all schools can be improved

and the number of good school places

increased.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000629"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Is not the point that banding can often be used as a

substitute for genuine improvement in the quality of a school? The hon.

Gentleman makes my point for me when he says that there is an issue of

how to select within a band when a school is over-subscribed within

certain ability ranges. I discussed the Thomas Telford school with the

hon. Gentleman and his concern was whether that school, which has fair

banding based on national criteria, selects the children in the top

niche of each of the nine bands of entry in order to keep up good

results. So even if one were to have a universal system of fair

banding, the same complaints would come from the same quarters that

even that system could be manipulated to create a higher ability

intake&#151;that there is no real difference between the qualities of

school and their leadership, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column689" />Column number: 690</div>and that it is all to do with intake. We will never win the debate on

that with the left, which is why we should not go down that route in

the first

place.</div><a name="06051012000163"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000630"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> The issue of banding and the role of pupil

distribution between schools is not a substitute for other means of

school improvement; it is part of a package of measures for

improvement. It does not substitute for quality of leadership&#151;I

have argued on many occasions in the Committee and elsewhere that

quality of leadership is the key factor, but banding is another of the

range of measures that can be

applied.</div><a name="06051012000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">On selection

within bands, I refer to the point I made earlier about the provisions

in the skeletal code which deal with selection. The skeletal code makes

it clear that selection by pupils&#146; scores within bands will not

be permitted, although other over-subscription criteria are

permitted.</div><a name="06051012000165"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000631"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way, as

it gives me the opportunity to give some clarification on a point made

by the hon. Member for Brent, East. If the tests are Qualifications and

Curriculum Authority tests, parents will know the results, but if they

are taken before 1 March&#151;the date that allocations are

made&#151;the results will be known afterwards. At some point, they

will be known, so that people will be able to scrutinise whether the

code has been properly adhered to.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000633"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I should be grateful if, through the hon. Gentleman,

we could get some clarification about whether the pupils themselves

will know what band they are in. That seems to be a terrible way of

undermining the confidence of children who may be placed in a lower

band. It goes against everything on which there is a consensus when it

comes to grammar schools and selection&#151;that we are going to tell

children that they are in band nine or band one in a fair banding

system. I thought that that was against the general ethos of

education.</div>

the whole notion of selection by ability, but let us not go into that

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000678"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> These amendments complement existing provision in

the School Standards and Framework Act, requiring local authorities in

the normal admission round to give first priority for school places to

looked-after children. They follow a commitment made on Second Reading.

New clause 27 amends section 97 of the 1998 Act to give local

authorities the power to direct an admission authority to admit a child

it is looking after to the school best suited to meet their needs when

the need for a place arises at any time during the school

year.</div> <a name="06051012000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looked-after

children are among the most vulnerable in our society. As a group they

tend to have low levels of educational attainment compared with their

peers. Only 9 per cent. gained five good GCSEs in 2004 compared with 54

per cent of all children, and a relatively small number, just 5 per

cent, go on to higher education compared with almost one third of all

19-year-olds.</div> <a name="06051012000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know

from the social exclusion unit&#146;s report, &#147;A better

education for children in care&#148;, that one reason looked-after

children underachieve in education is that their lives are

characterised by instability and they spend too much time out of

school. We also know that looked-after children move schools more often

than other children as a result of frequent changes of placement. As a

consequence, they are more likely to attend schools that are not

equipped to meet their needs, or in some cases they are not able to

obtain a school place at all.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column693" />Column number: 694</div><a name="06051012000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why we are giving local

authorities in their role as corporate parent the power to direct any

admission authority for a maintained school in England to admit a

looked-after child even where the school is already full. This will

ensure that looked-after children are always admitted to the school

that can best meet their needs.</div>

<a name="06051012000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to new clause 28. Under

section 97 of the 1998 Act, a governing body of a school that has been

directed to admit a child by the local authority under section 96 may

refer that direction to the Secretary of State, who may determine

whether the school must admit the child or not. The amendment amends

section 97 so that in future all such referrals will be made to the

schools adjudicator in England and the National Assembly in Wales. Such

referrals will be allowed only on the grounds that the admission of the

child would seriously prejudice the provision of efficient education or

the efficient use of resources. The adjudicator could agree the

direction or decide that another school should admit the child having

consulted that school. It is imperative that suitable school places are

found for those vulnerable children as soon as possible, which is why

the new clause provides a mechanism for such a speedy decision to be

made about a suitable alternative school if the adjudicator overturns a

direction.</div> <a name="06051012000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause

29 makes some consequential amendments to section 96 of the 1998 Act to

take account of the changes to the responsibilities for deciding

referrals about section 96 directions. It also amends section 94 of

that Act to prevent parents appealing against a direction to place a

looked-after child and makes provision for regulations to be made

requiring the adjudicator to consult prescribed persons before making a

direction using those powers. Regulations may also require admission

authorities to provide information requested by the

adjudicator.</div><a name="06051012000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">New

clause 30 amends the 1998 Act to deal with looked-after children for

whom section 87 of that Act applies: those children who have been

excluded from two or more schools. Section 95 of the Act provides that

a local authority&#151;that is, the admission authority for a

school&#151;must allow the governing body of the school a right of

appeal against its decision to admit a child who has been twice

excluded. The new clause removes that requirement in the case of

looked-after children and provides that the governing body may instead

refer the matter to the schools adjudicator who may either uphold or

overturn the direction and name another school.</div>

<a name="06051012000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 31 amends section 25

of the 1998 Act, providing a general power for the Secretary of State

to seek advice from the adjudicator on the admission of children to

schools. This will mean that in addition to advice in relation to

looked-after children the adjudicator will provide advice on matters

relating to the admission of children to schools as specified by the

Secretary of State. It provides for greater consistency as all

referrals about directions will be considered by the adjudicator and

will help to reduce the casework burden on the Department.</div>

<a name="06051012000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 33 provides the

National Assembly for Wales with the power to make regulations relating

to the admission of looked-after children. The amendments complement

the procedures in England 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column694" />Column number: 695</div>but recognise that the Assembly should decide for Wales whether and how

they should be implemented there. It is a wide-ranging regulation power

giving what we think is sufficient scope for the National Assembly to

decide for itself what procedures it wishes to adopt.

</div><a name="06051012000542"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

am</div><a name="06051012000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a group,

looked-after children have complex needs, which is why we are committed

to improving outcomes for them. The Children Act 2004 placed a specific

duty on local authorities to promote the educational achievements of

looked-after children. The Bill will complement that duty and ensure

that looked-after children are found suitable school places as quickly

as possible.</div><a name="06051012000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 328 is consequential. Amendment No. 358 adds to clause 164 and has

the effect of giving the National Assembly the power to make its

regulations two months following the passing of the Bill. For the

reasons I have set out, I hope that that the Committee will support the

Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): I welcome my near

neighbour to his new position this morning, and hopefully for a long

time to come. I welcome the new clauses even though we know that

looked-after children grow up and can succeed against all the

odds&#151;there are some remarkable stories. But why should this

group of young people have to fight the odds all the way through their

lives? I hope that this relatively small measure will make a big

difference. The statistics on the outcomes and life chances for this

group of people which we, collectively, have let down over a long

period are well known and do not need to be rehearsed yet

again.</div><a name="06051012000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a

specific question for the Minister. I had a constituency case involving

adopted children. One cannot time when such children arrive in a

household, and because they arrived after the closing date for

applications the local school five minutes away was full and they could

not get in. They were from a troubled background and needed support.

Perhaps a provision is tucked away in the wording of the amendments,

but would adopted children arriving in June, way after the January

deadline, be able to get into a school that was classified as full with

perhaps 30 in the class already? That is an important point and it is

sequential to the provisions for looked-after

children.</div><a name="06051012000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should

also like to place on the record again my special concern for the young

carers of disabled parents, who need access to their nearest school.

They are not quite in the same category, but they are important none

the less. I hope to be able to raise awareness of the particular issues

facing young carers throughout the passage of the

Bill.</div><a name="06051012000247"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000680"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. I ought to point out to the Committee

that there will be a debate on young carers at a later stage in the

Bill.</div><a name="06051012000248"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000681"></a>Annette

Cook.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000682"></a>Mr.

Clappison:</b> I am happy to echo the Minister&#146;s

sentiments about the position of looked-after children, which for a

long time has been a great disappointment within our education system.

Coupled with his proposals for directing looked-after children into

schools, would he go as far as to express a strong wish to see an

improvement in the academic and all-round performance of looked-after

children?</div><a name="06051012000250"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000683"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole

(Annette Brooke) raised an interesting question about adopted children.

My understanding is that they would not technically fall into the

category of children looked after by the local authority. I can check

that out and get back to her, and copy the information to the

Committee. I heard your advice, Mr. Cook, that we will be discussing

young carers at a later date.</div>

<a name="06051012000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">To respond to the comment made

by hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison), we are certainly

concerned to ensure that the educational performance of looked-after

children improves. We hope that the proposed measures will go some way

towards achieving that, but they are not by any means the only way in

which we can do so. The whole philosophy of our educational reforms is

to personalise education for every child so that all children,

including looked-after children, can achieve the best possible outcome

for them as individuals. I hope that on that basis that the Committee

will support the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000684"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second

time.</div><a name="06051012000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our previous

sitting, we discussed the new skeletal code for admissions and

admission forums. I said that the code is in many ways a welcome

advance, in that it touches on many of the points of concern relating

to covert selection&#151;for example, it highlights the fact 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column699" />Column number: 700</div>that it is totally unacceptable to use information gleaned about a

family from open evenings or other meetings with the family held

because brothers or sisters are at the school in question. The right

hon. Member for Redditch indicated that she would look into whether the

use of telephone information could be included in the code. The problem

is ensuring that the code is put into practice and enforced adequately.

A challenge based on many of the code&#146;s provisions would require

a subjective judgment, given that they deal with soft information

gained through informal meetings.</div>

<a name="06051012000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know from surveys that as

many as one in four head teachers admit to bending the rules in order

to cherry-pick pupils, and so artificially to improve their results and

league table position and appear a better school. The problem is that

when one head teacher or school cheats, it breaks everybody&#146;s

trust in the system&#151;parents and students. Such practices

undermine the system and the work that the Government are trying to do

by introducing the code.</div>

<a name="06051012000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to us that best way to

remove the danger of cheating would be to allow local authorities to

administer the criteria. The new clause would not prevent schools from

setting their own criteria, but if it is not accepted we shall press an

amendment that would do so. The new clause suggests that if the

criteria are objective, as the code says they should be, they could be

administered by anybody&#151;they do not need to be administered by

the school in question. The best body to administer the process is the

local authority. The local authority has no incentive to cheat. It does

not favour one school in its area over another or wish artificially to

inflate the league table position of one school rather than another. It

is disinterested and impartial; it wishes only to raise the standards

of all of the schools in its area.</div>

<a name="06051012000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would be particularly

helpful in ironing out problems such as knowledge of a family gained

through brothers and sisters being at a school or through open evenings

or telephone conversations. It is unreasonable to expect a school not

to have knowledge, sometimes quite considerable, of a family prior to

the admissions process. In our previous sitting, the hon. Member for

Bury, North, highlighted the case of a Church of England school in

London where there was considerable contact between parents and the

school some weeks before the commencement of the admissions process. It

would be entirely unreasonable to expect a school not to have knowledge

of a family, and it would be difficult to test whether that knowledge

was used in the admissions process.</div>

<a name="06051012000265"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000685"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Is the Liberal notion of localism that it should

extend as far the local authority, but not to the local

school?</div>

<a name="06051012000266"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000686"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> The new clause is about accountability. The local

authority is the directly elected, accountable body. On localism, we

have always said that devolving power down without ensuring that the

bodies that receive it are elected and accountable simply results in

tyranny on a local scale and does not improve the

situation.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column700" />Column number: 701</div><a name="06051012000267"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000687"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that under the new

clause schools will set out their own admissions policies, which will

give them freedom within the guidelines and the code, and local

authorities will merely administer what schools have set

out?</div>

<a name="06051012000268"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000688"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> Precisely. As I said, if the criteria are

objective, as the code clearly states that they should be, it should

not matter who administers them. The new clause would not remove

schools&#146; ability to set their own criteria; it would simply

ensure that they do not bend those criteria to

cherry-pick.</div><a name="06051012000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the

new clause, schools or the local authority&#151;depending on who the

admission authority is&#151;would set admissions policies in line

with the code. All schools would then submit their policies to, say, a

local authority officer, who would administer the admissions. That

would allow a layer of scrutiny so that the local authority could see

whether the admissions policies were in line with the code, although we

have not explicitly included provision for that in the new clause; the

matter could be considered later.</div>

<a name="06051012000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parents would then apply to the

local authority with their school preferences, and the authority would

sort the applications, matching children against the school&#146;s

stated criteria. Names could be kept from schools, especially if an

electronic system were used; many local authorities now use such

systems. The process could therefore be entirely anonymised, with a

code, tag or number attached to the application so that even the

officer would not know who the families on the system were. The local

authority would then send out acceptance letters to parents and inform

schools of their intake. Under that system, head teachers and governors

would never see the list of names, so they could not pick out families

with difficult parents or the children who they know are always in

trouble with the police.</div>

<a name="06051012000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Local Government

Association thinks that the new clause would improve transparency, and

individual councils to which we have spoken have also been enthusiastic

about the idea of improving transparency and preventing cheating.

Teachers&#146; unions have expressed considerable concern about

allowing schools more freedom to set their own admissions and say that

they would favour a more co-ordinated system. That can be achieved only

by making the local authority the

co-ordinator.</div><a name="06051012000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me

reiterate. The new clause does not remove schools&#146; power to set

their own criteria, but prevents them from cheating. That would be a

helpful amendment to the Bill, and I strongly encourage the Government

to accept it.</div>

<a name="06051012000273"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000689"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> The Education Act 2002 gave local authorities

responsibility for co-ordinating the annual school admissions process

in England, but the process works on the basis of a balance of

responsibilities between schools and local authorities, with

own-admission authority schools setting and applying their own

admission arrangements, and local authorities managing the flow of

information on applications and potential offers and making the best

offer available to parents at the end of the process.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column701" />Column number: 702</div><a name="06051012000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">As individual admission

authorities are accountable for decisions to grant or refuse admission

to their schools, we do not agree that we should transfer statutory

responsibility to local authorities&#151;despite my instinctive

cultural sympathy for anything called new clause 4. Where schools admit

pupils by reference to aptitude, ability or commitment to faith, it

could be asking too much of local authorities to expect them to assess

applicants properly against a broad spectrum of criteria. In

particular, assessments of religious commitments are best made by the

governing bodies of the schools concerned, using objective evidence

provided by their religious leaders.</div>

<a name="06051012000275"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000690"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> We discussed this at the previous sitting, and I

very much agreed with the right hon. Member for Redditch that we should

not try to assess the level of religious commitment. A letter from a

priest is perfectly adequate. Why could that not be appended to an

admission application so that a box could be ticked to say that the

applicant agreed and met the

criteria?</div><a name="06051012000543"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12

noon</div><a name="06051012000276"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000691"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> There may be circumstances in which schools will

want to come together and, if they can, work out a simple way to remove

some of the bureaucracy, but I am concerned that a complex series of

criteria could be involved and it would be too bureaucratic to impose

the responsibility on local authorities. As I said, there may be some

merit in permitting such arrangements if they are practical and as long

as the local authority, the admission forum and individual admission

authorities in an area are in agreement with them, but other aspects of

the new clause are

unworkable.</div><a name="06051012000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through

funding agreements, the Secretary of State requires academies to

participate in co-ordination, but city technology colleges are not

bound by similar arrangements.</div>

<a name="06051012000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The suggestion that

applications should be anonymised is presumably based on the perception

that inclusion of personal details could lead to abuse of the system or

covert selection, but the Department has no evidence of such abuse, and

even if there were, costs would be incurred in altering the

administrative systems. There are practical reasons why the process

could not be operated as effectively if forms were anonymised. Many

schools use a sibling connection as one of their over-subscription

criteria, but they would not be able to assess whether applicants had a

sibling at the school if names were removed. Furthermore, removing

names alone would not be sufficient to anonymise an applicant. Some

could be disadvantaged by their address, for example, but removing that

clearly would not be feasible in respect of catchment area

criteria.</div><a name="06051012000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are

good reasons why the Government resist the new clause, although I

understand the good intent behind it. I hope that the hon. Lady will

agree to withdraw

it.</div><a name="06051012000280"></a>

Teather:</b> I am extremely disappointed that the Government

are not willing to accept the new clause. It was offered with

constructive intentions, and I believe 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column702" />Column number: 703</div>that it would considerably improve the Bill. I do not accept that there

is no evidence of abuse of the system. We have heard that one in four

head teachers admit to bending the system in order to cherry-pick. That

is not acceptable, and, as the hon. Member for Bury, North said when he

referred to that survey in a previous sitting, if one in four admit to

it, goodness only knows how many people are doing it without being

willing to admit to

it.</div><a name="06051012000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not accept

the Minister&#146;s arguments. Most of the criteria could be

perfectly well dealt with in the forms that are sent out, by ticking a

box. If certain aspects cannot be anonymised in respect of the local

authority, they should surely still be anonymised in respect of the

school, which is our point. The local authority is a more disinterested

and impartial adviser on such matters, and it would be far better to

leave administration of the admissions process with it rather than with

the schools in question, which have admitted to bending the

system.</div><a name="06051012000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am extremely

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000713"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second

time.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column703" />Column number: 704</div><a name="06051012000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is considerable evidence

from a wide range of studies&#151;I will not go into all of

them&#151;that schools that control their own admissions tend to use

it to increase social segregation. Despite the Government having made

it obligatory to adhere to a code, we are worried that it will be easy

to bend and not easy to enforce. My greatest concern is whether a

system that requires so many safeguards is really safe in the first

place. As the Government have been unwilling to accept our constructive

suggestions on improving the admissions process, the new clause would

remove the ability of new foundation schools to control their own

admissions and be their own admission

authority.</div><a name="06051012000310"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000714"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> It seems that the Liberals take every opportunity to

undermine the Bill&#146;s objectives. Section 88 of the School

Standards and Framework Act 1998 states that the admission authority of

a foundation or voluntary aided school shall be the governing body of

that school. Despite that, the new clause provides that the local

authority, not the governing body, would be the admission authority for

new foundation schools acquiring a foundation and for academies. It

would drive a coach and horses through the entire thrust of the Bill,

and we shall vote against it if the hon. Lady divides the Committee on

the new clause.</div>

<a name="06051012000311"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000715"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> There is little for me to add to the debate. Trust

schools will be required to operate their admissions in the same way as

any other foundation or voluntary aided school and to comply with all

admissions law. We have set out and strengthened the code. There is the

ability to appeal to the schools adjudicator from the admission forum,

which in turn has increased

powers.</div><a name="06051012000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.

Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, the new clause would

drive a coach and horses through the Bill and what we are trying to

achieve. There is no reason why trust schools and academies should have

less freedom than other schools that are their own admission authority.

Sufficient safeguards are in place and I will table further amendments

on safeguards on Report. We want to ensure that admission arrangements

are fair and in accordance with the code. I hope that the hon. Lady

will ask leave to withdraw the new clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000740"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> The amendment would incorporate a key measure that,

as drafted, is left to regulation. Paragraph (4) of the schedule is

about a school&#146;s delegated budget, and it amends section 49 of

the School Standards Framework Act so that it says:</div>

<a name="06051012000522"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A new school shall have

a delegated budget from a date determined by

regulation.&#148;</div><a name="06051012000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">The date is

clear and the policy is unlikely to change. Paragraph 26.10 of the

regulatory impact assessment says that the policy is</div>

<a name="06051012000523"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to give temporary Governing

Bodies of new schools a delegated budget 15 months prior to the school

admitting pupils (or, in the case of the temporary Governing Body not

being established15 months prior to admission of pupils, at

the point it is

established).&#148;</div><a name="06051012000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendment would include that wording in the Bill.</div>

<a name="06051012000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">The wording is included in the

draft regulations that the Minister circulated. It is in regulation 2

of the School Finance (England) Regulations 2006. Since the policy is

not likely to change to 14 or 16 months, or to any period other than 15

months, which is a reasonable period by which a new school will need to

spend the budget prior to opening, it should be in the Bill and not

left to regulations.</div>

<a name="06051012000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 177 is a probing

amendment. It would make schools forum decisions unanimous to prevent

the outvoting of minority representation on the forum. I caution

against the trend of passing 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column705" />Column number: 706</div>decision making to unelected bodies, however representative of local

interest those unelected bodies purport to

be.</div>

<a name="06051012000349"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000741"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> Is not that the point that I made just five

minutes ago, when the hon. Gentleman said that I should give power not

to local authorities but to unelected governing bodies with a majority

of appointed governors?</div>

<a name="06051012000350"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000742"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> No, it is not the same thing, because a school is

accountable to local people, and if it is not popular among parents, it

simply will not attract pupils. Schools forums are different. They are

deliberately set up to be quasi-authorities with decision-making

powers. In a democracy, it is important that in such bodies, different

from schools, elected officials should take those decisions, whether

local or national. Elected politicians should not pass the buck to such

bodies as a way of avoiding difficult decisions.</div>

<a name="06051012000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 170 is another

probing amendment. It would delete paragraph (6), which removes the

right of appeal by schools against LEA decisions to take away its

delegated budget. I assume that the measure is to deal with schools

that cause concern, but it would be helpful if the Minister explained

and put on the record the reason for it.</div>

<a name="06051012000352"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000743"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. Amendment No. 176 would

specify the date by which a local authority must provide the governing

body of a new school with a delegated budget share prior to its

admitting pupils. At present, legislation requires that such a budget

is available only from the date at which a new school admits pupils. We

believe that a governing body should have access to a budget from a

point at which it starts incurring the expenditure needed to set up a

new school.</div> <a name="06051012000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the

hon. Gentleman said, the amendment would include in the Bill the

requirement for the budget share to be made available to the school 15

months prior to the first admission of pupils. That is absolutely in

line with our intention, but we believe that there is no need to

include it because the illustrative regulations show that we intend to

make such provision by way of secondary

legislation.</div><a name="06051012000544"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15

pm</div><a name="06051012000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

177 would enable regulation to be made allowing schools forums to

approve revisions, as the hon. Gentleman described. Currently, all such

revisions have to be approved by either the Secretary of State in the

case of England or the National Assembly in the case of Wales. His

probing amendment would require unanimous agreement within a schools

forum before any such revision could be

made.</div><a name="06051012000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Government&#146;s view is that that would place too great a burden on

the degree of local consensus necessary to enable local flexibility to

operate effectively and that it would be out of step with the ability

of forums to decide on a range of other local matters. Extension of the

power of schools forums to agree revisions locally must be on the same

basis as for powers already devolved to them. When there is local 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column706" />Column number: 707</div>consensus on an issue, but not unanimity, approval for the local

authority&#146;s proposals should be granted. Most of us find it

difficult to agree unanimously&#151;not least in the Chamber.

Ultimately, however, when presented with a proposal from its local

authority, a schools forum must abide by the majority view, and when

that view supports the proposal, we believe that it should prevail and

involved.</div><a name="06051012000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.

Gentleman said, amendment No. 170 concerns the important situation of a

local authority having cause to withdraw the financial delegation right

of a governing body. I think that I can give him the assurances he

requested. Withdrawal can occur when the governing body has been guilty

of a substantial or persistent failure to comply with a delegation

requirement or restriction, or has not satisfactorily managed

expenditure or appropriation of its delegated budget, or of any sums

received in the exercise of its power to provide community facilities.

The amendment would retain a right of appeal, as it would leave the

current schedule to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998

unchanged.</div><a name="06051012000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise

the need for checks and balances, and there are benefits in giving

schools a high degree of financial freedom, but the withdrawal of

delegated powers is an ultimate sanction and one that would be

exercised very rarely, as I have described. Such cases are complex and

are best addressed at a local level. With that reassurance as to the

purpose of the schedule and of the proposed changes to it, I hope that

he will withdraw his

amendment.</div><a name="06051012000358"></a>

The types of stateschool in question must be outside the local authority system. Theyhave deliberately been made non-maintained schools, with independentgovernance and sponsor bodies. That independence affords them thefreedoms and flexibilities to raise standards in schools where therehas been prolonged under-achievement. Indeed, academies are improvingthree times faster than the national average at GCSE. We cannot accepta situation wherein, if a non-maintained school is deemed inadequate,the local authority takes over again. That would not only go back onthe <div class="Column"><a name="Column710" />Column number: 711</div>fundamental principle of independence, but it would in many cases putthe school back in the hands of an authority that failed to address thesystemic failure of its predecessor school.</div><a name="06051012000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill provides fornon-maintained school proprietors&#151;often the controllingtrust&#151;to take action immediately when the school gets aninadequate judgment from Ofsted inspectors.

The academies have a duty to have regard toadvice from the Secretary of State, which effectively provides asimilar mechanism. The Secretary of State can intervene in an academythrough the articles of association and funding agreement held betweenthe Department and the academy trust; he may appoint additionalgovernors, stop funding or close the academy. Those are very similarpowers to those that local authorities have in relation to maintainedschools. I hope, on that basis, that the hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000759"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> The amendments deal with the compliance period

within which schools have to respond to the issuing of a warning

notice. The amendments are to do with the practical consequences of the

compliance period. Amendments Nos. 453 and 454 would simply change the

Bill&#146;s proposal for a compliance period of 15 days to one of 20

days. Although I fully accept that a school that is likely to receive a

warning notice from a local authority will not be surprised by

it&#151;there will have been a period of many months, and sometimes

years, during which the school&#146;s difficulties have been

discussed&#151;15 days still seems an extremely short period for a

school to decide whether it wishes to challenge the warning notice by

appealing to the chief inspector of schools, hence the suggestion for

20 working days rather than

15.</div><a name="06051012000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 455

would simply ensure that the ending of the compliance period does not

fall within the school holidays. Regardless of the arguments about

whether teachers have too long a period of holiday in summer, it serves

no practical purpose for the period of notice to fall within that

holiday period, or any other school holiday period, if the school is to

be in the strongest possible position to respond intelligently to the

warning notice issued&#151;either to accept it, or to decide to

appeal against it. These three short amendments are intended simply to

improve the practicalities of the workings of the warning notice

system.</div><a name="06051012000402"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000760"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> We are sympathetic to the amendments; they seem

to us to be extremely sensible. Fifteen days is indeed a very short

period in which to call what would undoubtedly be an emergency meeting

of the governing body to consider all the evidence and to draft any

response, and to expect a school to do that during the school holidays

would be entirely unreasonable. We encourage the Government to accept

this Labour amendment&#151;they might be more willing to agree to a

Labour amendment than a Liberal Democrat

amendment.</div>

<a name="06051012000403"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000761"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I fear that the hon. Lady feels victimised. I will

not disappoint her by dealing unevenly with her and my hon. Friend the

Member for Bury, North.</div>

<a name="06051012000404"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000762"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> Will the Minister give

way?</div><a name="06051012000405"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000763"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> At such an early stage, before I have even started

developing my argument, it would be a pleasure to do

so.</div><a name="06051012000406"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000764"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> Will the Minister remind me how many amendments he

or his predecessor has accepted in this Committee&#151;apart from the

Government&#146;s, of

course?</div><a name="06051012000407"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000765"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> We listen carefully to the arguments that are

made, and we have made it clear that there are some issues on which we

want to reflect. As ever, we 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column712" />Column number: 713</div>are informed by the wise words of all Committee members, even if

sometimes we disagree with them.</div>

<a name="06051012000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.

Friend the Member for Bury, North seeks to amend clause 47, which is

about the need for some schools to address issues on standards more

seriously and urgently than they have done in the past. Under the

current system, there are some opportunities for delay and

procrastination, and I am concerned that the amendments might enable a

few contumacious governing bodies to do that.</div>

<a name="06051012000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the first place, my hon.

Friend has argued that20 days for a response to a warning is

more reasonable than 15, but 15 days&#151;three working

weeks&#151;is not unreasonable since we are not necessarily expecting

a full remedy from the school. I emphasise a point made in the draft

guidance on the issue from my hon. Friend. The school has 15 working

days to comply with the warning notice to the authority&#146;s

satisfaction. That may not involve a full rectification of the specific

problem since it may not be practicable to do so in that time scale,

but it will undoubtedly involve the positive steps towards the

solution.</div> <a name="06051012000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,

in relation to amendment No. 455 my hon. Friend has argued, in effect,

that all those actions need to be carried out in term time. I beg to

differ given that, in an extreme case, a situation could arise in July

that would then have to be shelved until September and then occupy or

possibly distract the school for the crucial first four weeks of the

autumn term. I am sure that the vast majority of head teachers and

education professionals would regard that this issue should have an

absolute priority and may need to be dealt with as quickly as possible.

The legal onus is in any event on the governing body and not directly

on classroom teachers.</div>

<a name="06051012000411"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000766"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> Will the Minister clarify whether in

circumstances of extreme urgency&#151;where children were considered

to be at risk for health and safety reasons&#151;the local authority

would still be empowered to intervene immediately and not have to wait

for the end of the 15-day compliance

period?</div>

<a name="06051012000412"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000767"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> Yes. In circumstances of extreme emergency we

would expect it to do so. Local authorities should be realistic,

however. I have listened to my hon. Friend and I suspect that there

will be relatively few times when the need for warning emerges just

before school holidays. I will consider whether we need to add a

sentence or so to the guidance to make that point, particularly in

respect of the timing of issuing notices, to ensure that the urgent

work that must be carried out is done while the school is sitting. I

hope on that basis the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his

amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000771"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Clause 47 and the subsequent clauses in part 4 of

the Bill are important. Many of the provisions are re-enactments of

previous legislation but there are new powers designed to tackle

failure, underperformance and complacency wherever they exist in our

school system. The Conservative party fully supports that

objective.</div> <a name="06051012000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph

13.7 of the regulatory impact assessment at page 137 says,</div>

<a name="06051012000525"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is unacceptable for

any school to provide a low standard of education for its pupils

irrespective of location or background of the pupils&#148;.</div>

<a name="06051012000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">We agree with that statement 100 per

cent., as we do the statement in paragraph 5 of the draft guidance on

schools causing concern circulated to members of the Committee on 19

April, which says,</div><a name="06051012000526"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we

know that there are still pupils who are let down by attending poorly

performing or failing schools for too long...Our ambition is that

every school should be a good

school&#148;.</div><a name="06051012000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to the

National Audit Office, 980,000 pupils are attending poorly performing

schools. Twenty-three per cent of secondary schools are regarded as

poorly performing. As of January 2006 there were 232 schools in special

measures; of those, 47 primary schools and 43 secondary schools have

been in special measures for over 12 months. Of those 232 schools in

special measures, only six primary schools and four secondary schools

are regarded as making sufficient progress to leave special measures in

the near future.</div> <a name="06051012000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

will come to the measures proposed to deal with those schools when we

come to clause 49, but I noticed that in paragraph 4 of the draft

guidance the Government highlight the fact that the number of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column714" />Column number: 715</div>schools that Ofsted has put into special measures has dropped from 515

in 1998 to 242 by the summer of 2005. I think that it is a mistake to

turn special measures into a target or a measure of progress in

improving schools. There is a huge degree of professional subjectivity

in determining when a school should be put into special measures.

Turning that into a target will inevitably result in pressure on Ofsted

to ease up on schools that ought to be in special measures, to

demonstrate that the Government&#151;or the next

Government&#151;and Ofsted are delivering better

schools.</div><a name="06051012000426"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 47 is

about early intervention in schools before they reach the crisis point

at which an Ofsted inspection concludes that they require significant

improvement or need to be put into special measures. Paragraph 7 of the

draft guidance states that the aim

is</div><a name="06051012000527"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to enable earlier

action where there is evidence that this is required to ensure

underperformance does not become

entrenched&#148;.</div><a name="06051012000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill

re-enacts swathes of previous legislation on local authority powers

over schools, but adds a few more provisions. In relation to clause 47,

the regulatory impact assessment

reads:</div><a name="06051012000528"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Currently,

the existing power for local authorities to warn a school is too

complex and limited in

scope.&#148;</div><a name="06051012000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 27 of

the draft guidance

states:</div><a name="06051012000529"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There

is a strong justification, therefore, for updating LAs&#146; powers

to give formal warnings and use their powers of intervention. Currently

the system is somewhat cumbersome, and depends on a restricted

definition of

performance.&#148;</div><a name="06051012000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the

performance that would trigger the powers under clause 47 to which the

amendments are related.</div>

<a name="06051012000430"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 47(2) gives three broad

categories of poor school performance that could trigger a warning

notice from a local authority: standards of performance that are

unacceptably low and likely to remain so, a breakdown in management,

and the safety of pupils being under threat. Taking the first of those

categories&#151;the performance of the school&#151;amendment No.

173 would define unacceptably low performance as that for

which</div><a name="06051012000530"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;OFSTED has graded

the school as no better than satisfactory or

poor.&#148;</div><a name="06051012000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">As members of the

Committee know, Ofsted awards four grades to schools under the new

inspection arrangements: excellent, good, satisfactory or poor.

Satisfactory grades are currently given to about 30 per cent. of

schools inspected. As paragraph 13.8 of the regulatory impact

assessment

says:</div><a name="06051012000531"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The new

Ofsted inspection framework challenges all schools to be

&#147;good&#148; or &#147;excellent&#148;.

&#147;Satisfactory&#148; is no longer good enough &#151; as that

may mean that some children will not achieve their full

potential.&#148;</div><a name="06051012000432"></a><div class="hs_Para">In amendment

No. 173, therefore, we seek to include in clause 47(2) the standard

that the Government and the Opposition agree is unacceptably low:

schools providing no more than a satisfactory standard of

education.</div><a name="06051012000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 174 would include in clause 47(2) another definition of poor

performance: that a school&#146;s value-added measure lies within the

fourth quartile of the national league table. The amendment is 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column715" />Column number: 716</div>remarkably similar to the measure of poor performance set out in

paragraph 33 of the draft guidance, and I hasten to add that our

amendments were tabled some weeks before the guidance was issued. I

mention that not to demonstrate prescience but to highlight how much in

tune the Opposition are with the Government&#146;s thinking on

tackling underperformance in our state schools. When it comes to

driving up the quality of education and challenging poor performance,

the Government will find full support from those on the Opposition

Benches for measures that we believe will raise

standards.</div><a name="06051012000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph

33 of the draft guidance gives examples of circumstances that should

trigger a warning notice to the governing body of a school. One such

example

says:</div><a name="06051012000532"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

school is in the bottom quartile, and probably in the bottom decile,

nationally, on one or more key performance indicators. These would

focus on contextual value added data which takes into account prior

performance, deprivation etc., but could also include, for example, low

attainment rates, aggregate point scores and exclusion and truancy

data.&#148;</div><a name="06051012000435"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not a

million miles from our amendment, except that we use the word

&#147;fourth&#148; instead of &#147;bottom&#148; and suggest

the use of the value-added measure rather than contextual value-added

data, which is being piloted and will, I suspect, receive mixed

reviews. I recently visited a school in the north of England that is

regarded as &#147;excellent&#148; by Ofsted and has a very high

value-added score, but would have a score some way lower than 1,000

under the contextual value-added measure. The view of the head teacher

is that the basis on which points are added or subtracted for the

contextual purpose bears no resemblance to the reality of the

advantages and challenges. We need to take great care in plunging

headlong into this subjective measure for assessing schools, which

will, under the new two-day Ofsted inspection regime, provide the bulk

of the data and information informing the inspectors&#146; view of

the

school.</div><a name="06051012000546"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45

pm</div><a name="06051012000436"></a><div class="hs_Para">The paragraph

from which I have just quoted also talks about using exclusion data,

which would also be a mistake and would provide a perverse incentive to

head teachers not to exclude a pupil, even where he or she should be

excluded. That is another example of the care that needs to be taken in

using measures to assess schools that can easily be manipulated by

those who benefit from the

data.</div><a name="06051012000437"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

175 would provide two more definitions of poor performance to the

current criteria in clause 47(2), relating to what the Government have

termed a &#147;floor target&#148; of performance. Paragraph 13.8 of

the regulatory impact assessment says that this is an absolute measure

and sets out the targets as

follows:</div><a name="06051012000533"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in all schools

at least 25% of pupils will achieve five or more A*-C GCSEs by 2006 and

30% by 2008&#148;.</div><a name="06051012000438"></a><div class="hs_Para">Compare

that with schools like Thomas Telford, where 100 per cent. of the

pupils achieve 12 GCSEs at A* to C, including English and Maths,

although it takes a banded intake based on national data and 11 per

cent. of pupils qualify for free school meals. It is unacceptable that

there are so many schools where 75 per cent. or more of

pupils do not achieve five good 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column716" />Column number: 717</div>GCSEs. Amendment No. 175 would incorporate in subsection (2) the

definition of unacceptably low performance contained in the

Government&#146;s &#147;floor target&#148;

definition.</div><a name="06051012000439"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the

Government do not accept that the three different, but not mutually

exclusive, definitions of performance to be regarded as unacceptably

low should not be included in the Bill, will the Minister explain why

those definitions have not been included in the draft guidance on

schools causing concern? The three definitions that I have provided

fall short of schools requiring special measures and significant

improvement, which are dealt with in clauses 48 and 49, but not that

far short. Given that the purpose of clause 47 is to provide early

intervention, before schools reach the point of being put into special

measures or requiring significant improvement, it is odd that such

indicators, as set out in the amendments, are not included in paragraph

33 of the draft

guidance.</div><a name="06051012000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should

like to touch on one further point in relation to the clause and the

amendments. Paragraph 9.18 of the White Paper

says:</div><a name="06051012000534"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Local

authorities have been under a duty since 1998 to help to drive up

standards in schools, but we will build on recent reforms to strengthen

this role. Ensuring quality does not mean trespassing on school

autonomy&#148;.</div><a name="06051012000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a

concern, which I do not share, that the combined effect of the clauses,

together with the draft guidance on schools causing concern, would

reduce the autonomy that other parts of the Bill are designed to

create. My view is that the clauses about which I am talking, for the

most part, replicate legislation that is already on the statute book

and, where local authority power is increased, that is solely to do

with tackling unacceptably low performance. None of us should be

prepared to allow schools to languish year after year, providing poor

education to our children. Autonomy is about liberating the management

and leadership of the school from cloying interference in the

day-to-day running of the school. However, that does not mean that the

school is unaccountable for its performance; when it fails to provide

the quality of education that we expect, it should, in extremis, lose

that autonomy until the problem is

fixed.</div><a name="06051012000442"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am concerned

about paragraph 30 of the draft guidance, which

says:</div><a name="06051012000535"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any

failure to implement the school workforce agreement, or poor management

of the workforce, may contribute to falling standards of performance at

a school.&#148;</div><a name="06051012000443"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is wrong to

insert input measures into definitions of unacceptable outcomes. That

would lead to a loss of autonomy in the day-to-day running of the

school. It is important to keep the definitions of unacceptably low

performance tight and focused on the outcomes, and not to use these

fairly draconian provisions as a mechanism for implementing and

enforcing other priorities.</div>

<a name="06051012000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn briefly and finally to

amendments Nos. 162 and 163, which incorporate into the definition of

unacceptably low performance a situation where the school fails to

deliver improved well-being for all pupils. Well-being is defined in

amendment No. 163 as the five outcomes in the &#147;Every Child

Matters&#148; White Paper and the Children Act 2004: physical and

mental health and well-being; protection from harm and neglect;

education, training and recreation; the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column717" />Column number: 718</div>contribution made to society; and social and economic well-being. The

two amendments have the support of the Local Government Association,

which

states:</div><a name="06051012000536"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;During

our lobbying on the Children Act, we stressed the importance that

schools are part of the duty to co-operate in the delivery of the Act.

Schools are organisationally independent of the local authority and as

such there could be room for ambiguity about their statutory

responsibilities and duties unless they are specified as having that

statutory duty. This amendment seeks to rectify this, leaving no room

for ambiguity as a result of their independent

status.&#148;</div><a name="06051012000445"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

that note, I await the Minister&#146;s response to these six

supportive but important amendments.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000772"></a>Greg

Mulholland:</b> In my attempt to be extremely brief last time

I spoke, I omitted to welcome the new Minister for Schools. I apologise

for that, welcome him and look forward to working with him in the

course of proceedings on the Bill and in the future. It is the first

time that I have had the opportunity to welcome an opposite number on

any side.</div> <a name="06051012000447"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also wish

to add to the comments made earlier about the previous Minister for

Schools, the right hon. Member for Redditch. I think that we all agree

that she has dealt with the Committee in an impressive way using a lot

of diplomacy and her powers of persuasion, which are skills that she

certainly will need in her new job in these interesting

times.</div> <a name="06051012000448"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we

can see what the Conservative Front Benchers are trying to do with

amendments No. 174 and 175, we feel strongly that they are too rigid as

regards the triggers for the process taking place. We feel that it is

unfair to create automatic triggers based on league tables, whether

value added or results tables.

</div><a name="06051012000449"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we consider any

schools tables, we see that some schools have low value-added scores

and high results, and conversely some have high value-added scores and

low results, so it becomes a little arbitrary. There is a danger that

the amendments would penalise schools that through no fault of their

own end up with low value-added scores but not results. They could lead

to a school with a middle-class intake, high results and potentially

low value-added scores reaching the trigger level. I am sure that that

is not what was intended.</div>

<a name="06051012000450"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other problem with league

tables is the question of what happens if all the schools in the area

are performing adequately. That is quite possible, and we have to

acknowledge that league tables can be quite arbitrary.</div>

<a name="06051012000451"></a><div class="hs_Para">The good thing for Conservative

Front Benchers is that we strongly support amendment No. 162, which

would be a worthwhile addition to the Bill. It is important to

emphasise well-being as a criteria for judging schools, and it is

certainly a concern if schools are failing children on that

basis.</div> <a name="06051012000452"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we

are sympathetic to the intentions behind amendment No. 163, we feel

that the definitions have gone a little too far in terms of what should

be included. Schools cannot reasonably be expected to take over the

role of the parent for the child&#146;s economic well-being, for

example. From that point of view, we feel that amendment No. 162 is

helpful but amendment No. 163 is not. I look forward to the

Minister&#146;s comments on what would be helpful in defining what

well-being could be.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column718" />Column number: 719</div><a name="06051012000453"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000773"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis

and Littlehampton for tabling the amendments, because reading up on

them and listening to him and the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West

(Greg Mulholland) has been helpful. I shall say at the outset, because

we are short of time, that that will make me take another look at the

guidance and reflect on the comments, but I shall resist the amendments

all the same. The Government have made substantial progress in dealing

with failing schools and very low attaining schools. I say to the hon.

Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that we have never set a

national target for the number of schools in special measures, but

clearly we want there to be as few as

possible.</div><a name="06051012000454"></a><div class="hs_Para">To

date, less emphasis has been placed on underperformance, but even in

that respect the Government have a good story to tell. The majority of

poorly performing schools in the NAO survey are not failing&#151;that

is, in Ofsted categories&#151;or very low attaining; they are

identified as underperforming or coasting. In essence, those schools

are not using their full capacity. Large numbers of pupils will not be

reaching their full potential, but many pupils in the schools will be

doing well and we must not underestimate their achievements or those of

the teachers who are leading them well. That is why quoting the figure

of 1 million pupils in poor schools is potentially

misleading.</div><a name="06051012000455"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000774"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> What the report certainly reveals&#151;there is

little debate about this&#151;is that that type of underperformance

is identified too slowly and that once it is identified schools stay in

those circumstances too long. What does the Minister say specifically

about those two

criticisms?</div><a name="06051012000456"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000775"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> That is precisely why we are introducing these

measures. Clause 47 has been carefully constructed to give local

authorities a power to ensure that schools can be tackled early, so

that the current generation of pupils does not have to fail in order

for the next generation to be helped. It ensures that we can intervene

now for today&#146;s pupils so that they receive the education that

they need and deserve. The legislation will link closely to the draft

guidance. As I said, I shall have another look at the guidance, given

the points that have been

made.</div><a name="06051012000457"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000776"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> Will the Minister accept that, with 20,000 schools,

there are severe constraints on his ability to impose his will, however

beneficial that might be, on failing schools and that the key pressure

on failing schools in a system in which the money follows the pupil is

that parents take their children away from those

schools?</div><a name="06051012000458"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051012000777"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> Clearly, we believe that the exercise of choice is

an element, but it is not the only element. I cannot keep a close eye

on every school in the country, but the hon. Gentleman will be relieved

to know that there are others who assist me and my colleagues. I

believe that the architecture that we have, as amended by this

legislation, is the right architecture to allow us 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column719" />Column number: 720</div>properly to deliver an improved education for all our children in all

their individual

circumstances.</div><a name="06051012000459"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

amendment No. 163, schools do have to have regard to the five outcomes

in &#147;Every Child Matters&#148;, but they cannot deliver them on

their own. They will need to work in partnership with a number of

others, including voluntary and community groups and local authorities,

so it will be difficult to assess an individual school&#146;s

contribution to an outcome. I ask the Committee to resist the amendment

on that basis. There is plenty more that I could say on it, but I shall

stop there.</div><a name="06051012000460"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

amendments Nos. 173 to 175, we set out in the draft guidance when

warning notices should and should not be issued, and I believe that the

framework is sufficiently well defined that the amendments are

unnecessary. To use the lowest quartile is difficult because by

definition that is a relative measure; there will always be a lowest

quartile. That is why we talk in the guidance about schools that are

&#147;persistently&#148; in the lowest

quartile.</div><a name="06051012000461"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the basis

of what I have said, I hope that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and

Littlehampton will withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="06051012000462"></a>
