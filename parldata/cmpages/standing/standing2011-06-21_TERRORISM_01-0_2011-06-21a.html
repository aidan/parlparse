               <p class="tabbed">As a general
rule, I and my fellow Chair do not intend to call starred amendments
that have not been tabled with adequate notice. The required notice
period for Public Bill Committees is three working days. Therefore,
amendments should be tabled by the rise of the House on Monday for
consideration on Thursday, and by Thursday for consideration on the
following Tuesday.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000007">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">For those
Members less familiar with the process of taking oral evidence in
Public Bill Committees, it may help if I briefly explain how we will
proceed. The Committee will first be asked to consider the programme
motion, the debate on which is limited to half an hour. We will then
proceed to take a motion to report written evidence and a motion to
permit the Committee to deliberate in private in advance of hearing
oral evidence, which I hope we can take formally. Assuming that the
second of those motions is agreed to, the Committee will then move into
private session. Once the Committee has deliberated, the witnesses and
members of the public will be invited back into the room and our oral
evidence session will begin. If the Committee agrees to the programme
motion, we will hear oral evidence this
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000008">&#160;</a>

am delighted to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Scott, and
that of your co-Chair, Mr Caton. I am also looking forward to lively
debate and discussion on the Bill with members of the Committee. I
welcome to the Committee the hon. Member for Bradford South, who will
be leading for the Opposition. He and I have debated a range of issues
over the past few years. It is also a pleasure to welcome other
Committee members. I know that a great deal of expertise and knowledge
resides in the Committee, so I look forward to an informed debate
around a number of the issues germane to the Bill. I underline again
the Government’s commitment to dealing with terrorism and the
responsibility that we hold for keeping citizens safe.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000010">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I believe
that the programme motion provides plenty of time for our detailed
scrutiny of the Bill. We will have eight sittings of line-by-line
consideration after today’s oral evidence sessions. We believe
that that will provide sufficient time, but we will monitor progress
carefully to ensure that due and appropriate scrutiny is carried
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000011">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
look forward to the scrutiny process. It was clear from our Second
Reading debate that there are strongly held opinions about how the Bill
should be taken forward, including views from different parties about
what the emphasis should be. I look forward to listening to all sides
of the
argument.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000012">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
first question to you, deputy assistant commissioner, is on the new
role that the police will have in relation to the Bill. I am concerned
that more resources will be required and that the police will have to
face more issues. Do you think that that is practicable? What are the
issues related to manpower and resources, and do you foresee any
problems?<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000031">&#160;</a>

Osborne:</strong>
                  </em> The role the police will perform under
terrorism prevention and investigation measures is exactly the same as
that under control orders, in that it is for us to monitor and enforce
the order, so that will 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 4<a class="bkMark" name="Column4">&#160;</a>
                  </div>not change. Some of the changes in the Bill, such as with regard to
relocation, night curfew or night residence, will mean that the
environment becomes more challenging for police to work in. Therefore,
we will need some additional resources to meet the additional demands.
We have made submissions to the Home Office for a budget increase to
cover
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000032">&#160;</a>

to be different. However, we are hopeful that we will be able to do our

increase.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000033">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> You say that the duties will be similar to or
the same as those under the present legislation. Are there any issues
related to that? For instance, a number of convicted terrorists will be
back in society next year because they will have been released on
licence. Do you have any worries about the associations that might
occur, given the opportunities that the Bill provides for individuals
to associate with different types of
people?<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000036">&#160;</a>

                  </em> Hopefully, the new Bill still has the
ability to place restrictions on associations, but the issue will be
the environment within which such associations may take place.
Previously, with relocation, it was easy to identify the environment in
which associations may happen. If a lot of people who are on the orders
live in one close environment, managing that and looking at those
associations is potentially more difficult.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000037">&#160;</a>

                  <strong> </strong>Following on from that, there is the
ability for relocation to be called into question under the new Bill.
Does such people being in London for next year’s Olympics cause
any concerns?<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000038">&#160;</a>

                  </em> Ideally, if people are at risk, the further
you can keep them away from the point of risk the better. If people are
all within one geographic location—and it might be that people
do not stay in London; they might decide to go
elsewhere—managing that will need more resources and a greater
ability to intervene, should they get to the areas where we would not
want them to be. The new Bill makes the provision to put in place
exclusion areas for places that you do not want people to go to, so
there is an ability to interdict at that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000039">&#160;</a>

                  </em> It is very difficult to answer. It is not
only one measure inasmuch as the relocation is concerned, because the
relocation is combined with a curfew, with an association, and then
with the ability to restrict areas. That all adds up, so it is not
simple. Essentially, if you wanted surveillance coverage for one person
for 24 hours, that would require four surveillance teams,
which is very expensive.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000049">&#160;</a>

Committee later on. Actually, we probably would not seek to do that
just with personnel. We would look to find other ways of doing that
more effectively. One issue with control orders at the moment is that
we have managed to come to a style where we have been able to monitor
and enforce them in an effective, efficient manner. We would need to
look at how we could best do that in a similar fashion under the new
TPIMs Bill. However, until we know exactly what the Bill looks like and
how it will operate, it is difficult to say what additional resources
would be needed and at what cost.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000051">&#160;</a>

for us being able to monitor and enforce at the current time. Without
that relocation, and depending on where people choose to live, that
could be significantly more difficult. Where the choice of residence
will be and how many people are within an area will affect the
complexities, but there are different environments that make policing
easier or more difficult. People could choose to live in an area that
was difficult to police in normal circumstances, and that would be even
more difficult to police in relation to monitoring control order
subjects.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000053">&#160;</a>

What would the bar be for prosecuting somebody for terrorist offences?

you try to guide a chief
officer?<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000077">&#160;</a>

                  </em> The test would be precisely the same for a
terrorism-related case as it would be for any other. The question would
be, therefore, whether there is sufficient evidence to provide a
realistic prospect of conviction and whether a prosecution would be in
the public interest. The second question pretty well answers itself in
a terrorist case. The critical question is always whether there is
sufficient
evidence.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000078">&#160;</a>

necessary, we use the threshold test. We prefer not to, but it is one
that we can use. We would not approach a case where there may be a

the same test. The critical question in such cases is sufficient
“(admissible)” evidence. That is really where all the
work is done in such cases. That is the focus of our examination of the

                     <strong>Keir
Starmer:</strong>
                  </em> I think it is important to focus on what the
difficulties are before coming to whether intercept is the answer. The
difficulties that we confront in these cases are as follows. First,
what we are looking at is very often an intelligence-based file, and
therefore is not a file that has the sort of evidence that you might
find in other cases. That brings into sharp focus the issue of
admissibility: where has the intelligence come from? Is it a source
that can sensibly be put into the public domain, or would that put
other sources and individuals at risk? Is it coherent? Often, the
intelligence picture 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 8<a class="bkMark" name="Column8">&#160;</a>
                  </div>may be fragmented because of the nature of intelligence—it may
well work for an intelligence purpose, but may not work for building a
case. There are also rules about hearsay which apply strictly in the
criminal arena but not in the intelligence arena. It is true that
hearsay evidence can now be adduced in criminal cases, but there are
limits on that—the statutory tests. These are the issues we are
predominantly looking at.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000081">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Even when
there is evidence—something in addition to the intelligence that
we can use—the question is then, is there enough to provide that
realistic prospect of a conviction? If there is, we would prefer to
prosecute, because we strongly believe in the priority of prosecuting,
and we have prosecuted a number of cases, as everybody
knows.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000082">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is one additional group which warrants some consideration. Of the 12
control orders which are now in place, three are what we call
post-acquittal control orders, meaning that we have taken the decision
historically that there was enough evidence to bring proceedings, and
the judge has very often taken the view that there is enough evidence
to leave the case to the jury, but the jury has none the less
acquitted; there is then an examination of the file. In these cases,
the question is slightly different: there was obviously admissible
evidence—that was the base upon which the case was put forward
in the first place—so the question is, what is there,
post-acquittal, that might cause concern to those who are assessing
risk?<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000083">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Returning to
your question—how do we plug those gaps?—some of them are
difficult to plug, because if you are dealing with intelligence, you
are dealing with intelligence. As far as intercept is concerned, my own
position is that, in principle, I am in favour of intercept evidence
being admissible in evidence, subject to two caveats. The first is that
there must be a fair trial, and therefore the disclosure issues raised
by intercept evidence have to be fully thought through—and they
are not straightforward, as everybody appreciates. Secondly, there
should be a caveat that the use in any given set of circumstances or
set of cases should not significantly impact on the ability of the
security and intelligence services to do their job. But, in principle,
I am in
favour.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000084">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is a difficulty in assessing whether or not intercept would have made
the difference in historical cases, because, when historical cases were
prepared, intercept evidence was not admissible, and therefore it was
never part of the thinking for an operation that you would be obtaining
admissible intercept evidence. To look at cases now and say,
“Would it have made a difference?” is an exercise, but in
my view a pretty limited
exercise.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000085">&#160;</a>

post-acquittal cases, where people have specifically been acquitted by

the measures listed in, for example, schedule 1 could make it harder
for the police to gather evidence. Part of the idea of relaxing the
rules on electronic communications is to make this easier. What is your
view on the balance of that? Does a TPIM, or a control order, actually
make it harder to
prosecute?<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000086">&#160;</a>

this. The chances of getting admissible evidence for a prosecution

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 9<a class="bkMark" name="Column9">&#160;</a>
                  </div>reduced, because the fact of the order is open—it is known to the
individual—as are the conditions. I
understand the thinking that, under the old control order regime, by
controlling the individual and stopping them engaging in activity which
might be criminal, you are hardly likely to further a criminal
investigation. So far, that is true. We have prosecuted one individual
who was on a control order, but that was as a result of information
that came to light that related to his activities pre-control order. I
appreciate that part of the thinking behind the Bill is that, if you
could have a different approach that allowed the investigation to
continue in a slightly different way, you might get a different result.
I would not stand in the way of that, but, speaking frankly, there is
not a great chance of getting evidence after the imposition of the
order. There might be a chance of getting evidence about behaviour
before the
order.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000087">&#160;</a>

inter-dependants there. The control order put people in the protect and
prepare part of the Contest strategy. TPIMs moves them back into the
pursue element of the strategy, which is a slight paradox because it
was only due to the failure to get sufficient evidence to prosecute
them that we moved them into the control order in the first place. So

                  </em> A specified residence is very helpful,
because it will give you somewhere where people are supposed to be
based, rather than being somewhat nomadic. The question of where that
residence is is more complicated. Some parts of the country are far
more challenging for general policing and counter-terrorism policing.
If you have a number of people all within the same area, the risk of
saturation from surveillance units is quite big. There are other areas
where using technical assets such as CCTV cameras and other issues that
we may wish to explore might become problematic, as they will be very
visible. Therefore, it is very useful to have that condition if there
are too many people in the same area and because areas that are
undesirable for policing activity create additional
challenges.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000110">&#160;</a>

prosecution, some people outside this room may think that prosecution
is not pursued to the fullest extent or that in some way TPIMs or

prosecution is not pursued. Would you comment on the work the police
undertake with the CPS to advance prosecution wherever possible, and is
that the preferred
option?<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000113">&#160;</a>

is always the preferred option? Often it is only after months of
investigation that the police are able to produce evidential material
that results in the consideration of a control order or a TPIM.
Throughout all of our CT investigations we heavily engage with the
Crown Prosecution Service where we think that prosecution may be
possible. Before anybody is placed on a TPIM, it is mandatory that we
consult the CPS to ensure that a prosecution is not possible. The new
measures involve the CPS to a much heavier degree in looking at the
sufficiency of
evidence.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000114">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Keir
Starmer:</strong>
                  </em> May I briefly walk you through the process?
Looking at the current regime, we are now involved from the outset if
consideration is being given to whether a control order should be made.
The deputy head of counter-terrorism, Deborah Walsh, is immediately
notified, and she then allocates one of the prosecuting lawyers from
her division who, day in, day out, prosecutes terrorism cases before
the courts. They have a great deal of experience, as everyone here
understands.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000115">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
a decision is made that a control order may be imposed, the exercise
begins of reviewing the available material to assess whether it meets
the code test that I adumbrated earlier. That approach is no different
from the approach that Deborah Walsh and her team take week in, week
out, on numerous other terrorist operations. They are in the business
of reviewing material to consider whether prosecutions can be brought.
If a prosecution can be brought, that is the priority and a prosecution
is brought. We are firmly committed to that. If a prosecution cannot be
brought, we give brief closed reasons to the relevant authorities. The
allocated lawyer then remains with the control order in question.
Deborah Walsh sits on the quarterly review meetings that look at all
control orders. They are reviewed either if there is new material or if
renewal is suggested, and we go through the same exercise. That
exercise, the second time round, will include consideration of any of
the material that has been led in the control order civil proceedings.
At each stage we are applying the code test. So that is the extent to
which we are involved in the process. We have found it useful to have
an allocated lawyer stay with the case during its
lifetime.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000116">&#160;</a>

of the case, they see all the intelligence material. Throughout the
life of the control order, they continually review new evidence. They
do not need to look back at the intelligence material, so there is a
consistency of
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000117">&#160;</a>

of the rules. Additionally, if people have set communications, there
will need to be some additional assets to monitor and retrieve those
communications. Translation and other issues may go along with that,

attack at Glasgow airport, we became aware in Scotland that we were
part of the terrorist area. We have talked about dealings with the
Crown Prosecution Service. Do you have dealings with the devolved
Parliaments, with Scottish law being different from English law? When
you put out control orders—and when you are going to use
TPIMs—does that happen under English law that may operate in
Scotland, or is there some kind of cross-border relationship? That
would, of course, also apply to Northern
Ireland.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000134">&#160;</a>

from the control order side. We have obviously had to consider how we
approach offences that take place both sides of the border. Building on
the approach in the case you mentioned, we now have procedures in place
with our colleagues in Scotland to ensure that we can deal quickly and
effectively with issues that arise such as, not least,
jurisdiction—where the evidence is and how you transfer it. That
does not answer your question in relation to control orders, but
certainly when it comes to criminal conduct, we have clear agreements
and a good understanding with our colleagues in Scotland as to how we
will approach those
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000135">&#160;</a>

relocation in that case. Control orders inevitably provide greater

                  </strong> Is the time scale for the loss of the relocation
provisions also a matter of concern? We heard from our previous
witnesses that if those nine orders are to be renewed, they might well
not contain relocation provisions. The nine people might come back to
live in London in December just before the Olympics, which would be a
huge challenge for not only the police, but the security services. I
would welcome your view of the toxic combination of an increased threat
at a time when the eyes of the world are upon us and when al-Qaeda, in
particular, would want to see a spectacular assault. The coming
together of those factors raises the
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000166">&#160;</a>

                  </em> If an empirical decision has been made that
somebody should be relocated and that decision has been upheld by the
courts, there is generally a good reason for it. The risk is increased
if one person has the relocation condition removed. If nine people have
relocation conditions removed and therefore are all able to move closer
either to one another, or to their contact to whom they would wish to
be close, plainly you are right that there is an increased risk. I do
not want to exaggerate that, because they do not all come from London
anyway, but some of them certainly do.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000167">&#160;</a>

extent to which intercept evidence would have made a difference to the
imposition of control orders. I am summarising, but the general sense
of its conclusions was that it would make a relatively small difference
in relatively few cases. I am a little sceptical of that for the
reasons that the current DPP gave in his evidence to you a few moments
ago. He said that it is quite difficult to make that analysis, because
you are looking at an intercept regime that does not operate on the
basis that the output will be used in evidence in a criminal trial, so
it is a very hypothetical exercise. It may have been a bit over
simplistic in its analysis, but that was the conclusion that the

relocation issues, and both of you spoke very strongly about the

of anyone currently under a control order that, with the relocation
aspect that can be used by the courts in certain cases, we can be aware
of all their movements, and we can more or less guarantee that they
cannot participate in a preparation for a terrorist attack? I do not
believe that that is true. Even if we move them into a location where
we can better keep an eye on them, which is the thrust of this idea, I
do not believe that we can say, “Yes, we can keep track of
them,” to the point where we are satisfied that they will not
participate in such activity. With today’s technology and

controlees in the homes to which they had been relocated. I attended
quite a number of meetings of the control order review
group—CORG—at which these issues were discussed. I read
the intelligence—I am not saying that I read every word of it,
but I read enough to know what it contained—in every control
order case, from the beginning until 21 February this year. I think
that surveillance on people who have been relocated is very successful
and very strong. It is done by a panoply of agencies. It includes, of
course, electronic tags, so if the controlee moves from the area which
he is permitted to be in at any given time, that is picked up by the
electronic tags, which work extremely
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000192">&#160;</a>

some difficulties with Lord Macdonald’s concept of TPIMs as an
investigative measure. The investigation is over by the time the
control order is made. It may be that, when it is reconsidered in a
year’s time, further investigation will have taken place; but,
again, if the control order is renewed, the investigation is
over.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000194">&#160;</a>

the letters that came from chief police officers informing the Home
Secretary that prosecution was not possible, were rather lacking in
detail, and were not robust. Certainly, in my last two to three years
as independent reviewer, I was very satisfied that complete efforts had
been made to ensure that an investigation could take place, and it was
not possible—hence a control
order.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000195">&#160;</a>

Crown in Parliament; the Human Rights Act is interpreted by judges. You
spoke about the effect of the Human Rights Act when it was introduced

that any provision within TPIMs will require derogation from the Human
Rights Act, or whether it is liable to successful
challenge?<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000196">&#160;</a>

                  </em> I am not a critic of the Bill. I think that
the commitment to review the control order system, which was in the
Conservative manifesto at the election, was good and proper. It is
right that the control order regime should be reviewed. In some
respects, the Bill, with its change in the burden of proof and in the
scrutiny provisions that are contained within, is an improvement over
the control order system. I am by no means a die-in-the-last-ditch
control order person, and in a significant number of ways, this regime
is superior to the control order regime. Probably my only reservation
is the one that I clearly stated in answer to an earlier question,
which is the absence of provision in the Bill for relocation.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000201">&#160;</a>

                  </em> I agree broadly, but I have a concern about
the genesis of the Bill. It arose from coalition politics—I am
aware of the process that occurred—and it is a compromise. As I
said in my last report, and in the note that I sent to the Committee,
it is the sufficient lowest common multiple, and it will do. However,
it does not provide as much public protection as control orders, and it
would be foolish to ignore that fact. There are certain improvements,
however, as Lord Howard 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 22<a class="bkMark" name="Column22">&#160;</a>
                  </div>has said. I entirely agree with him about the burden of proof. I can
live with this Bill, subject only to a very careful consideration, as I

relocation.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000202">&#160;</a>

not available to the Committee for security reasons. In our

politicians to be briefed to the level of Ministers in relation to
having information that would help us to do the job properly?<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000203">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Lord
Carlile:</strong>
                  </em> Yes, looking back at what happened following
the election, I came to the clear view that it was a great pity that
some Opposition spokesmen had not been briefed before the election on a
suitable basis—and I do not regard a Privy Council basis as
adequate—on at least some of the secret material that existed in
relation to controlees. My suggestion was that the Opposition should
have a couple of direct developed, vetted spokespeople, who may not
necessarily be Front Benchers. They could be nominated by the party and
would be able to advise it, on an appropriate basis, of the real facts.
Such people would be trusted and relied on by their party to give the
basis for policy decisions. For example, my party made a serious
mistake in committing itself to the abolition of control orders. It
made that mistake understandably, however, because it did not have the
information. We should be able to run our political establishment
rather more smoothly and on a better informed basis than
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000204">&#160;</a>

that the Bill’s measures are part of a broader context, given
the information that we have heard from the police this morning on the
additional funds that would be available and on the use of surveillance
techniques. I think that you said that the Bill should be seen as
adopting a new approach to public protection, and you have talked about
an acceptable balance of risk against other considerations. Do you want

this to be part of a big politics, in which the parties bash one
another on the basis that they have got it hopelessly wrong. We were
bound to make mistakes when we embarked, at the time of 9/11, on the
road that we are now on, and the picture is evolving. The art is to
have the right balance for the time being and change that balance if
circumstances dictate or permit it. I think if I were to say more in
answer to the breadth of your question we would embark on a long
philosophical debate. If there are any specific issues I would be happy

Howard:</strong>
                  </em> I think it is the point that I made earlier
in my evidence. The material which is available to the authorities on
which they are able to assess the extent to which any particular
individual poses a risk to the security of the people of this country
is, to a very large extent, not material which can be adduced as
evidence in a court of law. That is a highly inconvenient fact, because
we would all like the matter to be tested in the normal way in our
courts. All of us want that to happen, but unfortunately it is a fact,
and it is from that fact that the need for a regime of this kind
arises.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000208">&#160;</a>

                  </em> You raise three particular items, and they
are all very interesting. Police bail is not really relevant to this
Bill, but on the 14 day/28 day debate I think it is relevant, and it
would be useful in my view to have a system of bail judicially
supervised. Bail conditions can be very stringent. Anyone who has been
in a criminal court has seen conditions much more stringent than those
imposed by a control order. I have done it myself as a
recorder.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000209">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have
already discussed intercept evidence. An important point that needs to
be borne in mind with intercept is about what happens in other
countries. Comparisons are often made between, say, the United Kingdom
and France, Italy or Germany. They are completely misleading
comparisons. We have an adversarial system in this country, and the
rules of disclosure of material to the individual concerned are far
more stringent than in any of the other countries with which
comparisons are made. The juge d’instruction in France can look
at secret material and never reveal to anybody that he has looked at
it, so there is no question of it being answered, whether by a special
advocate or anybody else.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000210">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Deportation
with assurances has concerned me for years. This is where the United
Kingdom courts have been a little too keen to apply the Human Rights
Act and the convention in a very strict way. It has meant that
terrorists are at large in this country, some in custody, who should
not be in this country at all. It is one of the issues that the
Equality and Human Rights Commission should address. Recently the
Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights have addressed
this issue in general terms. In a line, the margin of appreciation
needs to be a good deal wider on this point.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000211">&#160;</a>

                  </em> As a very experienced lawyer, you will know
that our learned friends will find something. I would not predict less
litigation than hitherto. There may be less room
for challenge to measures, for the simple reason that there will be
fewer measures. On the special advocate regime—I know special
advocates are going to give evidence to you—my judgment, having
read much of the proceedings and the judgments in every single control
order case between the start and 21 February 2011, when I
ceased to be independent reviewer, is that the special advocates have
been extremely effective. I am not in the least surprised that our
Canadian colleagues, who have a largely similar system of law, have
applied the special advocate system in certain respects. The same
applies in
Australia.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000225">&#160;</a>

brought it with me. It goes something like: reasonable suspicion is a
suspicion founded on reason that something may be so; reasonable belief
is a belief that it is so. That has been expounded much more clearly in
a number of cases which I am sure can be provided by your advisers. It
is a step change. It sounds like lawyers dancing on the head of a pin,
I know, but it is not. It is a step change and quite a significant one.

                  </em> A coalition is a quite different structure
from the other Governments we have had, certainly in my political life.
There is a level of intense negotiation that takes place between
Ministers within the coalition. All I said earlier was that I am aware
of extremely intensive negotiation between various parts of the
coalition on what should appear in the counter-terrorism review, of
which this is part—as opposed, for example, to the Prevent
review, over which I had independent oversight. If an entirely
empirical view had been taken of this territory, probably we would have
remained with control orders, albeit with some changes, such as the
standard of proof. The compromises were a necessary part of obtaining
an agreement in the coalition. There is nothing wrong with that, but it
is a factual observation one has to take into account in considering
the Bill. It has not been produced by the Law Commission; it has been
produced by the coalition, and that is a different
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11062145000238">&#160;</a>

figure, because there have been various estimates, between £11
million and £18 million. An estimate I was given in the past two
years was that you would need 60 whole-time equivalents for 24/7
surveillance of an individual, because you have to cover shifts,
sickness and all the rest of it. Plus you need a panoply of electronic
devices and opportunities. Sometimes that is very difficult to achieve.
A simple example is that, ideally, you might want a room in a house
across the street from which you can view someone’s premises,
but it is quite difficult to persuade people to let you occupy a room
to spy on

be shown, even after two years on a control order, that they represent
a substantial risk to national security. I think such cases will be

necessary. A Government have to satisfy a higher standard when they put
measures into a piece of legislation that is going on the statute book.

hypothetically, the kind of circumstances in which it would be
appropriate to implement such measures. On balance, although it is
