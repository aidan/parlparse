<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with this Bill, and copies are available in the Room. It might help new Members if I also remind the Committee that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call amendments, including any starred amendments, which may be reached during an afternoon sitting of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. I understood from discussions that there might be a sittings motion at the beginning of the proceedings, which is fairly normal, but it seems that the Government want to rush the Bill through by sitting late tonight, if necessary. That is unacceptable, given the importance of the Bill. It extends most of the provisions of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996, which is a large piece of legislation. There must have been some 15 or 16 Committee sittings on that Bill, but the Government are proposing, through the normal channels, to whip the Bill through in an unseemly way by sitting late tonight. I ask for your ruling, Mrs. Winterton, on whether it would be appropriate to have a sittings motion for such an important Bill.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Winterton. I welcome you to the Chair. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) suggested that we are rushing the Bill through and being peremptory, but that is not in our minds. It is our intention to get on with scrutinising the detail of the Bill, which is much smaller than the 1996 Act; it makes three basic amendments to that Act. I do not want it to be thought that we are trying to rush the Bill through--we are prepared to devote to it as much time as is appropriate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As Chairman, I can only comment that a sittings motion has not been tabled, although that dose not, of course, rule out the possibility of one being tabled later in the proceedings.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Duration of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> May I now welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Winterton? I should have done so earlier, but I was so keen to make my point of order that I forgot. It is a dear pleasure to serve under your tutelage and I look forward to perhaps more than one sitting, although it seems that we will have only one.
<P>
I said in my earlier remarks that the Government seem keen to get the Bill through as quickly as possible. On Second Reading, in relation to clause 1, I asked why the Government found it necessary to introduce at this juncture the amendments to the 1996 Act. Clause 1 amends section 62(10), which deals with the expiry of the Act, to extend it from 24 August 1998 to 24 August 2000. In other words, the 1996 Act has slightly less than 12 months to run without us needing to consider amendments to it. With regard to the time scale and the timetable, we must therefore ask why the Bill has been introduced now. No doubt the Minister will tell us why the Government saw fit to introduce the Bill earlier than necessary. I wonder whether they aim to rush the Bill through Committee this evening to make room for some of the proposed legislation that is already stacking up because of their incompetence in introducing legislation more quickly. We have just had the longest summer recess in living memory, so it is not the Opposition's fault that the legislative programme is falling behind. We must however ask why the Bill is going through the Committee so quickly.
<P>
I said earlier that the 1996 Act was very well scrutinised in Committee--there were 15 or 16 sittings. Although the 1991 legislation went through some major changes, we are being asked to extend the termination date of the 1996 Act from 1998 to 2000 and to make other changes. Let us, however, remind ourselves of all the other provisions in the Bill that we shall have no time to discuss and which we shall have to nod through for implementation under the new time scale, if that is what the Government want. Let us remind ourselves also of the scope of the Bill: it provides the police with powers to stop, arrest, search, enter and seize that go beyond those in ordinary criminal law; it gives the Government powers to close roads; it provides, in clause 2, for the Diplock system of trial without jury; it provides for the classification of certain offences as terrorist offences unless certified otherwise by the Attorney-General; it provides for offences against public security and public order and for the detention of terrorist suspects without trial, which of course relates to section 36 and schedule 3 of the 1996 Act; it provides for the special interrogatory regime at the police holding centres; and it provides for the independent scrutiny of military complaints procedures and for the regulation of the provision of private security forces.
<P>
I raise those points to demonstrate the scale and range of the Bill, which, as clause 1 provides will be extended to 2000. Failing to give the Bill proper and adequate time and scrutiny will be seen as a slap in the face for the people of Northern Ireland. In some quarters, it might even be deemed to be an abdication of the Government's duty to protect and be seen to protect their citizens and to give full and valid reasons for changes in legislation.
<P>
It has been suggested to me that the Bill is not only part of the negotiation process, but a sign that the Government have been lulled into a false sense of security by the ceasefire. Why have concessions apparently been made in the Bill? Why should we trust Sinn Fein-IRA this time round after what happened during the previous ceasefire, particularly towards its end, and what has happened since it ended?
<P>
I am also concerned that on Second Reading the Minister did not give the House of Commons a thorough briefing on the current security situation. He said--I paraphrase--that he would not go into the details, as though they were well known to all and sundry. I have to tell him that they are not well known. I do not expect him to go into matters that otherwise would not be in the public domain, but plenty of incidents are in the public domain. On Second Reading it is approriate for a Minister taking through such an important Bill to point up to the House the number of incidents occurring at present.
<P>
We know that there is a ceasefire, but those of us who served in Northern Ireland during the previous ceasefire are under no illusions that an IRA ceasefire means what most of us interpret it to mean. We need information. I hope that the Minister will take an early opportunity to spell out what is happening on the ground in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The Minister has commented on the ceasefire, as has the chief constable, who is supposed to have said fairly recently that the IRA ceasefire remains remarkably stable. He went on to say that that had resulted in a significantly reduced level of terrorist activity. He did not say that it had stopped terrorist activity. I should like to know, as would other hon. Members on the Opposition Benches, in what terrorist activity the Provisional IRA is still indulging.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that the chief constable supposedly said that the ceasefire has remained remarkably stable. That is not the way in which the matter was presented by the chief constable. I shall provide the hon. Gentleman with the detailed statement and the date on which it was made-- 4 November--to disabuse him of the idea that the statement was some fiction that had been got up by Ministers on the back of a ``supposed'' statement by the chief constable. The opposite is the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful for that clarification. I was not putting into the Minister's mouth words that the chief constable was supposed to have said. If I conveyed that to him, I apologise, because that was not the intention. I said that the chief constable was supposed to have made that statement, but all I have to rely on is a newspaper quotation. With all due respect to the press, one cannot always rely on the accuracy of such statements. The Committee will be delighted that the Minister will give the time and date of that comment.
<P>
To return to the security situation, the Minister admitted on Second Reading that ``some'' terrorist groups remain active, but he did not say which nor what activity there was on the ground. He mentioned two incidents--almost, I have to say, en passant. He spoke about the holdall bomb at Londonderry and devices at Markethill. The right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) raised an important question on Second Reading with regard to the Londonderry bomb incident when he pointed out that Semtex had been used in the bomb--it was planted just outside the Department of the Environment offices--and that no other group of terrorists in Northern Ireland apart from the IRA has access to Semtex.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Apparently the Continuity Army Council laid claim to that incident, but if it is in possession of Semtex, that suggests some close connections with the IRA and, by extension, with Sinn Fein. Given that situation, I would have expected the Minister to tell the House on Second Reading--no doubt he will take the opportunity this evening--to go into that issue in some detail. We are asked to believe that there is a genuine ceasefire which is holding and intact, and yet what appears on the surface to be a breakaway group from the IRA is breaking that ceasefire by planting bombs and has access to the one ingredient that only the IRA as a terrorist organisation has in its possession.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert McCartney </B>(North Down): Does the hon. Gentleman know whether, during the six-week sanitisation period that Sinn Fein had to undergo before being admitted to the talks, there were breaches of any kind, either by it or any other group? If there were not, does not that indicate the degree of association and control by Sinn Fein-IRA?

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman raises an extremely good point. I do not know whether there were any such breaches. Perhaps the Minister will tell us. One of the conditions of Sinn Fein entering the talks was that the sanitisation period was to be upheld. If it was not, we ought to be told why it was not and why matters proceeded as they did if there were incidents that either went unreported or were of such a serious nature that they would not be put in the public domain for security reasons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): To pursue the point, I understood the hon. and learned Member for North Down (Mr. McCartney) to be making the point that there were no infringements of the ceasefire during those six weeks, just as there were no infringements during President Clinton's visit 18 months or so earlier, indicating that the IRA has total control over its forces. To suggest, therefore, that it does not have that control now beggars belief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for putting me right. I misunderstood slightly the point that was being made and I am more than happy to endorse his clarification.
<P>
The IRA apparently controls things to the extent that there can be no movement whatever--of men, machines or armaments--during a three or six-week period. During the previous ceasefire, such movements were well documented but the IRA did not break the ceasefire in principle, although it was still targeting judges, Members of Parliament and other prominent people in society, still making dummy runs and still observing certain military establishments. If, as the hon. and learned Member for North Down is saying, nothing moved in the six-week sanitisation period. That is a strong indication that it is in total control of the situation. If a bomb goes off in Markethill or Londonderry, or one is planted but does not go off, surely we must conclude that these people are responsible for those actions.
<P>
Some well-publicised comments were made only the other week. Some journalists were at a meeting held by someone who has been described to me as a respectable Sinn Fein councillor. Ironically, I might well have met him on my travels when I had responsibility in the Department of the Environment for local councils in Northern Ireland, although I cannot bring him to mind. I am talking of Mr. Francie Molloy, who attended a meeting somewhere in South Down or Armagh--I cannot be specific. He was reported to have said that Sinn Fein's policy was a tactic rather than an end in itself. I surmise that by policy he means the ceasefire. He went on to say that this phase of negotiations may fall apart; it may not succeed. And, he said, whenever that does happen--these chilling words were passed to one side by the Minister and by his Under-Secretary of State, who replied on Second Reading--it would simply go back to what it knew best.
<P>
If that is not a clear indication of the political motives of Sinn Fein-IRA, I do not know what is. There was no allusion to that in the Minister of State's opening speech, nor was it alluded to by his colleague the Under-Secretary when he replied on Second Reading that same evening.
<P>
In the context of the Bill, the Committee and the House ought to know what these incidents have communicated to the Government, not only in their desire to get communications going but in terms of Sinn Fein-IRA's real agenda. The concessions in the measure, which we shall discuss later in more detail, may have been asked for by one side of the equation. However, it is important for the Government to realise that concessions which are being lapped up by one side are totally demoralising the other, which sees no concessions being made in its direction and feels that the Government are conducting a somewhat one-sided analysis and negotiation in their quest for peace. We all accept that the intent and purpose is to try and find a lasting settlement and a permanent peace.
<P>
Most of the time when I was a Minister with responsibility for Northern Ireland, I enjoyed the conditions of ceasefire. So I was not party to some of the terrible things that had happened prior to the 1994 declaration of ceasefire. When the ceasefire finished, in 1996--indeed, there was a build-up to the breaking of the ceasefire--I remember thinking then that, all through the ceasefire, we had bent over backwards to be accommodating to Sinn Fein-IRA. Now I look back and realise that Sinn Fein-IRA, having got those concessions in the bag, was not up for the negotiations.
<P>
I want to put a warning shot across the Government's bows. The IRA takes concessions but yields none, and what it gains can never be taken away. That is what Molloy spelt out clearly to his supporters. He told them not to get twitchy, as progress was being made. He said that if the final solution--if I can use that term--that the IRA sought was not achieved, the organisation would go back to ``what they know best''. In the meantime, however, Molloy noted that substantial progress had been made towards gaining concessions during both the present ceasefire and the previous one.
<P>
A number of questions were left unanswered on Second Reading. I hope that the Minister will answer them today. The Under-Secretary, in his haste to conclude matters on Second Reading, ended his closing remarks early and scarpered pretty damn quick. At that juncture, the attack--about certifying in and out--was coming from the hon. Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara).
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I remind the hon. Gentleman that he had about two hours to expand his arguments on Second Reading. He spoke for precisely 11 minutes. The Under-Secretary dealt at length with the various questions asked.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I have never been accused before of using only 11 minutes to ask questions or make a speech. Whether I spoke for 10, 11, 15 or eight minutes is irrelevant. I asked some questions that the Under-Secretary did not answer. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) was so angry that none of his questions on Second Reading were dealt with that he raised a point of order. No doubt he will emphasise that when he rises to speak.
<P>
The attack came from the hon. Member for Hull, North. It was pretty strong: I think that the hon. Gentleman felt a little embarrassed at the end, as he had left the Under-Secretary is some disarray. The point is that Labour party policy on the Diplock courts and certifying in and out had been in place for as long as anyone could remember. Now it has completely turned turtle after the Government's massive U-turn. The hon. Member for Hull, North was, quite rightly, outraged. He had defended and advocated the original policy many times in debates in the House and in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Seamus Mallon </B>(Newry and Armagh): We certainly should all be clear about the responses that we get to our questions. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire makes an interesting point that concessions were made during the previous ceasefire, for the duration of which a Conservative Government were in power. Perhaps my definition of the word ``concessions'' differs from the hon. Gentleman's, but he could help the Committee understand his position by showing how one of those concessions--made by the Government of which he was a member--actually hampered the peace process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The ceasefire ended--for example, with bombs in Manchester, my home town. I felt very angry about that. The concessions meant nothing to the people with whom we are dealing--that is the point that I was trying to make. I hope and pray that the concessions will be matched by these people in the negotiations, to enable real progress towards a lasting peace--not just a tactical ceasefire, but a permanent cessation of violence, which the previous Government tried to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman is amusing me somewhat. Is the hon. Gentleman seriously saying that everything that his Government did to try to advance the peace process should be unscrambled, unbundled and reversed because the previous ceasefire broke down? That is the logic of his remarks.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am not saying that. Any Government seeking to negotiate a peace process have not only to make concessions to both sides, but also have to seek concessions from the parties to the negotiations. My personal view is that during our attempts to do that--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman was the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I was not the Minister in charge of negotiations. I dealt with health--this is all new to me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert McCartney:</B> During the hon. Gentleman's time as a Minister in Northern Ireland, was there the slightest evidence that there has at any time been even a minimal diminution of the political demands of Sinn Fein-IRA for Brits out--to use its term--or of its demands for an end to partition and for self-determination for Ireland on an all-Ireland basis? The Minister may also deal with that point. Has there been any sign of even a minimal retreat from those demands?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> As far as I can say, no. The Government, in their negotiations and attempts to find a peaceful way forward, may well have perceived some movement by Sinn Fein-IRA. No doubt the Minister will inform the hon. Gentleman of that.
<P>
I asked three questions that were not answered. I shall repeat them in the hope they will be answered now. First, the Opposition sought an assurance that the Government will not seek in any way to appeal over the heads of the political parties in Northern Ireland in trying to find a solution to the problems. Such an assurance would be helpful.
<P>
Secondly, there is anxiety about the definition of consent, especially because Opposition Members understood it to apply within the terms of the Downing Street declaration and in those of most other subsequent writings and discussions on the subject. Will the Minister confirm that consent, as it applies to the second element of the triple lock, means that of people of Northern Ireland alone?

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman back to his first question, so that matters can be properly clarified. He asked whether appeals were going over the head of the political parties. Does he mean the political parties involved in the talks process, or every political party in Northern Ireland and in the United Kingdom?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> No, only the political parties in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I asked whether the hon. Gentleman meant the political parties involved in the talks process or all political parties in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am happy to confirm that I meant political parties involved in the talks process.
<P>
My second question was about consent. Will the Minister clarify how consent is to be measured? I understand that the final stage will be a referendum of the people of Northern Ireland, and that the consent of the people is deemed to be conclusive. How will a majority in a referendum be measured and how will that fit in with a definition of consent prior to a referendum?
<P>
My third question is why, in the light of the announcement that the Home Secretary and the Home Office are examining all anti-terrorist legislation, including the Prevention of Terrorism Acts and the Bill, and will introduce proposals in the new year, are we debating the measure before us today?
<P>
I have alluded to the prolonged and detailed scrutiny of the 1996 Act in Committee last year. I am delighted with the Minister's assurances that the Government are prepared to have appropriate and detailed scrutiny of the Bill. It is interesting that the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) said during our debate in March this year that there might be a tendency to nod through the continuance order, but that that would be wrong. He also said that it would be discourteous to those special advisers who spend so much time examining and monitoring how the legislation operates in Northern Ireland. I am referring, as was the hon. Gentleman at the time, to John Row, QC, Sir Louis Blom-Cooper, Dr. Norris, Mr Hewitt and, more latterly, Lord Lloyd who produced his report in the autumn last year.
<P>
By their own admission, when in opposition, a spokesperson who is now a Minister in the Northern Ireland Office, acknowledged the great importance of the legislation and the contribution made by distinguished people in Northern Ireland. I take the opportunity to express my gratitude to them for their work over many years, which was very helpful to the previous Government in ensuring that implementation of this complex legislation which is unique because it is so different from that which applies elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Their assistance was invaluable and it would be wrong for such important legislation to be nodded through in Committee. I hope that the Government will take a sensible view and that we shall adjourn at a sensible time before dinner and return later in the week to renew our deliberations.
<P>
I have given the Minister a lot to get his teeth into. I hope that he will be able to answer most, if not all, my queries. Extension of the legislation is vital for Northern Ireland and I have nothing against extension of the clause to the year 2000. We have always agreed with the principle of the legislation and we shall contest some of the changes that the Government wish to make, but in principle, we see no problem in extending the legislation. However, would like some explanation of why the extension is being made now and some anwers to our questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I endorse the welcome given to you, Mrs. Winterton, by the Minister and by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. I want to pursue one point raised by my hon. Friend. Clause 1 focuses attention on a criticism that the Government have not yet effectively answered, including on Second Reading. I hope that today will give them an opportunity to do so.
<P>
The point is a contradiction--or at least a tension--within Government thinking. Clause 1 itself does not contain that contradiction. Rather, the whole Bill is an expression of it, and most clearly so in clause 1. The clause extends the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996 by two years and is the first clause of the sixth successive Bill in a series of laws applicable to Northern Ireland. Along with successive UK-wide prevention of terrorism Acts they have supplemented the ordinary criminal law to give the police and armed forces additional powers where necessary to deal with terrorism.
<P>
The Government, like their Conservative and Labour predecessors, repeadly state that these powers remain only for so long as is necessary. However, whereas Minsiters of previous Governments have stressed that genuine peace would result in suspension and eventual repeal of the emergency provisions, that is not entirely the case with the present Government. The Home Secretary announced on 30 October that the Government will publish a consultation document in the new year to set out options for the replacement of the PTA and the EPA with a single piece of counter-terrorism legislation. The Government have not yet said when that legislation will be introduced, but the consultation exercise has been presented at the first, important, step.
<P>
The pertinent point is that neither on Second Reading nor in any press release or statement have the Government adequately addressed the tension or contradiction between the temporary extension of the 1996 Act and the Government's declared intention of reviewing and replacing the PTA and EPA.
<P>
It may be argued that the Committee should be considering not the temporary extension of the 1996 Act but the new legislation that the Government have promised. I can see three reasons why that is not the case and why the Bill is before us, but I do not think that those reasons stand up to investigation. First, if the Government were to argue that they have not had time to consult on or prepare a replacement for emergency provisions, and that they therefore have no alternative but to extend the 1996 Act, they would face a credibility problem. It is not as if the Government have decided to move into new and uncharted waters. In a democratic state with an independent judiciary, the potential scope for anti-terrorism laws is limited and well defined. The Government did not have to undergo a vast learning experience on coming to power; they were very familiar indeed with the range of powers from which they could select, or that they could adopt.
<P>
Moreover, well before 1 May, Labour Front Benchers--then in opposition--had already committed themselves to some principles and positions. With the extension of the life of the 1996 Act in clause 1 the Government have failed to deliver the goods that they had led us to expect, and they have failed adequately to explain why.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the Government had been so minded, it would have been possible to launch the consultation process in May or June. There was no valid reason why it was postponed until January. The three months required for consultation could have finished in September, four months after the general election. The Second Reading of a replacement Emergency Provisions and Prevention of Terrorism Bill could have taken place last week, rather than the Second Reading of a Bill to amend the 1996 Act, and that replacement Bill could and should now be in Committee.
<P>
The second reason that the Government have attempted to present for their extension of the life of the 1996 Act is that if they did not do so, there would or could be a vacuum in June 1998, when the temporary provisions lapse, and the problem would be compounded in August of next year when the Act itself expires.
<P>
Such a situation would certainly be unacceptable, but the implication that it is only through this clause and this Bill that the vacuum can be filled is entirely erroneous. Clause 1 is not imperative, as the Government would like us to think. Not only did the timetable allow the Government to introduce and enact definitive legislation before August 1998, but the temporary provisions can continue in force for the duration of the Act through a further continuance order, effective from June next year. On the Government's own premise of the desirability of that definitive legislation yet to come, it is risible that the Government did not pursue that option with due speed.
<P>
Thirdly, there is an inherent fault line in the Government's wish in clause 1 to extend an amended 1996 Act. That alone provides good reason to object to clause 1. Each supplementary or emergency power that the Government--any Government--want to maintain or introduce must be valid and justified, and defensible in its own right. Each one of those supplementary or emergency powers, however, forms part of a total package of such powers. The total package itself must also be valid and justified; it must provide the police and the armed forces with a combination or range of powers that together equip them to deal with the threat of terrorism.
<P>
The difficulty that the Committee now faces is that we do not know of what the final package that the Government have in mind will consist. In extending the life of an amended 1996 Act, the Government are seeking approval of three key changes. Ultimately, however, we can pass only qualified judgment because we do not know the whole picture of what the Government intend to introduce.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert McCartney:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the purpose of the extension, for which no rational basis has been established, is that it is necessary for reasons of immediate political expediency to show those reconstructed terrorists now active in the talks process, as a confidence-building measure, that the Government are willing to abolish internment, to put forward proposals that will make it more difficult in real terms for convictions to be achieved, and to make it altogether a happier place for those people whose retention within the negotiations is considered absolutely necessary?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Yes, I unequivocally and unambiguously agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman; it is a tragedy and a dreadful mistake. I believe that the motive behind the Bill is to create the right climate, which the Government are anxious to create, to keep the Provisionals within the process. I shall resist the temptation to digress on that issue, but I believe that the motives behind the abolition of internment are political.
<P>
The Government would have acted more wisely and more responsibly if they had avoided introducing changes bit by bit, as they have done in the Bill, but had stuck to their primary and previously declared strategy. There is an element of irony surrounding clause 1. In clause 1, the Government confirm their voluntary, self-imposed delay in starting the consultation process and in introducing and enacting their replacement of the emergency provisions and the Prevention of Terrorism Acts. There is irony in that because, almost overnight, the Government have committed the same sin as the one for which they denounced the previous Government.
<P>
Labour Members castigated the Conservative Government for delaying the review of anti-terrorism measures--the review that became the Lloyd review. The Minister is an honest, as well as an honourable, Member, so he will recall Labour Front-Bench Members condemning the Conservative Government for that delay. But if there is any guilt to be attached to delaying a review of terrorist legislation, he and the present Government are now comparably guilty.
<P>
I acknowledge the extreme probability that clause 1 will meet with the approval of the Committee as a whole, but I nevertheless argue that there are strong grounds for feeling uneasy about the tactic that the Bill constitutes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): I also welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Winterton. My initial reaction to the leaked news that the Committee may sit today and on no other day was one of surprise, but when I examined the Government's motives, I clearly understood why they wanted to move the process through the House as expeditiously as possible. Whether expedition leads to correctness I have grave doubts.
<P>
Casting my mind back over previous years, it seems to me that although the Minister may not be weak on terrorism, he is a member of a Government many of whose Back Benchers are not only weak on terrorism but soft on terrorists. The reason why the Government have decided to roll two years into one, so to speak, is not because of any commitment in the medium or long term, but because it is easier to get this over and done with. It is part of hitting the ground running. It does not matter whether the Government have regained their balance when they hit the ground. All that matters is that they have the chance to get this out of the way for another two years and avoid the embarrassment caused by people such as the hon. Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara), who continually cause problems for the Minister and the Northern Ireland Office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Not at the moment.
<P>
The Northern Ireland (concessions to IRA terrorism) Bill, as I prefer to call this Bill, appears to be out of time and out of sympathy with the realities of the situation which have been maintained for 27 years and, I believe, may be maintained for some time to come. We all remember what happened to Canary Wharf after 17 months of a ceasefire. We continually warned not the Minister's party--it was not in government at that time--but the Government of the day that IRA-Sinn Fein was totally insincere, and that the Armalite and ballot-box philosophy was still being maintained.
<P>
My opinion on that is not alleviated in any way by the Minister quoting the Chief Constable of the RUC as saying that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``IRA's ceasefire remains remarkably stable''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not sure who the Chief Constable is talking about. Perhaps the Minister knows. Is he talking about those unreconstructed terrorists who sit at the table of democracy--Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness? Is he talking about the more active members in south Armagh or east Tyrone? Is he talking about those--this point was well made by the hon. and learned Member for North Down--who though not subscribing members of the Provisional IRA still appear to be controlled by it? Like the INLA in the period leading up to the visit of the American President, the Continuity Army Council--the Republican IRA as it is sometimes called--is able to dovetail its activities with the requirements of the Provisional IRA. It is no coincidence that its bomb in Markethill was exploded when it was, in the constituency of the hon. member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon). It was intended, without any doubt, to be a major embarrassment to him, to his party leader and to his party in general.
<P>
The Minister might like to tell us some of the other things that I hope the Chief Constable has told him. If the Chief Constable has not given him that information or, indeed, if the Minister has not sought it, one, other or both are falling short in their responsibility to society in Northeren Ireland. What evidence is there since the announcement of the current ceasefire of the targeting of RUC members? How many RUC members have moved home during that period?
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am not asking the Minister to give me specific answers in relation to the IRA alone; I want to know whether any terrorist organisation has presented such a threat to RUC members that their senior officers have warned them that they are being targeted. Have any RUC officers been forced to move home, or has that ceased?
<P>
To return to the lack of time, I found it almost laughable that the Minister berated the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire for the length of his speech on Second Reading. I spoke for 28 minutes, and the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) spoke for 17 minutes. Although the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington), rightly acknowledged at the beginning of his response that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh was unable to be in the House because of other responsibilities, that was the last and only mention made of any contributor elected for a Northern Ireland constituency. As well as being the height of discourtesy, it indicated to me that the Government were not interested in sharing views or exchanging opinions with hon. Members elected for Northern Ireland constituencies.
<P>
That deficiency in Northern Ireland Office Ministers is illustrated by yet another nonsense today. I do not wish to digress, Mrs. Winterton, but the effects of the lack of consultation and the poor quality of consultation by the Government over the past five or six months are best illustrated by the document, ``RUC key policing objective and key performance indicators'', which appeared today. That document might be an example of political correctness, but it has little relevance to anything that is new in policing in Northern Ireland. For as long as I have been a Member of Parliament--almost 15 years--a chief constable's report has been produced year on year. They have possibly been produced for even longer, as I did not read the Chief Constable's report assiduously before I came to the House. All the new performance indicators are contained in the Chief Constable's report. What, therefore, is the Government's policy with regard to policing and security in Northern Ireland? Is it all sleight of hand? Is it to do with political correctness? Has it been formulated deceive? If the Minister believes that the IRA will be more impressed with the Bill than I am, he is very foolish.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman think it interesting--
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd </B>(Lord Commissioner to the Treasury): No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Let me go on. The hon. Gentleman should not jump to conculsions; he is very impatient. 
<P>
Until the general election, the current Chief Constable and his predecessor supported every single clause in the 1996 legislation. The Bill changes two clauses significantly. One clause removes the power of detention without trial. In the view of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, the Chief Constable has changed his mind in the seven months since the election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The hon. Gentleman sets me the daunting task of interpreting the Chief Constable's thoughts. Many varied ideas seem to be crossing his mind. He knows the Government's predisposition to so-called political correctness and perhaps he is trying to behave in a similar manner. He has been in the job for a comparatively short time and I do not want to embarrass him. However, the speed with which he tries to outstrip those who clamour for change in the RUC is unwise, to put it mildly, and could cause difficulties in future.
<P>
I apologise to the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, who wanted to intervene earlier. I hope that I am not giving way too late.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I am sorry for breaking the hon. Gentlemen's train of thought. I would have preferred to take issue with him immediately on one point.
<P>
I jotted down the words ``weak on terrorism'' and ``soft on terrorists'', which were applied specifically to the hon. Member for Hull, North and generally to members of the Labour party. I have criticisms of the Government to make, but those statements are unacceptable. Knowing that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone is a generous and honest man, I ask him to rephrase those remarks. I know that he did not not means to suggest that the Labour party, especially the hon. Member for Hull, North was weak on terrorism or soft on terrorists. Perhaps he would like an opportunity to amend those descriptions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making his point about the hon. Member for Hull, North. I am not attributing any malicious intent to him or to other Back Benchers who consistently voted against emergency provisions legislation. I am talking rather about the effect of their action on society in Northern Ireland, as it has undermined the confidence--albeit unwittingly; I accept the sincerity of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh--of people living under pressure from terrorism. I accept that there was no malicious intent, but I am speaking about the outcome of consistent opposition to emergency provisions legislation when it was so badly needed. That conveyed to the IRA that there was no necessity to make amends or to show remorse for the awful violence that has led to about 2,200 of the 3,200 deaths in Northern Ireland as a result of terrorism over the past 27 years. We have received no unqualified statements of remorse from the IRA.
<P>
I have never been and never will be a champion of loyalist terrorism. I have been as strenuous in my condemnation of loyalist terrorism as I have been of republican terrorism. I see no difference between them. When loyalists terrorists ended their activities, they expressed remorse and they made it clear that they would never again initiate a first-strike form of terrorism. However, that is not good enough for me: I want to hear that they will never again involve themselves in terrorism as such. Nevertheless, it is a beginning and it can be built upon.
<P>
What have we heard from Provisional IRA-Sinn Fein? Francie Malloy, to the best of my knowledge, was never an IRA man--I could not say that about Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness or Slab Murphy. However, although Francie Malloy was himself not an active terrorist, he was a good and consistent advocate of those who carried out terrorism on behalf of militant republicanism, which we know of as Provisional IRA-Sinn Fein. It was he, as alluded to earlier, who spoke to the militants in south Armagh who were worried about the leadership overplaying the ballot box element of their Armalite and ballot box philosophy.
<P>
We should remember that councillors sign a pledge to abrogate terrorism. Francie Malloy was not aware that journalists from The Daily Telegraph and Irish News were in the room when he told militants that if the talks process came to an end, they would go back to doing what they do best. We in the House remember Airey Neave, Ian Gow, Robert Bradford and the hon. Gentleman who died at Brighton.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. It was Sir Anthony Berry.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Winterton. We remember that those people--who, let us not forget, were democratically elected in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain--were foully murdered by the IRA because it does not believe that it can achieve its objectives through political activity. Nothing that has happened in the interim convinces me that any of these people intend that Government tokens such as the option to intern, the descheduling of offences or the ending of internal exile--a change that I applaud--will make the slightest difference to the way they act. Does the Minister really believe that when these payments of danegeld come to an end, he will have any more of a guarantee than the previous Government had in 1994 to 1996 that the IRA will not return to violence? Has the IRA told him something that it has not told the rest of us? Has it defined its bottom line for the ransom that his Government must pay? If it has, I am interested in hearing about it.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will pay attention to the need that my party thinks exists for amendments to the Bill and that the Government will give us adequate time for that. The Minister nods--if he is prepared to agree to that, I may think a little more.--[Interruption.] I hope that he is not dissenting--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman should not take nods in Committee as necessarily being assent. I was nodding to my hon. Friend the Whip. I shall deal with the hon. Gentleman's points in due course. I was not assenting to his last point--that is a matter for the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I thought, as other hon. Members may have, that I saw a trace of understanding cross the Minister's face.
<P>
Those of us who represent Northern Ireland constituencies are, as the Minister knows, tied to a schedule that is barely able to be held to at present. We do not have the civil service back-up that he has. Telling us at the latter end of last week that we were to meet here today, Tuesday, and expecting us to have tabled our new clauses and amendments by Friday was, in the first instance unreasonable, and in the second impossible. I leave it to the good judgment of the Minister and the Secretary of State to decide whether we who represent Northern Ireland constituencies should be given adequate time to put our case in more detail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> May I also welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Winterton, and be assured of your guidance when it is required, as no doubt it will?
<P>
I find myself in a semi-detached position in the debate on the clause because, like the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, I have sat on so many Committees deliberating on emergency legislation that I have a divided opinion on the Bill. I have no quarrel whatsoever with the three major issues that it deals with. Indeed, I welcomed them, as did my colleagues and not least the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Hull North.
<P>
My difficulty is akin to that expressed by the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter). He questioned the permanent extension to emergency legislation, which seems to be a contradiction. I can accept some of the logic for that extension, but given the fact that the Bill extends the 1996 Act to 24 August 2000, I should have thought that there would be an opportunity within that time and within the political context to start to look anew at the entire question of such legislation. I know that there is to be a review by the Home Secretary and the Northern Ireland Office and I welcome that because I an not naive enough to think that in this day and age there is no need for legislation to deal with what is nobly called terrorism. However, when that emergency legislation is ad hoc, conceived in crisis and renewed without full examination of all circumstances, we must ask what does it signpost.
<P>
That brings me to the issue, to which other hon. Members have referred, of the present context, including both political and security matters. There is an obvious division of belief as to what is peace as we know it in Northern Ireland and what are its effects on the political process. There are those who do not view it as a lasting peace. Indeed, the Minister has been asked when he would be convinced that there was a permanent cessation of violence. That is a difficult question for anybody to answer, even a Minister. No one who lives in the north of Ireland would ever be able to put his or her hand on their heart and say that there was a permanent cessation of violence.
<P>
All ceasefires or cessations of violence are ultimately acts of faith and judgment. They cannot be absolute. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, who spoke for the Opposition and who spent many years as a Minister in the north of Ireland, recognised in his speech that there is a developing situation with which any Government must deal. We must undertake the act of faith for this reason: after what the north of Ireland has experienced over the past 27 years--indeed, in my case, longer--what will we have left if we do not to undertake that act of faith or if the capacity to undertake it is removed? That is the crucial question. Unless we translate the act of faith into a political context that will allow us to deal with problems, there will be little or no political hope left in the north of Ireland.
<P>
I shall pose several questions. The Bill's powers will remain in force until 2000. Let us assume that the act of faith that many of us have made starts to become a reality, that the Secretary of State was correct when she said that she believed that there could be a political settlement before 1 May 1998 and that the process in which we are involved leads to political agreement for a new start. Where would the Bill then stand? Will its powers lapse? Will it not be renewed? Will it be replaced? Will it be superseded by legislation that a political arrangement in the north of Ireland might determine?
<P>
Above all, where would the Bill stand in relation to a factor in the talks process that is common to all parties--the commitment to a Bill of rights, probably based on the European convention on human rights? That immediately raises the issue of how the 1996 Act cohabits with emergency legislation such as the Bill. Those things may not come about--I hope that they will--but at this stage it is worth asking about such cohabitation because a Bill of rights is a stated objective of each and every political party involved in the talks at Castle buildings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The hon. Gentleman is developing an interesting theme. He questioned whether such legislation would be needed in Northern Ireland if there was a lasting settlement and talked about a total cessation of violence. A settlement acceptable to the vast majority of the people and political parties in Northern Ireland might be achieved, but a spin-off group, let us say from the IRA, might not accept it. Given that such a settlement will include north-south linkages of one kind or another, does he see any need for legislation, but only in Northern Ireland but in the south of Ireland, that will counter terrorism of whatever kind should it show its face in future?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks a perfectly valid question. Terrorism is not just acts of violence. It has spread much wider. It has to do with drugs--people who understand the Northern Ireland situation in paramilitary terms know full well that there is a substantial drug base across the terrorist groupings. It has to do with racketeering--the foundations of many paramilitary groupings are underpinned by widespread racketeering which is based on intimidation. In effect, entire communities are held to ransom by those who make threats from within paramilitary units. That is clearly a matter of controlling the community.
<P>
Those factors must be dealt with, and I suggest that they could better be dealt with in consolidated legislation that would derive from the review and would be common to all parts, rather than specific to the north of Ireland.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not know the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question. However, I know from personal experience that for 27 years, despite the panoply of powers under the EPA and the PTA and all the various types of legislation, when violence of that broad nature operated--and perhaps still operates--emergency legislation has not been capable of dealing with it. Had it been, we would not be considering this Bill now. One of the factors about this legislation and others of its type, including the PTA, is that in the north of Ireland such legislation has not succeeded in preventing terrorism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The hon. Gentleman puts an argument that we have heard from him again and again over the years. I must, in response, ask him how he can make a judgment about whether emergency legislation is effective. He may be able to say that it is not totally effective, but if we did not have emergency legislation, would not the outcome be much more tragic for Northern Ireland? If the hon. Gentleman applies his rule that because it is not totally effective it should not be there, where are we left? Talks in the past about the future of Northern Ireland have not led to a total resolution of our problems. Should we stop talking?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks me to prove a negative. This type of legislation has not solved the problem of terrorism, but wider legislation, of the type that has been identified, could get to the fundamentals of what keeps terrorists going in terms of the wider organisation. Above all--and this refers to the second part of the hon. Gentleman's question--it is the political process, with the support of the community, that will be the ultimate bulwark against the use of violence and terrorism in all its other manifestations. That is why it is essential to have that political process, and imperative that it works, is inclusive, and can be developed in a positive way.
<P>
I understand the feelings expressed by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and by the hon. and learned Member for North Down. In relation to what is euphemistically called inclusivity, it is not easy to sit beside people who have been convicted and sentenced for killing members of one's own party--to sit beside them day in and day out, negotiating a future with them. It is not easy for any Unionist party member to have to negotiate with members of Sinn Fein, but it is an essential part of the political process. That is where we live--that is what we have to deal with, warts and all.
<P>
One of the remarkable things about the political process is that we cannot choose our opposition--even our political friends are chosen for us. But when it comes to the ultimate resolution of the problem in the north of Ireland, we must deal with it, warts and all. That is why I became a little tetchy when the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone suggested that people who opposed emergency legislation were soft on terrorists. I have opposed it and will continue to oppose it at every opportunity, because it does not work. There are other ways of tackling the issue.
<P>
Emergency legislation blunts the mood within communities; they, and not the terrorists, suffer from it. I see that at first hand every day, even yet. It is not the people who make up or plant bombs who are inconvenienced or who suffer under such legislation; it is ordinary people going about their day's work in south Armagh, west Belfast and throughout the north of Ireland. They are entitled to a normality that such legislation does not provide.
<P>
To equate opposition to emergency legislation with advocacy of or sympathy for terrorism, or with being soft on terrorists, is to do an injustice to the many people who question this and other pieces of legislation. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire quoted the people who, at the disposal of various Governments, have reported on the implementation of the 1996 Act and the PTA. There are common threads running through their reports, one of which is their opposition to internment. Another is a request for audio-visual recordings in interrogation centres. If we are to use Lord Colville, Sir Louis Blom-Cooper and others as sources for our debate, we must consider their contributions on the three main aspects of the Bill. We will find requests and suggestions from them for changes in those three areas.
<P>
We must all ask ourselves whether the political situation in the north of Ireland is changing at the moment. I am not asking whether we like it or not, whether we are happy or whether it is a comfort zone for us; I want to know whether the situation is fundamentally changing. I believe--I come back to the act of faith--that it is. Others have made that judgment, including the Prime Minster. I think that he will put that judgment into effect and meet Mr. Adams before Christmas. The White House has made that judgment, too, as has the Northern Ireland Office administration.
<P>
The Minister said, both here and on Second Reading, that this was a different--better--ceasefire than before. He is right. All those factors must colour our perceptions when we approach the Bill. My perceptions are coloured not just by the changing political context in which we find ourselves but by my intense opposition to imposing a set of abnormal legal and administrative strictures on a situation to which there is no legal solution. Legislation has been used for far too long to solve an essentially political problem, which it never could and never will do. I would welcome the opportunity as we progress to expand on views of some of the detail.
<P>
I welcome the three fundamental elements of change, which took courage. Any British Government would require courage to take away the powers that we are discussing, as our debate will show--however long it continues. I had hoped that the further step would be taken--or at least the hand held until an opportunity had arisen to take that further step--towards creating something new in terms so that none of us could ever again argue against it logically and with conviction.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Robert McCartney:</B> I join with my colleagues in welcoming you to the Chair, Mrs. Winterton. I am sure that your experience and courtesy will be of great aid to us all. You have already demonstrated a remarkable degree of patience, which, I am sure, is a necessary asset in such matters. I shall be as brief as I can. All the contributions have been interesting, but the relevance of some of them to clause 1 has been somewhat tenuous.
<P>
I am not sure whether the Minister will agree with this, but a terrorist-controlled ceasefire that is cynically untilised for political gain does not amount to peace. The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh exorted us to resort to an act of faith. In consideration of the 1996 Bill in Committee, he resorted to an Ulsterism or a hempen homespun piece of philosophy and said, ``If you fool me once, shame on you; if you fool me twice, shame on me.'' He now asks each of us to be a fool twice. The world at large recognised the first ceasefire for what it was--tactical, fraudulent and cynical. However, it fooled many people more than once. It fooled the good Senator Mitchell, who praised the good faith of Sinn Fein-IRA in his report of January 1996. He said that he had no doubt whatever that one could rely on the fact that the ceasefire had lasted for 17 months as evidence of the good faith of Sinn Fein-IRA. Yet in October 1995, when the senator and his two colleagues were having the meetings that were the source of such faith in his heart, the IRA at that very moment, was already planning and studying the logistical requirements for delivering its February 1996 present to the City of London--the bomb at Canary wharf. The good faith of Sinn Fein-IRA was of course demonstrated in many ways, but a terrorist-controlled ceasefire that is utilised for political gain is not peace. Similarly, a ceasefire that is declared cynically and which is manipulated so that the threat of a breach obtains benefits is not peace.
<P>
Questions have been asked, in the context of clause 1, about why the Bill in its proposed form has been introduced now, given that general legislation for the whole United Kingdom that takes account of Lord Lloyd's report will be introduced early in the new year.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I rely of the Ulster wisdom of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh. I am not prepared to be fooled twice. The Bill is being introduced because it is necessary to keep terrorists on board and assure them that progress is being made along a path that ultimately will deliver their political objectives. The Bill is designed to give them encouragement and build their confidence.
<P>
Such confidence-building measures come in all sorts of forms. The changes made to the 1996 Act by the Bill provide three examples. The first is internment, which has not been used as a positive measure since 1977, It remains on the statute book because of primary legislation, and can be brought into force by subordinate order at short notice. At present, internment does no one any harm because it is not used. No one suffers from its exercise, but its availability--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman pursued this argument in the clause 3 stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall not pursue the question of internment any further now, but my general point is that it, and the others of the three examples that I was about to list, offer no significant or immediate benefit except to the confidence of terrorists.
<P>
That has been a constant theme. Terrorists must have their confidence built up to ensure that they do not return to violence and destruction. The Bill is one example of that confidence building, which has manifested itself in other ways--notably and most bizarrely in the case of Jason Campbell. Campbell brutally murdered a 16-year-old boy for no other reason than that he was wearing a Glasgow Celtic jersey. The boy had no real connection with Northern Ireland, but the Progressive Unionist party and the combined Loyalist military command declared that transfer of the prisoner would be an important consideration because it would build up their confidence. We all know what happened after that.
<P>
The Committee should consider seriously the purpose of introducing the Bill at this time. The measures build up terrorists' confidence enormously, but in the minds and hearts of ordinary law-abiding citizens they will destroy faith in the democratic process and in the rule of law.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> The debate has been more wide ranging than I had expected, However, we kept to the point and stayed within bounds despite the occasional transgression by the hon. and learned Member for North Down.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is for the Chair to decide what is within the remit of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I agree, Mrs. Winterton, but I was remarking on the somewhat tenuous nature of the debate. Our discussion has been helpful. It shows that we did not need a sittings motion--a point that goes back to what the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said about how this matter has been handled. The debate has undeniably been wide ranging. The hon. Gentleman made several points. Some of his more trivial comments were about the long recess. He tried to suggest that the long recess showed that the Government were failing in their duty. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the summer recess was one day shorter than that of 1992. I should not have thought that the matter was significant enough for the hon. Gentleman to raise.
<P>
I state categorically that the Government have no intention of rushing the legislation. It is not peremptory, and we are not trampling over the rights of hon. Members. I remind the Committee the Second Reading debate concluded an hour and a half earlier than the time allowed for it. The role of the Opposition is to oppose, but they did not avail themselves of that opportunity. It would be completely misplaced for Opposition Members to criticise the Government for trying to assess the mood of the House because that debate was not utilised by opposition parties.
<P>
The Government are trying to deal with legislation that is about efficient and careful government. We will be held to account for what we said in opposition, not just in these provisions but in other future and existing legislation. What we said in opposition must be carried out in government. We are doing that--there are no surprises in the legislation. The aims of all the amendments were covered by our comments during consideration of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996, and by the many statements made by my right hon. and hon. Friends in the years before Labour came to power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> To ensure that Northern Ireland Members do not take the hon. Gentleman's remarks amiss, would he agree that since the talks process started, there has been much pressure on them not only to deliberate and to deal with the major issues in the talks, but to fulfil their responsibilities and duties here? Does he accept that on this occasion, some Northern Ireland Members who normally contribute at length to debates, were encumbered or involved in other matters in Northern Ireland?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman is aware as an ex-Northern Ireland Minister that there is often great pressure on Northern Ireland Members. They have to look after their constituencies, be in Belfast and elsewhere, and they have to fulfil their function in London. I accept that those who represent Northern Ireland's interests have many pressures. When important legislation is being produced hon. Members have to make judgments about where they want to put their views across. I accept that there are often good reasons for hon. Members not to participate in Second Reading debates, and why they may not be anxious to serve on Committees. That is a matter for their judgment. It is significant that the full time was not used on Second Reading, and that now some of the same arguments are being advanced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Before the Minister leaves that matter will he treat it a little less glibly? He knows that representatives of the Northern Ireland political parties where present on Second Reading, that they contributed to the debate, and that his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland did not even acknowledge their presence in the House during that debate. It is fallacious to suggest that we should have anticipated that there would be extra time at the end of the debate when we might have made longer or more in-depth speeches. Madam Speaker constantly prevails on us no to speak at great length on Second Reading, but many of us spoke beyond the point which we thought would be tolerated. The Minister's argument is fallacious, and he knows it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Let me put the Committee's mind at rest. I am not dealing with this matter glibly. I will deal with every point that has been raised. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, who is assiduous in his duties. He spoke at length on Second Reading to set out his arguments, and he has done so again tonight. I recognise that other members of his party were present on Second Reading. I do not think that there is anything to be gained from continuing this discussion now that a defence has been raised by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire made a point about the list of issues covered by the Bill. I do not want to go back over each of those items. However, all the items that he listed remain in the Bill. If Conservative Members had wished to try to remove any of them, or to debate them, they could have done so by tabling amendments on specific points. The fact that they did not tells us their attitude to the Bill.
<P>
Much has been made of concessions to Sinn Fein and other political parties. I, my ministerial colleagues including, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and everyone who has any knowledge of how the talks process has been handled rejects the idea that there has been a concession approach. Our approach is based on trying to build confidence in both communities.
<P>
The Government are committed to fundamental principles of fairness and justice. That cannot be gainsaid. There will be no second-class citizens in Northern Ireland or anywhere else in the United Kingdom. We are determined to see full respect for and equality of several political, social and cultural rights and freedom of discussion for everyone. We are committed to building a society in which different identities are treated equally and enjoy mutual respect. In seeking specific developments in the talks process we are trying to build confidence on both sides of the community.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Robert McCartney:</B> The Minister talks about second-class citizens in the United Kingdom. Does he agree that that is exactly what his party and Government have made of the entire population of Northern Ireland? That population is resident in the United Kingdom, but not one person, from either side of the divide, can join the British Labour party. Is that part of the Minister's policy of equal citizenship?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> There are many members of my party from both sides of the divided community of Northern Ireland, and they are very active.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The affairs of the Labour party have nothing to do with clause 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I was taking my lead from you, Mrs. Winterton, by trying to respond to the hon. Gentleman. I apologise if I strayed from the point.
<P>
I reiterate what I said about concessions. I hope that we can lay the matter to rest so that we do not have to hear about it again in subsequent debates or elsewhere. The Government are trying to build confidence on both sides of the community. Indeed, that is what the previous Government sought to do. It must be the main objective of any Government to bring together the divided parts of the community. A liaison sub-committee has been established as part of the talks process to achieve that objective. Its role is to examine ways in which confidence-building measures can be expanded and be properly implemented to bring the communities together.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the previous Government considered concessions to both sides of the community through negotiations and by taking the matter forward and making progress. He needs to tell the Committee, vis-a-vis the timing of the Bill, whether confidence-building measures are paramount, or is there some other important reason for introducing them now? Are they convenient in that they build confidence while possibly achieving other goals?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It is obvious from the criticisms that confidence has not been established in the minds of those people and parties who represent interests in Northern Ireland. Indeed, the same point was made by the Conservative party. It is to be regretted. As I said earlier, the Bill deals with issues that we set out time after time in opposition, and we made clear what we would be implementing. If we did not present our proposals we would be criticised for ignoring what we said in opposition now that we are in government. That would be the wrong process to follow. The measure is about efficient government. We are trying to stand by what we said in opposition and to deliver our proposals in specific, realisable ways in the light of developments in other anti-terrorist legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister said earlier that the Government were honouring comittments that were given in opposition. I let that go at that juncture but he has now reintroduced it. How does he explain the fact that in opposition the Labour party opposed the Diplock courts and wanted to change the system so that certifying in and not certifying out was the responsibility of the Attorney-General, and yet it has not implemented its pre-election pledges in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I hope that the Committee can reach clause 3 tonight when we will be able to debate at length certifying in and certifying out, because that is the time to deal with those issues. As for other comments made on security assessment, it is important to recognise and, I hope, to accept that the Provisional IRA ceasefire is 18 weeks old and that terrorist activity remains low. All of us should accept that that is encouraging. The Chief Constable's knowledge on this issue is wide ranging. He has considerable experience of it and has the responsibility of advising the Government as well as carrying out operational decisions. On 4 November he said that the ceasefire remains remarkably stable. However, we have to recognise that terrorist groups still operate in Northern Ireland--the Continuity Army Council, or the Continuity IRA as it is otherwise known, the Loyalist Volunteer Force and, of course, the Irish National Liberation Army still exist. The terrorist threat has not gone away. I made that point on Second Reading and I make it again this evening. That is why we require vigilance, a proper overview and efficient, permanent anti-terrorist legislation for the longer term.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert McCartney:</B> Will the Minister explain why he is treating other groups, especially those on the republican side, as divorced from IRA control? During the six weeks that the Government required for the admission of the IRA, not so much as a squib went off. It has been pointed out that in similar circumstances during President Clinton's visit nothing happened. Does the Minister accept that the IRA has significant control over the level at which the so-called front-door-associated groups operate, or is he saying that they are totally and completely independent of Sinn Fein-IRA influence? If they are not independent of that influence, is not their activity important in keeping the Government aware that if they do not make concessions, violence will return?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I seem to have been asked to stray into a wide-ranging assessment of the nature of terrorism in Northern Ireland. There may be other opportunities, which I would welcome, to provide that assessment through parliamentary questions and statements from me and my colleagues.
<P>
The question that has been asked concerns the relationship of INLA and the Continuity Army Council to the Provisional IRA. There is no evidence to suggest that they are operating under the direct control of that body. If the hon. Gentleman has any such evidence, I hope that he will pass it on to those with responsibility for security in Northern Ireland.
<P>
I shall refer to another group, which has recently manifested itself--the Republican Revolutionary Strike Force. It has sent devices to Unionist politicians, including the hon. and learned Member for North Down. I have been advised that two people have been arrested by the Royal Ulster Constabulary for distributing those devices and it is interesting that of all the comments made in the preceding debate, not one hon. Member complimented the work of the RUC. I shall put on the record now that the RUC is assiduous and effective in tackling terrorists from whatever direction they come and will continue to do so. While the terrorist threat remains, the Government will continue to give the RUC and the security forces full support in providing proper protection to the people of Northern Ireland.
<P>
Other matters were raised concerning consent and where the Government stand on that. We have not changed our position since it was enuniciated shortly after we came to government. We are still committed absolutely to the fundamental principle of consent in all aspects. That has been the guiding principle for the Governments of the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom and it is supported by all but one party. The constitutional status of Nothern Ireland depends on the wishes of the majority. All except Sinn Fein agree that there will be no change in the position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom without the consent of the majority. The rules of procedure for the talks include the sufficient consensus rule by which agreement requires concurrence representative of the majority of each of the two communities and no settlement can be reached without cross-community support.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire referred to the triple lock, which still applies. The Government have made it clear that no proposals emerging from the talks will be put before Parliament without the support of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland voting in a referendum. That has been clear from day one and has consistently been argued. I can only question why it has been raised again this evening. Where does the doubt exist? The Government's position has been stated time and time again by the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State, and now I have restated it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Minister asked where our evidence was. The evidence is in his statement. He said that all the parties at the negotiating table agreed that the consent of the people of Northern Ireland was the basis on which decisions should be made. 
<P>
In dissenting from that may I ask whether he agrees that Sinn Fein contravened one of the six fundamental principles outlined by Mitchell, and we were told that those who contravened a Mitchell principle, one or all, would not be eligible to sit at the table of democracy? By tolerating the presence of Sinn Fein under the very circumstances that he has described, he has caused me to feel that I cannot depend on the Government's assurances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman is in the talks process. He has the opportunity to challenge those around the table on their support for the Mitchell principles and he should make his own judgment on that. It is the Government's position that Sinn Fein has signed up to the Mitchell principles. That is why its representatives are participating in the talks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> The Minister asked why there was still doubt about the Government's commitment to the principle of consent. I can answer that by asking the Minister a question. Is it not the case that the 1988 Labour party document on Northern Ireland distinguished between consent being necessary for the full and final transfer of sovereignty but consent not being required for a package of institutions that might be created through a settlement? That is where doubt lies because we have not heard unequivocally that that no longer applies, and that the principal of consent now applies across the board.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Once again, that point falls outside the scope of clause 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I want to deal with the points that the hon. Gentleman raised in his speech. He said that there was some illogicality in what the Government were doing, and that there has been some foot dragging in relation to Lord Lloyd's inquiry into anti-terrorist legislation. It is worth bearing in mind that the report was produced in October 1996 when the Conservatives were in government. If there was any foot dragging, I should like to ask the hon. Gentleman what he was doing at that time. Was he asking for measures to be implemented immediately? No, because he realised that Governments have to give careful consideration to a matter as complex and wide-ranging as Lord Lloyd's report.
<P>
Lord Lloyd also predicated his conclusions on there being permanent peace. The accusation that we were foot dragging, when there was no permanent peace when we took office--the ceasefire is only 17 or 18 weeks old--is completely invalid. We have quickly assessed the proposed way forward for anti-terrorism legislation. On 30 October, we announced our proposals. We said that a consultation document would be issued early in the new year. The hon. Member for Basingstoke is right that there will be a consultation period of about three months--not an unreasonable period. Sometimes, with complex issues, which this undoubtedly is, such a period can be extended at the request of the consultees. Therefore we must be realistic.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Within five months of coming to power, my party has made rapid progress towards putting effective and permanent anti-terrorist legislation on the statute book. We have taken the first steps, and I had hoped for support and recognition of that from Opposition Members.
<P>
As to the points made by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, I must say that I wholly support the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh in his defence of Labour Members who are accused of being soft on terrorism. There is no evidence to show that simply making a different assessment from the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone about what action should be taken now and in the future is the same as being soft on terrorism. A multiplicity of views must be expressed in a democracy. We will never make progress as a society if everyone is trapped in some point in history. Those who argue that Labour Members--the hon. Member for Hull, North has been referred to--are soft on terrorism do society a major disservice. Hon. Members who have put arguments for different ways forward have the right to do so in a democracy. There is no question of them being soft on terrorism; they are simply taking a different point of view from Opposition Members. I support the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh in his defence on this matter.
<P>
Another point was made about the targeting strategy of the Provisional IRA. A terrorist threat still exists in Northern Ireland and, possibly, in Great Britain--hence the need for the Bill. RUC officers, prison officers and others in the community must be occasionally advised that they could be under threat from terrorist groupings. That must be borne in mind, and such advice is rightly given. It would not be appropriate for me to discuss individual cases, the sort of advice that is given, or even the generalities. That would not help us to protect the interests of fellow citizens. I notice that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone is nodding; I hope that he understands the difficulties that arise from individual cases of targeting RUC officers, prison officers and others.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I want to clarify that I nodded in assent to the Minister's remark that we should not divulge individual cases in which personal security is an issue. I certainly did not indicate assent when he said that the generalities should be cloaked--that we should not know the Government's assessment of the targeting threat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Targeting must be completely condemned, which is why we have provided the RUC and security forces with sufficient resources to deal specifically with that problem and the threat to those who live in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. I mentioned the distribution of potentially dangerous devices to Unionist politicians and also commented on the way in which the RUC has tackled that problem. That is another form of targeting and the RUC should be complimented for dealing with it effectively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert McCartney:</B> Does the Minister accept that Sinn Fein-IRA operates under flags of convenience and that targeting by other organisations, including inland organisations, is from time to time carried out on behalf of the IRA? Does he accept that all the evidence proves conclusively that direct action against drugs, which was responsible for the taking of 11 lives on 31 August 1994--during the first IRA ceasefire--was carried out by operatives under the direction of the Provisional IRA?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That matter does not fall within the jurisdiction of clause 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone complained about the procedure for handling the Bill. Sufficient notice was given to all parties that wanted to table amendments in Committee. There will also be a Report stage, when amendments can again be tabled, although it is at the discretion of the Speaker whether those amendments are selected. Sufficient time has been made available before Committee and sufficient time will be made available before Report.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh asked how it is possible to attest to whether there is a permanent cessation of violence in Northern Ireland or, indeed, anywhere within the United Kingdom. He said that that question was impossible to answer. It is certainly not something that is currently in place, and probably will not be for the foreseeable future, however that is defined. That is because of the nature of the small paramilitary organisations that exist in Northern Ireland, none of which is prepared to sign up to the desire for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, or to accept the need to have political parties that will sign up to the talks process. It is therefore impossible to answer that question. However, we must aim to achieve that end through the talks process.
<P>
The permanent cessation of violence within Northern Ireland must remain the objective of all hon. Members. That is to be achieved through negotiation, through accommodation, through sitting down with people with whom it may be difficult to sit around a table, and by talking to those people and trying to find ways forward. That is the process we are in at the moment. For the first time in 75 years, all traditions of opinion are around the table in the same room in Northern Ireland. That is major progress and one of the ways forward in trying to achieve the desired end.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh also asked where the Bill would stand in the event of a permanent ceasefire. I have referred throughout the Committee to the need to achieve effective, permanent anti-terrorist legislation for the whole of the United Kingdom. Because what is now under discussion is an interim and temporary measure, it would fall within the ambit of such wider-ranging legislation.
<P>
I draw hon. Members' attention to what I said on Second Reading:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I remind hon. Members that the current Act contains a power to suspend many of its provisions. That power will be maintained; it is exercisable at any time during the lifetime of the Act if justified by changed circumstances. Therefore, should a political settlement be achieved, it will be open to the Secretary of State, when she judges it right to do so, to act to let lapse such provisions as she sees fit.''--[Official Report, 18 November 1997; Vol. 301, c. 172.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>Even without permanent legislation, the temporary provisions are still open to change if we move rapidly towards a peaceful settlement, and it is then for the Secretary of State to judge, subject to the agreement of the House, whether those provisions should lapse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I thank the Minister for tackling that point. In the event of a political settlement, the creation of an Administration in the north of Ireland, and the introduction of a Bill of Rights--which all parties that are involved in the talks believe will be formulated--how would such a Bill operate at the same time as the emergency legislation? Which legislation would take precedence? To whom would an appeal be made when those Bills inevitably clashed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Any legislation has to be consistent with international and domestic obligations, such as Acts that are on the statute book. The hon. Gentleman asks me to predict how this legislation will fit in with measures that have not yet been considered. That is impossible to answer. However, all measures must be consistent with each other. It is the Government's overriding responsibility to ensure that legislation is sufficiently robust to stand examination in our domestic courts and in international courts.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked me about devolving powers to a body in Northern Ireland. I cannot predict the form that such a body would take, its east-west relationship, or any of the other relationships for which some parties argue. The conundrum is impossible to solve at this stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I fully accept the impossibility of solving the matter, but there is a derogation from the European convention on human rights, on which a Bill of Rights would be based. A derogation in the PTA in terms of the EPA would be an absolute contradiction.
<P>
The Minister said that the Secretary of State had reserved powers. However, in new circumstances that might not be the case. I accept that a conundrum element--I put it no more strongly--exists. However, it is worth examining to try to resolve the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I could not agree more if we are to try to resolve the problem. Any derogation in the Bill has to be upheld by the courts. The need for such derogation is based on the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland, where there is a significant terrorist threat. Governments have had to consider Northern Ireland in that context.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked what would happen in the event of a permanent ceasefire or some change in current circumstances. The answer is that some of the provisions would lapse. As I said earlier, the Secretary of State has the power to allow that to happen. We would try to develop permanent and effective anti-terrorism measures, which would have to be consistent with a Bill of Rights and other domestic, European Union and international legislation. We cannot resolve those complex matters this evening. We can say only that the Government would be required to provide robust legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> May I pick up the Minister on the word ``consistent''? A review will be presented in the new year, which will probably include some of Lord Lloyd's proposals to bring together the EPA and the PTA. But Northern Ireland is very different. I am delighted that the Government are proposing to extend the legislation because the unique situation in Northern Ireland requires unique measures to counter terrorist activity. Does the Minister envisage a time post some sort of settlement when unique measures will still be needed to deal with a terrorist threat, perhaps, some rump of the IRA?
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The answer is possibly, but not certainly. We have to deal with the realities at the time when judgment has to be made. We cannot predict what the future will hold. That is why there is flexibility in the Bill, which we are then trying to put in the context of permanent, effective anti-terrorist legislation that will apply throughout the whole of the United Kingdom. That is where the consultation process can be so helpful, in examining some of the ``what ifs'' that will apply not only in Northern Ireland, but to emerging terrorist threats throughout the world.
<P>
Such matters require careful assessment and evaluation, which is why we have taken five months to consider Lord Lloyd's recommendations. On 30 October we moved towards the consultative process and, subsequently, to preparing legislation and presenting it to the House. The fact that we need to renew the Act is based upon legality and statute. It expires next year, so it is not likely that alternative legislation will be in place by that time. That is why the clause is necessary.
<P>
No one has spoken about what the clause is really about. If I may conclude my remarks--[Hon. Members: ``No.''] I am amazed that hon. Members are still so alert at this stage of the evening. It may help the Committee if I set out the detail of clause 1. It extends the life of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996 by providing that it shall repeal itself on 24 October 2000. It also provides that its temporary provisions shall expire on 15 June 1999 unless renewed by order on or before that date.
<P>
The purpose of the clause is simple and straightforward--it is to ensure that the criminal justice system and the security forces in Northern Ireland will continue to have in place beyond August 1998 the measures needed to deal with the continued threat of terrorism. I repeat that the decision to extend the life of the present Act is an interim measure, which should be viewed in the context of the statement made by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on 30 October.
<P>
Members of the Comittee and, indeed, of both Houses of Parliament hope that this legislation will not continue to be required. However, it has always been accepted on both sides of the House that, despite specific criticisms of existing legislation, there is and will remain a need to have provisions to deal with terrorism. It is therefore better that this is of a permanent rather than temporary or emergency nature. That is the Government's long-term objective. In the meantime, we need to extend the life of the existing Act. That is what the clause sets out to achieve.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is my intention to suspend the Committee for dinner. I suggest that the Committee reassembles at 8.30 pm. The Room will be locked in the intervening period, so papers and other belongings can be left.
<P>
<H5>7.4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
