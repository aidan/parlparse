<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 316, in page 48, line 9, after `consulting', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the Lord President of the Court of Session and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendment No. 424.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> As we have now reached an important part of the Bill, it might help the Committee if I gave a little background.
<P>
Clause 107 establishes the financial services and markets tribunal and gives the Lord Chancellor a general power to make rules for its operation. Schedule 11 sets out further details of the tribunal's constitution and operation.
<P>
The tribunal is a vital component of the new regulatory system. It is right and proper that the regulators should have effective powers. It is equally right and proper that we ensure that those who are subject to Financial Services Authority authorisation and enforcement decisions should enjoy their right to a full and fair hearing.
<P>
The tribunal will replace the existing fragmented provision for review procedures and will be fully independent. Its members will be appointed by the Lord Chancellor and its administration will be run as part of the Court Service.
<P>
Contrary to misleading reports in the press, the independent tribunal has been a key part of our plans to modernise financial services regulation since the draft Bill was published in July 1998. The first-instance nature of the tribunal was clarified last December, in the Government's progress report in March and in the proceedings of the Joint Committee, which Lord Burns chaired in the summer.
<P>
As the Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce, my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt)ómy predecessor as Economic Secretaryóexplained to the Joint Committee, the tribunal will be a first-instance tribunal. It will be able to consider all the facts and all the merits of the case, in full compliance with the requirements of article 6(1) of the European convention on human rights.
<P>
The tribunal will also comply with current best practice, as laid down by the Council on Tribunals. The council will oversee the tribunal's workings in accordance with its role under the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1992. Our amendments make it clear that the tribunal comes within the council's responsibilities under the Act.
<P>
The result is a single, fully independent tribunal, which will safeguard the rights of individuals and firms. A wide range of regulatory decisions will be subject to recourse to the tribunal. They will include: the refusal of an application for a new permission; the use of the authority's own-initiative powers to restrict an authorised person's business or to withdraw his authorisation; disciplinary measures against authorised firms; objections to controllers; the refusal of an application for or withdrawal of approval under part V; the making of a prohibition order; and the imposition of financial penalties for market abuse.
<P>
Of course, the right to refer a matter to the tribunal will generally come only after the necessary internal FSA procedures have been completed. As the Committee is aware, the Bill imposes several requirements on the FSA as regards the notice given, rights to make representations and to see evidence and the need to follow public procedures. We have come across the procedures several times in our deliberations, and we shall debate them fully when we finally reach clauses 338 to 340.
<P>
However, an important balance must be struck. It is in no one's interests for FSA procedures to replicate the tribunal's role. That would be costly and inflexible and would distance people from their recourse to the tribunal. Nor is it in the industry's interests for all cases to be referred automatically to a full tribunal hearing. The Joint Committee noted that that would impose unnecessary costs. We have, therefore, drawn a clear distinction between the tribunal's administrative internal procedures and its judicial procedures. The Joint Committee described the result as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an elegant hybrid which we find attractive''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It may be helpful to the Committee if I briefly outline the timetable for consultation on the draft procedural rules. The Lord Chancellor's Department expects to begin consulting the Council on Tribunals about the rules in early December. It intends that a draft should be circulated more widely in the new year, with a full public consultation in spring. I accept that Committee Members may wish to see a draft at the earliest possible stage, so I propose to make available to them the draft that the Government will send to the council in December.
<P>
For the purposes of our debate, I shall explain some procedural aspects that the rules will cover. Those include how references are commenced; how the FSA presents its case; rules on disclosure and inspection of documents, and rules of evidence, including the use of expert witnesses. As our amendments make clear, the tribunal will have broad discretion over the evidence that it hears.
<P>
Other procedural aspects covered by the rules are the holding of preliminary hearings and the procedure at the main hearing, including circumstances in which the hearing is not held in public. As long as that is consistent with the interests of justice and everyone's right to a public hearing under the ECHR, it is intended that that will generally be at the request of the person referring the case.
<P>
Post-decision matters, including publication of the decision and the award of costs are also covered by the rules. Our amendments to schedule 11 narrow the tribunal's discretion to award costs in line with the Joint Committee's suggestion.
<P>
The objective in drawing up the rules is to achieve a careful balance.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): The Minister is getting on to matters that relate to Government amendment No. 423. Are we dealing with that at the same time as the group of amendments that we are currently debating?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am dealing with Government amendments Nos. 400 and 424.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister mentioned schedule 11.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes, I did: I see no problem with that.
<P>
In drawing up the rules, the objective is to achieve a careful balance that ensures that rights are respected, but not at the expense of burgeoning legal proceedings or ineffective regulations. Fairness and transparency are at the heart of our plans for modernising financial services legislation, and the tribunal is an essential part of the overall package of firm but fair regulation.
<P>
I shall deal with the substance of our amendments. The clause includes a statutory requirement that the Lord Chancellor consult the Council on Tribunals on procedural rules for the tribunal. The inclusion of that explicit requirement reflects our wish to clearly emphasise that the Council is to oversee the new tribunal, in keeping with the role established for the council under the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1992.
<P>
Government amendment No. 424 addresses that more directly by making the tribunal one of those over which the council has statutory control by virtue of section 8(1) of the 1992 Act. Therefore, the requirement in the clause to consult the council is unnecessary, as the obligation to consult the council on the tribunal's procedural rules will be imposed be virtue of section 8(1) of the 1992 Act.
<P>
Therefore, amendment No. 400 deletes the reference to consulting the Council on Tribunals. However, I stress that that is not because the requirement is wrong, but because it is already part of the framework that will be applied by adding the tribunal to the list in schedule 1 to the 1992 Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): Clause 107 is important, as it deals with the tribunal, which the Joint Committee discussed at considerable length when it examined the draft Bill. At least five pages of its report are devoted to that subject, especially the relationship between the tribunal and other procedural bodies, such as the enforcement committee in the FSA.
<P>
The Minister was a little disingenuous to say that the Bill had always included provision for an independent tribunal fitted for the task as the original proposals that were published in July 1998 were deficient in many respects, and ran into a great deal of opposition. Apart from anything else, they would have conflicted immediately with the requirements of the ECHR. Effectively, what was proposed was something of an in-house appeals system that would have lacked the independence and impartiality that the convention requires. Also, remarkably, the Lord Chancellor was empowered under the original draft Bill to rule inadmissible certain types of evidence, so the tribunal would not have been able to assess the evidence according to its own requirements and reach a decision independently of the FSA. Those glaring defects were indeed corrected by the Government in response to criticism from ourselves and others, and the present proposal is a considerable improvement.
<P>
In the debate on clause stand part we wish, with your permission, Mr O'Brien, to examine a little further the relationship between the tribunal and the enforcement committee as the Bill does not cover this in detail. It is a problem in itself because we can talk knowledgeably about the tribunal only if we know its exact relationship with the FSA's other procedures. If we do not know what the enforcement committee's role will be, we shall have a problem. I shall question the Minister about that.
<P>
I repeat that it is regrettable that the tribunal's draft rules of operation are not available because they are not yet ready for consultation. The FSA and the Treasury must have worked on them for many months. I do not know what the problem is, but obviously it would have been better to have examined the software, as it were, as well as the hardware in the clause.
<P>
Amendment No. 316 would defend the interests of the northern territories. It is perhaps a welcome fact that the Scots have a different legal system in some respects. They are proud of it and we ought to respect it. The head of the judiciary in Scotland is the Lord President of the Court of Session. It would be appropriate to consult him, together with the Council on Tribunals, about the rules under which the tribunal will operate. The Government, with their pretence that they are devolving powers to Scotland and Wales, ought to be aware of that, and be particularly alert to the fact that the Scots should be formally consulted about such matters as rules of the tribunal. Our amendment would provide for that.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I support what my right hon. Friend said about the importance of consultation with the Lord President of the Court of Session. The Scottish and English systems are substantially different. The Lord President has considerable experience and deep understanding of our parliamentary system as he was part of it when he was Lord Advocate, and is a Member of the House of Lords. But the constitutional reason, as my right hon. Friend said, is that England and Scotland have had different judicial systems since time immemorial. Of course, those judicial systems are not different throughout and the system will be broadly the same in relation to financial services. The supervision of those systems is not the same, however, and the fundamental bases of English and Scottish law are substantially different in many areas and that should be recognised. I hope that the amendment will be accepted.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): May I make a point that relates to what the Minister said, but could also come under clause stand part? She referred to the holding of hearings in private and indirectly to the fact that the clause covers territory covered by the ECHR. Does the Minister feel that the clause should be broadened in relation to the rules for public and private hearings, where the Lord Chancellor is empowered to do what he wishes, to require him to comply with article 6 of the ECHR?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson: Let me turn first to the points made by the right hon. Member for Wells </B>(Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) and his claim that in our original proposal the tribunal lacks independence. Chapter 11(4) on page 36 of the consultation document published in July 1998 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The independence of the tribunal is to be guaranteed by making it entirely separate from the FSA, run as part of the Court Service by the Lord Chancellor's Department, as the banking, building societies and friendly societies tribunals are at present.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was a clear statement of its independence. We have always intended that it would be run under the auspices of the Lord Chancellor's Department although I agree with the right hon. Gentleman on one point: we have made a number of important improvements in the light of consultation responses and points made by the Joint Committee.
<P>
I can accept that it would have been helpful if copies of the draft rules had been ready to inform the discussion. However, the rules are inevitably quite technical and the Lord Chancellor's Department should have the opportunity to get the details right before releasing a draft. I have therefore given the Committee a brief outline of the expected content of the rules and I have also undertaken to send the Committee a working draft for perusal and comment. That will probably be in December, at the same time as it goes to the Council on Tribunals.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) asked about compliance. We believe that the tribunal is fully compliant with the ECHR. I was mystified by the point he was making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My point was not that it was not compliant and, as it is drafted, it is perfectly capable of being compliant, but that when the Lord Chancellor exercises his discretion, for example to hold meetings in private, he falls under the requirements relating to article 6. He could handle that in a way that was not compliant. I am sure that the Government would want him to handle it in a way that was compliant but it is an area in which he could fall foul.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The Lord Chancellor must exercise his functions in keeping with the ECHR. Indeed, the suggestion that he would not act in accordance with the convention is extraordinary. The Government have given the ECHR proper effect under UK law. All public authorities, including the tribunal, will be bound by it in every regard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Just to come back to the hon. Lady on one or two points, it was, of course, the Government's intention from the start to make the tribunal independent, but they did not deliver on that. One of our key criticisms of the Bill is the gap between intention and deliveryóbetween what the Government say and what is in the Bill. We are right to be vigilant and to want to ensure that the tribunal is properly independent.
<P>
The Government clarified their thinking a year and a half ago, which makes it even odder that the draft rules are still unavailable for consultation. Over the months, the Government clarified their thinking and ended up with more satisfactory provisions, but the hon. Lady should be more humble about the initial proposals, which were describedónot by myself, but by many commentatorsóas a dangerous shambles. If they had been found to be incompatible with the European convention on human rights, the Bill would have been thrown out and there would have been no proper regulation of the City.
<P>
Improvements have been made, but we must get back to first principles to ensure that we achieve a clear distinction between the investigating function of the FSA, its prosecuting function and its ability to levy fines. Otherwise, it will be judge, jury and executioner, as was first alleged. That problem has been responded to partly, but not sufficiently.
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman </B>(Erewash): Does the right hon. Gentleman not accept that the Government's attitude has been evolutionary and that they have demonstrated enormous good will to ensure that the scrutiny process is right? That is what we all want.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Of course, but if the hon. Lady were to revisit the initial announcement of the Billóthe intention to legislateówithin months of the general election, she would not have expected then that two years later the Bill would still be being amended, radically, in some places. We have just dealt with the market abuse provisions, which were entirely rewritten by the Government. The Government raised expectations that they knew what they wanted to do as a matter of urgency, yet they have not, frankly, delivered on them.
<P>
Outside criticism has been listened to in some respects, but uncertainties have been created and fears aroused. Living under a cloud is not good for the markets. In some respects, the FSA will have intolerably discretionary powers, which could be unjust and might conflict with international convention. That is not an entirely happy story. It is easy to say now that it was always known that the initial draft would be incomplete and inadequate, but that was not what the Government told us when they first announced the Bill in a blaze of publicity.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Perhaps you could clarify, Mr. O'Brien, whether the Opposition moved amendment No. 316, to which I want to respond. Before I do so, I also want to respond to the right hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If the Minister wishes to reply, I suggest that she does so now.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Brien. I hope that humility comes to me when it is appropriate, but it is inappropriate now. The right hon. Gentleman gave some grudging support for the many responses that we made to the various consultation exercises on the Bill and to the work of the Joint Committee. The processes of the House and the new draft Bill procedure will be pointless if we do not respond to them, and amend and improve legislation. The right hon. Gentleman's comments are entirely out of place and suggest that the only way in which legislation should be drafted is to get it entirely right before it is put before anyone, in which case there would be no point in Committees such as this.
<P>
The Opposition have argued that we have been inflexible and have not responded to their arguments, so when we respond not only to their arguments, but principally to arguments made by others and the Joint Committee, of which the hon. Gentleman was a member, I think that they should be a little less grudging in their welcomeó
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> More gracious.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes, as my hon. Friend says, more gracious.
<P>
I also agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash (Liz Blackman).
<P>
The Government reject amendment No. 316 and I ask my hon. Friends to bear that in mind.
<P>
Clause 107 could, but does not, list the many persons and bodies, other than the Council on Tribunals, which it will be only right and proper for the Lord Chancellor to consult. That is deliberate. It is not sensible to list exhaustively in the Bill all those whom the Lord Chancellor should consult. Were there such a list, I would expect it to include the Lord President of the Court of Session, to whom appeals on Scottish cases will be made. It will be equally important for the Lord Chancellor to consult the Lord Advocate, who represents the Scottish Executive, the Law Societies of England and Wales, of Northern Ireland and of Scotland, the Bar Council and many more.
<P>
<B>Ms Sandra Osborne </B>(Ayr): I was pleased to hear my hon. Friend's comments. Having spoken to the Law Society of Scotland, I am aware that it is concerned not so much that the Lord President of the Court of Session should be specified in the Bill, but that he should be consulted on matters such as who will be Scotland's representative on the tribunal and so on.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for her support. It highlights that it is not desirable to have an exhaustive list, nor is it desirable to specify some consultees and not others. The Opposition's amendment illustrates that if the Lord Chancellor is required to consult X but is not required to consult Y, the inference may be drawn that only X needs to be consulted or that less weight should be given to Y's views.
<P>
We readily accept the argument advanced by the right hon. Member for Wells that the rules must reflect the separate legal system north of the border. The Government are well aware of that as we have many hon. Members representing Scotland.
<P>
I assure the Committee that the Lord Chancellor's Department has kept in close touch with the Scottish Executive on its plans and I offer the right hon. Gentleman a further firm assurance that the Lord President will be consulted at the appropriate stage, as will the Lord Advocate, the Law Society of Scotland and others with an interest in the tribunal arrangements in Scotland. With that firm assurance, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends will not press their amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I would like to return to the matter of the enforcement committee. The Minister made much of her acceptance of the recommendations of the Joint Committee, of which I and my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) were members. Perhaps she will accept the recommendation that the details of the enforcement committee should be included in the Bill. That is a reasonable request, not only because it was made by an authoritative, all-party committee but because, if we are to have a tribunal with assigned powers, it is sensible for those powers to be defined in relation to other disciplinary committeesóchiefly the enforcement committeeóthrough which the FSA may operate. It would be unwise for the matter to be left entirely to the discretion of the FSA.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am aware that, later in the Bill, we shall touch on the FSA's proceedings and how it should order its internal affairs. However, to my knowledge the FSA will not be required to set up an enforcement committee to operate in a particular way in relation to the tribunal. Given the criticisms that were made about the appeal mechanism, it is important that we get right not merely the tribunal, but the enforcement committee. The Economic Secretary said that it will be something of a hybrid of different models, resembling both an administrative committee and a judicial committee. The FSA has consulted on the matter, and it would be helpful if she could tell us the result of that consultation and how the enforcement committee relates to the clause.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> It is important that the FSA's procedures are fair and transparent. Clause 340 will require the FSA to abide by procedures that it will publish and on which it will be consulted. Those procedures must achieve an appropriate degree of separation between those who take enforcement decisions and those responsible for preparing the case for enforcement. The provision is a clear response to the concern expressed by the Joint Committee. The Bill will also enshrine basic rights to make representations and see the evidence. However, the FSA's own procedures must not be too rigid: they should be relatively quick and informal. As the right hon. Gentleman recognised, it is not in anyone's interest to turn the FSA's internal processes into an additional tribunal. Clause 340 will impose certain requirements on the FSA with regard to operation of its internal enforcement procedures, which reflect discussions in Joint Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): Let me back up the comments made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells. The Economic Secretary rightlyóand perhaps with characteristic selectivityóquoted the Joint Committee's report when she described her predecessor's proposals as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an elegant hybrid which we find attractive.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the report has a subsequent section on the enforcement committee that includes, on pages 52 and 53, six specific recommendations, none of which have been properly taken on board in the revised clauses. It is essential that segregated roles are properly delineated for the enforcement committee, the investigation processes and the tribunal, but they are not. Various legal experts who made submissions on the matter referred frequently to Chinese walls, and I remain unclear as to how thick and sturdy the walls of the FSA's structure will be.
<P>
I should like briefly to mention two other subjects during this clause stand part debate, because they will not necessarily arise elsewhere. If the tribunal is to form part of the legal process, given that its resources will come from public funds, what guarantees will be there be that it will be properly resourced? As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells rightly pointed out, the tribunal was not envisaged in the draft Bill, and that was a serious flaw. The Government have now recognised that it is an important component of the checks and balances of the disciplinary procedures process. However, it will be no good unless it is properly resourced and financed and its work is not impinged upon by budgetary shortages in the Lord Chancellor's Department. Will the Economic Secretary tell the Committee about any potential restrictions to the tribunal's funding?
<P>
The Economic Secretary remarked that humility was perhaps inappropriate. While I do not dispute that, it is difficult for members of the Committee, after almost 18 months, to have to deal with constantly changing proposals in detailed, legal parts of the Bill. Earlier today, I read comments by Howard Davies in the Financial Times to the effect that amendments have been tabled for this morning's sitting of the Committee that are intended to impose restrictions on the tribunal being able to award large costs against victims who have appealed to it. That is an important point, and I hope that when we reach schedule 11 the Minister will deal with it in more detail. Many people have expressed concern that independent financial advisers and individuals working in the financial services industry will not be able properly to pursue the appeals procedure for fear that they may have large costs awarded against them. It is not good enough for us to discover for the first time from this morning's Financial Times that the Government are considering restrictions on the tribunal, because that affects the entire character of what we are discussing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. As he pointed out, we have before us a Bill that is constantly changing. Indeed, members of the Joint Committee were also unhappy about that, and went as far as they could in their criticism by stating in their report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This report represents a snap shot at a moving target.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, whenever they tried to work out what the Government's proposals were, those proposals had changed. The report stated that the situation was so bad that the Committee had been prevented from adequately examining many of the issues involved. A form of disclaimer pointed out that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Time constraints meant that we were unable to take views from many witnesses on the FSA's latest proposals.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We have seen some of the snapshots and trailers; we now want something close to the full movie, but we are still woefully short of that. It is unhelpful to the work of the Committee for us to have to scrutinise detailed and complicated parts of the Bill when our entire approach has to depend on a report in the Financial Times which we read only an hour or so before the sitting. That certainly gives the Economic Secretary an extra reason to provide rather more detail when we reach schedule 11.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I want to follow what my hon. Friend has been saying by pointing out that page 50 of volume I of the report and proceedings of the Joint Committee refers to recommendations by no less a person than Lord Archer of Sandwell about the distinction between the FSA's supervisory and enforcement staff. As the Committee knows, Lord Archer is the chairman of the Council on Tribunals, a former Solicitor-General, andóalthough it is not particularly relevantóa former and distinguished Labour Member of Parliament and Labour Member of the House of Lords. He suggested the Chinese wall between the supervisory and enforcement functions, and, although I may have missed something that the Economic Secretary said, it is not clear whether the Government have conceded anything in the light of those recommendations. All that I picked up on in her speech was that the Government wanted flexibility. I do not disagree that an over-rigid system would be undesirable, but will there be any independent supervision of the enforcement aspects? I am not suggesting that we recreate a Crown Prosecution Service-type system within the FSAóthat would be going too faróbut what is being proposed in terms of Chinese walls?
<P>
The example that worries me relates not to the FSA but to the Inland Revenue, which is another Treasuryódominated body. I have had persistent dealingsówith which I shall have to trouble the House in the coming weeksówith the Treasury in relation to the land settlement association. In dealing with the perfectly decent officials who handle that matter, I have found that if the Revenue's offerófor instance, to treat 50 per cent of certain payments as non-tax-deductibleóis unacceptable, the offer will be removed and the unfortunate citizens concerned will have to go through the long, expensive and complex tribunal procedure. The officials therefore wield enormous power, and the same will apply in relation to the FSA. They cannot be prevented from wielding that enormous poweróI am not seeking to do soóbut there must be independent supervision to ensure that it is not abused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): The right hon. and learned Gentleman refers to the issue that most exercised the Joint Committee in dealing with the enforcement questionóthat the enforcement aspect should be separate from the investigatory aspect. That point is amply covered by clause 340(2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``That procedure must be designed to secure, among other things, that the decision which gives rise to the obligation to give a warning notice or decision notice is taken by a person not directly involved in establishing the evidence on which that decision is based.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That appears to satisfy the Joint Committee's conclusion.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I have just glanced at clause 340(2), which is helpful. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for pointing that out. If the Economic Secretary will confirm that the structure will include someone in a senior position who will consider matters independently and who will be answerable for showing that fair systems are being operated, Opposition Members will be comforted. It is an important matter, as Lord Archer of Sandwell highlighted, and clarification from the Economic Secretary would be welcome.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Following a point that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, do the Government accept all six of the recommendations that are contained in paragraph 201 of the Joint Committee report? It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Bill should be amended to require the following: .Å.Å. The FSA should set up an Enforcement Committee''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is clear that that will be set up. The second recommendation states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Chairman of the Enforcement Committee should have appropriate legal qualifications.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Yes, we agree. The third states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The appointment of the Chairman of the Enforcement Committee by the FSA should be subject to approval by the Lord Chancellor.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In view of the Opposition amendment relating to Scotland, our response appears to be yes.
<P>
The Joint Committee has three further recommendations, the first of which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Enforcement Committee should give the defendant the opportunity of making oral representations before issuing a decision notice.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Economic Secretary confirm that that will definitely be the case? The next recommendation states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Enforcement Committee should reach decisions by majority of all the members involved, rather than by the Chairman's decision alone.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will she confirm that that will be the case? The final recommendation states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In the interests of public confidence, all final decisions ... should be made public, save in exceptional circumstances.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is there a risk that that will clash with the duty in the European convention on human rights to make public and to publish all decisions? I recognise that that raises issues that we shall debate when we come to schedule 11, but it would be helpful if the Economic Secretary would give an assurance that the Joint Committee's suggestions will be accepted in full by the Government.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I shall endeavour to respond to the points that have been made, but I should point out that I began this morning by remarking on the degree to which the new arrangements will be completely independent. The tribunal will replace the current fragmented provisional review proceduresóit will be fully independent, its members will be appointed by the Lord Chancellor and its administration will be run as part of the Court Service. Some Committee members had not taken their place in Committee when I made those remarks, but I repeat them for the benefit of those who missed them earlier.
<P>
Our approach involves a single regulatoróthe FSAówhich will rightly have a range of powers and responsibilities that are aimed at ensuring effective but proportionate regulation, and a single tribunal, which will have a broad degree of discretion and the powers to overturn and correct the FSA's regulatory decisions, as necessary. It will replace the existing fragmented arrangements for the review of regulatory decisions, which will be a massive improvement.
<P>
In June 1999, the Government published their response to the Joint Committee~s recommendations. Page 15 of that document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``As the reference in the Committee's recommendation to equivalent mechanisms rightly recognises, this is also an area where future practice could evolve. We therefore propose to meet the Committee's concern by amending the Bill to add clause 340(2) which will require the FSA to take account of the need for appropriate separation, by ensuring that a relevant decision is taken by a person not directly involved in establishing the evidence on which that decision is based.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Opposition members rightly raised that matteróthey want to ensure that there will be proper separation. However, I believe that such a separation is fully established in the Bill. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham discussed the tribunal's resourcing. That matter is dealt with in the comprehensive spending review settlement. The Lord Chancellor is confident that he has adequate resources for what is expected to be, on the scale of the courts and tribunals that are administered by his Department, a reasonably small operation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Does not the Minister realise that what she has just read out is typical Treasury speak? In other words, the resources that are available to the tribunal will be entirely dependent on whether the Chief Secretary decides that it should have the money. That is no way to set up and resource the tribunal. I hope that the Minister can do better than that before the end of this debate.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Frankly, the hon. Gentleman needs some more sleep; I am sorry that he and other hon. Members did not have enough.
<P>
We estimate that between 30 and 50 cases a year may come before the tribunal, but obviously, as this is a new jurisdiction we cannot yet be certain of the precise numbers.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Since the helpful intervention of the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford, I have been focusing on clause 340(2), which says that the procedure must be designed to secure that the decision giving rise to the warning notice or decision notice is taken by someone
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``not directly involved in establishing the evidence on which that decision is based.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is it simply that the decision will be taken by the equivalent of the custody sergeant as opposed to the officer on the case, or will those 30 to 50 cases a year go to someone senior and in an independent position? The former is not good enough, but if the latter were the case, I would be comforted.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I need some guidance from you, Mr. O'Brien, on whether we are straying into the provisions of schedule 11. Several amendments to that schedule have been tabled and I propose to deal with it when you direct us so to do.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hope that we will keep to clause 107 and come to schedule 11 in the near future.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
A number of Opposition referred to Chinese walls. The point is not how thick they are, but that they exist. Clause 340(2) specifically provides for a separation within the FSA of the investigation and enforcement procedures, which is, as I said, consistent with the recommendation of the Joint Committee that there should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an Enforcement Committee, or some equivalent mechanism to separate the functions of investigation and enforcement.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Obviously, the tribunal will be run as part of the Court Service and as such will be entirely independent of the FSA.
<P>
On concerns about the enforcement committee being insufficiently independent, the FSA's arrangements are a matter for it, subject to its meeting the strict statutory requirement to separate enforcement and investigation. I understand, however, that the FSA is proposing that the committee chairman should be appointed by the board and not by an FSA employee.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Perhaps the Minister can help me. Are the Committee chairmen going to be full time or, as would seem more likely, are they to come from a panel of part timers?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I would prefer to come back to the right hon. and learned Gentleman on that in a little while; perhaps it would be simplest to respond in writing.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I hope that a little while can be a few minutes, because the answer is material to the next debate.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We will get to the next debate in due course, as we always do.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said that he had first heard of the restriction on cost when he read this morning's Financial Times. Rather than reading the Financial Times in the bath, perhaps he should have been reading amendments Nos. 421 and 422, which are relevant, make exactly that point and are to be found on the amendment paper.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> We are talking about a matter of minutes. The amendment paper was not available until this morning. I gather that the amendments that came through the postówhich I have only just seen this morningówere for comment, but that is barely sufficient time to read them, let alone to research and consult on them.
<P>
Despite the hon. Lady's slightly sarcastic comments, I was not reading the Financial Times in my bath this morning; I was using my time constructively and reading the Council on Tribunals submission, which was made some time ago. The point is that we have had so little time. Just to say that what was in the Financial Times this morning is not relevant is not good enough. If restrictions are to be put on the tribunal in terms of awarding costs, it completely changes the character of what we are discussing. It would be better if the hon. Lady attempted to answer those questions and concerns, rather than suggesting that we should read other documents which were available half an hour earlier in the Financial Times.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I beg to differ from the hon. Gentleman. The amendments to which I referred were tabled last Friday. I am sure that I do not need to tell hon. Members that they would have been available downstairs in the blue sheets of the Order Paper fairly soon after that. They would certainly have been available from Monday. The hon. Gentleman should use the information that is available through the usual channels.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I do not doubt that the amendments were available in the blue sheets last Friday, but the commentary on the Government's thinking behind the amendments was not available until last night. I gather also that the Treasury held a press conference yesterday dealing with the issue of costs awarded by the tribunal, which was the basis of today's report in the Financial Times. That is what we were told by journalists. Although the actual amendments may have been available, the comments and the commentary were not, and the Government's explanations have been far from adequate.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I assure hon. Members that there was no press conference; I would have noticed if I had been there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I feel that I have had no change out of the Economic Secretary this morning, but I will have another go.
<P>
I have now had a chance to reread page 15 of the June report, which gives the Treasury's response to the Joint Committee report. When I quoted paragraph 201, I wanted to know whether there had been any advance in the Government's thinking on that issue since June. It is now November, and what I am hoping forórather than the general form of words that was read into the record again and which does not commit the Government to muchóis clarity on the six points that I went through. I think that we can more or less agree that three and a half of them are covered, but two and a half are not. I should be grateful for a response to that. It would be somewhat perplexing if the Government did not have some further thoughts to report on top of those that they had in June.
<P>
On the funding issue and the provision of adequate resources, now that the Minister has had a chance to reflectóand has perhaps had another note from her officials to consideróI hope that the answer that the City will hear is not that the tribunal's resources will be entirely dependent on the vagaries of the comprehensive spending review. Clearly, that is not an adequate way of starting off the tribunal's resourcing. I hope that the Minister will be able to say something more reassuring to the City than that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Frankly, the Government have got into a bit of a muddle on the policy issues and the procedures by which they deal with them. The Economic Secretary is fond of citing the Joint Committee with approval, saying that it made an important contribution and that the result of its deliberations should normally be accepted. It reported in April on the matters we are discussing, suggesting some fairly specific requirements for the composition and powers of the enforcement committee. That is relevant to the clause, because the whole enforcement and appeal system hangs together as a unit. We cannot approve the composition and powers of the tribunal without having regard to how decisions will be reached earlier and how they can be appealed. Probably the most important of the Joint Committee's specific requirements is that the committee's functions should be written into the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that, given the six points on pages 52 and 53 of the April report to which he has just referred, the Economic Secretary's inability to give a prompt and clear answer to my question whether there will be a serious stand back before an enforcement decision is taken, or whether the relationship will be such as that between an officer in charge of a case and a custody sergeant, shows a serious lack of Government thinking on that important issue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I entirely agree with my right hon. and learned Friend's observation. The effort simply to sweep the whole thing into clause 340(2) is somewhat of an insult. The Joint Committee asked some specific questions and suggested that the requirements should be enacted in primary legislation. All we have in the later clause is a requirement that there should be some rather unspecified separation between the investigative and the decision-making functions. That does not begin to measure up to the seriousness of the matter, or the specific suggestions of the Joint Committee. Given the tight time constraints under which the Joint Committee operated, it was unusual for it to spend so much time on an issue. It devoted five pages of its report to the matter, including the list of highly specific recommendations.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) asked a number of specific questions: how decisions will be takenówhether by majority of all the membersówhether decisions will be made public and whether there should be oral representation. The Government consulted months ago on all those questions. It is bizarre, in the light of the clear recommendations of the Joint Committee seven months ago and the fact that consultation has been undertaken on the matter, that the Economic Secretary cannot begin to answer any of our questions. That contrasts starkly with the speed with which the Government organised a press conference to give their version of some new Government amendments dealing with costs, before we had received any notes on clauses. That was an obvious discourtesy to the Committee, but beyond that it shows the selectivity with which the Government are dealing with those important points, which will intimately affect the outside world.
<P>
We are dealing with matters affecting people's livelihoods, as we have often remarked. Unlimited fines may be levied under the provisions. How the decisions are to be taken and by whom, how they may be appealed, whether they will be genuinely independent, whether they will be made public, whether representations may be made, whether the chairman will be appointed, and if so by whom, to whom he will be accountable and whether he can be removed are all vital questions. All that the Economic Secretary can say is ``We'll let you know.'' That is not good enough. It is not good enough that she is relying on a later clause that makes only the most tangential reference to the separation of powers. That is a highly unsatisfactory state of affairs, and if the Economic Secretary cannot give us some answers now, she ought to undertake to return to the issue in short order.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Economic Secretary must not be thin-skinned; we are not trying to hit her personally. What has worried me this morning is not the thought that the Government are malignóI think that they want to do the right thingóbut we have reached this stage after much effort. I was not a member of the Joint Committee, but months of work went into it. The Government remain ignorant on the issues; they do not know how to answer; they do not know what kind of structure will be set up, yet they are trying to push the matter through.
<P>
Fortunately, we are now in Committee, so Report, Third Reading and all the stages in the House of Lords remain. However, it is plain that the Government have not yet properly focused on this extremely important area, to which eminent peopleóthose within the financial services industry and such people as Lord Archeróhave given careful thought. I would not think the less of Ministers for saying that they would reflect on our debate and return to the matter. They would lose nothing by that, but it would highlight the fact that the business is unfinished and must be reconsidered. I sincerely hope that we shall receive that assurance, so that we can return to the matter on Report, if not before.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> First, I shall address the point about funding for the tribunal. As I said earlier, provision has already been made for the tribunal in the current comprehensive spending review settlement. I cannot see the problem with that. Is the hon. Member for Chichester proposing that the service should be outside public spending control?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I made my remarks because the Economic Secretary initially said that the level of funding would be subject to the comprehensive spending review, as if no decision had been taken about it. She now appears to be saying that funds are earmarked in the existing budget, and that there will be some flexibility should more be required. If she is giving us that assurance, rather than the Treasury speak that she was fed, if I may say so, when she first responded, we and the City will be relieved to hear it.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall simply read out what I said before-what the hon. Gentleman so wrongly and derogatorily refers to as Treasury-speak. I said that the cost of the tribunal is included within the comprehensive spending review settlement. That is exactly what I said originally.
<P>
In July the FSA published its response to consultation on its enforcement procedures. That response took full account of the Joint Committee's recommendations, and if Committee members have not yet seen that, I will obtain copies for them.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> In two sentences, what is the answer to my question about the level of decision? Is it to be found in that document?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am just coming to the point made by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir Nicholas Lyell). As I said, the FSA proposes that the chairman of the enforcement committee should be not an FSA employee but someone from outside. He or she will be appointed by the board itselfódemonstrating the importance that it attaches to the post. The policy is that details of the arrangements should not be in primary legislation, for reasons that I explained earlier.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 107, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 11</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Financial Services and Markets Tribunal</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 408, in page 216, line 29, at end insertó
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The Lord Chancellor may appoint one of the members of the panel of chairmen to be Deputy President.
<P>
( ) The Deputy President is to have such functions in relation to the Tribunal as the President may assign to him'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following Government amendments: Nos. 409 to 415.
<P>
No. 423.
<P>
Nos. 425 to 427.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> This is a large group of amendments, which, for the purposes of my explanation, I shall break up into slightly smaller sections.
<P>
It may be helpful if I explain first that schedule 11 sets out several detailed requirements as regards the tribunal's constitution and operation. The Lord Chancellor must appoint two panels from which tribunal members can be drawnóthe panel of chairmen and the lay panel. The panels will form separate pools of people who can be nominated to serve as members of the tribunal when it sits to hear individual cases.
<P>
A person qualifies to be considered for membership of panel of chairmen if he has legal qualifications as specified under paragraph 3(2). The panel must include at least one member who is qualified in Scottish law. The Lord Chancellor will also appoint the members who are not lawyers and will ensure that there is a balance of relevant expertise and standing. In addition, the tribunal can appoint experts under paragraph 6(4) to assist tribunal members where the matter before them involves a question of fact of special difficulty.
<P>
The Lord Chancellor must also appoint a member of the panel of chairmen as the tribunal's president, with responsibility to preside over its functions under the Bill. The president will be responsible for constituting a tribunal from members of the panels to hear each case. He will be responsible for deciding how many people make up the tribunal in each case. At least one member of the tribunal must be drawn from the panel of chairmen.
<P>
Amendment No. 408 introduces a power for the Lord Chancellor to appoint a deputy president. That power will be exercised only if the tribunal's work load warrants it. That is in line with the practice of other tribunals. For example, the Immigration and Asylum Bill provides for the appointment of a deputy president for the Immigration Appeals Tribunal. Amendments Nos. 409 to 412 are consequential on amendment No. 408.
<P>
The president will be responsible for assigning functions to any deputy president. The deputy president will be able to discharge any of the president's functions where he is absent or otherwise unable to act. The deputy president may not be appointed if the work load does not warrant it. The Bill will, therefore, continue to permit responsibility for filling in for the president to be delegated to another member of the panel of chairmen who is nominated by the Lord Chancellor under paragraph 2(5). That is to ensure that the tribunal can be run efficiently and effectively, even if its work load proves greater than was initially expected. That is in everyone's interests; a slow and costly tribunal obviously benefits no one.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 413, 414, 425 and 427 relate to the remuneration and retirement provisions for the president, deputy president and other members of the panels. The purpose of the amendments is twofold. First, they bring the president and deputy president within the pension arrangements that are set out in part I of the Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993. Secondly, they make members of the lay panel and the panel of chairmen subject to the provisions of sections 26 and 27 in part II of the 1993 Act, which relate to judicial retirement ages. Members of the panels will, therefore, be subject to the normal retirement age of 70, with the possibility of annual extensions up to 75.
<P>
Amendment No. 425 to schedule 16 deals with consequential amendments that need to be made to other pieces of legislation as a result of the Bill. It provides for the necessary changes to the Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993.
<P>
Amendment No. 413 removes paragraph 5(1) to avoid duplicating provision for the president's pension. Amendment No. 414 provides for an expanded sub-paragraph (2), which will include references to the president's remuneration and allowances previously covered in sub-paragraph (1).
<P>
Amendment No. 427 relates to schedule 17, and provides for the repeal of that part of the Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993 which refers to the retirement provisions for members of the financial services tribunal and which, obviously, will no longer be necessary.
<P>
Hon. Members may wonder why we provide for the president to receive a judicial pension, but not other members of the panels. Pension requirements under part I of the 1993 Act apply only to persons engaged on a salaried basis, which means the president and deputy presidentówhen there is oneónot other members of the panels.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Will the Minister confirm that the president and deputy president are full-time positions. Are other members of the chairman's panel part time?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The president and deputy president are full time. I shall confirm the nature of the other appointments in a moment.
<P>
Amendment No. 415 inserts into the schedule a new paragraph which concerns administrative staff for the tribunal. The amendment clarifies that the Lord Chancellor may appoint the necessary administrative staff and provide for their remuneration and payment of expenses.
<P>
I apologise to hon. Members for what has necessarily been a rather long explanation. However, in conclusion, amendments Nos. 423 and 426 concern the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 and the Northern Ireland Assembly Disqualification Act 1975. Amendment No. 423 is another consequential amendment to schedule 16, providing for the 1975 Acts to be changed so that remunerated members of the new tribunal are disqualified from office of both bodies.
<P>
Amendment No. 426 repeals provisions in those Acts disqualifying members of the financial services tribunal from office. Those provisions will obviously become obsolete. It is important that tribunal members are disqualified in that way because they will be judicial office holders. To preserve the separation of powers, they must not hold legislative office.
<P>
As I said, there are rather a lot of Government amendments to the schedule. However, they will ensure that provisions concerning the new tribunal are fully aligned with those relating to existing tribunals run by the court service.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister just said that it is important that members of the tribunals are disqualified from being Members of the House of Commons because they are judicial office holders. Will she explain, in two or three sentences, why that is so?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am sorry, but I was tryingóunsuccessfullyóto do two things at once. Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman repeat his question?
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Why is it important that deputy chairmen or part-time chairmen of panels should not be Members of the House of Commons or the House of Lords?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have answered that. The issue is preserving the separation of powers between judicial office holders and legislative office holders.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Why is that important?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We think that it is. If the right hon. and learned Gentleman wants to argue about a fundamental matter, the Committee is not the best forum for doing so. We, however, believe that such powers should be separate.
<P>
Earlier, the right hon. and learned Gentleman asked about members of the chairman's panel. Whether people are part time or full time may vary, with the exception of the president. They will be paid for the time for which they sit on the panel.
<P>
Finally, the separation of powers is normal practice for the tribunals and that is why we are ensuring that such separation is maintained in the provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We all agree that amendments Nos. 421 and 422 will occupy most of our time in debating schedule 11. The first group of Government amendments are essentially administrative. I would be grateful if the Minister could reply to some questions: if she cannot supply specific answers, I hope that she can provide some indicative ones.
<P>
My first question is about the chairmen's and the lay panels. The schedule as drafted and the amendments fail to provide a clear picture of the sort of people whom the Government want to sit on those panels. Will the chairmen's panel be composed entirely of lawyers; and will the lay panel be composed of industry practitioners or of some weighting of consumers and practitioners?
<P>
When the various panels are set up, minimum requirements are stipulated as to which elements should be represented. The principle is fine, but again the Government's intentions about the weightings of the different elements appropriate for the different matters brought before the tribunal are unclear. Will the Minister tell us more about how the two panels should operate and the sort of people who should sit on them?
<P>
My second question is about the charging of various arrangements. Will the charge go straight to the Exchequer or will it be funded from costs recovered from membership payments? Will the Government estimate how much the tribunal arrangements will cost each year? It is obviously an additional cost to previous estimates of the overall costs of regulation.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I want to speak to amendment No. 423, which deals with the disqualification of members of the legislature from being chairmen or part-time chairmen of panels. As a recorder, I declare an interest, because I hold judicial and executive functions at the same time. I do not know whether I have an ambition to become an FSA panel chairman at some time, but I want to raise a serious and fundamental point, intending no personal criticism of the Minister. She may not be able to respond immediately today, but I want to put some important points on the record.
<P>
I am not familiar with the number of tribunals to which the disqualification will apply. I do not expect the Minister to pluck the answer out of the airóunless an extraordinarily knowledgeable person is sat behind heróbut I would be grateful for a prompt written answer supplying a list of the tribunals to which the disqualification will apply. It certainly does not apply to all judicial positions.
<P>
Underlying the provisions is the notion that a member of the legislature cannot hold judicial office. As drafted, it is unclear whether the disqualification applies to the legislature as a whole or only to the House of Commons. I see no reason in principle for any distinction between the two. If there is any justification for this measureóin my opinion, none whateveróit lies in the purest application of Montesquieu's principle of the separation of the powers. That is likely to have come from Strasbourg.
<P>
It is important for the Government to reflect on this matter. I know that the Lord Chancellor is reflecting on it: he is in the prime position in the frame on this matter of principleóthe ability to hold legislative, executive and judicial or quasi-judicial positions. However, we are not talking about executive positions. No Ministers would sit as a panel chairmanóI am not being fatuous or flippant; they would not have the time. No Ministers would apply to sit in a judicial position, although many Ministers have quasi-judicial functions. The Home Secretary rightly pointed out only yesterday, in the context of the inspector of prisons, his quasi-judicial functions in relation to the Bulger case. The Deputy Prime Minister holds important quasi judicial functions.
<P>
There is a long, extremely richóin the constitutional senseóand valuable tradition of people holding both judicial and legislative positions, which is an important and valuable part of our constitutional framework. I come back to this point, especially as regards the House of Lords: but also in relation to the House of Commons, because I sit four weeks, or 20 days, as a recorder, presiding over juries, which is an absolutely judicial function. This not only keeps my hand in, in a lifelong practice, it enables me to bring up-to-date, day-to-day knowledge of the actual workings of the court to my contributions as a member of the legislature. Many distinguished Members of the other place hold judicial office.
<P>
No issue of principle underlies that, unless it undercuts some fundamental aspects of our constitution which the Lord Chancellor, with my strong support, is attempting to defend. For a start, the Lord Chancellor holds an Executive post in the Government, a legislative post as a member of the Upper House and a judicialónot quasi judicialópost, and rightly continues to sit on cases in which he and the Government are not involved, and I hope that he will continue to do so.
<P>
The Law Lords are members of the legislature, and are the most senior members of the judiciary. There are administrative reasons for the serious discussion about whether the Law Lords should continue their current function, and there are questions about a Supreme Court. But we are not debating that today. Indeed, I would rightly be ruled out of order if I strayed into that.
<P>
The issue of principle over whether it is possible to be a member of the legislature and hold full-time or part-time judicial functions is completely undercut by the existence of the Law Lords, and by the long and distinguished tradition of Members of both House sitting as part-time recordersópart-time judicial figuresóin the Crown court. Probably every Law Officer in living memory has sat in that position. The right hon. Member and learned Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris), the former Attorney-General, who recently stood down, sat as a recorder for decades and brought to the House his huge knowledge of the criminal law, to the great advantage of our debates. I see great advantage to the legislature in a number of peopleóthey are more likely to be Members of the other place than of this Houseóperhaps sitting part-time on FSA tribunals, and bringing real specialist knowledge to them. It would enrich our constitution and our legislative process.
<P>
I was not trying to be unfair to the hon. Lady when I asked her what arguments there were against that. She repliedóand I accept and respect her answeróthat it simply a matter of the separation between judicial and legislative functions. I am sure that it springs from a misplaced anxiety in Strasbourg. I have great respect for the court at Strasbourg. Although I had a great many worries in practice and in detail, I supported in principle the enaction into our law of the ECHR. I have appeared at Strasbourg and I think that I understand the system reasonably well.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Our system, and I will go to my grave believing this, does not in spirit offend against the concept of separation of powers. Every system, to some extent, must meld the question of separation of powers. We do it by having a certain number of people, such as Law Lords and recorders, who hold public positions. When exercising their functions they know perfectly well which are legislative and which are judicial. They certainly do not allow any political or party political aspect to influence their judicial functions. They would rightly be criticised and expected to resign if they did.
<P>
France, in theory, has a more purist separation between judicial and legislative functions, but in practice the French have to mingle the two. I have detailed knowledge of the French judicial system because when I was Attorney-General and Solicitor-General I went regularly to France for detailed discussions with the French Ministry of Justice. One of the strengths of the interlinking of the legislative and judicial functions is that few people rise to senior judicial office in France without having spent substantial periods in the French Ministry of Justice. They have been junior, then middle-ranking and then senior civil servants in the equivalent of the Lord Chancellor's Department.
<P>
It could be argued that their behaviour on the bench and in the Ministry of Justice puts them under much greater pressure to conform to the wishes of the legislature and the Executive than our system where the distinctions apply only part time. In the case of the Law Lords, although they are full time, they are so senior that they are quite immovable. They have reached the earthly paradise at the top of their tree and it is difficult, apart from little matters of personal ambition, to bring any pressure upon them. That is a great strength of our system.
<P>
A person working his way up the French system is naturally under pressure to some extent. I have a high regard for the French judiciary: they put those matters aside. I mention that because we are talking about issues of principle. I want our rich United Kingdom system to remain unsullied. It is a grave mistake to prevent someone from being a part-time chairman of an FSA tribunal simply because he is a member of either House of the legislature.
<P>
I hope that the Government will think about this. It may be argued that the decision has already been taken because they are following the procedure for VAT tribunals and I confess that I did not know that. But every syllable of my argument applies just as fully and effectively to someone sitting as a chairman, deputy chairman or part-time chairman of a VAT tribunal as it does to this. I hope that my speech will be sent up to the Lord Chancellor's Department. I hope that there will be careful reflection. I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment. If not, I ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to signify the importance that we attach to this by voting against the schedule.

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I shall deal first with the points made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs. The chairman's panel will consist of persons with at least seven years' experience as practising lawyers. The criteria for the lay panel will have to be considered in more detail by the Lord Chancellor's Department. However, the most important factor is that the Bill requires a balance of relevant experience.
<P>
Because of the need to make progress, the Lord Chancellor has, exceptionally, agreed that legal members of the tribunal will be appointed from among the current part-timers and full-timers of the Special Commissioners of Income Tax and the VAT and duties tribunal. Legal members of the current financial services tribunal may also be appointed. Lay members may be appointed from among the current lay members of the VAT and duties tribunal, under the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, and the current financial services tribunal. The schedule requires the Lord Chancellor to appoint people to the lay panel who appear to him to be experienced or otherwise qualified to deal with the sorts of cases that the tribunal will consider.
<P>
I turn to the points that were raised by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire. I recognise his argument about the way in which people operate in our system, and appreciate the many examples that he cited. Although I do not propose to respond in detail now, I undertake to write to him about the matter. The right hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned the conveyance of his speech to the Lord Chancellor's Department. Representatives from the Department are in the Room, so I am sure that that will be done forthwith.
<P>
The list of disqualifications appears in the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 and the comparable Northern Ireland legislation. Several existing provisions disqualify a range of members of tribunals, including those of the existing financial services tribunal that was created under the Financial Services Act 1986. This measure represents an attempt to take that forward. While I respect the points that the right hon. and learned Gentleman made, he should bear in mind that we must take account of the existing provisions. I shall write to him about the matter and endeavour to ensure that his points are borne in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I should like to add a quick addendum. Will the Economic Secretary's letter also clarify the position on membership of the tribunal in respect of Members of the House of Lords?
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I shall write to all members of the Committee about the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I have received representations from some of the people who sit on the tribunals and bodies that exist under the previous legislation as to whether their services will be required in the new tribunal. There is a need for people with significant legal experience in respect both of the tribunal and the ombudsman, given that much of the drafting of appeals will not be on strictly traditional legal terms. The FSA may be required to act more in the interests of consumers than in a legal sense.
<P>
Incidentally, the Economic Secretary did not respond to my question about an estimate of total costs.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for her comments. In the hope that she will reflect on these important issues, we shall act accordingly.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I thank hon. Members for their remarks. I believe that I answered the question about the cost of the tribunal, which we do not expect to be large.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In the interests of clarification, Sir Nicholas, you referred to amendment No. 423, which relates to schedule 16 and will not be voted on during the debate on the current group of amendments.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am looking to my right hon. and hon. Friends for guidance on that. My understanding is that the Economic Secretary will think further on the matter, and that there will be an opportunity to deal with it on Report. Therefore, I shall not invite my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. I am a little confused, because Government amendment No. 423, to which I believe we are referring, is listed under schedule 11 on the selection list.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> For the purpose of debate, the amendment has been taken with schedule 11 because it deals with tribunals and disqualification, but it will be possible to vote on it only when we consider schedule 16.
<P>
We are currently voting on certain groups of amendments that are relevant to this schedule. I hope that that has clarified the matter and there is no confusion. The Economic Secretary has said that she will look into the issue.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 417 and 418.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> As I have explained, the Lord Chancellor must appoint two panels from which tribunal members can be drawn: the panel of chairmen and the lay panel. Those panels will form separate pools of people who can be nominated to serve as members of the tribunal, which will sit to hear particular cases. The Lord Chancellor must also appoint a member of the panel of chairmen as president of the tribunal. He or she will preside over its functions under the Bill and constitute a tribunal from members of the panels to hear each case.
<P>
As we have discussed, we also propose that the Lord Chancellor will have the power to appoint a deputy president if the tribunal's work load so requires. In the president's absence, the deputy president will be able to fulfil the president's functions. The president will also delegate specified functions to the deputy president.
<P>
The president will decide how many and which panel members will be selected for the tribunal in each case. It is a requirement that there should be at least one member of the panel from the panel of chairmen. However, the president will not need to be involved in every case; indeed, involvement may be impossible if the president is away, or if a case arises at short notice.
<P>
Our amendments will ensure that the president can appoint as many additional members as necessary from either panel to hear particular cases under the standing arrangements. The standing arrangements require the president to set up and maintain arrangements for selecting tribunal members that could, for example, enable the task to be carried out administratively, in accordance with the arrangements. If it becomes apparent that a case raises particularly complex or ground-breaking legal issues, the arrangements might include the appointment of three legally qualified members of the panel of chairmen, or of additional members. Of course, the arrangements must ensure that, where possible, panel members are selected whose expertise is relevant to the case in question.
<P>
A modern tribunal needs flexibility, particularly given that the jurisdiction continues to evolve and its work load is unknown. The amendments meet that need and, on that basis, I encourage the Committee to support them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We will not press our amendment No. 165 because, in essence, amendment No. 373 covers the same territory, although it goes a slightly further. As we understand it, the requirement is simply that each tribunal should contain one member of the chairmen's panel; no mention is made of the lay panel. Amendment No. 373 would ensure that at least one lay panel member with relevant experience is appointed to a tribunal. That is doubtless the Government's, and the Lord Chancellor's, intention. However, because the number on the chairmen's panel is specified, it would also be appropriate to specify the number on the lay panel.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that he would not press amendment No. 165, which involves the requirement that there should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``at least one additional member of the lay panel''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
on each tribunal. That would create the legislative requirement that a tribunal must always consist of at least two people but, in practice, a minimum of three people would be needed to reach a majority decision. Amendment No. 373 goes further than that. It would require a minimum of three members and it specifies, as the hon. Gentleman said, that lay panel members who are selected for the tribunal should have directly relevant experience.
<P>
We have no difficulty with the proposition that the tribunal should normally consist of three members, with the idea that one of those people should normally be a member of the lay panel and, if possible, have relevant expertise. However, as I said, if a modern tribunal is to run efficiently and effectively, and with the minimum of procedural hold ups, it must be flexible. That is especially important when the exact nature and scale of its work load is unknown. The tribunal will need to be able to adapt and to respond to the demands that are placed on it, and the Bill makes provision for that. When interlocutory matters arise and decisions need to be taken before the main hearing of a case about matters of evidence and procedure, it may be appropriate for a single member of the chairman's panel to rule on the matter. In relatively straightforward cases, it may be in the interests of the referring party to have the case heard by one of the chairmen sitting on his or her own. Such arrangements are not uncommon in the operation of other tribunals.
<P>
I could give further reasons why we are not happy with amendment No. 373, but the hon. Gentleman has probably grasped the gist of my objections

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The Government amendments will make further improvements to schedule 11, and they will ensure that the tribunal operates efficiently and effectively. They also make some changes to clause 108óthey will affect the first-instance nature of the tribunal and reduce the Treasury's involvement in the tribunal's arrangements.
<P>
As I said in my opening remarks, the tribunal will be a first-instance tribunal, and it will be run as part of the Court Service. That is an important part of our overall regulatory scheme.
<P>
I shall begin with schedule 11. By requiring the tribunal to sit at such times and in such place or places as the Lord Chancellor may direct, part of the purpose of amendment No. 419 is to ensure that the Lord Chancellor can make arrangements as necessary for the tribunal to sit in Scotland. The amendment will also ensure that the Lord Chancellor has the necessary control to fulfil his responsibilities for the tribunal's costs and for providing it with the necessary accommodation for it to sit.
<P>
The administration costs of the tribunal will be public expenditure, and I am sure that opposition Members agree with the need to ensure that Ministers have the power that they need to control the spending for which they are accountable to the House.
<P>
Amendment No. 420 will enable the president of the tribunal to give practical directions to the tribunal. That will enable the president to ensure the smooth running of tribunals that he is responsible for selecting, and it will ensure that the tribunal is consistent in its procedural approach. For example, the directions may cover matters such as when it might be appropriate to appoint an expert under paragraph 6 and the procedures to be followed in doing so. Practice directions would be made subject to the overriding provision of the procedure rules made by the Lord Chancellor under clause 107.
<P>
I turn to amendments Nos. 421 and 422, which take forward an issue in which the Joint Committee, chaired by Lord Burns, took a keen interestóthe circumstances in which a person before the tribunal might be liable for the costs of the other party. That has been a sensitive question. A number of people have suggested that the risk of having to meet the FSA's costs as well as their own could deter some people from referring cases when they genuinely believe that the FSA is wrong. It is in no one's interests to discourage the reasonable exercise of someone's right to refer a matter to the tribunal and the Joint Committee made two recommendations on that.
<P>
First, it recommended that the FSA should not be able to include its own costs in any financial penalty that it imposes and we have dealt with that. Paragraph 16(1) of schedule 1 prohibits the FSA from taking account of its own expenses in determining its policy for setting financial penalties. Under paragraph 16(2) the FSA must prepare, consult on and operate a scheme to apply the income from financial penalties for the benefit of authorised persons. The FSA has made it clear that it proposes to introduce a scheme for offsetting that income against fees.
<P>
The Joint Committee also asked the Government to consider restricting the tribunal's discretion to award costs under paragraph 10 of the schedule to cases in which a party has acted unreasonably, vexatiously or frivolously. We have considered that further and our initial reaction was set out in our response to the Joint Committee in June. We thought it proper that the tribunal, as a fully independent judicial body, should not have its discretion narrowed in that way. We also thought that the power to award costs would be a useful check on the FSA's exercise of its powers.
<P>
We have discussed on a number of occasions the fact that the FSA will be subject to the usual general duty to exercise its statutory powers reasonably. The threat of not only losing a case, but having to meeting the other party's costs is a useful practical incentive for the FSA to be sure of its ground before exercising its powers. However, we have given further thought to that. The power in paragraph 10 is unusually broad for such a tribunal. We consulted further with the Lord Chancellor's Department and the Council on Tribunals and we concluded that it should be narrowed, as suggested by the Joint Committee. That is achieved by amendment No. 421.
<P>
Amendment No. 422 makes it explicit that one of the circumstances in which the tribunal may award costs is when it considers that the FSA's decision giving rise to the reference was unreasonable.
<P>
The amendments not only help to secure access to justice for those who might otherwise be dissuaded from pursuing a worthwhile case, but do so in a way that provides a real and practical consequence for any unreasonable exercise of its powers by the FSA. I hope that the Committee will support the amendments to schedule 11.
<P>
Clause 108 sets out the procedural framework for references to the tribunal. As we have discussed, the Bill does not set out every detail of the tribunal's procedures. Instead, it gives the Lord Chancellor powers under the previous clause to set procedural rules which are consistent with those applying to other tribunals for which he is responsible. It also allows him to keep those rules up to date in the light of changing best practice.
<P>
Our amendments apply the same principle to the period during which FSA decisions may be referred to the tribunal as applies to other procedural aspects, such as the calling of expert witnesses or arrangements for the selection of panel members to hear particular cases. Responsibility for setting a different period should rest with the Lord Chancellor. Clause 108 establishes a clear presumption in that respect, which is that the referral should normally be made within 28 days of the decision notice being issued. However, the Treasury has the power to set different periods. Twenty eight days may not be the correct period in all cases. It may be considered too short in cases in which the decision whether to refer is likely to be particularly complex; although less likely, experience may suggest that it is an overly long period in some cases and that a shorter period would enable the system to operate more effectively. It is not the Government's intention that different periods should be set, merely that the possibility should exist.
<P>
Under clause 108, the tribunal has the discretion to allow references after the expiry of whatever period is set for a particular type of case. The Government's amendments are intended to address two aspects of the working of the provisions. First, we have concluded that it would not be right for the Treasury to decide the most appropriate period for referring matters to the tribunal. Clearly, such a procedural matter should fall to the Lord Chancellor, who should be able to ensure that it remains aligned with good practice elsewhere in the Court Service, or to respond to a recommendation from the Council on Tribunals.
<P>
Government amendment No. 401 would remove the Treasury's order-making power and replace it with a provision that allows the period for referring decisions to be addressed by rules made under clause 107. That does not imply, however, that it is intended that a different period will be set. The firm presumption is that the normal 28-day period will apply for all types of case. The purpose of the power is merely to ensure that these arrangements are kept up to date and in line with good practice in other areas.
<P>
In keeping with that, Government amendment No. 402 proposes that the Lord Chancellor should be able to make rules under clause 107 about the tribunal's discretion to allow references after the normal period has expired. As in other aspects of the procedure, it seems only sensible that the Lord Chancellor should be able to make rules to guide the tribunal in the exercise of this discretion. Of course, such rules would need to leave the tribunal sufficient flexibility to meet the purpose of this discretion, which is to enable the tribunal to take account of unusual circumstances and to allow the interests of justice to be properly served.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 403 and 404 are intended to reinforce the first instance character of the tribunal. Currently, subsections (3)(c) and (d) refer to the grounds on which the FSA took its decision, and any action that it took in relation to the disputed decision, as matters that the tribunal may consider. Those subsections give the wrong flavour. The tribunal is not merely charged with reviewing the FSA's decision, which could be implied by the highlighting of matters in that way. Such matters are not central to the determination that the tribunal will be asked to make. The purpose of the tribunal is to consider the case afresh, taking account of all the relevant evidence and deciding the case on its merits.
<P>
Government amendment No. 404 therefore removes the references. By removing them, we are not saying that the tribunal should not consider such matters if they are relevant to the consideration of the case as a whole. However, they are not what the tribunal will be asked to consider. The tribunal will be required to consider the facts of the case and arrive at its own view on the rights and wrongs. In doing so, it is not constrained by what the FSA did or did not do, or did or did not consider relevant. If we remove subsections (3)(c) and (d), it no longer appears necessary for the Bill to say that the tribunal may consider evidence available to the FSA at the time that it took its decisions. The FSA will, in any case, be responsible for acquainting the tribunal with the grounds for reaching its decision, and the evidence that it offers in support of its case will, of course, be a matter for it.
<P>
All that is needed is to make it clear that the tribunal is not constrained by the information or the evidence available to the FSA when it reached its decision, which is what our amendments do. I hope that the Committee will support such worthwhile improvements to clause 108.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> First, I shall speak to amendments Nos. 323 and 374. Amendment No. 323 calls for the criminal standard of proof of beyond reasonable doubt to be included on the grounds that, in many serious matters, the tribunal will sit in a quasi-judicial capacity, which is analogous to criminal proceedings. We therefore feel that such a standard of proof is appropriate.
<P>
Amendment No. 374 would ensure that the evidence available to the FSA is made available to the person making reference to the tribunal, and corresponds to the rights in respect of warning notices under clause 338(5).
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are particularly pleased to note Government amendment No. 404 and, in principle, amendments Nos. 421 and 422. Let me tell the Minister that I was contacted and debriefed by a Financial Times journalist, who advised me how the Treasury had briefed him yesterday afternoon on its interpretation of those two amendments and asked for my comments on behalf of the Opposition. I had to tell him that I had not been briefed by the Treasury, so I was in no position to comment, but that we welcomed them in principle.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 421 and 422 go halfway towards addressing two crucial issuesóthe ability of individuals to defend themselves adequately in areas other than market abuse where legal support is provided, and whether the FSA should have total immunity. Amendment No. 422 would empower the tribunal to award costs against the FSA when it concluded that the FSA was entirely wrong to bring the case in the first place.
<P>
One of the key areas in which the existing regime has been open to widely justified attack within and without the industry relates to what happens when people are unable to defend themselves as a result of costs. The case of Morgan Grenfell Asset Management and Mr. Percy is well known and there are other important cases. Faced with the risk of having to pay the FSA's legal costs as well as their own, individuals have agreed to settle because they cannot afford to do otherwise.
<P>
In some contradictory developments, people pleaded guilty even though the FSA had accepted that individuals had been ethically sound in their conduct. In an appeal to the European Court, an individual associated with the Morgan Grenfell case was forced to plead guilty. He was charged with serious matters bracketed together with minor matters and there was a risk of being found guilty on the minor matter and having several hundred thousand pounds of Investment Management Regulatory Organisation legal expenses awarded against him, despite having been found innocent on the more serious matter.
<P>
The limiting of the ability to award costs certainly addresses one of the big issuesóthe impossible deterrent to the proper process of justice. However, it does not address the other issue, which remains hanging in the air. We have already heard from the Government a clear and helpful description of the point in relation to market abuse. I look forward to hearing whether the Government have further proposals to address the problemóthe need for legal aid on behalf of individuals who cannot afford to defend themselves adequately. As I said, the initial decision is correct and deals with at least half the problem.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Amendment No. 323 brings us back to an issue that we have already debated under parts V and VII. Although the amendment would not require the Lord Chancellor to make a rule requiring the tribunal to apply the criminal standard of proof, I assume that Opposition Members intend that it should be applied for all matters considered by the tribunal.
<P>
That would include decisions on authorisation to exercise the emergency powers under parts IV and XII as well as disciplinary action such as the imposition of penalties or making public statements on misconduct. Do the Opposition believe that the FSA should be required to be ``satisfied beyond reasonable doubt'' in all those cases, even where it is exercising its discretion to withhold authorisation because it is not satisfied that a person is fit and proper? If so, it would fundamentally change the basis of financial regulation in this country in an entirely irresponsible way. It would risk altering the character of the regulatory regime.
<P>
As the Minister for Small Business and E-ÑCommerce, my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt) and our expert witnesses, Sir Sydney Kentridge QC and Mr James Eadie explained to the Joint Committee, the disciplinary regime is essentially protective. The amendment suggests an intention to turn it from a protective regime for enforcing standards into a quasi-criminal, punitive regime. That does not seem consistent with the aim of having an effective and proportionate supervisory regime, providing effective protection for the consumer where necessary, but with a light touch where possible.
<P>
Once again I will set out our position on the standard of proof for the benefit of Opposition Members. It is not helpful to talk of standards of proof when referring to a body exercising a statutory discretion.
<P>
The real point here is that the FSA should exercise its powers rationally. When a case is referred to the tribunal, it will be subject to the appropriate civil standard of proof.
<P>
As my hon. Friend, supported by leaned witnesses, made clear to the Joint Committee this is a sliding scale that takes account of the seriousness of the behaviour or fault alleged by the FSA. In sum, I hear no new arguments from Opposition Members why we should impose a different standard of proof in this way.
<P>
The amendment is particularly inappropriate because it would apply a criminal standard to the whole array of regulatory decisions where the sliding civil standard is more appropriate. What Conservative Members are proposing seems a sure-fire recipe for ineffective and inadequate regulation. I do not believe that the industry, whose views they claim to represent, would wish to see the regulatory regime hamstrung in this way.
<P>
I am not clear what the intention behind amendment No. 374 is, but I can assure Opposition Members that it would be a strange procedure indeed that did not permit the person referring the case to see the evidence which the tribunal was considering. Indeed, the evidence which was available to the authority when it issued a warning notice and on which it had relied in deciding to issue the notice would already have had to be available to the referring party under clause 338 of the Bill. In that respect, I should inform the Committee that we have had some discussion with the Law Society about how that right might be extended to evidence on which the FSA did not propose to rely, but which might materially affect the case.
<P>
Drawing on the disclosure requirements that apply in criminal cases, one option we are considering is an amendment to clause 338(5) to require the FSA to give the person access to additional evidence on which it does not propose to rely, but which it considers could materially undermine its case. In addition, there could be a requirement in the tribunal rules for the FSA to disclose any further evidence which it has and which it considers could reasonably be said to assist the other party's case.
<P>
The Law Society has responded positively to these ideas. However, we can discuss them further and in more detail when we come to Part XXIV. So, turning back to the Opposition amendment before us, I can give hon. Members the assurance that the right to see evidence at the time of the warning notice in clause 338 will be supplemented by further provision to ensure that this covers evidence which it is not relying on, but on the contrary, which undermines its case.
<P>
Given that assurance I hope that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs will conclude that amendment No. 323 is unnecessary and will therefore agree not to press it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Minister knows that amendment No. 323 was intended to apply to cases coming before the tribunal that were essentially criminal. The Government keep trying to pretend that the only criminal territory would be market abuse. The level of fines suggest that many other aspects, as the most eminent lawyers have pointed out, would fall in the category of criminal, not civil, law.
<P>
Our amendment highlights that. I am happy not to press it, as we have made our point and accept what the Minister said about the practical issues that accepting the amendment would involve.
<P>
I am not quite sure what the Minister is saying about amendment No. 374. We would be happy not to press the amendment, as she seems to accept our point, although she prefers to address the matter in clause 338(5). However, our amendment supports what she said about the rules made by the Lord Chancellor ensuring that all the evidence available to FSA will be available to people defending themselves at the tribunal. If the Government will table an amendment to clause 338 ensuring that that is so, we are happy not to press our amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 146, in page 48, leave out lines 40 and 41 and insertó
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) No decision by the Authority which can be referred to the Tribunal shall have effect while the decision is open to review.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment speaks for itself, as it would incorporate in the clause a proviso that no decision by the FSA that may be referred to the tribunal should have effect while it is open to review. That theme crops up in other parts of the Bill, to which we shall table amendments, and highlights a problem with the independent tribunal procedure.
<P>
If someone goes to a tribunal, a 28-day period may elapse before the tribunal sits and considers the FSA decision. During that period, initial FSA decisions may be put into effect, advice given to regulators and so on. As a result, individuals, careers and the reputation of businesses may be damaged irretrievably, even though the decisions themselves may be subsequently reversed.
<P>
To some extent, the amendment is a probing one, designed to tease out from the Government how they propose to deal with the matter. Our amendment, however, is appropriate to the circumstances.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I want to support my hon. Friend.
<P>
The clause is generally fairly satisfactory, and is certainly an improvement on the provision that was drafted originally. Will the Minister confirm that we are talking about a genuine tribunal of first instance, which can examine all evidence, including new evidence, and hear arguments about issues that were not apparent when the enforcement committee or another FSA body first considered the matter? The removal of restrictions on the evidence that can be examined is a significant advance. Will the Minister clarify the tribunal's status as regards defining its own rules of evidence?
<P>
The amendment is important. We referred earlier to the enforcement committee and to the elegant hybrid that the Government now find attractive. The committee's views seem to be preliminary and to become binding only if the accused does not refer the matter to a tribunal. The Joint Committee therefore spoke of ``a case to answer'' rather than of a judicial determination and recommended that the decision notice should not be published. That would meet our concern that the accused should not be pilloried in public or assumed to be guilty when a referral might be made to the tribunal. If the Minister gave that assurance, we would not press the amendment. However, it is important, and clarification would be welcome.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I want to make several points on the amendment, which probably go beyond Opposition Members' comments. First, the right hon. Member for Wells referred to the tribunal being a first-instance tribunal. It will be fully able to consider the merits and facts of each case. It will have the authority to substitute its conclusions for those of the FSA and to require the FSA to act in accordance with its decisions.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman wanted me to confirm that the FSA cannot prejudice the tribunal by publishing its decisions. Clause 338 establishes that FSA decisions can be made public only after the case has run its full course, and that includes reference to the tribunal. At that point, the presumption will be that the decision will be published. The tribunal's decisions will be a matter of public record.
<P>
Clause 339 establishes the presumption that the FSA will publish its decisions when the judicial procedures are complete. However, the FSA is prohibited from publishing information about its decisions if, having considered the matter, it decides that doing so would be unfair to the firm or individual concerned or prejudicial to consumers' interests.
<P>
I have considerable sympathy with the aim of amendment No. 146. Subsection (5) makes it clear that a decision does not take effect before a reference to the tribunal is finally disposed of. However, it is not as clear as it might be that that includes the 28-day period during which the person concerned has the right to refer the matter. Of course, that is our intention for the generality of cases. Otherwise, the decision would take effect straight awayóbefore the other parties could consider whether to refer the matter to the tribunalóand would cease to have effect when it was referred.
<P>
I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for drawing the Committee's attention to that lack of clarity. However, I am less clear about why Opposition Members propose to insert their new text in place of subsection (6) rather than subsection (5), because it would leave redundant text in the Bill. We consider that subsection (6) performs a useful function in its own right by making it clear that if, having determined a case, the tribunal remits the decision back to the FSA, the latter is bound to act in accordance with the tribunal's decision. This may be a mistake in the amendment and it may be that the new text is intended as a substitute for subsection (5) rather than subsection (6) but, assuming that I have understood its intention, I offer the hon. Gentleman some assurance.
<P>
The Government will table amendments, along the line of the hon. Gentleman's amendment, to make the provision clear. However, the amendment does not tackle the other problems in subsection (5). First, there is the difficulty of what might be termed negative decisionsódecisions by the FSA not to grant something for which the other party asked, such as a new or extended permission, or approval under part V. It makes no sense to say that such decisions do not have effect while a matter is open to review because the question whether approval or permission is granted in the meantime would arise and that would be completely unsatisfactory. Effectively, an applicant would be guaranteed to get the right to carry on regulated business, at least for a time, even if the FSA found that he or she was wholly unsuitable.
<P>
There is also the problem of urgent intervention under parts IV and XII of the Bill. As we stated when we considered clause 51, it is necessary in some circumstances for the FSA to be able to stop, or restrict, someone's regulated activities with urgent effect if consumers' interests are threatened. All hon. Members accept that. Indeed, the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham suggested that in some circumstances those powers might need to come into effect before a threat materialised.
<P>
The type of intervention we discussed under clause 51 must be capable of having immediate or urgent effect. It would therefore be unsatisfactory if a decision to intervene was suspended while a person considered whether to refer, or where a case was being considered by the tribunal if it were referred. Immediate intervention must have immediate effect. Subsection (5) needs to make that clear so that no one can be in any doubt. This is part of the problem to which I alluded during the debate on clause 51 when I told members of the Committee that the Government would table amendments to make it clear that action under that clause may take place immediately. However, as I explained, this is caught up with the related problem of negative decisions. It is also necessary to ensure that whatever amendments we make are consistent with our proposed changes to part IV.
<P>
A further issue to be considered is whether clause 108(4) works as it should, especially in terms of giving effect to the tribunal's decision. Subsection (4) enables the tribunal to take any decision that the FSA could take. However, it is silent on how these should be put into effect although one option is for the tribunal to remit the matter back to the FSA. We are concerned that the current drafting may put the tribunal in the regulator's place for the purposes of the European directives, especially where what is at issue is a decision to grant permission under part IV of the Bill. We certainly did not intend the tribunal to be the competent authority under the single markets directive, with all that that may entail in terms of regulatory co-operation, regulation notifications and so on. So it may be necessary to provide for a mechanism whereby the tribunal decides what the appropriate response will be and the FSA is then placed under obligation to give effect to that decision. Of course, this may have wider drafting implications, so we shall also need to consider this, not only in relation to changes to part IV, but because of other points that have arisen in Committee. For those reasons I regret that we were unable to table amendments to amendment No. 108 for the Committee to consider. However, I assure hon. Gentlemen that we shall table amendments later to rectify the problems that I have outlined.
<P>
Our amendments will do three things. First, they will make it clear that in most cases a positive decision will not take effect immediately only to be switched off again if a person refers a matter to the tribunal. The usual practice will be that a decision will not take effect until after the period for referral has expired, or the matter is referred and finally disposed of. Secondly, we shall make it clear that where the FSA decides to refuse in part or in whole an application for a permission or approval under parts IV and XII, the application does not receive full permission or approval in the meantime while it is decided whether to refer, or until any referral is finally determined. Thirdly, we will make it clear that that does not prevent intervention under parts IV or XII having immediate or early effect where the FSA considers that the Consumer interests justify it.
<P>
Finally, we will clarify the mechanisms giving effect to the tribunal's decisions, particularly in the light of the changes to part IV.
<P>
I do not think there is any difference between the Government and the Opposition in terms of policy; it is just on matters of drafting. On that basis, I hope to persuade Conservative Members to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am sorry if the hon. Lady covered this point and I missed it, but in the early part of her remarks I took her to be saying that a decision notice would be published. I want to be clear about that, because paragraph 198 on page 52 of the Joint Committee report says that under the arrangement that the Treasury now approves, the FSA would issue a decision notice at the end of its proceedings before the enforcement committee which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``will contain a statement of the Committee's views on the action that the FSA considers appropriate, including any proposed penalty.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to say that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if the case went to the Tribunal, the decision notice would not be published.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is that still the Minister's intention? If not, confusion clearly arose on the Joint Committee which, to my knowledge, was not corrected.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The answer to that is no. The decision notice cannot be published until after any reference to the tribunal. That is covered by clause 339(6)(a).
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful for thatóI missed it in the Minister's explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are satisfied with the Minister's response. It is indeed subsection (5) and not subsection (6); I am not sure how it came out incorrectly.
<P>
Self-evidently, the issue is between the present wording, which relates only to a decision that is referred, and our wording, which contains the word ``can'' and deals with what happens in the 28-day period. We will return to the issue of decision notices a little later. We still see some drafting issues in relation to the wording of those notices and the ability to refer, but we are happy with the Government's undertaking to address the spirit of what we are getting at. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 108, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Further appeal on a point of law</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 405, in page 49, line 4, after `may' insert `with permission'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 406 and 407.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Clause 109 establishes the right to appeal against a decision of the tribunal on a point of law. An appeal is made to the Court of Appeal or, in Scotland, to the Court of Session. In keeping with the normal rules of court that currently apply to all appeals to those higher courts, the right is subject to the usual requirement to obtain permission to appeal. Permission may be granted by either the tribunal or the relevant higher court. Amendments Nos. 405 and 407 make that requirement to obtain permission explicit.
<P>
Further details of the procedure for obtaining permission may be set out in the procedure rules to be made under clause 107 by virtue of the power in clause 109(5). It is envisaged that permission would have to be sought from the tribunal first in the usual way, with the option of renewing the application to the appeal court if the tribunal refused permission.
<P>
Amendment No. 406 makes it clear that the only type of decision by the tribunal that may be appealed against in clause 109(1) is the final determinative decision referred to in clause 108(4). It is not intended that decisions in interlocutory matters such as the admissibility of evidence or the calling of particular witnesses should be capable of appeal. That would open up the possibility of the tribunal proceedings being endlessly disrupted and delayed by one or other party constantly seeking permission to appeal minor procedural issues to the higher court. That would not be consistent with the speedy and effective administration of justice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I should like some clarification. I am not a lawyer, but I think that the Minister was saying that the process of seeking permission is in essence a standard legal matter and not something that applies specifically to this territory.
<P>
It being half-past Eleven o'clock, THE CHAIRMAN adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
