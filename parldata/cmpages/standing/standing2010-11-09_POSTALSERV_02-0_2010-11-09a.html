on this important Bill. Most witnesses have never experienced this and,
because taking evidence is a recent innovation, the experience is new
even for members of the Committee. For those who are giving evidence,
Committee members are anxious to get evidence on the record from our
four witnesses, so that we can consider and reflect on those comments
during the Committee stage.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000017">&#160;</a>

over-regulation. There was particular criticism from Royal

I do, to talk about the

                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall give the Committee a little bit of positioning on the subject of
over-regulation. The mail market has changed tremendously since the
current price regime was put in place in 2005. Postcomm, however, has
not been sitting on its hands over that period. We published a strategy
review in 2007, which said that the market is changing and the
regulation should change with it. The fact is that we have been, in a
sense, stopped from moving regulation forward for two reasons. First,
the Hooper report was commissioned immediately after that strategy
review was published, and it would have been inappropriate for a
regulator to make fundamental changes to the regulatory regime given
the scope of Hooper’s terms of reference. Immediately after
that, the Postal Services Bill of 2009 was brought forward and Ofcom
worked to develop the new regulatory regime, so we only started work on
a change to the framework after that Bill fell in July ’09.
Fifteen months later, we have brought forward the first phase of
decisions for a lighter-touch regulatory regime. There is absolutely no
difference of opinion between us and Royal Mail about the regulatory
regime not being fit for purpose, but that does not reflect the fact
that we have been oblivious to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000035">&#160;</a>

Brown:</strong>
                           </em> The relationship is difficult when there is a
one-to-one regulator experience in that we only regulate Royal Mail in
the mail delivery industry, which is one of the advantages of moving
regulation across to Ofcom, because it has a much wider field to
regulate. Our relationship has been described to me as being like a
marriage, and in that sense it is very difficult. I think that,
professionally, it has improved over the past two or three years, but
we are a regulator and have to represent consumers and other customers
as well as the universal service, so there are natural tensions between
us—between the regulator and the regulated. That will continue
but, on a working level, they are a lot better than they have been in
the
past.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000036">&#160;</a>

for a different ownership structure. We made an announcement yesterday
about the commission’s “minded to” decision to
allow Royal Mail considerably higher price increases for next year to
accelerate its modernisation programme. I think that, if Royal Mail had
had a different shareholder, the shareholder would have stumped up the
money for the modernisation programme rather than asking the customer
to do so. We accept the constraints on Government funding, which are
very obvious. We have agreed in principle to those further price
changes, which will put up the price of bulk mail by 15% next year,
recognising that, with the current ownership structure, Royal Mail has
to go to its customers rather than to its shareholder to finance the
much-needed modernisation that will secure the universal service. That
is one very good example of why that part of the Bill has a lot of
logic.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000040">&#160;</a>

is no corporate or organisational view of it, to be honest. My own view

Royal Mail is currently saying that the regulator is too hands-on, you
can be pretty sure that regulation going forward will make sure that
the owner properly respects their obligations in terms of providing the

perspective, I believe the public should be reassured that, with the
sort of regulatory regime envisaged, the universal service will be

agree with what Tim said earlier. I think that, over many years,
experience tells you that single-company regulators find life really
hard. It is not anybody’s fault; it just creates a situation
that is very tough. We regulate a lot of very big and powerful
companies, all of which you

                           </div>will be familiar with, so I will not name them all. One of the virtues
of that is that I can have a difficult conversation with, or we can
make a difficult or uncomfortable decision for, certain corporate
interests one day, but we move on to something else the day after. It
just makes the whole environment more manageable, and I would envisage
our relationship with Royal Mail and, indeed, any other postal
operators being of that nature. That is the first
reason.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second reason is that we have currently sufficient scale, as an
organisation, and sufficient complexity and range of interesting issues
to be able to attract very high quality people to work at Ofcom. That
makes a huge difference when you are arguing detailed economic and
legal issues with some of the most well-resourced companies not only in
the UK and Europe, but in the world. If we cannot do that, and if any
regulator cannot do that, you can forget

                        <p class="tabbed">The
third reason is that we know about network industries, and this is a
network industry. We know about telecoms. We know about broadcasting.
They are obviously different, but there are similarities in how you
think about the underlying economics in
particular.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000047">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
fourth reason why I hope we can bring something useful to the table is
that, in all of the areas that we regulate at the moment, we have to
blend and balance both economic regulatory objectives and social
objectives. In broadcasting, we have to worry about the level of
original production and standards on television and radio, while also
thinking about the economics of advertising and pay television. In
telecoms, we have to think about the underlying competition and what we
can do to promote innovation, to reduce prices and to improve quality
of service for, say, broadband, while at the same time we have to think
about the USO and making sure that those networks are available to as
many people across the UK as possible. That marriage of both the social
objective and the economic objective is something that we are very
comfortable with and very familiar
with.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000048">&#160;</a>

                           </em> On efficiency, the biggest thing that will
improve or give incentive to Royal Mail is what is happening in the
marketplace. In terms of the decline in volumes that happen in the
marketplace, we believe that Royal Mail has to become more efficient. I
know that Moya talked this morning about the plans that have been put
in place over the past two years to drive that efficiency forward. That
is probably the primary driver. If it comes down to the regulator, in a
way the primary driver has failed, and the regulator has to put
artificial measures in, as we have done in the past. That is a
secondary
driver.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000050">&#160;</a>

there is the stability and predictability and opportunity created by
regulation. The regulator makes a decision and then backs off, and the
objective of the company is to beat it and to improve on it. There is a
clear incentive to drive efficiency. If they do that, they keep the
benefits and good luck to them.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000052">&#160;</a>

which is pertinent to Mr Morrice’s question, all of those things
are easier to do and will be more effective if you have private
shareholders acting as a discipline and demanding those efficiencies in

ownership and second-guessed by political decision making—I am
not giving a view as to whether that is right or wrong, but I can be
clear from a regulatory perspective—that will dull those
incentives, and we will be less effective in helping to deliver that

What I want to ask is, drawing upon your experience as regulators,
whether it would provide greater clarity for a regulator if the Bill
set out the criteria for access points, namely post offices, in the
same way that it does for frequency of collection and
delivery.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000054">&#160;</a>

regulate access to postal services. We set criteria within the licence
that Royal Mail operates with about what access it has to provide as a
minimum. It is up to Royal Mail if it wishes to go further than that
and how it goes beyond that, and that is already set within the
licence. Therefore, any changes to that have to go through a
discussion, a negotiation between the regulator and the regulated
company.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000055">&#160;</a>

think that, as needs and behaviour change over time, the needs of
access points will also change over time. Therefore, there has to be
the ability to reflect changing customer behaviour in terms of what is
access and what is needed. That may include bringing things in and
making things with greater access, especially with the move to
e-fulfilment and online shopping, and maybe changes elsewhere. The more
that is written in stone, as it were, the harder it is to change to
reflect customer-driven behaviour. That would be the only observation I
would make.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000056">&#160;</a>

economics may well change and therefore the opportunity, or the
changing conditions under which competition may or may not be
appropriate, will shift over time. Flexibility to understand that from
a technical and economic perspective, and not be boxed into a certain
answer from the regulatory perspective, is extremely important.
Otherwise, you are essentially pre-empting the economic analysis that
determines where there is scope for competition or, indeed, where there
may not be, in light of the need to ensure that the USO is

we had a little practice about 18 months ago when a prior Bill was

This time, although we are very early into the integration process and
we don’t expect to start the actual transition until July next
year, we already have a very close working relationship with all of the
Postcomm colleagues. In terms of the transition, the knowledge base of
that will be preserved through the TUPE transfer of staff across to
Ofcom. So we are very cognisant of keeping the corporate knowledge,
history, experience and skills of the Postcomm colleagues.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000061">&#160;</a>

the postal sector and the different companies. Every time that we have

well. Yes, we are responsible for regulation up to the point that we
are not and the changes for 2011 that we announced yesterday—we
are responsible and accountable for those. But what we start now for
2012 and beyond actually gets finished by Ofcom. What we are doing is
ensuring we can work as closely as possible together to make sure that

ever want to overclaim on the regulator’s role. We have this
problem with some people where we have debates about performance
measurement. We should be really clear about this. When innovation
takes place, prices come down or more choice is offered, it is
companies that are doing it. The regulator can help, and can play a
modest and sometimes important role, but ultimately it is investors,
companies and consumers who deliver those outcomes. I think it is
important for people who run organisations such as mine not to
overclaim about what they do and do not do.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000065">&#160;</a>

had a spending settlement that is demanding and challenging. We will
meet that, and I am confident that when we get to the other side of the
changes we are making we will still have a very strong capability in
the organisation. In relation to the budget and resources for postal
services, we expect that the full complement budget for Postcomm would
be the starting point for a further discussion between ourselves and
the Treasury, which no doubt will factor in some efficiency saving
because of savings from back office. We would expect to take a
significant proportion of the £10 million that is the full
complement Postcomm budget and use that to deliver our responsibilities
for post. I am sure that there will be savings, but I also expect to
have a successful discussion with the Treasury to ensure that we have
the resources to do the job
properly.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000066">&#160;</a>

has been very clear about that and we know that we have to keep a very
careful eye on it, and we do. The differences are that in telecoms we
have been able to do that in the context of a market that has been
growing and has grown consistently every year since we have been doing
it. It is obviously slightly more challenging to think about a USO in
the context where volumes and, potentially,

aspects of its work will effectively be a privatised monopoly. While we
have six days originally here, we also have the power to review. What
will stop there being a huge pressure on Ofcom either to reduce the
service by going down to five days or to increase the price? How will
you ensure that that universal service obligation is the most important

Stapleton:</strong>
                           </em> May I give a perspective on this? Moya
Greene’s main theme to the Committee this morning was about
modernisation and the future of the universal service depends first and
foremost on modernisation. The impact of competition from other mail
operators is demonstrated by the fact that today Royal Mail still
handles 98% of the revenue on letters. A lot is said about access
competition but Royal Mail still carries 99% of mail over the final
mile, which is what is really important to the universal service. All
that has gone to competition is upstream bulk haulage, which is a
network that is totally separate from the retail network.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If Royal Mail
had modernised at the 1.5% efficiency improvement that it committed to
in 2005, it would have made £666 million profit last year, not
the £166 million that it announced. That would mean
that there would be no pressure to reduce the scope of the universal
service if the business is modern and efficient. We accept that there
is a major challenge in terms of dealing with reducing volumes. Hooper
in 2008 said that Royal Mail had lost five times as much revenue to
other media as it had lost to mail competitors. We have looked at that
number two years later and it is now 10 times as much going
to other media rather than to access
operators.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So
the two things that will determine whether the universal service is
pressurised are the pace of modernisation and new product innovation by
Royal Mail to put it in a better position versus other media. We have
done some research with Consumer Focus that demonstrates how much
customers really value mail. They do not use e-mail because they think
it is better, they probably use it because they think it is cheaper but
there is still a major commitment to mail as a communications medium
and Royal Mail, as an efficient operator, can be a profitable provider
of the universal service.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000076">&#160;</a>

and the way it is going, if we are honest, it seems all the more
necessary that we should have the provisions that protect the service.
Otherwise, we are simply relying on the European directive. We might as
well say that we will go with the five-day service. Do you not feel
that there should be something to strengthen the legislation? To come
back to the point about access points—I am not confusing that
with the post office network, but talking about access points for Royal
Mail services—it was for the very same reason that countries
that have privatised their mail services thought it prudent to keep
something about the number of access points in the initial legislation.
For those reasons, we need something to make the role of Ofcom stronger

regard.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000077">&#160;</a>

not occur. If a postal administration order were in place due to the
insolvency of one operator, do you feel that there is enough clarity on
the role of Ofcom to reassure us that the universal service obligation

we would ideally want to have ensured that we had been through a
process in which that had been signalled, expected, anticipated and
that everyone had been able to adjust. That is the kind of process that
you would hope would precede that kind of outcome. As I say, rather
like the designation, if we are invoking that at short notice, we are
either facing very trying circumstances or some very poor judgments
have been made. I just hope that I never have to eat my words in

Nigel’s point in terms of modernisation and what Moya talked to
you about this morning. We have had a huge programme over the past two
years in terms of radically changing the way in which Royal Mail
operates and modernises, which will drive the cost down for the
business. She invited me to see some of the mail centres. We have been
to see them and they are incredible in 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 52<a class="bkMark" name="Column52">&#160;</a>
                           </div>terms of the things that they are changing and in terms of behaviour and
the efficiency they are getting out of simple things. No. 1, therefore,
is that modernisation, which will drive
through.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
other thing is that if you look over the past two or three years, you
will see that, in Royal Mail’s accounts, last year they made a
loss of only £8 million on the universal service. Three years
before that, they made a loss of £350 million. An element of
that is to do with some of the way in which they cost, but you can see
that there have been improvements and Royal Mail have seen those
changes. So we are a little bit more optimistic; we think there is a
great opportunity, if Royal Mail is given the freedom to be able to
invest and modernise, for a successful and very strong and robust Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000092">&#160;</a>

agreed in the first contract negotiated commercially between Royal Mail
and the operators, it included a profit margin. Royal Mail negotiated
that price. We were in the wings determining it and we would have
determined a price that was lower than that which was actually agreed.
So it was agreed higher than we thought looking at it independently,
and it included a return. Access prices have gone up by 14%, yet now it
loses 2½p per letter, Royal Mail claim. Our first
issue would be one of the reasons for that: the inefficiency or the
failure to modernise over the last five years is worth more than
2½p per letter. So if they had been efficient, access would not
be unprofitable, but it is now and I accept that. If you look at our
proposals and decisions yesterday, and our “minded to”
decision to support Royal Mail’s application for more money to
support modernisation, you will see that we would support the increase
in

Royal Mail for 11 years, five of them were in post offices. It was
mentioned this morning that only a third of Royal Mail’s
business actually comes from mail; that means two-thirds
doesn’t. My personal view, in terms of the separation, is that
it allows post offices to focus on their business growth and
development, and work with Government on some of the things that were
announced

no idea how we will get on personally, but I can tell you how it

your fingers now and all of the companies we regulate in the rest of
the sectors could appear here, some of them would say to you that they
like working with us and that they think it is a good, open, trusting
relationship. Some would say that sometimes they like what we do, other
times they do not, while others would spit blood about us and say
we’re an appalling regulatory bureaucracy and the sooner we are
closed down the better. You can probably put names to some of those
remarks with great ease. The truth is you get all of those and the
relationships wax and wane and change with personalities. If you do the

that TNT or Deutsche Post did that—if a private equity company,

for the Competition Commission rather than the regulator. There was
obviously a lot of speculation in the first part of 2009 about TNT
being a minority shareholder in Royal Mail. Its market share here in
the UK is very, very small. It is one of two access operators, and, as
we said earlier, access is a relatively small part of the total
marketplace. Clearly, that would have to be looked at, but there is no
self-evident competitive leverage from TNT’s strong market
position in the Netherlands in this marketplace. It is much more a
transfer of best practice rather than a transfer of market
power.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000106">&#160;</a>

to check whether you think the measures in the Bill would future-proof
the regime so that if, for example, you needed to deregulate more

would have the powers in the Bill and, in Ofcom’s case, in the

current regime for post to the one proposed in the Bill is definitely a
significant improvement. If we were merely inheriting the regime that
Postcomm is currently working with, my reaction would be that it would
give us a lot of problems. The new regime that is proposed in the Bill
is a huge improvement on a whole range of fronts: the scope for us to
make economic judgments about regulation and also deregulation; the
fact that we would have concurrent powers under the Bill which Postcomm
does not have, which we find extremely effective and very important in
the rest of the communications sector; the information gathering powers
which I think are essential if we are, for example, to get underneath
the issue of how much the USO truly costs and therefore be able to
assess whether there is an efficiency opportunity or whether the scope
for competitive entry is, in fact, more limited. All those areas are
significant improvements and give us a framework with which I
absolutely think we could

two things. They require quality of service, but, you have to

bulk mail there is no universal service, because it would just not be
affordable under any circumstances. That is the key. There has to be a
liberalised, competitive marketplace in which we can maintain that high
quality of service at reasonable, low prices to ensure that bulk mail
users see this as an efficient way of typically communicating with

those customers; it still gets more than 80% of the revenue from them.

like, and we will tell you if it is wrong afterwards.” From a
customer perspective that is a little concerning, because it means that
one must continually monitor—rather than having the regulator
monitor—what is going on. Customers and people such as me in a

slightly different in their approach to where we are going in the next
few years. One is what is broadly termed bills and statements, and the
other is what certain individuals in the House have called junk
mail—direct mail marketing. They are very different, but they
are volume mail. These are not the ones and twos that small businesses
may send to each other in exchanging invoices. They are material
amounts of mail, and they make up at least 80% of the volume that goes
through Royal Mail in any day. One has a certain amount of elasticity.
If Royal Mail puts its prices up, direct marketing will say,
“You are going to get fewer of them, because we have a fixed
budget.” Higher price means lower
volume.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000136">&#160;</a>

the first sort—statements and bills—you may have been
given the impression that there is less elasticity there in that if the
price goes up, they pay the bill. They will have to on day one, but on
day two the boardrooms of those companies will be pushing very much
harder to get people to transition away from mail altogether. There is
concern about the relationship between price and
volume.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000137">&#160;</a>

Market forces are only going to get more competitive, and, even with
Royal Mail becoming more and more competitive, it is still going to be
a challenge to make money out of doing those things. Do you basically
agree with the view of the chief executive of Ofcom that, with the
provisions in the Bill to bring in private money and to bring in new
efficiencies through better regulation, we need a total step change in
the way that Royal Mail works if it is going to

this morning and comments this afternoon. There has been a lot of money
spent in capex and in investment, but there has been very little
improvement in efficiency. In 2006, there was an expectation of 5%
improvement in cost efficiency per annum. It was negotiated down to
some 2.5%. What has been achieved? Zero. The issue is not necessarily
the competitors; it is the fact that the cost is not coming out of the
business fast enough. There is a lot of equipment going in, but the
cost is not coming out anywhere near as fast as is necessary to
maintain an efficient

                           </em> Thank you, Chairman. That question was about
improvements to the Bill that we might like to see. As I said at the
beginning, we very much support the Bill, but there are a couple of
areas where we feel that the Bill is perhaps looking to assist Royal
Mail—we all support that—but at the expense of
competitors. We think that is the wrong way of going about it. Clause
37, for example, puts hurdles in the way of new access applications,
and the compensation fund in, I think, clause 44 is perhaps another
such area, and so there are some areas where we feel that the Bill
rolls back the playing field for
competition.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000145">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are some other areas, to which Alan alluded I think, where the way in
which the regulatory responsibility transfers to Ofcom leaves Ofcom
with a lot of discretion, which translates for our members and,
perhaps, for the market, at this stage at least, into uncertainty, and
that uncertainty is damaging for the market. The sooner that there is
some clarity as to how Ofcom intends to use its discretion, the better
it will
be.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000146">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> What Mr Halfacre was saying about bulk mailing was
interesting. It seems that most of the individually addressed mail that
we receive these days starts life with either UK Mail or TNT, and it is
the last mile delivery by Royal Mail that is important. From
Mr Sibbick’s point of view, as a representative of
the competitors, I wonder whether he thinks that they are paying a fair
price for that last mile service, given that none of them have a
comparable network. Also, given that the Bill contains the power for
Ofcom to say that others should contribute to the cost, does he think
that his members should contribute to the cost of providing universal
service?<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000147">&#160;</a>

I do not—nor would I expect to—have access to Royal

                           </div>answer as to whether the price that is being paid is fair. However, I
think the point that Postcomm made earlier was that that access price
was the result of a commercial negotiation between Royal Mail and UK
Mail. Once that price had been agreed, it was simply put into the
market and was available to anyone who wanted to take advantage.
Anything else would have been discriminatory. In the event, almost as
much of that access has gone to Royal Mail’s own customers as it
has to my members.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000148">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
recall that in Richard Hooper’s first report, when he looked at
or tried to look at whether the price was fair, he also could not find
convincing cost evidence to make a decision one way or another.
Similarly, I think that in 2008—although it might have been a
year earlier—when Royal Mail applied for the price or margin to
be changed, Postcomm also concluded that the cost information to make a
decision was not there or not robust enough. My answer to that part of
the question is that I do not know whether the price is fair, but I
have no reason to believe that it is not. What we had yesterday was a
very large pile of paper that Postcomm has produced on the new
regulatory regime and, as a result of the work it has done on cost
transparency, it is now looking at that in a slightly different way. We
will have to see what that will mean when we have had chance to study
it in more detail. It will also depend on what Royal Mail chooses to do
with the new flexibility that it is given.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000149">&#160;</a>

as something that would be invoked only as a last resort. The risk is
that saying to Royal Mail, “If you do not improve your
efficiency and get your costs down, there is always a compensation fund
there to support you”, simply gives it a soft option and means
that competition, which is struggling in a market that is far from
neutral with VAT and so on, has even less of an opportunity to develop
and give customers choice. A compensation fund might, at some distant
point in the future, become a possibility but it should be used only
when the regulator at the time is absolutely satisfied that Royal Mail
is as efficient as it can possibly be. The Bill, quite rightly, sets
out a number of hurdles that would need to be cleared before such a
fund could be introduced, and we would support
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000151">&#160;</a>

dominant as Royal Mail is in almost any market will be subject to
competition law. In a sense, I am not sure that it matters hugely
whether it is the Competition Commission or a sectoral regulator who
deals with that. The regime that Postcomm came up with yesterday will
reduce the regulatory burdens

would be a large piece of revenue that comes from a service that very
few of the bulk customers use. As far as the UK service is concerned,

cause confusion. It is that balance between market power and excessive
market power: you need a strong player and that therefore has to be a

monopoly any more. As long as there is a playing field in which
competition is free to develop, customers will get the best of all
deals. There is a view, which I would probably subscribe to myself,
that when the market was first opened the threat of competition had
quite a galvanising effect on Royal Mail. If that competition is seen
not to materialise to any meaningful extent, there is a risk that Royal
Mail would fall back into its easy monopoly ways and that is not going
to be in its long-term interests and certainly not in the longer term

right between ensuring the long-term viability of Royal Mail for its

taxpayers’ interests. Do you think that, at the moment, across
the board on all the issues in the Bill, the balance being struck by

taxpayers are going to put their hands into their pockets most deeply.
I don’t think anyone would wish to see postmen’s pensions
put at risk in any way at all. I take the view that a large part of the
pension deficit can be laid at the feet of previous Administrations
that took too much money out of Royal Mail at a time when it should
have been ending its pensions holiday and resuming contributions to the
fund. That doesn’t necessarily mean that I feel the whole of
that deficit should necessarily be

not have any disagreement with what David has just said about the
pension—are really for others. If you look at the Consumer Focus
research that was published yesterday—and I suggest that
somebody finds that particular document, or documents as there is a
substantial amount of it, and at least makes a précis for
you—with the greatest respect to the House, there appears to be
some out-of-date thinking as regards what consumers, and therefore
voters, think of the universal service obligation. In what appears to
be a strong and reasonable piece of research—and that is,
perhaps, for everybody to determine—when asked about wants and
needs, for want the usual thing is leave it well alone, and we quite
understand that; when it comes to need, five days seems to be something
that 90% of people are quite happy with, as is a single service in the
USO, rather than first and second. A two-day service seems to be
something that voters would vote for. As far as price is concerned,
they seem to be relatively relaxed about the price of a
stamp.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000160">&#160;</a>

the retail consumer. The business users might have a slightly different
view, but I commend you to read that research because you have been
very tough in the Bill about maintaining the USO exactly as it is now.
I believe that if you were allowing Royal Mail to make some significant
change now, then its cost structures would change substantially, and
that would provide a better baseline for the provision of the universal
service. You are only delaying the inevitable, is really what I am
saying and I ask you to consider doing it now if you have the courage.

suggesting that 40% of mail will be gone in five years. I can’t
demur from that sort of number. It could happen a lot faster. If
unpleasant things happen, it could perhaps be slowed down, but only
perhaps, if regulation and the carriers provide a quality, profitable,

one hand, if you reduce the universal service, to an extent you reduce
the attractiveness of the post, as compared to the electronic
alternatives. You don’t want to do it if you don’t have
to. On the other hand, if the costs of the universal service become too
high—and the key to that is whether the Royal Mail is able
significantly to improve its efficiency and keep its costs
down—then in particular Alan’s members will migrate away
from the universal service. At that point, with all due respect, it
almost doesn’t matter what legislators say. The universal
service will become financially unsustainable, a compensation fund
wouldn’t even begin to touch the problem. The amount that the
taxpayer would have to stump up to maintain something like the existing
level of universal service, on a hugely reduced volume of mail, would
be astronomical.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000170">&#160;</a>

gradual migration from paper to various electronic media. That will
continue and it would be Luddite to try to halt it in its tracks in
some way. There are certain applications, for which mail will always be
the medium of choice, as long as it remains affordable. The trick is,
how long will it remain affordable? How quickly will the migration of
other mail—and of that mail if it isn’t
affordable—take place? I don’t think any of us have any
kind of firm grip on what that time scale might be. At some point,
there will be a need, as Alan has said, to reduce the universal
service. It is certainly not too early to start talking about how you
would reduce it in ways that would be least damaging to customers and
to the service as a whole, but I don’t believe that the need for
action is here now. Perhaps the need for talking about how best to do
it is here
now.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000172">&#160;</a>

frankly from this end of the room. I suggest to you that it is
important for you to see that five-year plan. She is very new, but
Royal Mail has pretty much burned its way through most of the
£2 billion in capex, and has not yet shown the
results of it. She suggested, on serious probing, that she was going to
need possibly £2 billion or £3 billion more. I hope that
you will be able to influence where she spends that money. You will not

to be optimistic about this, but perhaps one has to define what
optimism means here. I think optimism probably means that it will be
possible to adjust to the decline that is bound to take place, so that
for a considerable period of years into the future there will remain
sufficient volumes of mail in the system to justify the continuation of
something like the existing universal service, but perhaps scaled down
over
time.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000177">&#160;</a>

as I said before, that depends critically on prices not needing to rise
to the level at which particularly bulk mail users, for whom fractions
of a penny on an item are important, at some point throw up their hands

In some ways, it’s the most effective way of getting our message
across, but it’s just got too expensive.” In a sense, the
remedy is in our own hands, but because of Royal Mail’s
dominance, that particularly means Royal Mail’s own

back to the point that it is probably necessary to recognise some of

to say that the IBA is something for others. It’s not

sense—there are, of course, some 11,500 sub-post offices. The

would be of no value in the long term if it was only good for one of
those parties. I am not saying that one or the other has the power or
the hand to be able to deal those cards in a particular way. If it is
possible, I would recommend that you, ladies and gentlemen, should have
some input into the quality of that inter-business agreement. That may
not be possible directly, but if there is some indirect way in which

For example, where one of our couriers is unable to deliver an item,
perhaps because they need a signature and no one is at home, very often
the most convenient way for the recipient to collect the item is from a
local post office, rather than some depot that might be very far away
and might not open for the same number of hours. There could be an
opportunity for post offices to sell alternative services. There is an
outfit that we sometimes see on high streets called Mail Boxes Etc. In
the parcels express area, in particular, you can go along and access
the services of a number of different carriers. So, yes, there is
scope, but under the existing arrangements it has been very difficult
for my members to try to access
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000184">&#160;</a>

Royal Mail? You have already mentioned that, were it not for European
law, you can see the six-day delivery going. Are you saying that,
because most of your bulk mail is probably not very time constrained,
effectively you think that perhaps a Monday and a Thursday would be
adequate for most parts of the UK, and that it could just go down to
something like the arrangements we have for the milk service, with
deliveries being made on alternate days, for example? Are you saying
that you will be putting on a lot of pressure to weaken the universal

                           </em> The pressure is one of balance. If the only
way forward for an inefficient Royal Mail is to load the pricing to
bulk mail, the push back will have to be, “You’ve got to
be efficient in other areas.” If that means the reduction in the
scope of the service in other areas will make a material difference in
your efficiency in your total cost, then we will have to push in that
area, because the alternative would be that members would want to move
away from the mail service more quickly than they are currently. It
would not be gradual; it would be a much more steep decline. Witness
the situation after industrial action. It puts post on the boardroom
table; once it gets to the boardroom table, a lot of people take a lot
more interest in it and migration becomes much clearer and a more
defined path for that sort of
customer.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000190">&#160;</a>

if anything puts cost on the service without a material big improvement
in delivery—and we are talking about a relatively simple
product—it will hasten the decline of Royal Mail. If Royal Mail
charge more for the final mile of delivery, that extra cost will not be
absorbed by the industry, it will push more people out of Royal

point of view and is materially changing what we might call its USO,
because that is the only way it is going to stay afloat. The Dutch post
office has been very successful. The Danish post office has been
successful. The Swedish post was used as an example but, of course,
until relatively recently it was very much like Royal Mail—it
was totally broke and running on a wing and a prayer, even though it
appeared to be relatively efficient. You take your pick. There are not
many that make any material amount of money. Deutsche Post has always
been an example where modernisation has been at the forefront and
efficiency has been key. It has demonstrated its Germanic

it. The options for the future are relatively limited in which way this
will go. You can perhaps delay the decline, but it is difficult to see
how one will be able to find in any encouragement in letter mail to see
volumes increase. Packets and parcels are a different issue. Until we

ancient and go back a long way, I can remember that the telex, the fax
machine and the telephone were all going to kill mail. At one point
they appeared almost to be doing so. I think it was really from the
beginning of the 1980s onwards, following the separation of post and
telecommunications, that mail had a big, big resurgence. A lot of the
electronic alternatives, as with those earlier technologies, have
proved to supplement mail rather than to replace it. I do not believe,
for example, that 
<div class="columnNumber">

of the market by industrial action and that kind of thing? I believe
there may well be a plateau which becomes sustainable for a reasonable
period of time, and that good business can be made out of what exists
at the moment and what would exist over a continuing period. I do not
want to be downbeat about it but, as Alan has said, there are

relation to that, which is just something that I have been thinking
about. From the private sector’s business point of
view—possibly from the Government’s, but largely from the
private sector’s—we will see the demise of cheque
payments in the years to come. That is not something that I totally
agree with, with my background, but do you share concerns that that
decision will have an impact on the amount of traffic through Royal
Mail? I sat last night and—dare I say it—did my IPSA
payments, and I sent a lot of cheques away to people. At some time in
the future, if I am still a Member of Parliament, I will not be able to
do that, so all those envelopes that I posted last night will not be
going through Royal Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000201">&#160;</a>

the classic example; people pay online nowadays rather than put a
cheque in the post. Cheques are going down. That is clear, and we have
all seen it. I understand your point about how you support, or do not
support, that decline and what it means in a statutory sense, but the
evidence is clear about the volume of cheques being used. A lot of
those have always historically been going through the post. It shows
and demonstrates that the volume decline is hitting the social mail
area, because most cheques are probably consumer to business. That is
already a small amount of the total mail, but it is going to go down
even further. Businesses do not like to use cheques any more if they
can avoid it. That has already

competition and ensuring something like the universal service
obligation can be delivered. I am sure that your members will have
different views on where that balance has been struck. I am keen to
look at the big picture and your members’ view on the
Bill’s overall direction of travel given that they rely, and
will rely for the foreseeable future, on Royal Mail as a universal
service provider. I am going to try to put you on the spot—you
might not like it, but we get put on the spot occasionally. Do you
think that your members welcome the Bill overall or
not?<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000212">&#160;</a>

I have mentioned, we have some reservations about trying to help Royal
Mail, seemingly at the expense of competition. We do not think that was
necessary, and we do not think that that was helpful. A big area is
uncertainty, because as long as there is uncertainty, there will be a
reluctance to invest either with new people coming into the market or
existing people expanding their services.

the European managing director of a very large US employee-owned

absolutely not an expert on postal services but I do know a little

business and I have worked in employee-owned businesses. I think if you
get the combination of two factors—people having a genuine stake
in the business and secondly a degree of participation and a sense that
they have an influence over their businesses, my personal experience is
that remarkable things start to happen. Either one of them is quite
interesting, but put the two together and you get really interesting
results.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000222">&#160;</a>

are two basic starting points for our interest in the Bill, which we
also support. We have a slightly different take on public ownership
from the traditional view that has prevailed for the past 80 or 90
years, and we believe that people who are deeply involved in businesses
that are operating for public benefit, or are paid for by the public,
should have more of a role in participating in them. For the past few
years we have been engaged in promoting foundation trust hospitals,
co-operative trust schools, football supporters’ trusts, and all
such organisations in which people can have a more direct say. We think
that Post Office Ltd, once it gets over the hurdle of being a financial
business that can make profits, actually has a huge opportunity to
engage with all of the different stakeholders—sub-postmasters,
employees, multiple operators and, indeed, the general
public.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000227">&#160;</a>

shall ask my other question now, too. On Second Reading, John Redwood
asked what the Government were talking about mutualising. Would it be
the Crown offices, which the Government already control and own, or the
mass network of self-employed businesses? Is the first doable and the
latter impossible, or are they both doable from an administrative

                           </em> From the surveys that we have put together,
and from the companies that we have looked at, we definitely see that
employee share schemes are a good way of engaging employees with
businesses and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 71<a class="bkMark" name="Column71">&#160;</a>
                           </div>making them feel that they are part-owners. On the question of whether
it should be the 10% ownership that is stated in the
Bill—obviously, that is a matter for whoever is putting the
formal proposal together—and how that affects employees, we have
seen companies in which employees hold lower stakes but still feel
engaged. Although they might not hold as much as 10%, or more than
that, they like the fact that they own shares in their company and they
see that as a benefit and a worthwhile thing to do. That is at all
levels, not just executives, and it goes right through those
organisations. For example, one of our members, National Grid, has been
offering employee share plans on an all-employee basis for
25 years. It looked at this, following privatisation, as a
good idea. At the moment, its level isn’t even up to 10%, but it
still encourages its employees to acquire shares in the business
because it does engage them. I have got some statistics. I don’t
want go over dry statistics, but it is something that I could provide
to you. I could deliver the information.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000231">&#160;</a>

well, we are seeing that employees appreciate having some rights to
ownership and being offered share plans, because they feel that the
employers are taking them into account. The actual 10% ownership issue
is a point about what marked changes or what impact they can actually
have when the company is making decisions, because 10% is not any kind
of controlling stake, but it can still allow them to have some voice. A
lot of the employees we see do attend shareholders meetings. If they do
not all attend in person, then they will have representatives who
attend on their behalf.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000233">&#160;</a>

Leslie:</strong>
                           </em> Can I make a clarification, so that we are
clear about what we are talking about here when it comes to share
ownership? There are different ways for employees to own shares in
their company. Generally, people think about what Alexy is speaking
about—the direct share ownership where people have the share
certificate and the shareholders’ rights in the company
individual shareholding. At the other end of the spectrum, more like
the John Lewis model, the shares are held in a trust on behalf of the
employees. Both are very good models and the one thing to know about
employee ownership is that there is not any one size fits
all—you have to have something that fits the
organisation.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000234">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What makes a
difference with your normal engagement activities in an organisation is
that the shareholding, whether it is direct or indirect, does give the
employees rights. It gives them rights to information. It gives them
rights to influence. It gives them rights to have a voice in the
company. So, it is not just the shareholding itself that makes the
difference, it is the governance and leadership that surrounds that
that really makes it work, and that is where you see most of the
success.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000235">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">You asked
about the 10%. Personally, I am a bit disappointed at 10%, because 10%
to me is small, which means that you have to put more effort into
giving employees that real voice in the company so that they do feel
that it is theirs—they do feel that that ownership, if you like,
is real and it is not a
token.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000236">&#160;</a>

10% is quite low and I think that there is a danger that if it is just
shares and there isn’t a participation culture that goes with
it, it won’t change a lot. We see

have a sense of ownership. They feel that they participate in
decisions. They discuss decisions and when they make a decision they
stick with it. It was interesting watching some of our members through
the recession. Employee-owned companies are affected the same as
everybody else. They would have gone through an awful lot of agony
about how you manage through different times but, because those
decisions were made in a very participative way, once the decisions
were made they were stuck to, and bought into, by everybody. Our
members have gone through the recession in a very resilient way and I
think that is down to the way you manage the company.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000237">&#160;</a>

that it depends on the entity you are looking at as to how best to
engage your employees. I suppose that is the kind of question I had
here. The information that we have got from the Bill does not
necessarily go into the detail as to whether this will be an
acquisition by a third party, maybe some type of public offering, and
how, to that level, employees can then be engaged. Because 10% may seem
low, but we work with a lot of companies and, because of how they are
structured, 10% to them is quite high because they have other
shareholders and they need to take them into account. It is going to
slightly depend, I would have thought, on the entity and how this is
actually looked at for the privatisation with the Royal Mail
side.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000239">&#160;</a>

                           </em> There is a lot of fast and loose talk about
mutuality and mutuals, and the label comprises many different types of
businesses and many different types of organisations. Mutuals across
the UK turn over £100 billion a year, but they are as
varied as the Co-operative Group, the biggest mutual, down to the
smallest co-op pub or local community organisation. There is a real
mixture of organisations here, and if we were to talk about a mutual
post office, we could all be talking about different things. I will
tell you what I am talking about, which might also help Mr Redwood, who
is probably going to read this

                        <p class="tabbed">Basically,
the opportunity for Post Office Ltd is to have a mutual that is a
mixture of different stakeholders, and one which does not put one
particular stakeholder group at the front of the queue—there is
an unintended pun there. It does not put the employees ahead of the
sub-postmasters or the multiple operators or, indeed, the general
public, because the one thing that they all have in common is that they
all want to see a successful Post Office
operation.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000242">&#160;</a>

type of mutual structure that you are starting to lean towards in all
of this is, in the jargon, a multi-stakeholder co-operative. It is run
as a business, but you try to manage the different stakeholder groups
so that you have a balance of who is responsible for what. Ultimately,
the point that I am making is that no particular stakeholder
group—the employees or the multiples or the
sub-postmasters—is actually in the

downstream from what we are talking about in the Bill, would try to
balance out those different interests and try to make sure that there
is a range of opportunity for those interests to be aired, but not to
control and overrule each
other.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000243">&#160;</a>

difficult, but the question is whether it is desirable and doable. The
answer to the question, “Is it doable?” is, “Yes,
it is.” We can take some comfort from the existing successful
mutual businesses that mix and match different types of stakeholder. I
mentioned the Co-operative Group, which has members who are members of
the public—there might be members here. There are also a number
of regional businesses, which, from time to time, might actually see
the world in a different way to the executive that is running the
business. There are in-built frictions, and there are in-built ways of
dealing with those frictions. You can take that further, looking at the
example of NHS foundation trusts, where there is a whole range of
different stakeholders involved in the governance arrangements. The key
point is working out the most appropriate role for each of the
stakeholders and making sure that that is matched in the governance
structure that you

                           </em> As far as we have seen, we do tend to want
to encourage matched or shared ownership as part of a way of
participation, but that is not always possible when working with
organisations that are effectively global. We have obviously seen other
ways in which they might try to replicate a type of share scheme, but
it might actually have to be paid in cash depending on the location of
your
employees.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000248">&#160;</a>

can also be linked to the performance of an organisation or a company,
and they can be paid in cash. They could have similar performance
conditions as you might see attached to a share scheme, say, so that
you actually have to perform before you receive your return or your
shares.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000249">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the other side, as far as the 10% is concerned, I know that there were
some discussions, as you were saying, with the trade unions earlier on,
and there seems

			Column number: 74<a class="bkMark" name="Column74">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to be a difference of opinion as to whether 10% is enough. Again, I am
assuming that it slightly depends on the entity and what it is trying
to achieve. If you are working with something like a trade sale, it
will presumably depend on the purchaser’s view of how much
employee participation there should be. But it is something that they
need to take into account early, I would have thought, because it will
affect potentially what they pay for the company.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000250">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The other
issue that we have seen with some companies is where they want to
effectively allocate a certain percentage of shares to employees and
how that company is then retained as, shall we say, employee-owned,
when original employees may leave the company. Are you then looking at
maybe having to buy back their share ownership for it to go back into a
pot for employees, and if so, what are the potential costs to the
company of putting a structure like that in place? Some companies have
fallen foul of that because they have realised that the costs can be
quite prohibitive if they have a lot of transition of
employees.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000251">&#160;</a>

entrepreneurial side of employee ownership. The issue there is, how do
you motivate people to want to solve problems and grow a business? If
you were to put some degree of incentive into the scheme whereby, if
people can find innovative ways of solving their problems and growing
the business, they get a greater share of what they create—they
share the wealth creation—I think that is worth looking at. Just
being given a greater share of something if you can’t see how

long-term, resilient businesses: John Lewis, Ove Arup and an awful lot
of our members have very long-term approaches to employee ownership.
You’ve got to bake that into the business model at the start
though, because if you have a situation where there is an opportunity
not to have a proper endgame, you see situations where business are
spun out again. So we would recommend that part of this is structured
in such a way that the employee’s share is in a trust or
whatever, and you can control them.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000254">&#160;</a>

carefully as to how that would work. Where the shares are seen as a way
to make money, that changes the whole dynamic of what makes employee
ownership work. The reason it works so well in organisations like John
Lewis and Arup is because people can concentrate on the long-term
success of the business, not on the quarterly share value. The decision
tends to be longer term and much more sound than it would be just
making quite short-term decisions. Therefore, I would suggest that you
want to have some kind of safety net built in that ensures that the
shares will always be retained within the business, so if there is
going to be a direct shareholding, then it can be resold to the
organisation or to internal employees—but the shares do not
eventually end up going outside. Because then you are losing what you
have created and the long-term capability.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000255">&#160;</a>

                           </em> We have seen encouraging signs from our
members and a lot of them are FTSE companies. The issue is always going
to be that employees, like any other shareholder, will look at the
share price and will be likely to sell when the share price goes up.
However, a lot of them actually do retain their shares because they
have a long-term commitment to the company. We have seen that with some
of our members. We got some results in our recent surveys at about 50%
to 60%, or sometimes higher, of employees actually retaining the
shares—not necessarily the full amount that they acquire,
because there is often a tax implication behind this so they may sell
some of the shares to meet those liabilities, but of employees actually
having a long-term holding. I hope no company would
encourage employees to hold shares or to buy shares in a market that is
dropping, or to try and prevent them from selling shares when they wish
to do so. We can back it with, say, an employee benefit trust, which
allows them, if the company is not a plc—so there is not a ready
market—to at least sell into that as an effective market for
those shares. It is always difficult. It is encouraging that employees
retain their shares, but at the same time I think that companies will
get a thin line if they try to demand that employees retain their
shares whereas other shareholders might have free access to sell in an
open market.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000256">&#160;</a>

concerned, the benefits, as I have mentioned before, include engagement
of employees, having employees feel that they are part of the company.

as a number of you know, a tax-approved regime in the UK for certain
types of employee plans. In particular, the share incentive plan has
proved very popular with many FTSE 100 companies and larger entities,
because that way, not only can employees acquire shares in a
tax-preferred way, but the employer can also match their participation
levels and effectively give them shares in the company. As long as they
hold them within the required time frame, they can receive them in a
more tax-preferable way, compared to other shareholders. For them, the
cost of obtaining shares can be reduced for the employees without
necessarily giving them a discount. There are share option schemes as
well, which work in a similar manner to give them similar tax
benefits.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000259">&#160;</a>

sad but it’s true that a lot of resistance comes because people
just don’t know enough about employee ownership and they
haven’t seen the benefits, because it is not yet a mainstream
model. If you look at the United States, employee ownership has really
taken off. Just this week it was announced that a company of 15,000
employees has gone into employee ownership, and that is happening on a
regular basis. We don’t have that head of steam yet. I think

better people to give evidence to talk about the business of Post
Office Limited. However, what I would say is that it is a fundamental
starting point that there is no point in trying to change the
governance arrangements or the corporate structure of a business that
is bust. The business needs to be making profits and capable of going
forward to make profits. That is a given and that is why we put it in
the introduction to that paper. Whether in any business you seek to
ensure that every single part of the operation is profitable in the
same way, is a matter of the strategy of the business. It might be that
certain parts of the business would be tolerated to work at a lower
profitability or even temporary losses. The point overall is that the
business has to be profitable, otherwise it is not a
business.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000264">&#160;</a>

in the sense that it performs a social obligation as well as a purely

profitability of the business, to have a different view on the
profitability of individual units. You talk about the social service
that post offices provide, and a good example might be co-operative
societies that keep marginal stores open in the highlands and islands.
They cannot make as big a profit as they could on the mainland, but
they are kept open because they might be the only store in the area.

You will find that lots of the smaller sub-post offices that you are
describing are actually stationers or newsagents as well and do other
things as part of their business. We are talking about the post office
part of the business, and it is entirely possible within the management
of Post Office Ltd to take account of the needs of different
stakeholders and different business parts of the organisation. You
cannot speculate on how that would work out in any individual case.
Ultimately, the sub-postmasters, just like the multiple operators and
the general public, want to see the Post Office succeed, which means
getting people through the doors and using the service. It is no
different, regardless of which stakeholder group you are taking
about.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000268">&#160;</a>

schemes, of which I am a great fan. On a point of clarification, the
Bill stipulates 10% or more for share ownership, so we should not get
too fixated on the 10% figure. That would be the largest figure for
employee share ownership of any major privatisation anyway, and that is
the minimum it can be. We have already talked about whether it was just
shares, rather than being in a trust, and whether employees would be
able to dispose of those shares. Could you comment on some of the other
factors that you think the Government should take into account when
designing the scheme? What should Ministers bear in
mind?<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000269">&#160;</a>

Armitage:</strong>
                           </em> From the employee share scheme side, which
you have mentioned, they should look at some form of employee benefit
trust, or at making some kind of market to look at those shares, not so
much because you necessarily want employees to be buying or selling in
any kind of bulk, but because you obviously need to factor in people
leaving or coming into the Royal Mail in future and how they will be
included in any kind of share scheme. I suppose that it is just about
keeping a certain number of shares.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000270">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On the 10%,
presumably that will depend on how the Royal Mail is affected and, if
it is acquired or there is a public offering, how much employees can
reserve. It is obviously not for me to comment on the size of it,
because that would be more of a market issue. You can still encourage
employees to acquire shares, even though it might not be, say, a
publicly listed company. We have definitely seen private companies that
have a number of employee share schemes in place.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000271">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Again, it
depends on whether there can be created some kind of market for the
shares, and it depends on the private company, because some have
restrictions in terms of their actual structure as to who can own
shares—the reason that they are private. It can be a difficult
way for employees to own shares, especially when you are looking at a
private entity. Usually, there is not such an issue with plcs, because
there is an open market, and employees have the same rights as other
shareholders to deal in those
shares.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000272">&#160;</a>

the financial mechanics of creating the shareholding, the other issue
is how to build in representation and get participation going, because

problems. They will be solved somewhere in the organisation, so how do
you get the organisation working together with the right behaviours and

have the benefit of their 10%? Without solving the problems, they will
not benefit from the

that you want to go for. The benefit of an employee benefit trust is
that it is very stable. It is easy to administer, you do not have the
turnover of shares, you do not have to think about people buying and
then selling—it is very stable. It could be said that it is a
bit more difficult to give people a tangible sense of ownership if they
do not have the bit of paper that says that they are an owner of the
company, but companies such as John Lewis Partnership and others do a
great job with that. A lot of it comes down to how you enshrine the
employee voice, and how governance of the trust is implemented. That is
a way to do
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000275">&#160;</a>

were just apprehensive because of previous bad practice in share
distributions to employees in the ’80s. My own experience with
British Steel in 1988 was that 6% of shares were sold to employees, and
they were mainly managers who had the tip-off, who were in charge of
the redundancy programme at the time and who had access to

are right: back in the ’80s, they seemed like get-rich-quick
schemes. You got your shares one day, then tried to sell them as
quickly as you could for as much as you could. That was nothing to do

employee ownership in a lot of those industries and they are looking
much more closely now at retaining their shares, from both the employee
and the company perspective. I think that way of thinking
has changed as employers have become more aware of the benefits of
employee share-ownership. But to say that every company should have x

                           </em> One example that comes to mind
quickly—this has been prompted by someone talking earlier about
the demand for paper, which is a declining industry—is the
Thomas Russell paper mill in Fife, Scotland, which has been
employee-owned since the ’80s and fully employee-owned since the
mid-’90s. It is unionised, has an excellent industrial relations
record and has been out-performing other paper mills in the UK and
performing well globally as well. Recently, its employees voted to come
out of the collective pay agreement, because they did not think it was
right to do it, and the union backed that locally. Having a strong
ownership voice with the union, if it is managed properly, can work
exceptionally
well.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000290">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">You
asked another question about how it can improve communication. It is a
bit of a journey and not something that happens overnight. You have to
work very hard to make it work. A lot of it is that you have to look at
how the employee voice will be represented throughout the organisation
to ensure that all parts of the organisation are heard and how much
import is then given to the different parts, whether it is done by a
council, elected representatives or something else. Involving unions in
setting that up, as well as involving employees, can go a long way to
setting it off on the right
foot.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000291">&#160;</a>

and post offices, but do not wish to address purely Mr Hunt, because I
think that the business experience of the other three witnesses would
be useful. Clearly, we have a situation in which perhaps 4,000 post
offices are viable and two thirds are not. If we are trying to make the
business viable, presumably there are options of increased business and
continued subsidy, or the mutual staff will have to decide that some of
those post offices will close. What could be put into the Bill or how
could it be strengthened to make the post office network more
attractive? People have to want to buy it. First you have the
sub-postmasters who have a lot of money in it anyway. Do they want to
spread that money around to less viable post offices which is
effectively what they may be doing? Who else would you interest? What
is your take on things like the inter-business agreement with Royal
Mail and what would you want to see from

regulation and having not just the collection and the delivery points,
but the access points defined very clearly in the Bill in terms of
regulation? What types of measures like that would you want to see to
strengthen it and make it a worthwhile organisation to buy

Hunt:</strong>
                           </em> I am not sure you can legislate for all those
things. Two things need to be achieved. I have already talked about the
first one which is that it is a viable business. I do not think it can
be a half-viable business, or a nearly viable business or an unviable
business if it is transferred to a mutual. It needs to be viable first.
So if difficult decisions need to be taken to make it viable, they have
to be taken before it is transferred. To use sporting terminology, it
would be a hospital pass to hand over something that was a pretty
difficult decision that someone would then need to take. I would want
to see at the point of transfer that that business is viable going
forward, not full of problems and unresolved decisions and unable to
trade
profitably.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000293">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Having
said all that, the opportunity for all the different stakeholders to
try to solve some of those problems together is not currently being
taken. I know you have spoken to the National Federation of
SubPostmasters and you can talk to multiple operators and other people
who are currently running post offices. Their experience is that they
do not generally feel part of Post Office Ltd’s decision-making
process. They do not generally feel that they are people who are
consulted and able to give their own expertise, which in many cases is
pretty substantial. So they do not feel that they are cut into the deal
as it stands at the moment. So over the next couple of years, I would
like to see a change in the culture of the Post Office so that it opens
up to being able to receive this new kind of arrangement, talking to
the sub-postmasters and their representatives more openly and deciding
the business direction more openly with the different
stakeholders.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000294">&#160;</a>

that into the Bill would be nigh on impossible, and I am a great
believer in legislation that sets the principles. In this situation,
one golden principle is set in the Bill as it stands, which is the
public benefit of Post Office Ltd. It is really important that the
future business adheres to that public benefit and is effectively held
to account by Parliament for that. You talk about regulation. It is
entirely possible to run mutuals in highly regulated business areas.
There will always be different external interests in it and that should
be something that continues. Ultimately the viability has to be sorted
out before this is
transferred.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000295">&#160;</a>

it is a tremendously underused asset, because in most rural communities
it is the point where everybody goes to get things and fix things. I
have never understood why there was not more innovation in terms of how
you build those businesses and how you use them. Before dismantling it
and chucking it away, I would recommend that somebody has a good look
at how you might use that network much more effectively. I think that

up a little on what you have said about employee share ownership
schemes. Given that good communication between management and employees
and a sound business model are the two most important things, is it
correct to say that the percentage of shares offered to the employees
is secondary to the quality of the scheme that they can join,
particularly if that scheme means that they feel they have a stake in
that business and are sharing in the success of that business? Would
that be your view?<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000302">&#160;</a>

Employee share schemes work with companies for which it is their first
share scheme, so they do not obviously have any necessary percentage of
employee share ownership before they go into their initial share
scheme. Often they want to put together a share plan that is as
encouraging to employees as possible. For example, entities that can
have one of the tax approved plans may well go down that line, because
they can offer employees benefits other than just employee share
schemes. They may also be able to offer them something that is
familiar, because their employees will not have just come from nowhere;
they might have come from another organisation that offers those
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000306">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have seen that when foreign-owned companies have come into the UK and
built up their presence here, sometimes when they offered a plan in the
UK that had been very familiar in their particular location they did
not have a very large take-up because the UK people were not familiar
with it. They have then tried again, often using an approved plan, and
they have seen the take-up increase very highly. That is not because
they are offering more of a percentage, but because they are offering a
different kind of scheme. It is hard to say

much mutualisation but community ownership. I wondered whether there

look to those that currently exist. The point is really, in all of
this, that once a business becomes unviable, the decision needs to be
taken about it. If that decision is whether it stays or goes, it might
be a bit blunt as an instrument. You can also look at a different way
of doing it, which might involve the local community. All of that,
which you say is an alternative to mutual ownership, is actually one of
the types of mutual ownership that could fit within

                           </em> I do not know if I can give a quick answer. I
don’t know that you can put a figure on it. I will
give you two quick examples: there is Admiral Insurance, which is based
in south Wales, where they currently have employee ownership of 12% to
15%. If you add on the senior executives, the ownership stake gets up
to about 20%. That is still quite small, but they are working to grow
that. I think you have there a company that has much higher retention
than other businesses, has high levels of customer satisfaction, is
more innovative and is expanding in a market that is not expanding. So
it is working very well. Another good example would be Eaga plc, which
was formerly a public sector organisation, 100% employee owned and
listed on the AIM market in 2004. It has now got 37%
employee ownership stake. However, it has an excellent infrastructure
with a really good employee voice, with a partnership council, which is
fully involved

well. I would be reluctant to put a figure on it, but 10% seems very
small.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000314">&#160;</a>

be honest. They will start at a level and then will encourage employees
as the company grows, or as the industry market changes, to acquire
more shares. Incentivisation is a very good way, as Peter is saying, to
do

                           </strong> It is often what you can’t put in the Bill
that is a bit of a debate. It has come from what you have all said,
that with employee shares, the key part is participation and
involvement. I want to check that we couldn’t put that in the
Bill, because it seems to me to be quite difficult to put in the Bill.
I want your views on that. In terms of the mutualisation model, we can
be reassured as a Committee, that we shouldn’t have a detailed
prescribed model for that, because with mutualisation you need to bring
people with you. Are we right to keep it in principle approach in the
Bill and set in train
consultation?<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000324">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Yes is the answer. You heard on Second Reading
people say that you can’t do mutuality to people; you
can’t do a top-down mutual. You can set the principles, but the
establishment of the arrangements of how you actually run it have to
involve the people who will be involved in running it. So, I think, no,
if the Bill goes through, the next period should be about getting those
people together and making sure that they are involved in designing the
structure that they themselves will be operating in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000325">&#160;</a>

                           </em> That is the point. Until you definitively
know the structure you want and how this will be privatised, I
don’t see how you can be more prescriptive. Because effectively
you are going to be limiting what you can do. You need to know the
structure of the organisation in advance. So keeping it fairly loosely
defined, shall we say, in the legislation is probably a good thing at
this stage. It may be something that needs to be tightened up
for  the future.<a class="bkMark" name="10110980000328">&#160;</a>
