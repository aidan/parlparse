<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move amendment No. 114, in page 17, line 12, leave out `twenty-six nor more than fifty-two', and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`thirteen nor more than twenty-six'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are pleased to have you back in the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody, as we reach the running off of our debates.
<P>
It is important that we do not relax our guard, but continue to discover the implications of the Bill. I tabled the amendment not so much to state a definitive policy as to invite the Minister to clarify matters, because, unusually, the explanatory notes do not make them entirely clear. It is important that we do not create an injustice or make a material change by accident.
<P>
I understand that the Minister's objective is to run together the additional and special awards, as set out in the explanatory notes. It is entirely commendable and sensible to want one regime for both. In fact, if it is that difficult to explain them, it is likely that they will be safe in the hands of experts, and not easy to disentangle. We welcome simplification in principle.
<P>
In contradistinction to what might loosely be called ordinary compensation payable for cases of unfair dismissal, the awards relate to the two circumstances under which employers decline, refuse or are obdurate about re-employment, with compensation therefore enhanced. In the one case, it relates to a refusal to take on staff in what might be termed normal circumstances; in the other, it relates to a refusal to re-engage under five specific heads, which are listed in the explanatory notes and which include membership of a trade union, or complaints on health and safety grounds, with which I have some sympathy.
<P>
I am anxious to tease out what is happening. It would be useful if, either now or in correspondence, the Minister would let us have a little schema or matrix on the various compensation awards that are payable. I understand that over and above what the explanatory notes call normal compensation, there is, in normal cases, an enhancement for gender, disability or ethnic discrimination. In such cases, descrimination goes up from a scale of 13 to 26 weeks to one of 26 to 52 weeks.
<P>
I turn to cases of additional and special compensation. I am prepared to defer to the Minister, because it is not quite clear, but I understand that additional awards other than those for sex, race or disability compensation are for 13 to 26 weeks. However, special awards seem to have no formal limit. Perhaps they attach themselves to the higher rate payable in discrimination cases.
<P>
It would be useful if the Minister would explain that difference, because the regulatory impact assessment suggests that the coalesced consolidation of the additional and special awards could lead to a reduction in compensation in certain cases. Indeed, paragraph 144 of that document refers specifically to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The lowering of the maximum level of compensation''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I take it that that must mean a reduction from 52 to 26 weeks.
<P>
The cases are few in number. The RIA suggests that there were fewer than 350 in 1996-97, although, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset said earlier, there is an explosion generally in employment tribunal cases. There were 55 re-employment orders, but the regulatory impact assessment and the explanatory notes are silent about the number of cases in which they would apply.
<P>
If I have construed the matter correctly, some cases would involve a slight reduction of the maximum level of compensation. In the interests of simplification, it may be desirable to make such a change, but it would be helpful if the Minister would explain the various categories, the intention of the clause, its effect and say why the changes would be beneficial.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Wills):</B> I welcome you back to the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody. As members of the Committee will know from the explanatory notes, the intention of the clause is to simplify the existing system of additional and special awards made by employment tribunals in cases of unfair dismissal, when a re-employment order has not been complied with. As the hon. Gentleman correctly identified, such situations are fairly unusual and we want to deal with that rather than with anything else.
<P>
The Committee will agree that, in such cases, it is important that the employers have a real incentive not to behave in such a way and the Bill will introduce a punishment when re-employment orders have not been complied with. Rationalisation is long overdue. The hon. Gentleman asked me to write to him with a matrix of all the various compensatory awards that were applicable, and I undertake happily to do that. At present, if a re-employment order is not complied with, someone may receive an additional award at a higher or lower level depending on the type of case. In certain cases, people may receive a special award, instead of an additional award either at a lower level, if the person has sought a re-employment order, but the tribunal has not made one, or at a higher level if a re-employment order has been made, but not complied with. The situation is complex.
<P>
To put the matter at its simplest, all the so-called special categories will go. There will no longer be any special awards, but all will be entitled to additional awards if a re-engagement was not made once it had been ordered. There will be no changes regarding sex and race discrimination cases.
<P>
I appreciate that the amendment is a probing amendment, so I shall not spend long on it. In simplifying the awards, we have had to decide where exactly to pitch the level. The aim of the award is to punish employers for not complying with the re-employment order, which we all agree is important. The additional award available under clause 29(2) is between 26 and 52 weeks' pay. Bearing in mind that the current limit on a week's pay for that purpose is &#163;220, the figure will be between &#163;5,720 and &#163;11,440. In our judgment, that level of penalty should provide an incentive for employers to comply with a re-employment order. The level in the amendment will not. I accept that it is a matter of judgment, but in this case I prefer to abide by my judgment rather than the hon. Gentleman's. For that reason , we cannot accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister has set out to explain matters. He has undertaken to write to me, and I suspect that my hon. Friends and others would also benefit from a useful explanation of that complicated matter. I think that there is some rationale to his actions, and we do not want to send a signal that delinquent employers can walk away from a tribunal's findings and take no notice of them. In that spirit, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 29 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 30</center></H4>
<H4><center>Indexation of amounts, &c
<p5>Mr. Boswell: I beg to move amendment No. 271, in page 17, line 31, at end insert</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`by more than 1 per cent.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 272, in page 18, line 5, leave out `&#163;50,000' and insert `&#163;40,000'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Apart from the implications highlighted by amendment No. 272, to which I shall return, the principle of indexation is acceptable. I distinctly remember debating with the Minister of State an indexation order that raised all the figures. Although I say ``distinctly'', as I recall it, we repaired from all-night deliberations on the Report stage of the National Minimum Wage Bill at about 8.30 am, and came into this Room at 10.30 am and debated, in a constructive way, the indexation order. Such orders will become a thing of the past, as indexation will be automatic.
<P>
I have two reservations. The first, which is minor, is dealt with by amendment No. 271, which would prescribe that if the retail prices index for September was higher or lower by 1 per cent. than the index for the previous September, an order would be triggered, but if the difference were less than that, no order would be triggered. That would avoid unnecssary change and promote a degree of stability if appropriate. Change of less than 1 per cent. either way in the retail prices index makes no material odds, and I am concerned that if changes are made, people may not have received intelligence of them and the award may be out of line. A tribunal may pick that up, but if the matter were resolved privately and practitioners were unaware of a change, there might be a slight untidiness.
<P>
If I had taken literally the Government's commitment to keep inflation level at about 2.5 per cent., I would have produced a different formulation, but I provided one designed to point out to the Minister that we do not need trivial changes. He has already conceded a point in a different context about the sums in subsection (3), in which he allows for a degree of rounding. The issue is no more substantial than that, and I leave it to his consideration.
<P>
Amendment No. 272 deals with a more substantial point, one on which I can give some thanks to the Minister and his colleagues for having listened to and&#151;a rare occasion&#151;having even taken notice of Opposition Members, although I appreciate the fact that we have had other allies on the matter, in relation to the capping of employment tribunal awards. As the Minister will remember, the Government's original proposal in ``Fairness at Work'' was not to have a cap at all, and some of us pointed out that the most likely result of that would be for persons with fat contracts&#151;people who might be termed ``Islington persons''&#151;to avail themselves of the law to screw their employers for substantial sums because of some procedural delinquency. I do not condone employers' doing so. The horny-handed sons&#151;and daughters&#151;of toil would not receive anything comparable. We suggest a limit of &#163;40,000, rather than &#163;50,000, because it is a matter of public knowledge that the Confederation of British Industry, in response to ``Fairness at Work'', suggested that the figure should be lifted substantially from its present &#163;12,000 to &#163;40,000. That is more than a factor of three, but the Government chose to go to &#163;50,000. I remind the Committee that under the clause, the figures are subject to indexation, but I shall leave that matter and return to the substantive point.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The CBI, as the negotiator in what became the compact of 17 December, and as a major player representing business, thought that the figure should be &#163;40,000. Inevitably, it was heavily influenced by the views of small firms, which said that that was the maximum with which they could be comfortable; but, lo and behold, the Government came up with &#163;50,000.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): My hon. Friend referred to business representatives being heavily influenced by the views of their members at the grass roots. Does he agree that it seems that the Government were heavily influenced in their decision to make the figure &#163;50,000, not by a consideration of principle, but by a desire to throw a sop&#151;and an irresponsible one, at that&#151;in the direction of their left-wing Back Benchers? [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> There are two interesting points about that. First, it is not for me to comment on the Government's mental state or motives in making their decision. I merely record the passing scene and the apparent dissonance between the CBI's view, about which the Government now profess themselves to be concerned, and the result, which is different. Secondly, the Government's proposal will help much more those who, for shorthand purposes, I shall describe as Islington man and woman, than those at the bottom end of the employment scale who are not likely realistically to aspire to such higher figures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): I am sure that my hon. Friend does not want to leave on the record a misunderstanding. The reaction of Government Back Benchers was not about the suggested sop or the &#163;50,000, but the fact that Labour Members were described as left wingers. As the Whip turned round, they were saying, ``Not me, Whip.''
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I call Mr. Boswell on the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall turn to the right literally and remember to address you, Mrs. Dunwoody. Labour Members who do not want to incur your displeasure should turn to the left; they cannot turn to the right and still keep in order.
<P>
Whatever the Government's motives, there is a gap. The change from the CBI's suggestion of &#163;40,000 to a figure of &#163;50,000 will tend to help people at the top of the pile.
<P>
That brings me to the concern about the Government's analysis in their regulatory impact assessment. The inference is that the numbers will be small&#151;about 100 employers will face an increased award. Using a figure of &#163;30,000, which is mid-way between the current &#163;12,000 and the new ceiling, the average payment will be increased by &#163;18,000, making a total cost of &#163;1.8 million per annum&#151;a cost that is currently borne by the victims of unfair dismissal.
<P>
The Government will say that the change is trivial and one which&#151;I shall make the point before they do&#151;will fall on delinquent employers who have failed to observe the procedures. The Minister is nodding. I make no bones about it. Employers should go through the right procedures, and they are at risk if they do not. However, the Minister will know that some employers beg to differ on whether they have done their best and they are often affronted by tribunal decisions.
<P>
To repeat a point that I made in regard to ``Fairness at Work'', the Minister needs to think more seriously about the fact that his regulatory impact assessment changes the stakes for an employee in the middle range&#151;someone who receives a salary of up to, say, &#163;40,000, which is a substantial sum. If such a person is dismissed, he or she has two options in redressing grievance: to take an unfair dismissal case to an employment tribunal or to sue on contract in the courts. If the court route is chosen, the individual is unlikely, unless the contract is unusual, to receive more than a quarter of a year's salary or the three months' notice period&#151;in the example I have given, a maximum of &#163;10,000. That is closely in line with the maximum of &#163;12,000 available under the unfair dismissal procedures.
<P>
Once the figure is raised to &#163;50,000, there would be, in the absence of compensatory action for wrongful dismissal&#151;I am not canvassing for that&#151;a substantial shifting of the balance towards unfair dismissal claims. That is why the Government's estimates in the regulatory impact assessment are implausible. There will be more traffic through the employment tribunals, particularly of older employees who may feel that their working life is coming to an end and that the tribunals are an obvious means of redress. The Minister has characteristically tried to give assurances that the system will not be clogged up, but it is not as simple as he claims.
<P>
In summary, the first amendment attempts to help the Government by providing a de minimis requirement for altering the figures annually, if inflation is low; I do not regard the figure in the amendment proprietorially. The second amendment is substantive and invites the Minister to explain why he chose a cap of &#163;50,000 rather than &#163;40,000&#151;none the less, we are pleased that there is a cap; that is an advance. Behind the apparently mild change, which moves in the direction of business, there may be a seething mass of potential grievance that may create much more trouble at the tribunals, a lot more hassle for employers and a good deal of grief generally. That gives the Minister enough to be going on with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): Amendment No. 272 deals with an important development in the Government's thinking on the Bill, as it proceeded from the White Paper. The key point, on which the Government should be congratulated, is that they have conceded the principle that the sum of compensation matters&#151;it is not, as they initially claimed, simply an issue of social justice whereby if a wrong is committed, appropriate recompense should be made, regardless of the wider implications. That debate is of central importance. Opposition Members repeatedly return to the view that there will be no social justice under a Bill that allows not just one employee but potentially others to lose their job when a business, especially a small business, ceases to trade because of provisions that are intended to protect employees and compensate them if they have faced unfair conduct.
<P>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), I should be interested to know why the Government have chosen &#163;50,000, rather than &#163;40,000, as suggested in amendment No. 272, or, indeed, any other figure. I welcome the fact that the Government have conceded the principle that the level at which the compensation is fixed clearly makes a difference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Size matters.
<P>
<B>Mr Brady:</B> My hon. Friend says that size matters, but I shall not proceed any further down that avenue.
<P>
Given that the Government have conceded that point of principle, I presume that in establishing the appropriate level of compensation, they calculated the optimum figure at which fairness would be maintained while minimising the damage to business.
<P>
I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments on the position of smaller businesses. In accepting that a higher level of compensation would involve an economic and, possibly, an employment price being paid, the Government implicitly accept that there is a continuing spectrum whereby the impact on a business increases as the size and profitability of that business decreases.
<P>
The Government have clearly abandoned the principle of social justice and understood the damaging impact on business and jobs that higher compensation would have, but they have stopped there. Why have they not allowed their logic to proceed a little further by understanding that the appropriate way forward would be to set the compensation according to the size of the business? They must recognise the fact that some smaller businesses will not be able to continue trading if they have to pay compensation of &#163;50,000, whereas the big blue-chip companies can easily pay &#163;50,000, &#163;100,000, or an unlimited sum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am closely following the logic of my hon. Friend's argument. Does he agree that his argument for taking account of the size of the business in determining the award is reinforced by the fact that the Government have adopted that principle in other measures? For example, under the Competition Act 1998, fines will be calculated according to a set proportion of the turnover of a business. Why not apply the same principle to the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for that helpful point. He has also helped the Government by supplying a formula that they could easily use to adopt a more enlightened approach.
<P>
In considering whether &#163;50,000 or &#163;40,000 is appropriate, I presume that the Government have accepted that different amounts of damage could be done to different types of business and that, in some instances, compensation of more than &#163;50,000 would damage the economy or jobs and so outweigh the benefits. I should welcome hearing the Minister's thoughts on exactly how &#163;50,000 was chosen. Did the Government consider other figures?
<P>
In responding to the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, would it be possible to shed some light on the Government's assessment of the greater damage to business profitability at &#163;50,000 compared with &#163;40,000? Clearly, the Government have accepted the logic that there would be greater damage and that there would be a saving to business in having a lower level. I presume that the Government must have done the calculations; they cannot possibly have plucked the figure of &#163;50,000 out of the air as a rough approximation to the salary of a Back Bencher.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister, in his characteristically helpful fashion, will be only too ready to shed some light on the Government's thinking. Perhaps he will say, too, whether the Government, although perhaps wedded to the &#163;50,000 now, may be willing to consider other figures in the light of experience in one or two years' time if it seems that the damage caused by the &#163;50,000 limit is greater than the Government had hoped.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> We have had an interesting discussion. I hope that I can allay all the concerns expressed by Opposition Members.
<P>
Amendment No. 271 would mean that limits on awards and payments will be varied only when the RPI for September in the year in question is more than 1 per cent. I understand the desire of the hon. Member for Daventry to be helpful, but in practice, as the RPI, even under a Labour Government, is more likely to go up than down&#151;[Hon. Members: ``No.''] That is economic history, I am afraid. For all the comments of Opposition Members, that happens to be a fact. In practice, depending on the exact rate of increase in the RPI, the amendment would mean that the limits may not wholly keep pace with price inflation. In fact, the cumulative effect of the amendment, thanks to the miracle of compound interest, means that the effect would be quite significant over time. The real value of the limits has been eroded over the years because they have not always been raised in line with price inflation and that needs to be rectified.
<P>
As well as doing away with the need for a time-consuming and costly annual review, clause 30 is designed to ensure that the real value of the limits is maintained. We intend to introduce a Government amendment&#151;[Hon. Members: ``Ah.''] Yes. It has come to our notice that, as drafted, subsection (2) provides for the limits to move up or down in line with movements in the RPI. Our proposal provides that the limits should increase in line with upward movements in the RPI but remain the same if the RPI falls. The reason for that is simple: workers' earnings will not decrease should the RPI fall, but would stay at the same level.
<P>
The second amendment, which has largely occupied Opposition Members&#151;

<P>

<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I want to move on as I have a lot to say about amendment No. 272 which will interest Opposition Members. It would reduce the maximum limit from &#163;50,000 to &#163;40,000. The Government's objective in the compensatory award is to ensure that the vast majority of successful applicants are fully compensated&#151;it is a matter of social justice&#151;to encourage employers to set up proper voluntary systems for resolving disputes. That is in keeping with our overall practice throughout the Bill.
<P>
I accept, to some extent, that the level of the limit is a matter of judgment. The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) has tried hard to construct a theoretical case based on logic and argument and I hope that he will keep practising his skills, but in this case the matter is simple&#151;I hope that Opposition Members who were so interested in the amendment are listening to what I say. A limit of &#163;50,000 covers two years' earnings for 80 per cent. of full-time employees, whereas the limit of &#163;40,000 proposed by the amendment would cover two years' earnings for only 65 per cent. of full-time employees. That seemed to us a sensible place to strike the balance. I hope that I have clarified that for Opposition Members.
<P>
I turn now to the understandable concerns of Opposition Members about what they regard as the burdens on business&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am keen to continue. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will practice his logical skills in a moment. We share concerns about burdens on business. I appreciate why hon. Members are worried about the burden of a large aard,but as the hon. Member for Daventry anticipated, my view is that the burdens will arise only if someone is unfairly dismissed. That is a crucial point which should not be forgotten.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> May I suggest a rephrasing of what the Minister said? The burdens will not necessarily arise simply when a person is unfialry dismissed; the burdens of attending and defending a case at a tribunal may well arise if someone makes an allegation, even if, in the event, he is shown not to have been unfairly dismissed. That is one concern of small business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am always happy to entertain any suggestion from the hon. Member for Daventry, but we are talking about the limit on the amount of awards.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does the Minister not understand, further to what my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said, that by increasing the limits so substantially as they propose, the Government provide an incentive for people who might otherwise not take up employers' time on cases to do just that? Surely that is so blindingly obvious that only an exceptionally clever person could fail to see it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I know how energetic the hon. Gentleman is, but if he had waited just 10 seconds rather than leaping into the breach so quickly, he might have had the answer to that concern, which I was about to address.
<P>
In striking the balance and considering, since we published the White Paper, how to approach the matter, we looked carefully at all the responses to it, as we always do with responses to consultation. We concluded that removing the cap altogether might produce the unwanted effect that many disputes that at present are settled privately would end up going through the tribunal system, which could result in a change in the nature of that system and make access more difficult for ordinary applicants.
<P>
Notwithstanding the attempts of the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West to argue the contrary, this is a matter of social justice. We do not believe that there will be much practical effect on small businesses. We have heard that only 100 or so awards each year are affected by the current cap of &#163;12,000. For the reasons that I have given, we think that the limit of &#163;50,000 will achieve our objectives more fully than what the amendment proposes. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That was an extraordinary set of revelations. I am minded&#151;I will put the Minister's soul at rest&#151;to withdraw amendment No. 271, which relates to the RPI. I thought from his honeyed words&#151;woe betide him if ever he becomes a doorstep seller because he will be far too plausible for his own good in the role&#151;that he was almost about to accept our arguments. It would be possible to adjust our suggestion by including a catch-up provision if the first order had not been triggered because it was de minimis, and stipulating that it should cut in only when the difference became more than 1 per cent. However, let me retire from the field with amendment No. 271, in anticipation of the Minister's forthcoming amendment. It will not be especially congenial to us, however, because it will create&#151;borrowing a phrase from an earlier stage of our deliberations&#151;an asymmetry whereby awards can only go up, as, apparently, he believes pay can only do under new Labour, and will not cater for falls in the RPI, such as have occurred in countries such as including Japan, whose language he once quoted. That is unusual but it should be debated when it happens.
<P>
I am much more concerned about what the Minister said about amendment No. 272 because it became increasingly clear that the Government were seriously concerned about the stress to which we felt that the tribunal system would be subjected by the lifting of the limit. He made at least some gesture in that regard by imposing a &#163;50,000 limit rather than setting no limit at all. If such a provision was to have any effect in the real world, it would target the chianti-swilling classes and no one else.
<P>
It was interesting that the Minister reduced the proportion of average earnings from 80 per cent. to 66 per cent. I am not sure that the category of people who will now be constrained in the Government's unfair dismissal proposals are necessarily those who naturally regard themselves as soul mates of the Labour Government, although they may possibly be of the Minister&#151;I shall leave that for him to sort out with his colleagues.
<P>
I decided not to offer the Minister a prop by suggesting a &#163;40,000 limit and an order-making power to enable the sum to be adjusted notwithstanding the fact that it is also index-linked. It could have been increased to &#163;50,000 if it were necessary to target the chianti-drinking classes. However, the provision is a fairly long way from the average industrial situation involving a production line worker or someone who works in a service industry for relatively low wages.
<P>
It would have been better for the limit to stay at &#163;40,000, which would have meant a three-fold increase in the limit or slightly more than that. That would have been a fair starting point, and the matter could have been looked at subsequently if it was felt that it could give rise to inequity. The Minister's answer was not wholly plausible, but even an increase to &#163;40,000 will lead to significant pressure on the tribunal system because of the balance between going to a tribunal or, as the Minister delicately put it, settling one's differences with one's employer privately.
<P>
In the light of that discussion, as ever the Minister leaves me a little encouraged, but not wholly so. His explanation of the choice of the compensation limit figure was not plausible. I shall withdraw the lead amendment, but I intend to press amendment No. 272 to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 30 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Guarantee Payments</center></H4>
<P>
Questioned proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have only a few bullet points to make. I apologise for not having tabled specific amendments.
<P>
I am minded to think that the Minister is working along the right lines in clause 31. I expect that he will want to tell the Committee that it is all of a piece with clause 30, in that it seeks to remove the need for an onerous annual procedure. I understand that the provision on guarantee payments, consolidated in the Employment Rights Act 1996, is simply about making an annual review of time limits.
<P>
I imagine that few changes have been made. We must remember, however, that the review must take the time of many officials and, to some extent, of Ministers; and we should not forget the private sector, which is presumably consulted. If the Minister can explain it along those lines, I shall be happy to let the clause go through.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Employers make guarantee payments to employees who laid off for days that they would normally have been required to work under their contract of employment. The payments are made for up to five days in any three-month period. Those periods are currently subject to annual review.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry has rightly divined that clause 31 is linked to clause 30, which means that the requirement annually to review the financial limits on various payments, including guarantee payments, will be replaced by linking the payments to the retail prices index. Clause 31, in turn, replaces the requirement for an annual review of the time period for guarantee payments with a provision allowing them to be varied by means of a negative resolution order. I hope that I have persuaded the Committee to accept the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the Minister explain how subsection (3) will operate? I understand that limits in place before the Bill's enactment will stand for awards made before then. A need to take inflation into account will take effect only from the Bill's enactment.
<P>
I am slightly concerned, as is a colleague outwith the Committee, about the interaction of the new limit for employment rights. Two things are going on here. One is the new limit. The other is the fact that the two-year period is being reduced to one year; as I recall it, that reduction is being made by order. Those will both take place. I take it that where an employment has come to an end before the provisions come into force, the old regime will apply, and that the new regime will apply only from the time when the provisions come into force.
<P>
I realise that the Minister's answer may affect what advice he gives individuals. If he does not feel particularly confident of the answer at this stage, he may wish to write to the members of the Committee. That may well be the safest course of action. However, it is important that we should have a sense of how the provision will work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Clause 32 is consequential to clauses 29 to 31. It repeals the existing provisions for increasing those limits that are not subject to statutory annual review and the current annual review arrangements for others. I confirm that the hon. Member for Daventry's understanding is correct, but I am also happy to write to members of the Committee to confirm that in more detail.
<P>
As with the preceding clauses, clause 32 will result in a simplification and in administrative savings, and it will ensure that limits are not eroded by inflation. It also sets out the position with regard to increases made under the repealed provisions before the index-linking provisions of clause 30 take effect. I commend the clause to the Committee.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Again, the clause contains an order-making power. To be positive where positiveness is due, I concede that both the Under-Secretary and the Minister of State have been fairly anxious, and have taken on board the bitter experience of earlier exchanges, about providing for rather a lot of affirmative orders. In the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce), it occurs to me that some of his difficulties in relation to clause 28 might have been allayed if an affirmative order procedure were to apply under that clause. That is not provided under the Bill as drafted, but perhaps we may try to adjust that at a later stage.
<P>
I recollect that during our deliberations, the Minister suggested that the provisions in clause 16, which is identified in clause 33, will be dealt with through primary legislation. I do not know whether it will be necessary to delete the reference to clause 16, or whether a precautionary need to include it for some other purpose remains. Given that the Minister of State has suggested when debating earlier clauses that he would like to beef up the affirmative orders, I wonder whether it will be necessary to amend clause 33 to include provisions for those other clauses to be brought into the sweep of what is a rather healthy development.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The clause provides that any orders and regulations made under it should be made by statutory instrument, and that orders and regulations made under the powers in respect of&#151;

</P>
<P>
On resuming&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I had just begun to speak to the clause, which provides first that any orders and regulations made under it should be made by statutory instrument and secondly that orders and regulations made in respect of blacklisting, part-time work, and the power in clause 21 to confer employment rights on individuals, should be subject to the affirmative procedure. As the hon. Member for Daventry spotted, the clause also refers to the power given in clause 16, which provides protection for employees against being pressurised into opting out of collective agreements. As I explained during our debate on clause 16, we shall introduce an amendment on Report to replace the clause 16 power with substantive provisions.
<P>
That extensive application of the affirmative procedure is in line with the Government's concern, as explained by my right hon. Friend the Minister of State in our second sitting, that regulations and orders made under the Bill should be drawn up after the fullest possible consultation and that there should be the opportunity for full parliamentary scrutiny that the affirmative procedure affords. I commend the clause to the Committee.

<H4><center>Clause 34</center></H4>
<H4><center>Finance</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Financial provision clauses are always tightly drawn and I shall not speak at length. Can the Minister give any information, beyond that contained in the explanatory notes, on the effects that the Bill will have on public sector finances? The notes state that there will be small increases in expenditure, with one or two off-setting decreases that will not quite create a solution figure of zero. The notes make particular reference to the extra costs of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service and of the Central Arbitration Committee&#151;they state that the additional costs of the latter are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``under discussion but . . . expected to represent a substantial increase in its current running costs of around &#163;94,000 per year.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister and I have debated on several occasions the difference between ``significant'' and ``substantial''. I suspect that the figure might be four or five times that, but in view of the anticipated difficulties created by parts of the Bill, it might well be money well spent.
<P>
There will be other costs in relation to employment tribunals, but I shall not return to ground that I have already tilled. However, it would be helpful if the Minister could update us on where he is now and undertake to keep us in touch with future developments. Legislation does not come for nothing. We have talked at length about the compliance costs to business. There are also compliance costs to Government and the Minister must bear those in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The clause is a technical one that provides for expenditure incurred as a result of the Bill and as a result of amendments made by the Bill to other Acts. The hon. Member for Daventry rightly referred to the length and complexity of previous clauses. In view of that, I would not like to commit myself to anything as precise as figures. The hon. Gentleman will no doubt appreciate the Government's tight grip on public finances. I undertake to keep him in touch with the situation as it develops and will write to him as soon as I can give him the consistent overall picture that he wants. In the meantime, I hope that the Committee will accept the clause.

<H4><center>Commencement</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I simply want to ask about the commencement provisions, rather as I did about the financial provisions. The Minister has helpfully given advice in the explanatory notes about the likely timing. He said that he wanted to proceed as quickly as possible, as and when the necessary consultation procedures were concluded. However, it is clear that under clause 28, for example, there will have to be extensive procedures. Can the Minister update the Committee on the commencement?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall set out briefly where we are at present, and am happy to keep the hon. Member for Daventry up to date with subsequent developments.
<P>
The clause provides for the substantive provisions to be brought into effect by commencement order, so it is in line with common practice. It will enable us to ensure that the different provisions are commenced in an orderly and sensible fashion that takes account of both the need for thorough preparation and consultation by the Government, and the need for time, in which business, employees and trade unions can adapt to the new legislation.
<P>
In some cases, as the explanatory notes suggest, codes of practice and guidance may need to be prepared before the provisions come into force.
<P>
In other instances, steps may need to be taken under some of the provisions in the Bill before other provisions can be brought into force. For example, the provisions on appointments to the Central Arbitration Committee under clause 22, will be needed to reinforce the committee before it assumes its new role under the statutory recognition procedure in schedule 1.
<P>
Finally, on timing, it is worth recalling that the provisions on parental leave, time off for domestic incidents and part-time work, are subject to specific deadlines in European law of December 1999 and April 2000 respectively, and that they will be made in good time to meet those. Other regulations under the Bill will be made as soon as possible, consistent with sound preparation, and allowing those who will be affected the time in which to prepare themselves.
<P>
I hope that that is helpful and I commend the clause to the Committee.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have some brief points to make about Northern Ireland. They are, in a sense, informed by circumstances with which the Minister will be aware. People may work for United Kingdom employers, but their place of work or, to use a term of art, the place where their contract is held, may be disputable. It would be unfortunate if the Northern Ireland law were to diverge materially from Great Britain law in that respect.
<P>
The Minister will know that there are special provisions pending the conclusion of the details in Northern Ireland and that the assembly will not have responsibility for such matters at this stage. They are a United Kingdom responsibility that will require an order. However, I want the Minister to clarify the interaction of his proposals with what will happen in Northern Ireland, for the reasons that I have given and because of what he said in our earlier debate on clause 36. The obligations of the directives on parental leave and part-time workers bite on the United Kingdom, so those provisions must be on the same time scale in Northern Ireland as in Great Britain.

<P>
As the explanatory notes say, the subject matter of the Bill is intended to become a transferred matter under the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Assuming a satisfactory outcome to the current talks, it will fall to the Northern Ireland Assembly to decide, consistent with the 1998 Act, the extent to which measures equivalent to those in the Bill should be put into effect in Northern Ireland. I do not see any reason to be unduly concerned in the way suggested by the hon. Member for Daventry, but if cause for concern should arise, we shall consider the matter. In the meantime, I commend the clause to the Committee.

<P>
Brought up, read the First and Second time, and added to the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We now come to new clause 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I rise not on a point of order on clause 1, but on one flippant matter and one more serious matter.
<P>
The flippant one is that I was glad to see in the report of our proceedings on 16 March that you were described as Madam Speaker rather than the Chairman. I am sure that that is simply pre-knowledge of the future rather than anything else.
<P>
The serious point, Mrs. Dunwoody, is that you were written to by the Minister, who kindly introduced this document, ``Regulation of the Private Recruitment Industry, a consultation document'' in its draft form. He has asked that it be not widely distributed, and I understand that. This is my point to you, Mrs. Dunwoody, and the Minister may like to respond. I understand that we shall debate the clauses&#151;now with pre-knowledge of what the Government are considering in regulation&#151;on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. It is now effectively a classified document, and Opposition Members do not leak to people. However, an organisation such as the Federation of Recuitment and Employment Services could assist the Committee if it had access to the document in advance and could then give us a briefing, as could a number of other interested organisations.
<P>
What is the status of the document? It has been released to the Committee. Is it privileged? Will the Minister perhaps get over any embarrassment and say that he is willing to give it to responsible people who would not give it wider circulation, so that it would then be available to those with a professional interest to inform the Committee about what they think should happen?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The status of individual documents is not a matter for the Chair of the Committee. Does the Minister wish to comment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the matter, which I understand is purely for the purpose of clarification.
<P>
The fundamental point, as I believe I said in my letter to you, Mrs. Dunwoody, is that some changes and amendments may still be made to the draft regulations. In those circumstances, it would be unwise to distribute the document more widely. We would not want to set hares running unnecessarily. Purely to be helpful to members of the Committee, we took the slightly unusual step of circulating something that is still in draft, and not yet a finalised draft.
<P>
I am conscious of the hon. Gentleman's concerns about the matter and we were trying to be helpful, but with your permission, Mrs. Dunwoody, I ask hon. Members to respect the confidence of the document. The final draft document will be ready as soon as possible. We are conscious of the concerns of all members of the Committee in this respect and we shall move as quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am disturbed at what the Minister said. I realise that he is constrained by precedent and may want to reflect on it. However, he is saying that we can make amendments out of our own head based on the consultation paper&#151;I assure him that we shall do that if necessary&#151;but that it would be a breach of confidence, which we would not wish, to share the document with any other person, including those who are best qualified to advise us. That creates a difficulty; it means that the House will never have an opportunity to debate the document&#151;certainly, not if the Government persist with the timetable that they have already imposed on Report.
<P>
The implications of that might need to be discussed through the usual channels. However, it means that we are operating with one hand tied behind our backs. An unreasonable burden might be put on their Lordships, because they will have to debate the document if we are not allowed to do so&#151;by then it will have reached the public domain. If they debate the document, we will reconsider it in the light of any amendment that they deem it fit to make.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I recognise the difficulty in which Opposition Members may find themselves. I have made it clear why we are taking this approach. Obviously, I would expect hon. Members to use their own discretion in this matter; it is a matter of common sense. Hon. Members can use their common sense to decide whether it is wise to circulate the document widely, given that we have said that changes might be made and that we are acting as fast as we can to ensure that the document is circulated as widely as possible in time for good discussion and consultation. Our whole approach has been based on consultation; we shall not change that approach now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I think that the Minister is coming round to our point of view. His guidance is very helpful. Perhaps such guidance will be needed when interpreting other provisions in practice. I interpret him as saying, first, that we should not go around saying, ``This is the Government's final document'', or praying in aid certain phrases used in it as if it were the final document. Of course, I shall respect that, but I cannot speak for my colleagues.
<P>
Secondly, he is saying that we should not circulate the document widely as if it were the final document. The logic of that is that we would wish to consult only selected practitioners, to whom we could make clear the status of the document, which they would respect. Thirdly, the general point was summed up in his evocation at the start&#151;we are honourable Members and we do not intend to abuse the confidence that he has given us. In the light of that guidance, I can live with the solution that the Minister has steered us towards.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Those must have been the longest points of order that we have heard for a long time.
<H4><center>New Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Implementation of European Union Directives</center></H4>

<P>
(b) the cost which would have arisen from implementing the minimum standard permissible under the directive.'.&#151;[Mr. Brady.]
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Brady:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
It gives me great pleasure to move new clause 1, especially as it occurred to me that I might not have the opportunity to do so&#151;I wondered when the points of order would cease. I am delighted to propose what I believe to be a definitive new clause, which approaches the peak of perfection. No reasonable man or woman could possibly oppose it. [Laughter.] I said no reasonable man.
<P>
The new clause is, I hope, a tribute to the skills and professionalism of civil servants, who, in their great assiduity in drafting legislation to implement European directives, constantly seek to do the best possible job. I say that in an ecumenical spirit; it is not a new phenomenon under the new Government&#151;the previous Government used to experience it, too&#151;for legislation to be drafted in such a way that it goes some way beyond the necessary minimum required under European directives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I know that my hon. Friend, like me, would not wish to cast aspersions on the integrity or professionalism of the British civil service. The purport of what my hon. Friend says is that often in the translation into British law of European Union directives, and regulations, there is a triumph of perspiration over wisdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am not quite sure how to respond to that, so perhaps I shall not do so. We are discussing a phenomenon that has often been referred to as the gold-plating of EU directives. Some of our European competitors who have a different legal tradition and a different tradition in Government frequently implement, or occasionally neglect to implement, their EU directives, in a way that is slightly less specific or detailed and, in the final analysis, less onerous for the populations of those countries, especially the business people who try to earn a living there.
<P>
I have said that my new clause is close to perfection; it is also modest, in that rather than seeking flatly to prevent the Government implementing any part of the Bill that goes beyond the necessary minimum required in implementing the new directives, it would impose a little self-discipline, a slightly greater awareness, upon Ministers. During a Bill's implementation and, more importantly, the drafting and adoption of regulations arising from it, Ministers should be required to consider the extent to which what they are doing is not, as they have frequently stated it to be, simply a matter of implementing EU directives and putting them into British law. As I said, the phenomenon is not new; it would also have been of great benefit to Ministers in previous Administrations.
<P>
The new clause would make it necessary in those aspects of the Bill that arise from European legislation, especially the part-time work directive and the parental leave directive, for Ministers to consider that fact and to publish a statement setting out what would have been the minimum necessary changes in the law in order to meet the requirements of EU legisation. It would then further set out an assessment of the costs of what the Government are already doing through regulatory impact assessments, with more or less accuracy, but, more important, it would require the Government to set out an estimate, first of the cost that would have arisen from the minimum level of legislation required to implement a directive, and secondly, of the cost that will arise from the Government's own detailed proposals.
<P>
That would be of enormous benefit. It would be of a great favour to the Government. It would assist Ministers in focusing their minds on the task that they have set themselves of trying to control the regulatory burden of British business. It would have the enormous benefit of bringing all the decisions and considerations out into the open. It would be a matter of supplying more information and making it possible for Members of Parliament, the public, the business community and the press, in an entirely transparent environment, to see what will be the effect of the&#151;Mr Bercow: Excessive zeal. Mr Brady: Excessive zeal, as my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham says from a sedentary position&#151;which they may exhibit in implementing EU legislation in British law.
<P>
I would perhaps be going a little too far were I to say that my new clause, in its state of near perfection, enjoys the Prime Minister's support. But I am sure that it does enjoy the implicit support of the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) who, if he had not been so busy of late and had had a little longer to reflect on both these important matters and the Committee's proceedings, as I am sure he wishes he had, would have recognised the wisdom of new clause 1. It is entirely consonant with the Prime Minister's exhortations a few weeks ago, speaking to a business audience in Bristol, when he set out his view that the process of EU legislation, especially where it impacts on business and increases its costs, has gone too far. He made that clear, and certainly those who supplied his thoughts to the press went a little further, saying that the time had come to begin reversing that process.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Again, I am not being quite so ambitious as to press the Prime Minister's thoughts that far forward. I shall leave that to him, and I look forward to the introduction of his legislation to reverse some of the increases in costs, althougth that it not a matter before us today. New clause 1 would assist the Prime Minister at least in stopping the unnecessary burgeoning of costs and regulation on British business, and would go some way to ensuring, at the very least, that where the socialist Governments of other European countries come together to create burdensome new regulations in employment and social matters, the United Kingdom, at least, is not disadvantaged any more than other EU countries. It would require some transparency about the extent to which the Government were exceeding the neceesary standards. If the Government were to implement procedures relating to part-time work, parental leave or domestic incidents that were more onerous than is required by EU directives, the onus would be on them to explain why. Rather than having the comfortable facility of hiding behind EU directives and saying, ``We are doing only what we have to do; we are stepping into line through the social chapter. There is no discretion in this,'' they would have to make it open and clear to all that a British Government were doing more than what EU law required and would, one hopes, begin to throw light on those sadly numerous instances of the UK's implementation of a directive going much further than in many other states.

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that in addition to his justifications for his new clause, there is justification in the language used by both the Secretary for Trade and Industry and his immediate predecessor? Both referred in glowing terms to the American example, and expressed the belief that it should be a third model for the future. Should not that, too, guide us in this matter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Perhaps I was being too modest in claiming the support merely of the right hon. Member for Sedgefield. Clearly I have the support of a great swathe of senior Ministers and former Ministers across the north-east of England who, correctly, have identified the fact that the way forward for the British economy is to come closer to a deregulated American model which, again, I believe my new clause would assist the Government in achieving.
<P>
I shall not dwell, Mrs. Dunwoody&#151;you would not allow me to&#151;on my very interesting experience last week in Hong Kong, but, in much the same light as the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) may I say that the ability of a deregulated economy, such as that in Hong Kong, to deal with the enormous economic shock that it has had to face in the past 12 months should give pause for thought to Ministers who try to implement EU directives.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hong Kong is a fascinating place, but it is not yet subject to direct EC legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Indeed; I had already returned to these shores. However, the parallels are most interesting, not least in respect of the implementation in Hong Kong of a ``one country, two systems'' model, which relates to the United Kingdom and the European Union, especially in the implementation of labour law arising from EU directives and the different ways in which EU countries other than the UK tend to implement such directives. An unfortunate facet of the way in which we do business in this country is that, although we generally have a far higher standard of public administration and most other European countries, directives tend to be implemented in a more burdensome and costly way for British business. That results in the mountain of red tape, about which we heard earlier, leading to a red tape summit at the top.
<P>
Having worked my joke for the day into my speech, I leave it with the Minister's conscience&#151;he is a man of conscience&#151;to consider the benefit of British business, the British economy and the stated aims of his right hon. Friend the Prime Minister that would accrue if he were in a moment of enlightenment to urge his hon. Friends to support new clause 1. It would not only improve the quality of regulation arising from the Bill but set a most encouraging preceding for the wider implementation of EU directives. In doing so, it would ensure that British business no longer had to endure unnecessarily high costs arising from the Government implementing EU directives without their having to make a case for doing so.
<P>
It is a modest aim, but one that could bring important benefits. I do not believe that a reasonable person could object to the case that I have set out for new clause 1. It would lead to greater information and transparency, and greater self-restraint on the part of Government, and would improve the quality of legislation, especially in the implementation of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend has moved what might be described as a modest but perfectly formed new clause with characteristic charm and even some understatement. He has contributed to a new phenomenon in the Committee, which can best be described by reference to my reverie, provoked by his closing remarks about the interaction of the potential bonfire of red tape&#151;which I am sure the Prime Minister would want to initiate, and perhaps even kindle himself&#151;and the implications for participants in the red tape summit, who might be at some personal risk from the interaction.
<P>
My hon. Friend is right to raise the issue. He expressed it well, and I want only to draw on a couple of anecdotes that are directly relevant to my experience of such matters.
<P>
The only general points that I would make relate to the need for transparency. Even if it is not true, it is believed by a large chunk of British business that it is at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis our competitors in the European Union, let alone those with lower costs and lower regulatory regimes outside, because the red tape is interpreted literally in this country but more freely in other countries. The phenomenon has led some apologists for the European Union to create Aunt Sallies, which are then knocked down, about stories involving straight bananas and hairnets for fishermen.
<P>
Such attitudes foul the waters in discussions about the European Union. If an official in the United Kingdom, be it a district councillor or environmental health officer, wants to get out of a hole, he has only to say, ``It's all because of Brussels, you know'', and people believe him whether or not it is true. My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West made the important point that it should be clear who is responsible for such matters. To draw on this morning's interesting debate about the responsibilities of emloyers and agents in relation to agency employers, it should be clear what the rules are, who is to blame for them and what lies behind them. The motives behind new clause 1 are admirable.
<P>
I wish to share two anecdotes with the Committee, which support my argument. I shall slightly disguise the individual involved, but about 10 years ago I had a conversation with a French politician whom I knew relatively well. It went more or less along the following lines: ``Well, Tim, what is the social chapter''? ``You give me the social chapter'', he said, brandishing a piece of paper, ``and I'll sign it.'' There was a slight pause and he continued, ``Mind you, I won't do anything about it, but at least I will have signed it.'' That exemplifies the declaratory practice carried out not universally, but in some countries, in the Community. It exemplifies the culture of saying, ``Let us make a declaration of solidarity. Let us not worry too much about about the details''. That may have some affinities with new Labour.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): The hon. Gentleman is making a fascinating point and is attempting to cast aside popular folklore. Is he aware of the rankings of the various nation states of Europe in terms of their propensity to act on European legislation? He will find that Britain is not the most able, consistent or loyal country in such matters. We come about third on the list.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We are now having an interesting debate, but I am conscious of our limitations. I do not want to be paranoid about such matters but, when I was a Minister, there was a tendency to look at the United Kingdom and expect high standards of compliance. That led to more inquiries about our compliance than about that of certain other countries. For many years, I used to trade the joke to farmers' clubs, ``Could you tell me how many Italian dairy farmers there are?'' When someone eventually asked whether it was 3 million, I said, ``Well, you should be the Italian Agriculture Minister because he has spent the past 14 years telling European colleagues that he does not know how many there are, so he cannot work the milk quota system.'' However, I realise that the debate could degenerate into an anecdotal exchange.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I do not wish to indulge in further anecdotes, but the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) made my hon. Friend's point for him. It is so much easier to implement EU legislation at a minimum standard than at a maximum standard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That thoughtful comment draws me to the end of my anecdotes. As the late, lamented Frankie Howerd always said ``Let us return to the prologue''. I shall finish my story about my French friend. Having said that he would happily sign up to any social chapter, but not do anything much about it, a couple of years later he was in a high position in the French Government with some responsibility for European affairs. Our traditions are different.
<P>
My other anecdote is germane to the interests of my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West and accords with his new clause. I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) will not mind my sharing it with him. It is relevant that he is learned; even if one does not believe in genetic manipulation, his genetic inheritance may be important, because he is the son of one Lord Chancellor and the grandson of another.
<P>
When my right hon. and learned Friend was Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, I had the privilege of serving under him. He made a great effort and something of a fuss to get officials to draw up what he described in legal terminology as a ``Scotch schedule'', which was designed to show the provisions of the European directive alongside the provisions of the British directive and, with an explanatory note, to make some allowance for over-compliance, precise compliance or under-compliance. My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West has helpfully added the suggestion that such a provision should include some estimate of the costs arising from over or under-compliance.
<P>
Of course the operation was fraught. It took a lot of effort, and officials needed some persuasion to do it, but it was a worthwhile exercise which we shared later with several other Departments. The purpose was to look at the European directive systematically, to check our level of compliance and so, as my hon. Friend suggests, to work out some of the costs.
<P>
The problem is that it is easy to gold plate a European directive, or even to nine-carat gold-plate one, with minor and subtle additions that add to the cost without improving the lustre. To some extent, we have seen that in some provisions of the Bill, particularly those on the parental leave directive. My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West and others have said with some eloquence that the provisions go beyond the narrow requirements of the directive. For example, they appear to be much wider and to provide for more eligible cases than comparable Irish legislation. That is interesting, because the Irish have broadly the same tradition of law-making as us. That shows an element of gold-plating.
<P>
That may be right, and Ministers sought to defend their proposals: I do not go into that. However, we should know the Government's motivation; is it compliance with the directive, or is it a feeling, which may not be justified, that we need go beyond it? If Ministers want to go beyond it, they should come clean with the Committee about the legislative process, and add an estimate of the cost of the discretionary decisions that come on top of what they are obliged to accept from Europe.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall be brief, mainly because I am charitable. I do not intend to delve into the pathology of the Conservative party's relationship with Europe&#151;at least not now. However, we were given some interesting insights into that pathology, and at generous length.
<P>
I turn to what lies at the heart of new clause 1, which is the assessment of cost. I assure the Committee that the Government are committed to the principle of thoroughly assessing the risks, costs and benefits of every primary or secondary legislative proposal that may affect businesses, charities or voluntary bodies. Part of that process is the consideration of policy options, including those that go beyond the terms of a European Community directive. As far as possible, we ensure that details of the costs of the various options are included in the regulatory impact assessment that accompanies such proposals.
<P>
For example, the regulatory impact assessment for the Bill gave qualitative reasons, with costs, for increasing statutory maternity leave from 14 to 18 weeks. The problem with the new clause is that it would focus only on the costs, but which are important, but tell only part of the story. There is no mention of the benefits of implementing such regulations. I agree that industries should be aware of the costs, but they should also be aware of the benefits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I detect that the Minister is again moving in our direction, so perhaps we can come to an arrangement. He seems to suggest that he may be inclined to propose his own new clause, which would publish the benefits and costs of additional regulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Sadly, I am about to disappoint the hon. Gentleman. I would like to give some examples of the benefits that businesses with a positive attitude to family-friendly working gain from the regulations. They gain a competitive edge, as we have said many times during the progress of the Bill. They gain improved returns on investment, because by offering good working practices they can attract the right people and retain experienced and skilled staff, which means reduced expenditure on recruitment and improved productivity. Business improves because it benefits from improved morale, better staff relations and enhanced loyalty among employees. Academic studies have found that such policies can reduce sickness and staff turnover, both of which can be costly.
<P>
Such benefits sould be included in any assessment of costs. Those details would be included in regulatory impact assessments, which would be a more effective method of achieving what new clause 1 sets out to do. We already do most of what the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West would like to achieve, and I therefore invite him to withdraw the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am disappointed not only by what the Minister said, but in the Minister himself. From our previous deliberations, I held the view that he was an eminently reasonable man, and that he would appreciate the wisdom of following the course of action that I had recommended in new clause 1.
<P>
I also felt that his response edged a little towards the disingenuous in his suggestion that because there could be some benefits to business in having a higher level of regulation than is necessary under EU directives, it would be inappropriate to publish an estimate of what the costs would be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does not business, especially business that lives with such issues at an expert level day by day, understand perfectly well that proposals of that nature will impose actual and known costs on it, but regard the benefits that the Minister has attempted to set out as speculative and lying in the future, if they occur at all?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> My hon. Friend is correct. In a generous spirit, I would have been prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to the Minister had he been prepared to come a little way in the direction of common sense by agreeing to table a new clause that, in his own terms, would have given an honest and transparent assessment of the costs and the benefits as the Government perceive them. At least then there would have been a clear and open account, for all to see, of why the Government in so many instances seek to regulate more than is necessary under the EU legislation that they are required to implement. Had he been prepared to make such a proposal, I would have been happy to withdraw new clause 1 on the understanding that the Government would table an even better new clause, hard as that may be to imagine. I would have looked forward to supporting that Government measure, and I am sure that my hon. Friends would have done so.
<P>
I am disappointed that the Minister has refused to accept the simple and straightforward case for greater openness in the administration of public policy and with the business community. Such a measure would also make it clear that the Government are acting in good faith when they say that they intend to contain regulation, and even go so far as the Prime Minister in wanting regulation reduced. Many people in the business community have said that his statement is inconsistent with what the Government are doing, a view with which I concur. If the Government were serious about their stated aim to reduce regulation, they would not object to the modest proposal in new clause 1.
<P>
Given that the Minister was not prepared to go even a little way to meet this entirely reasonable request, I not only seek the support of Opposition Members&#151;I hope of both Opposition parties&#151;but reach out for support from Labour Members, many of whom have spoken of the need to limit the costs applied to business. At the least, there must be openness and transparency to allow business to see what the Government are doing. The Government must explain their reasons when they impose higher than necessary costs. I therefore wish to press the motion to a vote.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The genesis of new clauses 2 and 3 is a straightforward disagreement between the Government and the Conservative Opposition.
<P>
The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry believes that the provisions of the Bill will help the economy. Conservative Members disagree. The right hon. Gentleman stated the position clearly on Second Reading. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The legislation will contribute to economic prosperity by reducing staff turnover, increasing morale in the workplace and raising productivity.''&#151;[Official Report, 9 February 1999; Vol. 325, c.130.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have no doubt that he was sincere in that belief.
<P>
Conservative Members disagree. Our fear is that although many of the measures in the Bill are well intentioned, they will be counter-productive in practice. [Interruption.] There is some chuntering from the hon. Member for Eccles (Mr. Stewart). We are reinforced in our concern by the knowledge that we are supported by the principal representative organisations of British business which agree that the requirements on union recognition will be unhelpful to the economy. We fear that they will be corrosive of our industrial performance and will militate against labour market flexibility and the pursuit of multi-skilling, essential pre-conditions of competitive advance in today's international market-place.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Conservative Members are also concerned that the provisions on unfair dismissal awards will be burdensome, especially to small companies. We are anxious that the impact of the parental leave provisions will be disadvantageous to companies and, in particular, harm small businesses. We do not agree with the former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the right hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson), who insouciantly dismissed the significance of the cost of the parental leave provisions by telling the Select Committee on Trade and Industry on 4 November 1998 that the costs would be a tiny fraction of the total employment costs borne by business.
<P>
In that dismissive observation about the costs, the right hon. Gentleman showed his inexperience of British business, because neither he nor his successor has worked a single day in a competitive enterprise in the private sector. The significant point is simply stated: fractional or marginal costs can make the difference between a business surviving and going under, between a business keeping its employees on board or having to dismiss one or more of them, between a business being able to take on new employees and not being able to.
<P>
We fear the cost of the parental leave provisions. We are also anxious about the provisions for time off to handle domestic incidents, particularly as this is fundamentally a shell Bill. Much of what follows, as the Minister will have to concede, will come in the form of regulations. As yet, we do not know what their final form will be. Despite the Government's avowed intention to cut red tape and reverse the draconian increase in the regulatory burden on British industry and commerce, when challenged, the Minister was not even prepared to commit the Government to the proposition that the regulations on the Bill would be shorter than the 72 pages of the working time directive regulations or the 112 pages of the national minimum wage regulations. That is the basis of our anxiety.
<P>
I said, when I was experiencing sedentary turbulence from the hon. Member for Eccles, that Conservative Members were supported by the principal representative organisations of British business. I feel sure that he wants to be reminded of that support. The Institute of Directors said that it fears that the provisions in the Bill will sap the competitiveness of British firms. The British Chambers of Commerce said that it fears that the provisions will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``slow or stop growth in the small business sector''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Federation of Small Businesses similarly expressed its concern that it will be too costly and too risky to employ staff in view of the likely enactment of the Bill. The Forum of Private Business opposes the contents of the Bill.
<P>
We face a straightforward disagreement. Ministers think that the Bill will be effective in promoting rights and the competitiveness of the British economy by saving money that would have been spent if people had had time off without leave or if industrial relations had been worse and productivity lower. Ministers think that that will not happen if the Bill is enacted. We wait to see. They could be right. I am prepared to concede that our anxieties may not be fully realised. It is even conceivable that they will not be realised at all, though I am doubtful on that score.
<P>
My new clause is, if anything&#151;I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West will not take offence at this observation&#151;even more reasonable than the pinnacle of reasonableness attained by him in proposing his new clause. All that it says is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `. Twelve months after the coming into force of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Department of Trade and Industry shall publish a detailed qualitative and quantitative report, following consultation with representatives of employers and trade unions, on the impact on the economy of its provisions.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Minister will not just chunter away from a sedentary position to the Government Whip but will attend to the debate so that he will be able to respond intelligibly and tell us why he thinks that the publication of an annual qualitative and quantitative assessment of the provisions is undesirable. The Minister is looking anxious; if he wants to intervene, I am happy to give way.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I was hoping that the hon. Gentleman had finished his speech, but I was perhaps mistaken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I fear that the Minister was speaking more in hope than in expectation.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will agree to the new clause, or to something similar, or explain why not. It is obviously sensible for the Government to submit themselves to the test. All that the Opposition are saying is that the facts should speak for themselves. The Department should receive representations and then publish those representations, as well as the statistical evidence that it has adduced and its evaluation of the representations and of the evidence. If Ministers are so confident that they are right, that their proposal will be an unmixed blessing, that our view is wrong and that we shall be discredited because the Bill will be seen as a major social and economic advance, it is curious that they should be afflicted by a bout of reticence and not want to trumpet the success of the Bill&#151;soon, no doubt, to become an Act. I cannot see why the Minister objects to the proposal.
<P>
New clause 3 would enable the House to waive the provisions on parenting and domestic incidents in the event of inclement economic weather. If growth suffers, production falls, we experience stagflation and a spotlight is focused on the costs borne by British businesses, there would surely be a case for going to the European Union and asking to waive or relax the provisions because of the economic downturn. The Minister is giggling; I doubt that he is familiar with the provisions on subsidiarity in the treaty of Maastricht or the treaty of Amsterdam, but I am happy to tell him the basis for the new clause. Article 3(b) of the treaty of Maastricht deals with the vexed question of subsidiarity. It states&#151;this is the basis of my hope that Ministers will agree to my proposition&#151;that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community shall take action, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, only if and insofar as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can, therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the Community.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I readily concede that I have never had great faith in that article, but it has to be said that enthusiasts for the treaty of Maastricht did. If subsidiarity is to mean anything, it should mean that there is an entitlement for national Parliaments&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is moving quite far from the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am happy to explain, Mrs. Dunwoody, why I am not moving far from it at all. New clause 3 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In the event of adverse economic conditions, including any such conditions highlighted in a report under''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the previous new clause,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``authority shall be sought from the European Union to waive or relax the provisions relating to leave for parenting''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If our domestic economy is suffering, in a way that other EU economies are perhaps not suffering, it is reasonable for British Ministers representing the British Government and deriving their authority from the British Parliament, to go to the European Union and politely request an entitlement to waive or relax the provisions on parenting and the handling of domestic incidents for which the Bill allows time off.
<P>
If the Minister is not confident that that is provided under article 3(b) of the treaty of Maastricht, presumably he is confident that it is provided under the protocol on subsidiarity and proportionality in the treaty of Amsterdam, which carries the authority and, indeed, bears the signature of the Prime Minister. On pages 84 to 86 of that treaty, there is a protocol, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality shall respect the general provisions and objectives of the Treaty, particularly as regards the maintaining in full of the acquis communautaire and the institutional balance; it shall not affect the principles developed by the Court of Justice regarding the relationship of national and Community law; it shall take into account Article F4 of the Treaty of European Union, according to which the Union shall provide itself with the means necessary to attain its objectives''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that a record of the debate is being taken and, therefore, it is not helpful if he chooses to speak in a way that makes it extremely difficult to record his doubtless golden words.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> You are right to remonstrate with me on that point, Mrs. Dunwoody. However, I shall be happy to provide a verbatim account of each of the two extracts to which I have referred&#151;article 3(b) and the protocol.
<P>
My point is simply that the protocol refers to the European Union carrying through its policies. The EU has policies on parental leave and on the domestic incidents for which time off should be provided. However, the EU also has policies, the purport and probably the detail of which, as the Minister would agree, is to promote competitiveness, to boost economic performance and to encourage greater employment.
<P>
The Minister is a reasonable fellow; he must surely be able to anticipate the possibility of a downturn under any Government, because of the impact of the economic cycle. If we suffer a downturn, surely he would want the freedom to be able to go to the EU buttressed by the support of Parliament and say, ``Consistent with your policies, and ours, on job creation, competitiveness and subsidiarity, can we please have a time-out on these provisions?''
<P>
That is all that I am saying; it is so transparently reasonable and, so moderate in its aspirations that I feel sure that the Minister will agree readily to accept new clauses 2 and 3. We shall then have not only a legislative triumph for the Opposition but, much more important, a real advance for the business people and employees of this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> After my hon. Friends eloquence, I need not dilate on this matter, except to say, in prefacing my remarks, his reasonableness and his vying with my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West suggest that I must have a word with them both after the sitting. Having made that general point militarily, it occurs to me a tailpiece to his eloquence is appended&#151;new clause 9, which I have tabled. Under new clause 9, the Government would be given the power to suspend the provisions of the Bill in case of emergency. For the avoidance of doubt, I should say that new clause 9 was prepared with haste and occasionally the gremlins get in and are difficult to eliminate. I have identified a remaining gremlin. Subsection (1)(c) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an economic emergency attending more than one section of industry''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, the word should be, ``affecting''.
<P>
I am reminded of the saying of the great radical, John Bright:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The angel of death has been abroad throughout the land; you may almost hear the beating of his wings.''&#151;[Hansard, 23 February 1855; c. 1761.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
An ecomomic emergency could hover over an industry as a portent of its imminent demise. That would be unfortunate.
<P>
I sympathise with the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham. He and I want to give the Government a welcome measure of flexibility that they could use to suspend any provision if things do not work out as they expect.
<P>
I need to flag up the issue of unintended consequences. If things do not work out as Ministers expect and the consequences are not benign&#151;as the Minister claims and as we all hope&#151;but impose costs and burdens that damage competitiveness and weaken the British economy, a safety valve will be necessary.
<P>
I cite the recent experience of the Minister's Department of the national minimum wage, which raised a problem with au pairs. Despite the Opposition's extensive efforts in the consideration of the National Minimum Wage Bill to offer Ministers a flexibility provision to remove categories of workers by order if it became difficult, so rigid were Ministers in their doctrine that they must have the minimum wage, all the minimum wage and nothing but the minimum wage, that they were unable to provide that necessary flexibility in the definition of workers. Except for some specifically excluded categories, all workers were to be included, and that was the end of it. As they could not redefine workers, Ministers subsequently faced with the embarrassment of the case of au pairs, which they had not anticipated, had to strain the meaning of language by redefining work in the home in a way that I find legally implausible and intend to take up with Ministers. However, we need not go on about that now.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The point of new clause 9, which is not inconsistent with the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham, is to offer Ministers flexibility in the event of a problem or economic circumstances, perhaps that we in our wisdom have not anticipated, to waive the provisions of the Bill.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will want to heed another, respectable analogy. The form of the new clause, although not the exact wording, mirrors provisions with which I am familiar from my consideration in Committee of what is now the Bank of England Act 1997, which set out the new constitution for the Bank of England and the terms under which the Monetary Policy Committee was to operate. A section and schedule of that Act specifically provide that if it necessary to waive the operation of the independent Monetary Policy Committee for reasons of national economic emergency, that may be done by affirmative order, to be approved or otherwise by the House, and may if necesssary be extended. That showed some Government prescience and wisdom in envisaging circumstances in which the subject of the Act could be an unguided missile, and providing a safety catch so that if it were to go wrong, matters could be brought under control before damage was done.
<P>
That is our intention in this case. New clause 9 makes provision for a particular industry or group of workers, a particular category or size of business, in relation to the size of the labour force, or an economic emergency that affects more than one sector of industry, such as a major downturn in the labour market, or such as currently subsists in Japan, where the last thing that is necessary is an additional dose of regulation.
<P>
New clause 9 is analogous to&#151;and in some respects, modestly, slightly more comprehensive than&#151;the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham to waive the parental and domestic leave requirements in difficult conditions. It also stands alongside, and is very much in sympathy with, his suggestion for an annual report on the effect of the Bill. Incidentally, to return briefly to the National Minimum Wage Bill, that is provided for by the continuing existence and observation of the Low Pay Commission. It is no good having the machinery to inspect the damage without the machinery to rectify the damage or to put the machine in neutral until necessary running repairs can be made. That is what new clause 9 proposes. It is consistent with the thinking of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham. I hope that the Minister will, if he cannot take on board precisely that form, reflect on whether he can include provisions that might be of use to him or subsequent Ministers in a future emergency.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The new clauses are eminently reasonable. I would not go as far as my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham, however, and suggest that they are anywhere near as reasonable as new clause 1. New clause 2 relies on the unarguable case that we would benefit from more information about the impact of the Bill. It would enable us to take whatever action was necessary, be it in economic policy or to deal with any flaws that had arisen.
<P>
New clause 2 is difficult to fault. It simply sets out a means by which there would be proper qualitative and quantitative information about the effects of the Bill. It is slightly worrying if Ministers do not wish such information to be produced. It suggests that they are&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Frit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Indeed, perhaps Ministers lack confidence in their assurances that the provisions will have no deleterious effect on British business. If they really believe that the economy will not suffer under the Bill, why do they not want a proper analysis of its impact?
<P>
The Minister is being uncharacteristically modest. If he really is confident that his proposals will benefit the economy, surely he would want to take credit for that great achievement not just 12 months on but annually thereafter. It was most generous of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham to provide the annual opportunity for Ministers to bask in the praise of British business, which will presumably pay homage to the Department of Trade and Industry and thank Ministers for the increased burden of regulation that has been placed upon it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend has stirred up a further thought in my mind. In tabling new clauses 2 and 3, I might inadvertently have provided the Minister with not only an annual opportunity to gloat, but a vehicle for his further ministerial advancement. I assure him that that was not my intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that entertaining thought. I hope that any further advancement would carry at least ministerial pay, which would be entirely justified by the hon. Gentleman's hard work. In the spirit that we have adopted in Committee, it is reasonable that we table a new clause that may be of assistance to the Government. It may help Ministers to take the credit that is due to them. Perhaps I am being slightly disingenuous, however, in that my own suspicion is that there would never be any credit to be gained from the Bill, and that Ministers would annually have to pay penance for it and accept that they were costing jobs and making businesses less productive. The information should be published and available for all to see. Members of Parliament, the public and the business community should be able to hold the Government properly to account for the measures that they have introduced.
<P>
New clause 3 is also an eminently sensible measure. It would be entirely consistent with the Prime Minister's objectives.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will know the standing orders in relation to Committees and repetition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Of course, I am entirely familiar with them, Mrs. Dunwoody, although unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham, I cannot quote them verbatim.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If the hon. Gentleman persuades me, I may do so. I am sure that he will bear them in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> They are at the forefront of my mind, Mrs. Dunwoody. I should welcome your guidance about whether it is possible to be repetitive when discussing different new clauses, given that my argument on each of them is relevant separately and in its own right. I shall perhaps take up the matter with you at a later date, Mrs. Dunwoody, when I could doubtless learn a great deal from your wise counsel and experience.
<P>
The critical point about new clause 3 is that it deals with the vital need to reduce the regulatory burden on our economy when it is shown that that burden is causing problems and costing jobs. There is no reason why the Minister should find the new clause difficult to accept. It would give Ministers a greater power, which is not something that they are generally keen to avoid. They would have a new responsibility, which would be a positive one. If there were unforeseen problems and difficulties, the new clause would give Ministers the power to address them.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham spoke in remarkable detail about the subsidiarity provisions that are relevant to the measure. I shall flag up a further question&#151;it is hypothetical and I hope that it will never happen&#151;about the possibility of the United Kingdom finding itself part of Euroland and not having the lever of managing interest rates to respond to economic differences between the different countries in Europe. If the United Kingdom economy was suffering, or was stagnant when other parts of Europe were not, in the absence of the interest rate tool to respond to differences in economic terms, it would be necessary for Ministers to seek some relaxation or flexibility in the weight of regulations that apply in different parts of the labour market. Otherwise, they could be faced with the enormous problems that result from mass migration from the parts of Europe where there is high unemployment to those where it is perceived that there are more jobs.
<P>
Given the Government's stated aim to take us into the single currency, when the interest rate tool will not be available to manage fluctuations and differences, the powers under new clause 3 would be of enormous benefit in helping the Government to manage the economy.
<P>
New clause 9 is sensible in that it would allow the supension of measures that were found to be damaging to an industry or a group of workers. It is hard to see how any Government who have the best interests of British industry or its employees at heart, would not wish to have the powers to suspend&#151;not to remove or repeal measures, which Governments can do through the parliamentary process&#151;measures that are found to be harmful.
<P>
In that spirit, I support new clause 9, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, and I support my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham in his admirable new clauses 2 and 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> As always, I have listened with great interest to the arguments elaborated by Conservative Members. My attention hardly wandered at all. I shall deal with each of the new clauses in order.
<P>
In respect of new clause 2, I recognise the hon. Member for Buckingham's concern about the need to consider the Bill's impact on the economy. It is common sense; we all share that view. It is clearly sensible for any Government to be aware of any such impact, so that they can gauge which provisions are successful and judge whether further refinement is needed. However, I have already explained that, when making primary or secondary legislation, the Government publish a regulatory impact assessment, which assesses the likely impact of the measures on the economy.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall confirm how we intend to monitor the Bill's effectiveness. We shall monitor and evaluate the effect of the take-up of parental leave and the changes in maternity rights. The employment tribunal service will monitor the number of applications made and the resulting awards. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service and the Central Arbitration Committee will monitor the number of requests made for their involvement in recognition procedures. The CAC will monitor the number of applications made to use statutory procedures. The regular workplace employee relations survey will enable us to trace changes resulting from the Bill and related legislation. Of course, employers and trade unions will have an input into all those forms of monitoring.
<P>
Small businesses are of concern not only to Conservative Members but to all members of the Committee, and we are setting up the small business service. That will doubtless have a powerful voice, and monitor the effect of all the measures on small businesses.
<P>
I have outlined a far more flexible and satisfactory way to assess the impact of the Bill. It would also be more effective than what is proposed in new clause 2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> We have shared the contents of the hon. Member for Buckingham's mind at great length already, and mighty as my imagination is, I cannot conceive of there being anything further to add.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way, so that I can prove him wrong?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister is not giving way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I would like to share my view of new clause 2 with the Committee&#151;and with the hon. Member for Buckingham. I fear that it would be bureaucratic and of doubtful value. I know that he is cautious about unintended consequences, but adding to the weight of bureaucracy may be an unintended consequence of the new clause. The Bill is, in part, enabling legislation. The regulations that it will empower the Secretary of State to make, subject to Parliament's agreement, will come into effect as soon as possible after Royal Assent, consistent, of course, with thorough preparation and consultation. However, the impact that the regulations will have on the economy will vary. To have a nil return in an annual report against those regulations that did not bear fruit would be of no value whatever. New clause 2 would be impractical and bureaucratic. I am not inclined to support it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> No, I have already given my views on the contents of the hon. Gentleman's mind on this matter. I now move to new clause 3.
<P>
Again, I shall be remarkably brief; the clause will be unworkable. The hon. Gentleman has exhaustively shared with us his knowledge of how Europe works, but also revealed his ignorance of how markets work, and particularly how the single market works. New clause 3 would be counter-productive to our economy. The directives that issue from Europe are mostly about making the single market operative. What would happen if member states were allowed to pick and choose which bits of which directives they did not want to apply? Allowing directives to be applied or disapplied in the way that he suggests would result in anarchy.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The hon. Gentleman's constant bouncing up and down further reveals his ignorance about the important place that rules and regulations have in the conduct of an orderly and effective market. We believe&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> We believe that the single European market is of great benefit to this country and we would not do anything that would result in its becoming ineffective and inefficient. Frankly, I am surprised that the hon. Member for Buckingham would suggest anything that would undermine the effective working of the market place.
<P>
I shall be even briefer in replying to the hon. Member for Daventry on new clause 9. What I said about EC directives in response to new clause 3 is relevant to that new clause, so I shall not repeat it. The wording of new clause 9 is, for the hon. Gentleman, uncharacteristically disproportionate. The proposal seems to contradict the expressions of support for employment rights that the hon. Member for Daventry volunteered during earlier sittings, notwithstanding his ususal caveats. It is completely out of proportion; we are discussing a cost to employers of about 5p per worker per week. The language employed in the amendment is inappropriate to the scale of the proposal and the remedies are unnecessary.
<P>
For those reasons I hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw the new clause. If he does not do so, I shall be driven to oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Minister's response to the new clauses was spectacularly disappointing and inadequate. I imagine that the Minister is a reasonable fellow in most circumstances. He knows that his was a downmarket effort at a response.
<P>
I shall deal with the Minister's arguments in turn. First, it is absurd and disingenuous to pray in aid opposition to bureaucracy when he is the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry in a Government that have imposed 2,400 additional and burdensome regulations on business in 22 months. It beggars belief that he has the brass neck to claim to be the inveterate opponent of bureaucracy. No significant increase in bureaucracy would result from new clauses 2 and 3; the Minister knows that perfectly well. If he is so opposed to bureaucracy, why, in the light of the red tape summit, the Prime Minister's speech in Europe, and the comments of the Secretary of State and his immediate predecessor, is he not prepared to gaurantee that the length of the regulations appertaining to the Bill will be shorter than those relating to the working time directive and the national minimum wage? If he were prepared to do so, I would at least respect his bona fides as a determined opponent of bureaucracy. Given that he is not prepared to make such a commitment, his claim is ludicrous.
<P>
Businesses that are hit by these measures will not be reassured by the fact that Ministers have collated statistics and perhaps even published them. They will be interested in observing a qualitative assessment based on a range of different views on the impact of the Bill. That is all we ask. It is so reasonable that the Minister knows that he has no coherent arguments against it, therefore he prays in aid a bogus argument, or an apology for a reason. That is regrettable.
<P>
As to the European Union, the Minister has red boxes full of briefing papers on those aspects of the single market that are relevant to the discharge of his obligations. He must know something about the single market and I politely suggest that he is not the only person who knows something about it. Those of us who have long studied that subject and the wider issue of British-European relations are familiar with the issues too. In the event of inclement economic weather, the new clause would provide that the Minister, buttressed by the British Parliament, should have the freedom to go to the European Union and ask a question. That is what I said; it was deliberately or accidentally misrepresented by him. I asked if we could waive or relax the provisions relating to the parenting and the handling of domestic incidents. That was my challenge to the Minister. For him to wax eloquent about a threat to the operation of the single market is ridiculous.
<P>
The Minister believes that our request, for that is what it is, cannot be met. It is the chapter to which he voluntarily signed up that has militated against flexibility and the entitlement to national self-government in relation to such matters that previously obtained. It will not do for the Minister to blame us for the pickle into which he and his right hon. and hon. Friends have got themselves.
<P>
What we are asking for is reasonable. We want an annual qualitative assessment of the impact of the Bill and the entitlement to ask the EU whether we can relax or waive the provisions for a specified time because we are suffering difficulties that other countries are not. New clause 9 covers particular sectors that are being affected adversely, albeit only temporarily. Can they be granted relief? Furthermore, can particular types or sizes of business that are suffering deleterious effects from the measure be offered some relief? Can they be offered light at the end of the tunnel?
<P>
The Minister has not responded satisfactorily to our requests. I am saddened by that, because I still think that he is basically a decent and honourable man. I will not hold that against him&#151;or, at least, not for too long. His unreasonableness, obstinacy, and imperviousness to rational argument forces me to press my new clause to a Division.
