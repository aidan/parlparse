                           </strong> I want to raise a point of information first. The
Minister said that Manchester covers Salford constituencies, but it
does not. Salford is a city in its own right that sits at the side of
Manchester. The LEP might be shared, but Manchester definitely never
covers Salford.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000032">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My question
is about our concern over the signals the Government are sending over
LEPs—that is the crux of what we are saying. We talked about the
north-west, and Lancashire does not have an LEP, although it is a large
area where regeneration and growth are important. Does not the Minister
have concerns? We might be at 87%, but what about the 13%? There is no
regeneration or growth going on, and very mixed signals are being sent
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000033">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am very
familiar with the situation in Lancashire, as is the Minister of State,
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, my hon. Friend the
Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr Prisk). There is great appetite
in Lancashire, on the part of businesses and Lancashire Members from
all parties, to form an arrangement that, I think, is almost there. The
discussion has been about whether there should be a single LEP for
Lancashire or whether, to reflect some of the differences in local
identity and different conceptions of economic geography to which the
hon. Lady alludes, two LEPs for Lancashire would be the best approach.
I know that Members on both sides of the House are keen that the
arrangements are up and running. We will have further discussions about
that, so I certainly do not expect Lancashire to be without a local
enterprise partnership—far from it. In fact, the proposals that
we have seen are vigorously in the opposite direction, which is why
they have such strong adherence. I am confident that the local people
will be able to reach a unified view about the arrangements that should
be in place.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000035">&#160;</a>

back to our earlier discussion about London? The right hon. Gentleman
will be aware that it is precisely London that has accounted for the
rapid growth in the coverage of LEPs since our debate this morning. I
welcome the creation of a LEP to cover the whole region of
London—the area that is covered by the Greater London authority.
That seems to be a proper recognition of the role of economic
development across London. However, there is a question about Croydon,
on which the hon. Member for Croydon Central might be able to give us
clarification. Is Croydon part of the London LEP, part of the coast to
capital LEP, which I think it was proposing, or part of both?

sedentary position, it is indeed part of both, which is a significant
reflection of the natural economic geography that we were talking about
before lunch. As my hon. Friend knows, Croydon is very much part of
London, but it is also part of an innovative proposal: the coast to
capital LEP, which takes in a swathe of business activity with a lot in
common from Croydon through to Gatwick and down to the south coast.

co-operation are adequately reflected in the powers. We have had
evidence from different groups—whether from the Local Government
Association or from planners—that capturing this duty to
co-operate by creating LEPs in a statutory form might not be the right
approach. However, I will reflect on our debate and come back on Report

of incurring the displeasure of my hon. Friend the Member for North
Herefordshire, I shall touch briefly on the particular point that the
hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington made about the sale of assets of
the RDAs. It is absolutely right that the sale of any Government asset
should protect value for money for the taxpayer. We are required to do
that: it is the taxpayers’ investment and the taxpayers’
funds. The process that the Department for Business, Innovation and
Skills is conducting will ensure that the local groups who might have
an interest in taking on these assets have the chance to make a proper
case. It will also meet the principle in the growth White Paper that
assets and liabilities should be taken together so that there is no
possibility—which was envisaged—of toxic assets, with
liabilities left with local communities and the assets spirited away.
It is important that the two are managed together. The Public Accounts
Committee requires an approach that emphasises value for money, and I
hope that hon. Members accept my assurance that our intention is that
the arrangements will secure that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000043">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
151 deals with the “town centre first” policy. It would
put in place a statutory duty to ensure that local development schemes
have regard to sustainable development, which we have already discussed
at some length. We propose, crucially, that the schemes should also
include a “town centre first” policy. The amendment would
ensure that sustainable development and the “town centre
first” policy were permanent and robust elements of national
planning, that communities had legal certainty, and that the advantages
of new retail development complemented other forms of retailing. The
duty would ensure that councils would no longer fear legal challenges
if they wished to take decisions that were not in the
developer’s interest, but in the greater public
interest—the interest of sustaining our town centres. I shall
refer later to a fascinating debate on that subject that was held
before Christmas in which concern was expressed by Members of all
parties, as well as the experience of my constituency.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000053">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">The new duty
would make the rule clear and unequivocal, as well as making it easier
for councillors and developers to work together. Members on both sides
of the House recognise that high streets are vital to the economic and
social health of our communities. The debate to which I referred was
held in Westminster Hall and was unusually well attended, with 26
Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members in the Chamber. There was
unanimity in the views expressed by Members of all parties because,
albeit in different ways, everyone was saying the same thing. Our high
streets come in many forms in large city centres, market towns, suburbs
and villages, and the duty would apply to them all. As was said in that
debate, successful high streets require planning and management
strategies that are built for the long term, including effective
partnerships between the public and private sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As was
reflected in that debate, high streets have a special place in the
heart and habits of the people of Britain. At its best, the high street
is a place where people go not only to shop, but to find services,
access leisure facilities, and meet friends in bars, pubs and
restaurants. It is therefore an important part of the make-up of our
local communities, so it deserves to be protected and
promoted.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000055">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">High
streets vary in nature, from a row of shops on the one hand to complex
city centres on the other. It is not true that they are universally in
decline; on the contrary, some are succeeding—in particular, but
not exclusively, those in more affluent areas. Evidence of the ability
to turn around decline can be seen in some of the great city centres.
In Birmingham, when the bullring was rightly bulldozed, a vibrant
city-centre high street took its place. Manchester city centre has
experienced remarkable repopulation and regeneration. That said, high
streets have suffered in the downturn. There are 12,000 fewer shops on
our high streets than there were two years ago, so we must ensure
promotion of investment in, and growth of, the retail sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In 2010, 87%
of supermarket development that was given planning approval was for one
of the four big supermarkets. Supermarkets tend to build out of town,
because it is cheaper and more convenient for them to do so. However,
there are many examples of supermarkets having made a success of
in-town retailing, which has provided many additional benefits to the
communities concerned. It is a sad reality, nevertheless, that too many
high streets are still in slow decline. We cannot allow such decline to
continue.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Decline
occurs most often in poorer areas and is characterised by empty shops,
poor environment, lack of investment, and the growth of pound shops and
charity shops. The use of the high street decreases as the quality of
the offer is eroded. That is allied to the flight of the
multiples—the household names—to shopping malls and
out-of-town shopping centres. In too many high streets a vicious circle
of decline is destroying the community fabric—the shopping and
social fabric—and condemning too many of our citizens to
shopping and socialising in high streets that are not what they once
were.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
situation is dramatically evidenced in my constituency. The heart of
Erdington is its high street. I must have heard the same thing several
hundred times: 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 627<a class="bkMark" name="Column627">&#160;</a>
                           </div>“The high street is not what it once was.” People have a
real sense of regret as they look back to the golden era of that
street, and they want the regeneration that will once again make it a
place to which people can be proud to go. It is clear from evidence to
the Committee from the Town and Country Planning Association, Planning
Aid, the Federation of Small Businesses, and the Association of
Convenience Stores that regeneration is clearly needed to turn the
tide.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our proposal
would lay the basis in primary legislation for a “town centre
first” planning policy of the kind that has, in various ways,
been in place for 15 years. Crucially, it would ensure that councils
and communities have the strength, the certainty, and the vital tools
to promote their centres.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At present,
planning policy statements refer to and define “town centre
first” policy, but we know that such statements may be subject
to change and might be superseded by the new national planning policy
framework. As we have already discussed, the framework has not yet been
set out, and it may not include definition of “high street
first” in the way that is necessary. Unless we are able to make
progress in the next stage of discussions with Government, the planning
policy framework will not be on a statutory basis,
either.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
believe that the issue of the high street is so important that it
warrants specific legislation, and that it is necessary to stand up for
local people, and for councils who stand up for local people, not least
because councils are often threatened with inquiries and legal actions
when seeking to act on community decisions relating to planning
permission as it affects high-street and out-of-town developments. This
is despite the fact that they have complied with existing national
planning policy. The law that we propose would reduce the threat of
legal action and give councils and communities more freedom and more
power.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the spirit of localism, with which we strongly agree, the amendment
does not prescribe the decisions that will be made at local level. This
is not Whitehall telling town hall what to do. Furthermore, nothing in
the “town centre first” policy prevents communities
opting for out-of-town developments if that is the express will of the
community. The amendment, therefore, will not prohibit the development
of out-of-town retail developments, but will ensure that town centres
are given the priority that they rightly deserve in view of their
pivotal role at the heart of our
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
place a high priority, as I am sure all Members do—this was
reflected in a Westminster Hall debate held before Christmas—on
the regeneration of our local high streets. We are trying, including on
an all-party basis. We are trying in Erdington, and I welcome the fact
that we have made some progress in my constituency. Sainsbury’s
has agreed to move back into the high street, and I hope that
Mothercare will follow, having moved out of the high street to the Fort
retail park, despite requests from hundreds of local mothers who wanted
it to
stay.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the subject of the regeneration of the high street, it is right that we
should have public service facilities in those streets. I welcome the
opening of the NHS health and well-being walk-in centre on Erdington
High street, to which so many of our citizens now go. It is a matter
for regret, however, that the much-needed Connexions 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 628<a class="bkMark" name="Column628">&#160;</a>
                           </div>office has closed; it was a lifeline, helping out-of-work young people
to get into work or training, or to better
themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">While
there are some disturbing long-term trends that give rise to legitimate
concerns, the decline of that great British institution, the high
street, is not inevitable. However, if the public good is to be
realised, if we are to have high streets of which we can be proud and
if the private market is to flourish through investment in high
streets, it is crucial that we have a clear statement in the Bill. Then
we might see the public sector working in partnership with the private
sector to the benefit of the communities that we represent, built on
that presumption of “high street first”. I hope that the
Committee will feel able to support our
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
strong statement by Parliament on “high street first” is
all the more important in light of a profoundly worrying report
published earlier this week by the Association of Convenience
Stores—the “Voice of Local Shops”, as it calls
itself. A research project undertaken on its behalf found that the
number of vacancies in centres across the country has reached 26,000,
and that one in seven high-street shops is empty. The ACS, which
represents local shops, supports the amendment. Its chief executive,
James Lowman, has
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We
need a change in the law and by amending the Localism Bill MPs have a
chance to show their constituencies that they care about the high
streets at the heart of their communities. This new law would be a
positive step toward ensuring the diverse vital and vibrant shopping is
a visible sign of the economic
recovery.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000367">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">Without
these clauses, communities could be left at the mercy of the big
developers who could use the crisis as a way of forcing through plans
for big out of town stores which would have a devastating effect on the
long term prospects for our high
streets.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000368">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">We
have already gained significant support from all sides of the house on
this issue in the earlier stages of the Bill. These latest figures show
that MPs must act fast and do the right thing for their
constituencies.”<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000369">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
powerful evidence in the ACS report relates to some of our
constituencies. Let me start with my constituency: in Birmingham, taken
as whole, 25% of shops now stand vacant. In St Austell the figure is
29%; in Sunderland it is 20%; in Watford it is 20%; and in
Bradford it is 25%. Those figures are profoundly worrying. I hope that,
in light of the genuine all-party consensus of concern, we will be able
to stand by local people, local shops and local high
streets.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000068">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I join the hon. Gentleman in paying tribute to the
work of the Association of Convenience Stores, which has campaigned for
the amendment and for such an approach. I share his recognition of the
vital place that our high streets have in our national life—one
that they have had for many years. It is important that that should
continue.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000069">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman is used to giving us history lessons, but we have a
piece of living history on the Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for
Croydon Central was a special adviser to John Gummer, who, as Secretary
of State, introduced the “town centre first” policy, so
the Committee has a degree of expertise. We should pay tribute to that
very wise and far-sighted Secretary of State and his choice of adviser.
My hon. Friend’s interest in the subject continues
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000070">&#160;</a>

                           </div>in our national life and in our towns and cities. I have great sympathy
with the intention behind his amendment. The clauses on neighbourhood
planning, which we have yet to address, provide a ready-made
opportunity for towns and neighbourhoods to specify that they want
their high streets to have a vibrant future, and to specify how they do
and do not want them to develop. That is an important opportunity. Some
of the proposed amendments to those clauses suggest that local
businesses should be given a greater voice in the design of
neighbourhood plans, which reflects the hon. Gentleman’s
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000071">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman knows that the place for “town centre
first” is in policy, rather than in legislation. That does not
in any way undermine its importance. It is a good example of an
important and worthy issue that one could extend, with any number of
other worthy issues, thereby getting rid of policy altogether and
legislating for everything. The subject is classic territory for
policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman mentioned that the national planning policy framework is
being revised in parallel with the Bill. He has my assurance that the
“town centre first” policy will continue to be strongly
expressed. Indeed, my firm intention of reviewing the policy to make it
more accessible and clearer will increase the clarity and visibility of
that policy in the suite of our national planning policy framework.
That is the right place for a policy, so while I do not disagree with
the hon. Gentleman’s case for ensuring that town centres come
first, I hope that he will accept that policy is, as it always has
been, the place to capture such
matters.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000073">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister is right that public policy can be
expressed in different ways. The clear message that we need to send
from the Committee—we are at one on that—is that
successive Governments stand by that commitment to “high street
first”. It is to be welcomed that the hon. Member for Croydon

matters—<em>[</em>

                           <em>]</em> It might have been
a small part, but it was no doubt a noble, historic one. There is a
clear consensus on the objective. The issue is how we give effect to
that, not least because, as the Minister knows, it is not just a
question of the regeneration of the high street and of what local
people want, both of which are crucial. Sometimes, councils taking
decisions in the best interests of their local high street, and acting
on the wishes of their local communities, still face
challenges.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000074">&#160;</a>

planning policy framework, we are content to have next-stage

my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington, and both would
place obligations on local authorities when developing their local

Opposition Members have a different view from the Government about how
best to deliver housing. The Government say that their approach will
deliver the homes that are needed. If they genuinely believe that, they
must support the amendment. If they do not, there will be no way for
local communities to assess the extent to which their local authority
has calculated the need for housing in the area and how it intends to
meet it. Without that, the fears that Labour Members have expressed are
likely to be
realised.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000080">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Without
wider, national or regional oversight, the sum total of local authority
housing provision will fall far, far short of the levels necessary to
meet the country’s needs. We have to realise just how dire a
situation we are facing. Today, the Home Builders Federation published
figures showing record low housing numbers for 2010 of just 102,000 new
homes. That is the lowest number since 1923, and at a time when it is
estimated that 230,000 are needed each year. The figures are dire and
the prognosis is even worse. When we hear directors of major house
builders, such as Rick Willmott from Willmott Dixon, saying to the
industry<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000081">&#160;</a>

challenge the Government, if they really believe that their new
approach will deliver the homes, to accept the amendment, because that
is the way that we, they and local communities will be able to check
whether it is working. It will provide the proof that the hon. Member
for Henley claimed to be offering on Tuesday. It does not impose any
national or regional obligations on local authorities. This is not a
top-down approach, but simply a requirement that individual local

in his new clause, which is a much more detailed formulation, and I
will leave him to speak to that. However, the principle behind the

set out at the local level the basis on which they have calculated the
need and demand for housing in their area, and to set out how they
intend to meet those needs. That is a localist way of proceeding. I

                           </strong> There is substantial read-across between the
amendment tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich and the new clause, and we would welcome the adoption of
either. The purpose of the new clause is to ensure that local plans
integrate land-use planning, and housing strategies and their
delivery.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000085">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
believe that all local authorities should be required to undertake a
strategic assessment of housing need and to provide the necessary
evidence to inform the development of housing strategies and planning
policies within their areas. This information should be a key input in
determining the amount of housing required—including affordable
housing and housing designed specifically for those with care and
support needs—and in allocating a sufficient amount of land to
meet
requirements.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is required not least because the need for housing is
pressing and growing. For example, we know that 1.76 million
households, the equivalent of 4.5 million people, were on housing
waiting lists in 2009, an increase of 23% over the preceding five
years. We also know that housing need will continue to rise steeply in
the coming years, because Government projections suggest that nearly
258,000 new households will form every year in England between 2006 and
2026. More than 2.7 million people in England are living in overcrowded
homes, and that figure is expected to rise to more than 3
million by 2011-12.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As I have
said, we also know that the Government’s hasty decision to
revoke the regional spatial strategies has proved hugely damaging to
house building in this country. It has created a vacuum at the heart of
the planning system and, as we have rehearsed in Committee, plans for
more than 200,000 homes have been scrapped. Indeed, research
commissioned by the National Housing Federation and carried out by
Tetlow King Planning shows that the Government’s directive in
May 2010 permitting councils to ignore the regional targets has allowed
plans for 201,500 homes to be dropped. The industry expects that figure
to rise to at least 300,000 over the next 12 months.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In addition,
research by the Home Builders Federation shows that during 2010, as
those reforms took effect, there was a steady fall in the number of
planning permissions granted to developers for new homes in
England—from more than 40,000 in the first quarter to slightly
more than 30,000 in the third quarter. The results for the third
quarter showed how planning permissions to build new homes have dropped
alarmingly from 2007-08 levels and are now at one of the lowest levels
for the past five years.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000089">&#160;</a>

                        <p>On the evidence so far,
failure is within his grasp. A step towards success would be the
acceptance of the amendment proposed by my right hon. Friend the Member

                        <p class="tabbed">I stress that
new clause 6 would not impose national or regional targets on local
authorities. Local authorities would be free to address the housing
need in their areas as they see fit, and to arrive at local plans in
full consultation with local people and communities. Amendment 188
would, however, help to ensure that all local authorities properly
assess housing need in their areas and set out how they intend to
address that need. It would ensure that local authorities make robust
assessments of housing need to inform their new local plans based on
the collection, analysis and publication of data on affordable and
other housing needs, particularly for the most vulnerable in our
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If local
authorities clearly set out in local plans how they intend to address
housing need, crucially, local people will be far better placed to hold
their local authority to account on the success or otherwise that it
has achieved. If clear aspirations are not set, local people are likely
to find it difficult to assess how well their local authority is
performing. New clause 6 would be entirely consistent with the aims of
improving transparency and helping to enable local people to gain a
clear understanding of what their local authority is planning in
relation to housing delivery. It would also be consistent with the
Conservative party’s own document “Open Source
Planning”, which I read avidly not quite nightly. The document
sets out that in developing their local plans, councils will be
expected to ensure, as a
minimum,<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000094">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

provision of good data by the local planning authority to the electors

                        <p class="tabbed">Surely
Ministers accept that local communities and authorities will not be
able to develop, in the words of “Open Source Planning”,
their “vision for the development” needed in their area,
and will not be able to plan effectively to meet the need for housing,
without the provision of good data. Ministers must also surely accept
that such data are essential to enable local people to hold their
councils to
account.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000097">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
want greater collaboration and involvement of local people and
communities in the planning system. We all share that clear
objective—it is common ground across the House—but we
must ask the Government how it will be possible to achieve it without a
detailed analysis of housing need. Surely there is a clear need for
evidence about local housing need, including the need for social rented
and affordable housing. Local citizens deserve nothing less, and they
also deserve nothing less than an evidence base that would allow local
councillors and local authorities to lead the debate about the benefits
of housing development by, for example, demonstrating its importance in
addressing housing affordability and creating employment opportunities.
Such evidence would allow councils to do that in a sensible way and,
crucially, it would allow citizens’ voices to be heard in the
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000098">&#160;</a>

welcome the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for
Birmingham, Erdington, and my right hon. Friend the Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich, because housing and the availability of housing
are probably the biggest issues in my constituency. When I have my
advice surgeries on Friday afternoon, person after person comes in to
speak to me about the lack of housing, particularly affordable housing.
It is important that local authorities across the country understand
existing
requirements.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000101">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
first point is that I understand the lack of prescription in the
amendments, and the point about local authorities doing the research
themselves, but the housing needs of my constituents will not be solved
in Lewisham alone. Given the availability of land in the inner city, we
have to look at how local authorities can work together to address
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000102">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
second point—as I said, this will be a brief contribution; I am
sure everyone will be relieved by that—is that the assessment of
need is important as well, because we need to think about our changing
population. Yesterday, I spoke at a National Housing Federation event
that marked the launch of “Breaking the mould: Re-visioning
older people’s housing”, a report that looks at the
housing needs of older people. Considering the changes in demographics,
it is incumbent on us to ensure that people have suitable housing in
later life. In the UK, 8.5 million people are over the age of 65. By
2031, that will increase to 15.8 million. There are distinct regional
differences, particularly for the over-85s, who have very specific
housing needs. In London, the number of over-85s will increase by 25%
over the next 10 years. In the home counties, that group will increase
by 100%. There is, therefore, a large challenge, but having an ageing
population is a great opportunity, too; I do not want to talk
negatively about our population ageing. However, we must do something
to ensure that people have suitable
homes.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At
the event yesterday, I was struck by the comments of a gentleman who
was promoting an extra care scheme in north London. He was shocked by
the hostility towards the proposed development. Members of the
Committee may wonder, “What’s not to like about an extra
care scheme?” but residents in the area say that it is too big,
too wide or too ugly. There is always a reason to be against something.
We need to ensure that the public sector can assess what is required,
collate the evidence and then have a debate with the public about what
needs to
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000104">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Many communities are fearful of change, and
that is one of the initial obstacles that we need to get over to win
the debate on why housing needs to be built in this country. In my
experience, housing development is a bit of a dirty word, and I suspect
that, when we get into neighbourhood planning, we will get into that
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000106">&#160;</a>

vulnerable groups have housing needs. I mentioned the elderly
population, but the recently homeless and women who have suffered
domestic violence are two other groups. Trying to find sites for
homeless hostels is hard, because there is a huge amount of fear about
the way that those sorts of facilities will be managed. It sometimes
takes a brave local authority and a brave local councillor to stand up
and say that it can be made to
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000107">&#160;</a>

mentioned the provision of Gypsy and Traveller sites in relation to the
revocation of the regional spatial strategies and some of the proposed
changes to neighbourhood planning. I am skipping forward a bit, but how
many neighbourhood plans will say that they want a Gypsy and Traveller
site in their community? Equally, with the revocation of regional
spatial strategies, there will be no requirement for a certain number
of pitches to be provided in overall
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000108">&#160;</a>

who is committed to ensuring that there is a responsible view towards
housing provision for all sections of the community. In the whole
country, however, London will be unique, because there will be no
regional framework anywhere else. That could result in London having to
make disproportionate provision for unpopular groups, because of the
lack of it elsewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000109">&#160;</a>

Member for Birmingham, Erdington. We share the view that more housing
is needed, and the statistics published on completions last year
reflect the problem that the Bill attempts to address. The previous
system turned people against development, and made it more difficult to
persuade people that development was in their interests; that is the
problem we faced. It is significant that, in England, the average
number of homes built during the 13 years of Labour Government was
lower than in every single one of the previous 50 years, apart from
one. That shows the problem that we are dealing with.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000111">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I will not try
the Committee’s patience by rehearsing the arguments in favour
of the Bill’s reforms, but they are twofold. First, if people
are involved locally from an earlier stage, they are more likely to be
in favour of development, rather than resistant to it. Secondly, if
people are allowed to share in the benefits of development, they will
turn into enthusiasts for it. That is what the Bill is about. It is
pro-growth and, in particular, it is designed to secure a greater
contribution to housing, so it is important that the changes are
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000112">&#160;</a>

provisions deal with the problem mentioned by the right hon. Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich, and the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington.
They have addressed the right problem, but they have given the wrong
solution. Despite what the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich
said, his solution is centralising and prescriptive. Proposed new
subsection (3) in amendment 188 specifies that a required
procedure is to be followed in carrying out the assessment. It
specifies a time, the form of the housing assessment report, and the
matters that it includes. The form of the consultation that is carried
out by the local authority is included, as are details on the documents
and information. That is a very prescriptive method, which is not in
the spirit of what he described.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000113">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister refers to new clause 6, in the
name of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington. If he
looks at my amendment, he will see that it is not prescriptive. It
simply sets out a requirement that the scheme, which is to be run by a
local

approach that we are taking is very much in line with the approach
preferred by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, which is
to require that there should be a rigorous and numerical assessment of
housing need. That is one of the key tests of the soundness of the
local plan, and if it fails, the plan will not be adopted.
Neighbourhood plans will be required to conform with that, too, so that
every neighbourhood plan, to address the point made by the hon. Member
for Lewisham East, cannot suggest a total amount of housing that is
less than the amount in the local plan—only more—so we
are very concerned to make sure that the test is numerical, rigorous
and defensible. The way that the right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich would do that is better than the way that the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Erdington would do it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000119">&#160;</a>

concession that the over-prescriptive approach is not right. However,
the thrust and intention of the approach favoured by the right hon.
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich is already available and, indeed,
will be required and strengthened by the national planning policy
framework. He is aware that section 13 of the Planning and Compulsory
Purchase Act 2004 requires a wide range of assessments to be made, and
PPS3 in the current suite of national planning policy statements
requires councils to undertake the types of assessment that he
specifies. I am not minded to put that in the Bill, for reasons that I
will come to in a moment. My approach is to invite professional bodies
to make recommendations for robust methodologies that can be shared
with members of the public, so that they can be held to
account.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are two reasons why it is inappropriate to put the measures in the
Bill. First, statutory provisions already exist in PCPA, and are
strong. The reference and, indeed, the practice of national policy is
very well understood and accepted, and we intend to strengthen it in
the review that we are undertaking. Secondly, as in the example of the
“high street first” policy, if we were to specify
particular requirements on local authorities for housing need
assessments, we would be invited to—it would be churlish to
refuse a request—specify, for example, the means by which the
economic development prospects of particular councils needed to be
discharged. I could add the environmental assessment. Singling out
housing considerably expands the scope of primary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000122">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am at one with the right hon. Gentleman in requiring an absolutely
clear, transparent, robust numerical assessment of housing need. Powers
are available in planning law to do that. They will be reinforced, and
we will strengthen their importance by making sure that no plan can be
assessed and found sound unless it conforms to a rigorous assessment;
indeed, every neighbourhood plan has to go beyond
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

share the views of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington, and the
right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich about the absolute primacy
placed on housing and making sure that the plans are meaningful and not
invented for the purpose of simply ticking a box. The way to do that is
through the powers available, consistent with how it has been done,
rather than by taking a novel approach that would lead in a direction
that would result in us encumbering the Bill with many other areas. I
ask the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington, to withdraw his new
clause and the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich to withdraw
his amendment; if they are unwilling to do so, we will have to decline

Minister. He asked us to take on trust the contents of the national
planning policy framework, which we know will not be available for
scrutiny for some time. In a sitting last Thursday, he gave us his best

available. We have to take that on trust; we do not

                        <p class="tabbed">We know how
much attention the Government have paid elsewhere in the Bill to
requiring local authorities to do things that they want them to do.
That is why there has been so much criticism from local government
about the very prescriptive requirements that we are discussing. For
example, the provisions on assets of community value prescribe in
immense detail what the authority must do, and how it is to respond if
a community group decides that it wants something listed as an asset of
community value. However, when we come to something as fundamental as
housing—the right of our fellow citizens to have a
home—his Government, dismantling the existing structure, have
not got the decency to put in the Bill a provision requiring local
authorities to make a proper assessment of housing need and demand in
their area, and to set out their plans to meet that need. That is the
basis of a proper localist approach: requiring the authority to do
that, enabling local communities to assess whether their authority is
meeting its responsibility, and allowing interested groups to look at
the sum of the local plans, to see whether they add up to what is
necessary to meet the national requirement. Without that, I am afraid
to say the Government’s position is a
sham.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000126">&#160;</a>

and he probably has as good a view as I have of the reasons for that.
It does not reflect well on the Government. If they were serious and
really believed that their new scheme would deliver, they would have no
hesitation in accepting the amendment. That would show their bona fides
in wanting to ensure that the localist approach can, for the reasons I
outlined, deliver increased housing. It would allow local communities
to see what their council’s plans were. It would enable them to
evaluate whether those plans were adequate to meet the defined needs
and demand in the area, and it would enable other interested parties to
assess whether the sum of the parts added up to the country’s
need. Without such a provision, we are essentially leaving the housing
needs of the country in limbo for a long period, without an adequate
framework for challenging failure.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

the Government that, on something as fundamental as housing, they are
trying to get us to accept that there is no need to put in the Bill
this underpinning for their localist approach. I sincerely hope that
members of the Committee will have the courage of their convictions and
will vote for my amendment. It is not prescriptive; it is not, as the
Minister tried to pretend, an unreasonable imposition. To be fair, he
did then recognise that he was referring to new clause 6, and that the
amendment is not prescriptive.

rest of the planning framework and procedures are sufficient to deal
with the matter. As I have said already, that view has not deterred him
from putting a vast number of very prescriptive requirements in the
legislation, on matters to which the Government attach importance. I am
afraid the only conclusion I can draw is that they do not attach the
importance they should to rectifying the country’s housing

might be helpful if I explain that I have heard from Mr Dromey that he
would like the Committee to vote on new clause 6. That will happen
later, because the Committee will go through all the clauses in the
Bill before we formally vote on new clauses. The Clerk has made a note
and will indicate when it is the appropriate time. At that point, the
Chair will ask the hon. Gentleman whether he still wishes to press the
new clause to a

Committee, I should say that as we no longer have two Doorkeepers, the
locking process takes a bit longer than the notification to lock the
doors. I have to deem that the doors are locked at the point that I
say, “Lock the doors.” One Member came into the room
after I had said that—I had a nod from both Whips—so I
did not hear that Member’s

amendment gives us an opportunity to explore the Government’s
thinking, to address some legitimate concerns and, we hope, to get some
answers. It is designed to explore the Government’s commitment
to the presumption in favour of sustainable development and to impress
on them the concerns expressed to us by numerous organisations about
the delays that the introduction of local plans might bring to the
planning
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000159">&#160;</a>

amendment would place a deadline on local authorities so that they
would need to have an up-to-date development plan in place by the end
of 2012, after which a presumption in favour of sustainable development
would apply. There is no doubt that the introduction of local plans
might add substantial delays to the planning system. At present, only
25% of local authorities have completed local development frameworks.
We are worried that there will be no clear planning policy at a local
level in the intervening period, thus adding further uncertainty into
the system. If one thing is clear, certainty is crucial in the best
interests of the community and the best interests of investors in the
community. In the absence of a time limit, the production of local
plans could add a further three to four years to the process, as well
as giving rise to substantial delay, confusion and
cost.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000160">&#160;</a>

the Government still of the view that facilitating sustainable
development is a key objective of the planning system and that it
should form part of the statutory framework? Do they believe that there
should be a presumption in favour of sustainable development if local
plans are not in place within a specific period? The presumption in
favour of sustainable development has been described by Ministers as
the golden thread at the heart of the reconfigured planning system. We
also understand that the Government intend to include a presumption in
favour of sustainable development in the national planning policy

amendment would ensure that sustainable development was not
prejudiced by plans emerging late. Local authorities have had since
2004 to get local development frameworks—LDFs—in place.
Under the amendment, the presumption would become effective from the
end of 2012. Our modest, sensible proposal is in line with “Open
Source Planning”, and it is certainly in line with our thinking
as Her Majesty’s Opposition. I also think that it is in line
with the thinking of the Liberal Democrats. If I am right, can we not
arrive at a sensible conclusion and make sure that sustainable

saying that the amendment would ensure that the community

to move it. Before the election, the Conservative party’s
“Open Source Planning” document described the previous
Government’s approach as “unnecessarily
complicated”. In the same document, the party that now leads the
coalition Government said it would “scrap CIL”. I
therefore warmly welcome a broken promise on the part of the
Conservative party in favour of a coalition of support across the House
that it would be sensible to maintain the CIL. However, I must say to
Liberal Democrat Members that, had it been the junior party in the
coalition breaking that promise, I fear it might have been against a
background of photos of Members signing a pledge saying “Scrap
the community infrastructure
levy”.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000176">&#160;</a>

amendments on the CIL would ensure that, crucially, it would be set at
a level that would not reduce the likelihood of affordable housing
being delivered in accordance with the local plan. It is vital that
when a combination of CIL and affordable housing requirements makes
development unviable, there is a clear mechanism that allows CIL to be
waived, in whole or in part, so that levels of affordable housing do
not automatically fall as a consequence. These amendments would ensure
that affordable housing was taken into account when setting the CIL and
require CIL regulations that make provision for an exceptions process
to be specified in the charging

Even the name of it is hardly a clear demonstration to communities as

made a few days ago: taking a year zero approach to these matters is
probably not the most helpful approach. We would not have started from
CIL as the legislation has been drafted, but it is a mechanism that
gets money into communities to assist with the infrastructure needs
that come with development. It is part of the package of measures that
I mentioned earlier that allows people to share in the benefits of
development and to have some recognition that the effects of

This is designed to replace the even more opaque system of section 106
agreements and put it in place a clear tariff basis so that any
developer contemplating development is clear in advance about what
contribution they will need to make to the wider infrastructural needs
of the area. That is absolutely right. One replaces another, so section
106 agreements are reserved for very site-specific issues, as opposed
to the more general contribution it currently

me address the amendments before us. It is important that there is no
point having the payment if it jeopardises the provision of affordable
housing, which we are all in favour of. Section 211 of the Planning Act
2008 requires the charging authority—I dare say that that was in
the minds of our predecessors—to have regard to the economic
viability of development in setting the charge, including a
consideration of affordable housing, so that needs to be taken into
account now. That is further reinforced by the requirement for local
planning authorities to have regard to the Secretary of State’s
guidance, which says that the CIL schedule of charging must take
development costs into account and should consider the effect on
affordable housing. We reiterate our commitment to that principle. It
is also worth emphasising that social housing—affordable
housing—is exempt from payment of the levy, so our commitment is
further reflected in that way. The measures and reforms that we have in

                        <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich asked about the use of
section 106 payments to pay for affordable housing. I have received
representations suggesting that the provision of affordable housing
might be a proper use of CIL. It would provide a greater opportunity
for revenue to flow into affordable housing if it were regarded as part
of the infrastructure of a community, which, in many respects, it is.
It is clearly part of the essential make-up of an area that has an
infrastructural effect. I want to reflect on those representations and
consider whether clarifying the definition in such a way would be make
things clearer and provide not only protection, but an increased
opportunity for affordable housing. I hope that the right hon.
Gentleman will be satisfied, but will also welcome my contemplating and
considering those representations.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000188">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for
that. He raises an interesting proposition, but he will understand that
clarity is essential. Until now, the assumption has been that CIL would
be calculated in a way that reflected infrastructure needs, excluding
support for affordable housing. If that is to change, it will clearly
have an impact on the viability of developments and on how local
authorities choose to set the figure for CIL for their areas. When does
he expect to be in a position to give greater clarity on the
Government’s conclusions? I do not object to the principle of
provision for affordable housing being within CIL, but there must be
clarity on how the process will operate.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000189">&#160;</a>

charging schedules can perfectly reasonably not regard affordable
housing. I do not make any indication that we will adopt the policy,
but when clauses are published, representations are received. In the
spirit of the debate that we had on other clauses, I think that this is
an interesting proposal. We will consider it and reflect on it. At any
rate, the protection, and the questions of the viability of affordable
housing and of the legitimacy of testing the rates set against the
effect on affordable housing, will remain. The protection is undoubted,
and I hope that that addresses the question that I dare say is behind

                           </strong> I want to express my general views on CIL and set it
within a context for the record. I tabled an amendment, which I have
since withdrawn, on this general issue of what to do with CIL receipts.
As a councillor, I was very keen on section 106 funding because not
many councillors knew about it, but my colleagues and I did. We used it
quite effectively in our ward. The funding is quite constrained, and we
would have liked far more discretion on using it outside the immediate
area of the development and on more specifically targeted initiatives
within the ward. Nevertheless it was very useful. I am pleased to be
able to make these comments, because I am confused about section 106
funding and how it fits with
CIL<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are looking to increase the discretion and flexibility of local
authorities on spending money. I cannot remember the figure for the
specific ring-fenced grants that are available to local authorities,
but it is very high. That money was freed up by the comprehensive
spending review and announced in the local government settlement. One
of the strong messages was that at a time when local authorities were
facing financial difficulties, they were at least being allowed more
discretion over some of their specific funding and direct grants. I
welcome that, but why do we not extend it to CIL,
too?<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
would be helpful if local councillors were allowed to use the proceeds
from CIL for purposes other than the building or upgrading of local
infrastructure. If they want to spend it on that, let them, but it
should be at the discretion of local authorities. That would allow
local residents to directly benefit from large developments in their
area. The authority itself may want at different times to share out the
CIL receipts when it is appropriate to develop areas other than those
directly related to a particular development. It gives authorities the
ability to time and phase the release of receipts to particular
projects. We seek to clarify that issue through any necessary
amendments, but the general gist is that we prefer the discretion and
would not like to see CIL specifically locked into infrastructure
developments.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000200">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Moving on from the hon. Gentleman’s
questions, I have a couple of points. My local council, Salford city
council, has some concerns about this, and I have some questions. There
is a fear that, even though a levy called the community infrastructure
levy is being retained, it may not be possible to use the funds to fund
required infrastructure. When the regulations are drawn up, will they
specify that the other person specified will 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 646<a class="bkMark" name="Column646">&#160;</a>
                           </div>be required to spend those funds on infrastructure? I understand that
infrastructure means many different things. In some cases, it might be
roads, in others play areas or youth facilities. There is a whole
variety of things that it could be, and those properly should be
decided locally. Will the levy have to be spent on infrastructure? That
is absolutely key.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000201">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are also
concerned to know what proportion might go to other persons and what
proportion might be retained, because, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Lewisham East has said, that is not clear. Too much uncertainty
surrounds the matter as it is specified in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000202">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have two questions. First, following on from my
hon. Friend the Member for Worsley and Eccles South, are the Government
concerned that councils may use the levy for projects that are not
related to infrastructure or business development? Secondly, some
concerns have been expressed about the loose definition in clause 95 of
expenditure. Subsection (3)(b) refers
to:<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000203">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>For
clarity, perhaps the Minister can provide the Government’s
interpretation of “ongoing

                           </strong> I am grateful for the questions, because they give
me the chance to say a little more about our intentions. As I have
said, we were minded not to repeal CIL, and we thought that it was best
to make use of what is on the statute book. We think that the current
definitions are constraining in a number of respects, as I mentioned in
relation to affordable housing and whether it should be considered part
of the infrastructure. We want to reflect on that, and I intend to
consult before making use of the powers that are available
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000205">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
balance must be struck in the community infrastructure levy. It is an
opportunity to have local people recognise that development is not
against their interest but contributes to a better community for them.
Indeed, the more they feel that that is the case, the more likely they
are to accept and even encourage development and so, as it were, the
cake grows. It is important to see the uses to which these funds can be
put as a means of encouraging development by allowing people to
participate in the returns. At the same time, that must be balanced
against the explicit and quite specific need to provide the roads that
connect the developments to the rest of the
community.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000206">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is worth reflecting, in the way that the hon. Member for Worsley and
Eccles South suggested, on whether the proposals are drawn in precisely
the right way at the moment, and on whether local communities should
have more discretion over how the funds are deployed, which is the
point that my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford East made. It is
worth reflecting on that so that we can achieve the right balance
between ensuring that we have enough funds to provide the roads,
railways and other contributions, and ensuring that we are making
greatest use of the possibility for people very locally to see some
benefits of
development.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
will, therefore, consult on that, and I want to reflect on two aspects
of it. Consistent with the approach that we are taking of amending
rather than repealing or replacing the measures, the question of the
definition of infrastructure is important. We must consider whether
affordable housing is a legitimate opportunity. In addition, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 647<a class="bkMark" name="Column647">&#160;</a>
                           </div>providing a piece of infrastructure that is funded through CIL and not
being allowed to contribute to its maintenance costs in the future,
seems to me to be a rather perverse situation. If one can build
something that is clearly a piece of infrastructure but one does not
have the funds to maintain it in good condition, we should reflect on
that. In answer to the question that was raised by the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Erdington, we are looking at the ongoing costs, which are
what we have in mind. We will consult on that,
however.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000208">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
other aspect, which the hon. Member for Lewisham East raised, was the
question of other bodies. This addresses directly the point made by the
hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South about neighbourhoods in the
city of Salford. We think that there should be an expectation that the
people who are directly affected by development should have some
entitlement to share in its benefits, which should not be kept at a
higher level. There should be some obligation on the part of
authorities to share benefits with the people who are affected, in much
the way that the hon. Member for Bradford East mentioned. We want a
proportion to be spent locally, either by the local authority, or, if
there is a democratic body below that level, perhaps devolved to that
body. Again, that will be the subject of consultation and further
measures in regulatory form, should we find that there is support for
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000209">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am grateful for the opportunity to air these matters. I know that the
council in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Milton
Keynes South has some interest in it, and there is interest across the
country. This is an important opportunity to amend the provisions that
we have inherited to see whether they could be made just a little more
pro-neighbourhood and pro-development, while not losing the important
prize of providing infrastructure. I hope that that clarifies the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000210">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I had not intended to contribute to this
debate, but I feel that I have to say something. What the Minister has
been saying is, in many ways, admirable. He is clearly wrestling with
difficult issues and trying to come up with the most sensible
solutions, and I wholly support that. However, this is an abuse of the
legislative system. We are considering legislation, and the convention
is that the Government come forward with agreed policy, and the detail
of how that policy will apply should be available for the Committee to
scrutinise so that we can satisfy ourselves that their properly defined
proposals will work. We simply cannot do that. We have been asked in
this whole section to accept a series of assurances from the Minister
that he will consult, think further and make changes. Unless he does
that to an extraordinarily tight timetable—when I asked him a
question on an intervention about the timetable, he was not able to
give a precise answer, and I am not surprised—we simply will not
be able to do our duty. We cannot properly scrutinise, because we are
presented not with clear, defined policy and the detailed definition of
how it will be put into effect but a series of thoughts on what is,
clearly, an evolving policy. The Government are ruminating, thinking,
considering the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000211">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
welcome that. In many areas, I hope the Government will go on thinking,
because, frankly, a lot of what they put in the Bill is not adequate
and needs further thought, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 648<a class="bkMark" name="Column648">&#160;</a>
                           </div>but I wish they would have done that thinking before they presented a
Bill to Parliament and asked us to scrutinise it. Frankly, it makes a
mockery of the scrutiny process in Committee. We simply cannot wrestle
with the detail because we do not know what it will
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000212">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As ever, the right hon. Gentleman tries to have it
both ways. In the previous debate, he castigated us for resisting his
amendment, which he said would be a clear improvement to the Bill. In
this case, we have received representations, including from Front-Bench
and Back-Bench Opposition Members, as to the desirability of including
neighbourhoods in a greater and more flexible way than the current
legislation provides, but he criticises us for that as well. As I said
when I gave evidence to the Committee, I take the process of scrutiny
seriously. I believe that there is broad agreement on many of the
principles of the proposal, but there is expertise in this Committee
and the House, and we have an opportunity during the Bill’s
progress through the House to make improvements as we
can.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000213">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman will know that CIL is available to local
authorities. It is not required of them but is an option available to
them, so the provision in no way places any burdens or obligations on
them. The only question that we are addressing—it would be
unreasonable to close our ears to representations—is whether we
ought to make the provision more empowering, but what they have is
there, and it holds. Determining whether we want to extend the
flexibility seems a perfectly reasonable way to
proceed.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000214">&#160;</a>

on the debates in Committee and considering that it is only two months
since Second Reading, we have made substantial progress. Leaving aside
the more knockabout exchanges, we have made improvements and
commitments to improve the Bill. We have some way to go before the Bill
completes its parliamentary stages. I made a commitment to the
Committee when we took evidence that I would be reasonable in
considering representations. If the right hon. Gentleman observes his
own strictures and makes no further contributions on the basis that we
are absolutely certain that the Bill will be amended in no other way, I
am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for North

                           </strong> I could not let that stay on the record. The
Minister mistakes two separate processes. He says that we have already
made improvements; we have not—the Bill is exactly the same as
it was when it was presented. The purpose of scrutiny in Committee is
to improve the Bill, but the Government have resisted all our
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000218">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The right hon. Gentleman is an experienced
parliamentarian and was a Minister, so he knows how to interpret the
commitments and undertakings that I have given to the Committee. Having
taken Bills through Parliament, he knows that it is not in the
experience of Committees directly to adopt particular amendments that
are promoted without their being subject to the House’s due
diligence and reflection. He does the Committee and me a disservice in
not reflecting some of the commitments that I have
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000219">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not, and I was going to observe that the
Minister has given a series of commitments that we look forward to
seeing delivered on Report. When we have pressed him for a timetable on
some such commitments, however, he has been, shall we say, reluctant to
confirm that we will see positive outcomes.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000220">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The crucial
point is not that the Minister has not given commitments to give
further consideration to concerns, but that the policy issue is not
clear. On issues such as the community infrastructure levy, he will
know that it matters fundamentally to local authorities whether
provision for affordable housing is part of the CIL level that they
set. If it is, they will set it at a different level from that which
they would set if they knew that any provision for affordable housing
should be handled separately under section 106. Although I take the
Minister’s point that the CIL is there for local authorities to
use, in effect, until there is greater clarity on that policy, they are
in a difficult position. It would be foolish of them to set in place
provisions that would have to be altered rapidly because of a change of
Government policy on the CIL.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000221">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government should not be reconsidering policy in Committee. Yes, we
should be considering the detail of how the policy is put into
effect—that is the subject of debate in Committee, that is when
we should be looking to improve the provisions in the Bill. The
convention is that the Government come with legislation on policy that
has already been defined, which is not the case here. We are dealing
with a difficult situation—it is like wrestling with jelly,
because on many issues the Minister has said, “We’re
thinking about this; we might change the policy. We might do it this
way; we might do it that way.” That is not how procedures should
be handled in Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000222">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Again, I fundamentally disagree. The right hon.
Gentleman’s experience from his own Government was in stark
contrast to this. They came to the House with Bills that were being
written during their process through Parliament. The most recent
Planning Act to be considered had more clauses inserted during its
passage than it started out with.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000223">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It has been
noted elsewhere, and all hon. Members would acknowledge, that
proceedings have been remarkable, because although the Bill deals with
a very ambitious and far-reaching set of reforms, a degree of common
ground has been achieved in what seemed before to be unlikely areas of
consensus. We have reached agreement on the shape of the future in a
way that many people doubted when we started. When it comes to the
particular issue of sale, I will only make the point that all we are
talking about is extending the powers available to local authorities.
At the moment they cannot take provision for affordable housing into
account. I said I would reflect, in response to representations, on
whether they should be allowed to in the future. That does not stop
them publishing a charging schedule at the moment. It is entirely a
consideration I am giving of a request to go further. That is in the
spirit of the legislative process—if Parliament exists to
scrutinise and improve legislation, it would be churlish not to
consider representations that are made. Many organisations in civil
society have spent much time considering the clauses of this Bill and
making suggestions. The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich
recommends that the Government turn a

long debate—no doubt to the further displeasure of my hon.
Friend the Member for North Herefordshire—and to speak in
advance, rather than saving my contribution to be a surprise at the
end, at the risk of provoking once again the right hon. Member for

                        <p class="tabbed">Our
discussions in recent days have shown that the idea that communities
should be able to have greater control and influence on their locality
is common ground between us. I think that the hon. Gentleman the Member
for Birmingham, Erdington confirmed that the Opposition favour the
principle of neighbourhood
planning.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000235">&#160;</a>

question that arises is how to do it. That is what I suspect the debate
will be about: whether we have precisely the right way, or whether
there are suggestions as to our approach. If we are addressing the best
way of engaging in neighbourhood planning, the question that arises
first is what is the definition of neighbourhoods? The amendments that
I am speaking to address this in particular. It is pretty easy where
there are existing democratic structures such as parish councils and
town councils—everyone knows that. So the first question is
should areas that do not have those democratic

we have suggested a number of means by which they can do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000236">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We will come on to debate these points, but I want
to frame the debate. What I am saying is that, if there are areas that
are not covered by existing democratic organisations, there is a
question before the Committee, on which I intend to take constructive
views, as to what is the best set of arrangements we can put in place
for that. Some suggestions will no doubt be made by hon. Members,
including my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley
himself.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000238">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
first question is what arrangements should be made where there are no
existing arrangements in place? The second relates to comments made by
the hon. Member for Lewisham East. There are local authorities which
are very progressive and very keen on devolving power to their
communities and neighbourhoods—those do not present a
difficulty—but, just as over community rights, there are some
councils that might be inclined, now or in future, to try to frustrate
the opportunity that we envisage for communities to define themselves.
So a second theme of the debate—again, I want to take a
constructive approach to this—is how can we safeguard the rights
of those communities who are being frustrated by an authority that is
not in the mainstream, not in the swim of the localist reforms that we
have in mind? There are arrangements around
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000239">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
ask members to bear these in mind as the key questions: what are the
arrangements where no democratic bodies exist; and how can we make sure
that we have adequate, but not onerous, protections for communities
against those councils—I hope that they will be few—that
may seek to thwart or subvert their entitlement? I said that I have
been impressed by the spirit in which the hon. Member for Birmingham,
Erdington has approached these issues. The duty to co-operate was a
good example of that. There are clearly improvements that can be made.
I am open to such suggestions and I hope that it will enable
members’ contributions to know that they have a receptive
audience and we can proceed on those
lines.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000240">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me address the proposals in this set of amendments. They are technical,
one might even say comical, in that the drafting of the Bill neglected
to specify that for a neighbourhood to apply to a local council, it had
to be the local council that covers that neighbourhood. On the face of
it, it would be possible for a neighbourhood in Tunbridge Wells to
apply to Birmingham city council to have its neighbourhood designated.
With your permission, Mr Bayley, I move the technical amendments that
correct that small
anomaly.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000241">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let me say from the start that the Minister was
right when he said that it is common ground that encouraging
neighbourhoods to have greater ownership of their neighbourhoods and to
develop neighbourhood plans is a thoroughly noble objective. He is also
right to say that where there are no democratic arrangements in
place—a parish council, for example—issues arise about
what arrangement should be put in place by way of a neighbourhood forum
to establish a neighbourhood plan. In discussing the amendments, we
will address some real and legitimate concerns that the Government must
allay, and I hope that they will accept some of our
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000250">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I want to be
relatively brief, because the amendments relate to wider concerns,
which we will come to in amendments to the schedule, about the
legitimacy of the process through which neighbourhood development
orders and neighbourhood plans are made. The amendments place a
threshold of 20% of those eligible to vote on referendums for approval
of neighbourhood development orders and neighbourhood
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Before
I move on to the reasons behind the amendments, I want to explain that,
as I have said, we are in favour of neighbourhood planning in
principle. Local decision making has clear and obvious benefits. The
people who live in an area understand its problems. They have views on
how things could be improved, and if their views become reality, they
will have an incentive and thus a commitment to make them succeed.
Therefore, they will—if we get it right—give their time,
police the detail of agreements and do all that they can to make their
areas pleasant places to live and work.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000252">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Any proposals
that seek to empower local people should do so fairly, and should
ensure that people with different levels of resources, knowledge and
expertise are able to benefit equally. The principle is sound, but the
question is whether all citizens will be able to avail themselves of
the opportunities in the Bill. It is also crucial that we ensure that
actions that arise from such proposals command a reasonable level of
support from the communities concerned, particularly where plans have a
material impact on the lives of citizens and where they live and
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000253">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is with that in mind that we have assessed the Government’s
proposals on the processes to make neighbourhood plans and
neighbourhood development orders. Regrettably, the proposals, as they
stand, have fallen short. The Government’s proposals are wholly
inadequate and run the risk of being utterly undemocratic in how they
work in practice. Under the proposals, bizarrely, it is possible for
only three people from a community to be involved in the creation of a
neighbourhood plan. As I have described, that could be three men or
three women and a dog in the Dog and Duck. Only three people have to be
members of a neighbourhood forum, and only one of those members would
be required to vote through the plan in a referendum. As the
legislation stands, it runs the risk of producing an outcome that is
both undemocratic and farcical. The plans have the potential to affect
the lives of thousands of people living in a community. We therefore
believe that it is only right that such actions should be backed by at
least a significant minority of that community.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000254">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
imperative for such a requirement increases when one considers, if our
later amendments are not successful, that only three people could
introduce such plans to make development orders and neighbourhood
plans. The purpose of proposing a threshold for the referendums is to
ensure that, crucially, there is a degree of legitimacy and acceptance
of the outcome of the exercise. We need to have a debate on the level
at which to pitch the threshold. For both a referendum on a
neighbourhood development order and a neighbourhood plan, we propose
that they are declared valid only if voted for by at least 20% of those
entitled to vote in that referendum. We strongly believe that that is a
reasonable requirement and will guard against a very small minority in
a community being able to impose their will on others, including on
those who do not vote. As I have made clear, we want neighbourhood
plans to have integrity and support from the community, and we want
them to be legitimate. Unless we address the issue of how we ensure
that they truly represent communities, there is a risk of the noble
concept of the neighbourhood plan being called into disrepute in some
areas. In conclusion, we hope that the Government take on board our
concerns regarding the legitimacy of the proposals, and either accept
our amendment or commit to return to this House at a later stage with
their own
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000255">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Parliament has debated at some length the question
of thresholds in referendums in recent days and weeks, both in the
House and in the other place. It has come to a view, on a very
important question that will be before us in May, that it would be
inappropriate to have a threshold in place. That is consistent with the
practice, as the hon. Gentleman will know, for various 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 654<a class="bkMark" name="Column654">&#160;</a>
                           </div>types of referendums we have had in this country. I think that the last
time a threshold was set was for the 1979 referendum on devolution for
Scotland. It is a major constitutional principle, as evidenced in
discussions this week on whether to set in place thresholds for
referendums. To do so in this case would be inconsistent with the
settled view of the House, which has considered the matter in many
different circumstances, even as recently as late last night. It is
worth pointing out that the requirement to have a referendum is in
itself a very strong safeguard. Some people outside the House have
questioned whether it is essential, and whether we should not just make
sure that parish councils, town councils or neighbourhood forums are
open enough, and consider whether either a majority of the council or a
single meeting should be
sufficient.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000256">&#160;</a>

have taken to heart the issues that the hon. Member for Birmingham,
Erdington raised about ensuring that literally everyone in the
community has the opportunity to state their views on these matters.
That is why we have included the provision for a referendum, which is
contrary to what happens elsewhere in planning policy. For example, the
adoption of a local plan does not require a resolution of the whole
electorate; it just requires a resolution of the council. The fact that
we are debating the issue at all is testament to the attention we give
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000257">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Does the Minister really think it is right
that, for example, 2% of the population in an area can vote on a
neighbourhood plan and perhaps then 50% of that
2%—1%—actually sets out what the future shape of that
area should be? Does he not have any concerns about the quality of
information that would be available for people to base their decisions
on or about the ability of people to give their time to make balanced
decisions on what is before them? Certainly, given my own experience, I
have significant concerns about all the things I have just

                           </strong> The hon. Lady raises a classic objection to ballots
or referendums without either a compulsion to vote—as is the
case in Australia—or a threshold. The same argument applies to
electing Members of Parliament. In some constituencies, there is little
more than a majority—and, in some cases, less than that—
in support of the winning candidate, as no doubt the Under-Secretary of
State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend the Member
for Hazel Grove will argue very strongly in the referendum campaign to
come.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000259">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is a consistent principle that we give people the
opportunity—the right—to vote, but we do not compel them
to do so. Crucially, we do not wish to encourage a perverse consequence
of having a threshold: abstention campaigns that subvert the process.
One of the classic objections to setting thresholds in parliamentary
elections, local authority elections or referendums is that they
provide the opportunity and, indeed, the incentive for opponents of a
particular cause not to argue their case or encourage people to
participate in the democratic process and debate. Instead, opponents
encourage people to stay away, so that they can subvert the views of
those who have the commitment to vote by staying at home. The threshold
then falls below the required level. This is a much debated policy.
Time and again, the House has

of their local community? Why do we have the figure of three? Why have
a figure so absurdly low that it is likely to lead to perverse outcomes
in some
communities?<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000261">&#160;</a>

clauses. That figure refers to the composition of neighbourhood forums,
not to the referendums that are available there. In reflecting on these
matters, we should follow our consistent practice. Just last year, a
Select Committee of the House of Lords held an inquiry into the role of
referendums, and it recommended that there should be a general
presumption against the use of voter turnout thresholds because of the
evidence presented to it regarding the ability of abstaining voters to
defeat proposals. The matter has been aired fully and

in response to my earlier intervention. He discussed the fact that we
do not set a threshold for turnout at a general election. The big
difference, however, is that people grow up in this country thinking
that it is their civic duty to vote, and I would like more people to
think that. It is a big thing to decide who will be the Prime Minister
of this country. The nature of people’s environment is also a
big thing. We have already discussed how difficult it is to engage
people when drawing up policies and visions for an area. Yes, people
want to be involved in a particular planning application when they say,
“No, we don’t want it,” but my concern—I
wonder whether the Minister sees this at all—is that it is going
to be very difficult to engage people and persuade them to give up
their time to make sure that we have a 75% turnout, which is what I
would love to see in referendums on local development
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000267">&#160;</a>

has put people off over the years, and I hope that giving people the
opportunity to shape the future of their neighbourhood will encourage
them to participate. I hope that they will be encouraged by voices in
their community to take an interest in matters. I hope that
neighbourhood plans will be of great importance, but we should consider
some other important areas for which we, or others, do not set
thresholds for participation. For example, one could hardly think of a
role of greater importance for the world than that of the President of
the United States. There is no requirement for, or compulsion on,
people to vote, or for the election to be declared null and void if a
certain threshold is not reached. Important though neighbourhood plans
are, giving people the opportunity to vote, rather than compelling them
to do so or requiring certain thresholds, is the right
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000268">&#160;</a>

a majority of people took part in it. Nevertheless, I return to my
earlier point. The Minister has invited me to respond, so I will take
20 seconds to make one other point. He might accuse me of a frivolous
use of public money, but my experience of the planning system and
developing neighbourhood-type plans in Lewisham was that the only way
to get people other than the usual suspects into the room was to pay
them to be part of a public consultation on developing a neighbourhood
strategy in Deptford and New Cross. When we advertised on public
forums, we always saw exactly the same, small number of people. That
goes to the heart of the problem, and it is why we are suggesting a
threshold on the number of people who take part in
referendums.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000273">&#160;</a>

discretion that, if the outcome of the referendum had either been
derisorily small or so close and the number of people voting so low as
to undermine the viability, the Government would have had the

said, “This was a very finely balanced outcome, on a derisorily
small turnout, and we won’t proceed.” I accept that the
feeling in Wales at the time was in favour of devolution. Therefore,
even though the balance was pretty fine, the Government felt that they
were right to proceed, although not doing so still remained an option.
That arrangement was sensible, because it avoided what happened in
Scotland in 1979, which was referred to by the Minister of State,
Department for Communities and Local Government, the right hon. Member
for Tunbridge Wells. A threshold was set in advance and, although there
was a clear vote in favour of devolution in Scotland, the then

Erdington rightly highlighted the point that, if there is a derisorily
small turnout in a referendum for a neighbourhood plan—that
could happen for precisely the reasons identified by my hon. Friend the
Member for Lewisham—the council will have to proceed, because
such a referendum will be mandatory under the Bill. It will not have an
option. It cannot say, “We have listened to the referendum.
People have had an opportunity, and we have assessed the vote. Yes, it
was a yes vote, but only three people actually voted—two in
favour and one against—which represents only 2% or 1% of the
neighbourhood. Therefore, we do not think it is right to proceed, given
all the costs, time and commitments involved.” The Government
expect costs of £15,000, £17,000 or £20,000 to

outcome of the referendum, that would be an entirely reasonable
formulation. In the scenario that I have depicted, with a derisorily
small turnout and a wafer-thin majority, the local authority would have
decided that it was not sensible to proceed, given the costs and effort
required.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000290">&#160;</a>

Proposed new section 61E(4) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000291">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>There
is no discretion for the local authority, and no scope for it to apply
common sense in extreme circumstances. That will not happen all the
time, but the Government should think more about it. In some mayoral
referendums, we have seen pretty low turnouts, and there might be
derisorily small turnouts in those on neighbourhood plans. What do
Government Members think about what the TaxPayers Alliance and others
would say if a local authority was committed to spend £20,000 in
developing a neighbourhood plan on the flimsy basis of three people
voting—two in favour and one against? That would clearly be
nonsense.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000292">&#160;</a>

urge the Government to listen to my hon. Friends and to think again.
The Minister could think again—he has shown that he is willing
to do so, and perhaps he will on my point—and change proposed
new subsection (4), so that the local authority must have
regard to the outcome of the referendum but is not bound to implement a
neighbourhood plan if the yes vote is derisorily small. Alternatively,
he could accept the concept of a threshold. I prefer the former because
that is localist; it gives the local authority some discretion and
protects against absurd situations. It is genuinely a common-sense
argument. I ask the Minister to think
again.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000293">&#160;</a>

the right hon. Gentleman to respond, and my hon. Friend is slapping his

chutzpah that he brings to the proceedings knows no bounds. He can make
a passionate defence of the practice of previous Governments and can
make an equally passionate defence of the opposite of the practice of
previous Governments. During the whole period when he was a Government
Member, we did not have a threshold on a single referendum. We had a
referendum on Scotland, on Wales and on the north-east regional
assembly, which I think was his idea. We had a Mayor, new arrangements
London and different mayoral referendums everywhere. At no point was
there a suggestion of a threshold. I will check the debates on such
matters to see whether he made it clear to the electorate that, if
there were a low turnout, the Government were minded to disregard the
result.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000294">&#160;</a>

individuals a small sum to participate to get as wide a cross-section

the story about the art gallery and the eyes that seemed to be looking
at each person from a different viewpoint, and this measure is a
classic example. Many members of the Committee will say that they do
not see the problem. They are aware of easily defined local communities
that are already capable of being described as a community, or possibly
as a parish or “parishable.” They are distinct
communities that would relish the opportunity to develop a plan. That
is not my experience of many of the communities that I know.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000347">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Believe it or
not, although the Bradford district contains about 600,000 people,
two-thirds of it is rural. The third that is not rural is made up of
former council estates, and they are distinct communities. People know
when they are on an estate and when they are not, and everybody
understands that. The rest of the area is made up of lots of so-called
urban villages. They have grown and grown, in many cases through
overdevelopment. Some 50, 60 or 70 years ago, they were distinct
communities in their own right, divided by fields, but they are not
now. Where one stops and the other begins is in the Dog and Gun, and
because the details are difficult to determine, it is easy to get into
a fight. Beyond that, further difficulties relate to boundaries, which
I will come to
soon.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000348">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There is
nothing wrong with the principle of having much greater community
involvement in planning, and I welcome it. The question is whether the
new neighbourhood planning framework is not only fair, but workable in
many communities. My principle concern about delivery relates to the
neighbourhood forums for non-parished areas. Unlike parish councils,
neighbourhood forums are seemingly accountable to nobody, and there is
no obligation for members to disclose financial interests. It is not
long ago that we discussed the importance of requiring local councils
to have registers of interests for members, but such bodies and
organisations do not have to declare any financial interest in a
plan’s outcome. As a result, they will not and cannot command
the necessary community legitimacy—and I think legitimacy is the
right word. Do they legitimately represent their communities on plans
that are drawn up?<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000349">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There may be
ways of making neighbourhood forums marginally accountable. I believe,
however, that they can be successfully underpinned only by some
parish-style accountability, with a clear electoral mandate. There are
difficulties to do with boundaries, and in a place such as Bradford,
there are no obvious parish boundaries to work from. Believe me, it
causes difficulties. As well as social difficulties, it can be
ethnically divisive. In an extremely segregated area such as Bradford,
one can easily imagine a neighbourhood forum seeking to omit a
particular street or estate from a neighbourhood area, for the purpose
of excluding particular groups from the process. That is the reality of
many areas. In my constituency, there are places where the whole street
is from one particular European country, while the next street is from
another. There are two or three streets together that are of one
particular Baradari, and others that are of a completely different one.
I do not know how one legitimately forms a cohesive plan for
neighbourhoods in such areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000350">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 206
seeks to give communities the opportunity to re-establish parish or
community councils in urban areas before neighbourhood forums are
formed—and that is possible. The newest parish council in
Bradford is in an area that, despite being called a parish council, is
probably 80% Muslim. A former regeneration company decided to use the
vehicle of a parish council as a successor body at the end of its life.
It is possible for any community to have an elected body of a parish
council nature. Parishing overcomes nearly all the problems of
accountability and representation, and the boundary issues for
neighbourhood planning in urban areas. I would have thought that it
would also fit in very well with the Government’s localist
agenda, giving people an opportunity to engage democratically at a much
lower level, empowering communities to make their own decisions about
the issues that matter in their area.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000351">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A method of
doing that, in the form of a community governance review, exists in
legislation; it is set out in the Local Government and Public
Involvement in Health Act 2007. The reviews are carried out by local
authorities, which can make recommendations to set up a new parish or
community council. My amendment would make the review mandatory before
a new neighbourhood forum is set up, to establish whether people want
to set up a new parish council. That route seems sensible, and I would
think that I would be supported by those already involved with parish
councils. I guess the argument against it is that it probably slows
down a process.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000352">&#160;</a>

was rushing her, my grandmother used to say, “He must have a bus
to catch.” The Government are acting as though they have a bus
to catch. We have time for this; if we go forward with the proposals
for parish areas, we have time to parish others, or at least to include
local, accountable and democratically elected bodies that take on the
role of the neighbourhood forums. That would be an extension of
democracy to a lower level, which is in line with the localism
agenda.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000353">&#160;</a>

of the Bill is very business-light. I am surprised, as it was initiated
by the Government side, which includes so many Conservative Members.
There is a missed opportunity in the Bill; local businesses are given
no legal right to be involved in the neighbourhood planning process.
That issue is covered by one of the amendments. Businesses are an
integral part of many communities. It is right that they should have a
role in shaping commercial development in an area. Amendment 207
addresses that by allowing business rate payers registered in the
neighbourhood area to form part of the neighbourhood forum. The hon.
Member for Crawley asked about the Gatwick area. In my view, an
industrial estate or business park composed entirely of ratepayers
should have the same rights to initiate a neighbourhood development
plan. No doubt the Minister will refer to that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000354">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Withdrawing a
designation on the basis of there being no criteria makes sense when we
have not set any clear criteria, but in proposed new section 61F(5),
there are some criteria. They are not strict enough for my liking, but
criteria are set for what a local planning area should be like. So why
can we not withdraw designation if it stops being like that? There is
an illogical aspect to the Bill, in that having decided that something
can be designated because of certain criteria, we cannot later say that
it should not be designated if it stops being like that. I would like
the Minister to address that point in particular, but my main concern
is the nature of the bodies, their lack of accountability, the
unworkability of creating the forums, and their legitimacy in many
communities that I am familiar with.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000355">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I shall speak to amendments 137 to 139, 142 and
191 to 193. Once again, it is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for
Bradford East, who has identified some serious issues, which I hope
will be sensibly addressed during our debate. I stress once again that
unless Ministers listen to the concerns expressed, they run the risk of
establishing a new framework, which will quickly fall into disrepute.
The issues of representativeness, integrity and legitimacy are
absolutely key, and we hope that we will be able sensibly to address
them during the
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000356">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I said in an earlier debate, we are returning to a common theme in this
part of the Bill, which is the democratic legitimacy of the process by
which neighbourhood plans and neighbourhood development orders are
made. I should like once again to express the Opposition’s
support for the principle of neighbourhood planning. Anything that
sensibly, properly and fairly increases local participation in the
shaping of communities is a thoroughly good thing. We have real
concerns, however, about the representative nature and democratic
legitimacy of the framework that the Government have presented in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000357">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We also have
real concerns about the social and economic ramifications of the
proposals. As the hon. Member for Bradford East has clearly recognised
in his 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 665<a class="bkMark" name="Column665">&#160;</a>
                           </div>amendment, there are real dangers that the proposals will create a
divide. The hon. Gentleman spoke with passion about his community; I,
too, represent a community where some of the concerns that he expressed
would be felt very strongly. Along with many of the organisations that
have given evidence, and that we have met, we believe that the
Government are creating a two-tier planning system at the local level.
It will be a two-tier system democratically, economically and socially.
We do not believe that our amendments will necessarily solve all the
problems that have been identified, but they will improve the
proposals. We hope that at the end of our debate the Government will go
away and rethink the proposals in their entirety, so that we can return
to a sensible outcome that we can all support.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000358">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
137 to 139 seek to improve the democratic legitimacy of the
Government’s proposed neighbourhood forums. We want to increase
the number of members required to constitute a neighbourhood forum from
three to 20, and we want a requirement for one of them to be an elected
councillor.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000359">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 142
seeks to apply the Equality Act 2010 to neighbourhood
forums, and amendments 191 to 193 seek to ensure that local authorities
can rule on the appropriateness of a local area for neighbourhood
forums and the forums themselves, not least for the reasons that the
hon. Member for Bradford East indicated. It cannot have escaped the
Government’s notice that their proposals will create a
significantly different system in different 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 666<a class="bkMark" name="Column666">&#160;</a>
                           </div>parts of the country. Intrinsically, there is no problem with the
creation of different systems—of there being a certain
flexibility—provided that they pass certain tests. Do the
proposals create systems that are genuinely representative; that are
transparent and open; that are accountable to the community in which
they are based, financially accountable; and that allow equal access,
regardless of background, geography and resources, financial or
otherwise?<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000360">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On all
counts, the proposals set out in the Bill do not meet those tests. It
is clear to us, having analysed the proposals and having heard and read
evidence from a whole range of organisations, that the proposals are
fundamentally flawed and unfair. They will create a two-tier system in
more ways than
one.<a class="bkMark" name="11021788000361">&#160;</a>
