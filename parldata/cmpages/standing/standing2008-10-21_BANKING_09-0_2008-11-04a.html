Committee and we now come to discuss clause
1.</div>
<a name="08110441000010"></a>




<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
1</h4><a name="08110441000005"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Overview</div><a name="08110441000015"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Bill.</div>
<a name="08110441000016"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000277"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. As you
are aware there are good reasons why we have only now reached clause 1,
but it is the meat of the Bill in terms of the special resolution
regime. I shall take a limited amount of time to set the scene because
clause 1 gives us a good overview of the framework of the regime
tools.</div><a name="08110441000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause sets out the broad purpose of the SRR, which is to address a
situation in which all or part of the business of a bank has
encountered or is likely to encounter financial difficulties. It
outlines the tools at the authorities&#146; disposal under the SRR.
The special resolution regime includes the three stabilisation options:
transfer to a private sector purchaser, to a bridge bank and to
temporary public sector ownership. As the Committee will hear when we
consider clauses 13 to 24 and 30 to 38, the stabilisation options are
exercised through the stabilisation powers, which effect the transfer
of shares and other securities or property, rights and liabilities by
operation of law. Those stabilisation powers include the onward and
supplemental transfer powers set out in clauses 25 to 29 and 39 to
41.</div><a name="08110441000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses
42, 43 and 55 provide for a package of safeguards relating to the
exercise of partial property transfer powers, which, as Members are
aware, proved of particular interest to stakeholders during the public
consultation process. I draw attention to the safeguards here because
the Government will be issuing a consultation document on them, as I
indicated in my letter to Committee members last week, as well as the
draft code of practice, which the Committee has seen, on Thursday of
this
week.</div><a name="08110441000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have established an expert liaison group of banking sector
practitioners, including legal and insolvency experts, to advise the
Government on the development of the safeguards. The group held its
first meeting last Friday, and the consultation document that we
publish on Thursday will reflect its views on the Government&#146;s
proposals. It will also have a key role in continuing
to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div>advise the Government through the process of consultation and beyond.
Yesterday I tabled a new clause on the position of the liaison group,
and we will debate that in due
course.</div><a name="08110441000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110441000278"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): It will be helpful to
Committee members if the Minister sets out who the members of the
expert liaison group are.</div>
<a name="08110441000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000279"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I will circulate the names of the members of the
group to the Committee.</div>
<a name="08110441000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
the overview of the SRR, part 1 of the Bill includes provisions on
compensation, incidental functions, the role of the Treasury and how
the regime applies to building societies. The special resolution regime
also includes the bank insolvency procedure and the bank administration
procedure, which the Committee will consider when we come to parts 2
and 3. The special resolution regime outlined in clause 1 is at the
heart of the Bill; it establishes a permanent and credible framework
for authorities to resolve a failing bank. The SRR provides the
authorities with the tools to deal with banks in financial difficulty
in a manner that supports the public interest in financial stability,
confidence in the banking system and depositor
protection.</div><a name="08110441000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
most situations, normal regulatory interventions or voluntary action by
the management of the bank can resolve an individual bank&#146;s
difficulties. However, bank failures will sometimes occur and can
damage confidence, disrupt financial markets, harm depositors and
generate significant costs to businesses and to the economy as a whole.
Bearing that in mind, it is worth taking a couple of moments to outline
the background to the development of the special resolution regime and
the genesis of this part of the Bill.</div>
<a name="08110441000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The recent
period of sustained disruption in global financial markets, starting in
the United States in the summer of 2007, has had a widespread impact on
financial markets, firms and economies across the world. In the UK, the
most visible consequence of that has been the financial difficulties
faced by a number of financial institutions, including Northern Rock
plc.</div><a name="08110441000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
summer 2007, Northern Rock found itself unable to finance its
activities, due, among other things, to a business model that was
heavily reliant on funding from the wholesale money market. In the
light of those severe difficulties, the Government took action to
maintain financial stability, while protecting consumers and the
interests of the
taxpayer.</div><a name="08110441000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
February 2008, when it became clear that, in the light of prevailing
market conditions, no institution was prepared to make an offer to take
over Northern Rock that was judged adequate to protect the taxpayer,
the Government took the decision to take the bank into temporary public
ownership. To that end, legislation to give the Government powers to
transfer the shares or property of a failing bank was brought forward
in the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, which received Royal
Assent on 21 February of this year. The main transfer powers expire,
under the terms of that Act, on 20 February 2009. That Act provided the
Government with temporary powers should further action be needed while
permanent legislation&#151;this Bill&#151;was being prepared and
passed.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 269</div><a name="08110441000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The prudence
of that approach has been demonstrated by events concerning Bradford
&amp; Bingley plc. On Monday 29 September the Government used both the
share and property transfer powers provided by the 2008 Act to bring
the bank into temporary public ownership and then to transfer the
deposit book to a private sector purchaser. The special resolution
regime outlined in clause 1 replaces the 2008 Act with a permanent
framework for the authorities to resolve a failing bank, with
objectives that include protecting and enhancing financial stability
and confidence in the banking system, and protecting depositors and
public funds. Those objectives will be considered under clause 4. By
setting out a clear and credible statutory resolution regime to address
a failing bank, which removes control from the bank&#146;s management
by overriding the powers of shareholders and directors, the regime also
provides a strong incentive for banks and their directors to take
action to prevent their business from getting into
difficulties.</div><a name="08110441000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unlike
the 2008 Act, the SRR has been designed as permanent legislation and
therefore provides a framework with strict conditions that must be met
before the powers are exercised, clear objectives that the authorities
must have regard to in exercising those powers, and refined
stabilisation powers that are targeted in their effect alongside new
tools such as the bank insolvency procedure. Clause 1 also establishes
that each of the tripartite authorities&#151;the Bank of England, the
Treasury and the Financial Services Authority&#151;has a role in the
operation of the special resolution regime. The powers and
responsibilities of those bodies are extended by the Bill, in line with
each institution&#146;s current mandate and responsibilities, to
enhance the UK framework for financial stability and depositor
protection. The SRR also provides the authorities with a wide range of
tools to meet the above objectives, by resolving a failing bank or
facilitating fast payout to depositors. The establishment of the
special resolution regime was widely supported by stakeholders
throughout the consultation process; I am also grateful for the support
from Opposition
Members.</div><a name="08110441000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said, clause 1 clearly sets out the framework for the whole
package of SRR tools&#151;we will debate the tools
later&#151;giving the authorities the full range of options for
dealing with a bank that is experiencing difficulties. I appreciate
that the Committee will wish to discuss many of the provisions that the
clause summarises, and which I have just briefly run through. I am
looking forward to debating the provisions in detail over the remaining
sittings. However, I propose that detailed consideration of those
provisions be reserved until we reach the corresponding clauses. I will
be guided on that by you, Mr. Gale. Given that clause 1 is a
broad summary clause, intended to provide users of the Bill with a
clear understanding of its contents, I urge that the clause stand part
of the
Bill.</div><a name="08110441000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000280"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The clause is fairly wide-ranging&#151;as the
Minister has indicated&#151;and it is up to the Committee to decide
how broad it wishes the clause stand part debate to be, bearing in mind
that we need to try to avoid covering too much ground that will be
touched on under other clauses. If it becomes necessary to embrace
other arguments and discussions prior to further clauses being reached,
I shall bear that in mind. As the issue is complex, I am acutely
conscious of the need to have a fairly wide-ranging debate now. The
decision is in the hands of the Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 270</div><a name="08110441000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000281"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr. Gale, for this ninth sitting, which by my reckoning
takes us to about halfway through the Committee&#146;s proceedings. I
am not sure that we have broken the back of it yet, but the end is in
sight. I take note of your comments, Mr. Gale, about guiding
our debate. I recognise the challenge in trying to restrict remarks.
One could make a speech that lasted for both sittings today and well
into Thursday, but it would not be in my interests or those of the
Committee to go down that
route&#151;</div><a name="08110441000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110441000282"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con):
Shame.</div><a name="08110441000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000283"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b>&#151;although my hon. Friend might tempt me to do
so if he is not careful. I want to give a sense of where we are coming
from over part 1 and to set the backdrop for our debate on
it.</div><a name="08110441000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Minister
said, clause 1 sets the scene for part 1. I share his recognition that
one of the learning points from the crisis over the last year is the
lack of a decent toolkit for dealing with the problems of a failing
bank. That came out particularly clearly from the debate on the future
of Northern Rock and the time it took to resolve that situation
suggests that we did not have the right tools available. I suspect that
if the tools that were initially developed in the Banking
(Special Provisions) Act 2008 and have been fleshed out in this Bill,
had been deployed in respect of Northern Rock they would
have produced a different outcome. We do not know what that outcome
might have been, but we have seen how Bradford &amp; Bingley was
tackled and in some respects it was not dissimilar to Northern Rock in
its problems. A very different solution was found for Bradford &amp;
Bingley compared with Northern
Rock.</div><a name="08110441000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is in a way
disappointing that the Government have not listened to the warnings
that they were given prior to this crisis about the adequacy of the
framework for dealing with a failing bank. At the end of one of the
scenario-planning exercises that the tripartite authorities undertook
and which looked at this issue in about 2005, both the Governor and the
then chairman of the FSA, Sir Callum McCarthy, highlighted the need for
a review of the tools that were available. They recognised
that the framework that was in place was not sufficient to deal with
the consequences of a failing
bank.</div><a name="08110441000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill provides a set of tools, the stabilisation options in part 1, the
insolvency procedure in part 2 and the administration procedure in part
3. When considering those stabilisation options and the transfer to a
private sector purchaser and to a bridge bank and temporary public
ownership, we need to bear it in mind that this part of the Bill
invests significant powers in the tripartite authorities. Those powers
enable them to make important decisions affecting the function of the
banking system and the wider financial sector, as well as affecting the
outcomes for individual institutions and their creditors. The framework
for the exercise of these powers is set in clauses 4 and 5, and we will
talk about them in more detail later on.</div>
<a name="08110441000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 4 sets
out the objectives of the special resolution regime. The Committee will
note from the range of amendments tabled on clause 4 that there is a
question  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 271</div>about the completeness and adequacy of the framework which we would want
to probe in that debate. Clause 5 talks about the code of practice. We
are grateful for the early sight of the code last Thursday, but as the
Minister wrote in his covering letter, it is very much a work in
progress. It makes it a little difficult in the context of the debate
on clause 5 to understand just what the safeguards will be over the
exercise of the power by the Bank, the FSA and the Treasury, given the
amount of work that still needs to go into the code. It would be
helpful for the Committee if, in his summing up of this stand part
debate, the Minister would outline how he envisages the process of
consultation on development of the code working, in parallel with the
passage of the Bill.</div>
<a name="08110441000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">For my part,
I would want to see before Report in this place a more detailed code
that is much closer to completion&#151;I accept it might not be
finalised&#151;than the one that was circulated to us on Thursday, so
that we can be sure that a robust framework is in place that will
govern the use of these powers. I am sure that when we reach clause 5
we will have a long discussion about the nature of the
code.</div>
<a name="08110441000247"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="08110441000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concern I have&#151;also expressed in the response to the
stakeholders&#146; consultation&#151;is to ensure that there is a
proper framework in place so that these powers are exercised in a
predictable way: that people know the circumstances in which they will
be exercised. That is what we are lacking at the moment. We will try to
tease out how we shall know the circumstances in which the powers will
be exercised. That requires further elaboration in the code and I hope
that today&#146;s debate helps us establish more detail.</div>
<a name="08110441000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">In talking
through this part of the Bill, it might help the Committee if the
Minister were able to use recent examples of how the powers in the
special provisions Act have been used, to illustrate how they will be
exercised in the framework in this Bill and to explain the points of
difference between the special provisions Act and the Bill before us.
The Minister referred to how Bradford &amp; Bingley was dealt with in
the context of temporary public ownership and the transfer of shares
and property. We also had the situation with Heritable where the FSA
determined that the threshold conditions had been breached and that led
to deposits being transferred to ING Direct and the rest of Heritable
being placed into administration; there was a similar pattern with
Kaupthing. These are powers that we would expect to see in this
Bill.</div>
<a name="08110441000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, one
element of the Icelandic banking system fell outside the powers of the
special provisions Act and it would be helpful for the Committee to
understand how the Bill would deal with Landsbanki&#146;s branch in
the UK. A different set of powers was used to tackle the problems faced
by Landsbanki. We need to understand how the Bill would tackle a
situation where a bank&#146;s branch based in the UK faced
significant financial problems. A relatively large number of banks
based in the UK operate through a branch system rather than through a
UK subsidiary. We will come to that in clause 2, when I will
probe it in more detail. That important issue needs to be
resolved.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div><a name="08110441000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
ensure there is some predictability in the way that these powers are
used. That will require us to probe some of the language in later
clauses. Clause 7(3), for example, says that the power can be exercised
if</div><a name="08110441000233"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
is not reasonably likely that...action will be taken...to
satisfy the threshold
conditions.&#148;</div><a name="08110441000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
sounds a relatively low test and I think people would expect a higher
test where the threshold conditions are to be invoked. We will come to
that. That is why it is important in this debate on part 1 to tease out
some of the language and the meaning, certainly in relation to that
clause. The explanatory notes state:</div>
<a name="08110441000234"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Those
conditions essentially demarcate the boundary that must be crossed
before the stabilisation powers...may be applied to a
bank.&#148;</div><a name="08110441000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
does not further our understanding of how clause 7 will
work.</div>
<a name="08110441000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue of
partial transfers is one of the most contentious in the clause, and
stakeholders have expressed concern about it. Before debating the
relevant clauses, we will want to see as much as we can of the draft
statutory instruments that relate to partial transfers, or a clear
statement from the Government of the principles that might underpin
them. Part of the architecture of the reforms is that the power should
be set out in primary legislation, the safeguards in the secondary
legislation and further elaboration in the code of practice. We need to
see that entire package before we decide whether we are content with
the Bill. The Minister has expressed his willingness to make it
available, for which I am grateful, but the state that the code of
practice was in when it was circulated on Thursday suggests that there
is still some way to go before those documents approach a reasonably
final
stage.</div><a name="08110441000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
final point is that the Bill focuses on what will happen when things go
wrong. It is important to have the right set of solutions in place when
that happens, but I am sure that all members of the Committee feel that
prevention is better than cure. We want to ensure that the FSA, the
Bank and the Treasury, in tandem with the work that we are doing here
to the legislative framework, look carefully at how they will ensure
that the preventive framework is in place, so that those powers will
hopefully remain sitting on a shelf gathering dust after the current
crisis is over, rather than being used on a regular
basis.</div><a name="08110441000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110441000284"></a><b class="B">Sir
Peter Viggers</b> (Gosport) (Con): This is a crucial clause in
an important Bill. We must realise that we are not going back to the
year 2006. When the legislation is passed, we will not be returning to
the happy, confident days before the credit crunch impacted a year or
more ago. To that extent, the Minister is completely right when he says
that the measures we are putting in hand are permanent and that many of
the issues relate to a new permanent framework, and that is why it is
so important to get it right.</div>
<a name="08110441000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the US
authorities were faced with difficulties and introduced Sarbanes-Oxley,
the effect on the banking industry and the efficiency of financial
markets was disastrous. The City of London will be allowed to expand to
a greater extent than it might otherwise have done because the American
financial markets are now rather constipated and hampered by the
bureaucratic and legalistic effects of Sarbanes-Oxley and the
imposition of measures that caused difficulty for their
operation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 273</div><a name="08110441000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the
measures that we are introducing now will be permanent, but others will
of course be temporary, and that imposition will need to be removed if
we are to return to the days of an efficient and confident banking
system. We need to distinguish carefully between the permanent
measures, which we must get right, and the temporary measures needed to
satisfy the present difficulties.</div>
<a name="08110441000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
previously&#151;I remember raising the issue with the
Minster&#151;put forward the nearest analogue to the present
situation, which is the situation of Lloyd&#146;s of London in the
1990s. I draw on my experience as a director of a bank in the secondary
banking crisis of the 1970s, so I have, uniquely in the Committee, been
here before. I was also one of the four members of Lloyd&#146;s of
London&#146;s audit committee when it pushed through what was then
the biggest single corporate rescue in the history of finance, so I am
sure that the nearest analogue to our present situation is
Lloyd&#146;s of London. In that case, an insurance underwriter would
underwrite a risk and then lay it off by reinsuring with another
insurance entity. That second insurance entity would then lay off his
risk. What would develop was what was known in Lloyd&#146;s days as a
spiral, which was a spiral of reinsurance so that the second, third,
fourth, fifth&#151;perhaps the 15th&#151;insurer did not know the
exact nature of the assets he was reinsuring. That is a very close
parallel to the current collateralised debt obligations. Our present
difficulties arose because of the creation of collateralised debt
obligations in the United States initially, and the reinsurance and
refinancing of the toxic assets in a spiral very similar to the
Lloyd&#146;s spiral of the
1990s.</div><a name="08110441000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110441000285"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): I have to agree with
everything that my hon. Friend is saying about some of the causes. Does
he agree that another major cause was that many of the directors of
these banks did not understand where some of the hot shots on the
derivative desks were making the money? The derivatives they were
trading were very complex and highly leveraged. The question here is
how we legislate to ensure that directors understand where their
institutions are making their money and what the risks associated with
those assets
are.</div><a name="08110441000052"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000286"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> Indeed. My hon. Friend makes a very good
point. I recall being called in by the then Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, who told the assembled junior Ministers that we would be
faced with a number of complex situations. Quite often it was difficult
to understand the nature of the complexity of the issues that were
being put to us. I remember her saying with a very firm and direct
gaze, &#147;Never do something you do not fully understand.&#148;
That is exactly what happened in the secondary banking crisis. There
were people in senior positions in banks who did not fully understand
the nature of the complicated instruments that they were acquiring.
They saw those very clever hot-shot people dealing in these assets.
They saw that fees were involved. They saw that it was very profitable
and they allowed the deals to go through.</div>
<a name="08110441000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
exact parallel here with Lloyd&#146;s of London. I remember it very
well. One Lloyd&#146;s underwriter would nod through risks that he
did not fully understand. In the trade he was known as the nodding
donkey. Anyone wanting to offload a risk could go to him and he would
agree because he was making a great deal of money out 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 274</div>of trading in assets that he did not fully understand. There is a close
parallel. I could go into considerable detail on this. It took up a
great deal of my time in the 1990s, but the parallels between the
Lloyd&#146;s spiral then and the banking spiral in the last year or
two is very
close.</div><a name="08110441000230"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000287"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> There is one other point to make. People at
Lloyd&#146;s felt that they could effectively pass the sardines
continually around and that everybody would keep making money. It is
analogous to what has gone on in the last 10 years and the theory that
it was the end of economic history; we had ended this era of boom and
bust and we could manage growth for ever. Perhaps this is the hubris
that we have found&#151;I do not mean to be too political
here&#151;with the current Government&#146;s thinking that they
could control events and control cycles. But at the end of the day it
is difficult to control cycles. Therefore the Bill needs to address a
little bit more how we manage our way through difficult times,
particularly economic cycles. We have seen today that we have not ended
the era of boom and
bust.</div><a name="08110441000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000288"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> I very much respect all the points that my
hon. Friend makes. He is one of the Members of Parliament who, in a
previous incarnation, dealt with very large amounts of money. He
understands large sums with lots of noughts on the end, which are
difficult to grasp if one has not been involved in banking and
international financing matters.</div>
<a name="08110441000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
close parallels between the Lloyd&#146;s situation of the 1990s and
the banking situation that has developed in the last year or so. What
lessons can we learn? I have made the points before and it is a matter
of regret to me that despite the fact that I have talked to journalists
from the <i class="I">Financial Times</i>, made speeches on the Floor of the
House and raised the issue with the Minister, the points that I am
about to make have not been fully understood and
comprehended.</div>
<a name="08110441000248"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="08110441000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
did Lloyd&#146;s do? How did it face up to that very difficult
situation? Faced with a spiral of risks, which were not fully
understood, that had been undertaken by a range of bodies,
Lloyd&#146;s separated the toxic assets&#151;the uncertain
assets&#151;from the viable, continuing business. That is what the
banks should be attempting. They should be carrying out a much more
scrupulous, careful and determined analysis of their assets and should
be separating out the viable, continuing business. All the banks and
building societies that we have been talking about have very sound
businesses and assets. The accountants and others need to identify the
parts that are definitely, provably sound and then separate them from
the assets that are not definitely, provably sound. Of course, not all
of those assets will be defective and useless; many will be valuable.
When I talk about toxic assets or doubtful assets, I am not talking
about worthless assets, but those with a value that cannot be
completely
proven.</div><a name="08110441000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lloyd&#146;s
separated the uncertain assets and moved them into a new vehicle, which
was called Equitas. If we were to follow that plan in the current
banking situation, Smith bank Ltd would identify the proven valid
assets, which would stay in the parent company, but all the uncertain
assets would be relegated to a subsidiary&#151;for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 275</div>the sake of simplicity, let us call it Smith Toxic bank Ltd. Smith bank
Ltd owns Smith Toxic bank Ltd, which owns the uncertain assets. There
are two key points: first, it is crucial that new
money&#151;taxpayers&#146; money, investors&#146; money and
shareholders&#146; money subscribed by way of rights issue or
preference shares&#151;does not go into the old, mixed up Smith bank
Ltd, which includes toxic assets, but into the new Smith bank Ltd, the
parent company, which only has assets that are known to be
sound.</div><a name="08110441000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
does not invest new money in a body that has assets of uncertain value,
which is why I think that the Hank Paulson plan is fundamentally
flawed, although I am not claiming to know more about banking than
Mr. Paulson. It is flawed because it involved putting the
$700 billion of new money into mixed bodies that included the toxic or
uncertain value assets, rather than putting it into proven, sound top
companies.</div><a name="08110441000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110441000289"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): My hon. Friend is
making a clear argument. The standard way that accountants would deal
with the matter would be to provide fully against what we have called
the doubtful, or toxic, assets. Those should have been written down and
established before any investment decisions were made. Would that not
have the same effect as my hon. Friend&#146;s
suggestion?</div>
<a name="08110441000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000290"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> I think that one needs to go further to
identify and isolate the toxic assets. Drawing on the parallel of
Lloyd&#146;s of London, taking a top company and making allowances
and provisions against its assets does not have the same decisive and
incisive effect as separating off the assets. Identifying and isolating
toxic assets is a central feature of the way
ahead.</div><a name="08110441000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110441000291"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): The hon. Gentleman puts
forward a therapy for many banking ills. Does he consider that the
procedure that he is mapping out would probably have been a better way
of dealing with Northern Rock in the early days, when some of the
sub-prime mortgages were held by Lehman Brothers and an agency of
Northern
Rock?</div><a name="08110441000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000292"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> Indeed. My point has general application.
My central point is that new money should go into the purged body, so
that shareholders and taxpayers know that they are investing in a sound
body rather than a tainted or uncertain
one.</div><a name="08110441000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is some good news here. My second point is that if the tainted assets
are identified and isolated&#151;carefully identified and
cross-checked against other tainted assets&#151;it will be found that
because the spiral has involved reinsurance or, in the case of CDOs in
banking, reinvestment, in a ring, all the banks that undertook that
insurance or investment made reservations against their investment,
because they too were uncertain about the value of the asset. When all
the tainted assets are pulled together and carefully cross-checked, the
bank that undertook the collateralised debt obligation and then sold it
on will be found to have made reservations against the CDO, as did the
second, third and fourth banks and so on, perhaps in a multiple ring.
There will have been a duplication of reserves in the spiral, and
therefore the risk and the potential loss will not be quite as great as
had been thought. That is the good news.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div><a name="08110441000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge that
there be much closer analysis and breakdown of risk, that investment go
into the purged top body and not into the mixed body, and that an
analysis of the toxic assets be undertaken, perhaps by a different
body. If Smith bank toxic assets and Jones bank toxic assets are pulled
together and carefully identified, the lesson of Equitas is that there
will be duplication and the risk will not be as great as originally
thought. That is exactly what the sage of Omaha has discovered; his
American company has invested in Equitas, demonstrating that the value
of the loss was not as great as it should have
been.</div><a name="08110441000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have seen some references to the point that I am making. For instance,
last week a former Japanese Finance Minister made an important speech,
urging that there be closer analysis of the risks that banks have
undertaken and more careful identification of the toxicity of the
assets. I return to my central point, which is that I am not satisfied
that the authorities&#151;the Bank of England, the Treasury or the
Financial Services Authority&#151;have done enough to ensure that
banks undertake as scrupulous and detailed an analysis of their
prospective losses as they
should.</div><a name="08110441000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000293"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> I agree that the Paulson plan was flawed, in that
it effectively asked taxpayers to stump up for all the bad assets. My
hon. Friend&#146;s solution is to try to separate off the bad
assets&#151;effectively creating a good bank and a bad
bank&#151;but he will find that many assets defined as toxic are not
really. They are assets that are effectively under water compared with
when particular individuals took out loans. These houses still have a
value and over time these particular assets will, with inflation, rise
and no longer be toxic assets.</div>
<a name="08110441000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">A weakness of
some of the solutions that have come up is that there is no solution to
deal with the front-end crisis, which is a super-decline in asset
values, almost to an extent that the values of houses are lower than
any rational market would say that they are. One needs to come up with
a solution that gives confidence to people who are borrowing and to the
housing market, so that over time many of these so-called toxic assets
effectively reflate their way out of their
toxicity.</div>
<a name="08110441000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000294"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> Indeed. Using the word toxic is shorthand,
which is why I did expand and say uncertainty, because uncertainty
derives from not knowing how other people will value the assets. A book
of mortgages will have a high value if people are confident in property
prices but if they are not confident the value is doubtful and becomes
&#147;toxic&#148;. We need to restore confidence. If one is
drowning and wants to restore confidence, one has to get a foot on the
bottom of the swimming pool. It is no use just splashing around. We
have to find a firm, clear point of certainty, which in my opinion is
to have assets that are certified as valid and sound. That is where new
money should go, not into the mixed body.</div>
<a name="08110441000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
to the Minister for his attention. I am concerned about this point. I
hope that more can be done to satisfy me that the point has been
grasped and that the Government are working in this
way.</div><a name="08110441000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000295"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I am pleased to follow my hon. Friend the Member for
Gosport, who made an important case and highlighted the problems in
clauses that we shall be discussing.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div><a name="08110441000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
described the problem of what we have seen in the banking sector as a
spiral. The accountants&#146; reaction to this is that all these
debts are toxic. It is an unfortunate word because it really means
doubtful value of assets. They might not be toxic. What has happened is
a collapse in the market for those assets. As a chartered accountant,
my reaction is to ask why we do not write those things down to their
lowest possible value. That is the problem. If they are written down to
where they are at the moment, there is a collapse in the asset base of
the individual banks, which then has to be responded to by stuffing in
capital through investments in shares and preference shares, which is
the way that this crisis has been handled. I am interested in the idea
of moving these debts out of the banks and putting them into separate
subsidiaries. That is an interesting proposal because it then produces
a good bank and a bad bank but the bad bank might not actually be a bad
bank. That is one solution.</div>
<a name="08110441000231"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><a name="08110441000296"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): If the hon. Gentleman
has studied the Scandinavian banking crisis, he will know that the
establishment of the bad bank there did eventually deliver a rather
better outcome than had been anticipated because, as he says, they were
not assets without value; they were simply assets for which it was not
possible to determine an appropriate market value at that time, which
had led to substantial writedowns. So there is merit in a bad bank
option.</div><a name="08110441000249"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="08110441000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000297"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
intervention. I do think that we should be looking at that.</div>
<a name="08110441000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
solution is to take a more realistic value of the provision made
against the assets. Instead of writing them down significantly, they
should be written down to a realistic value, as we heard Angela Knight
argue in oral evidence. If that is done, the requirement for the
capital to be injected into the bank is by no means so great.</div>
<a name="08110441000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
concerned that the Bill does not address the speed at which the
Government have put in, or propose to put in, extraordinary amounts of
money without really knowing the value of the banks. It is
extraordinary that banks that could make billions year after year can
overnight seem to become virtually worthless so that, without billions
of pounds of investment by the Government, they would sink. We have
already seen in today&#146;s media that the proposed injection into
Lloyds bank of huge amounts of preference money by the Government is
now being said by Lloyds to be unnecessary because it will have repaid
it all within a year. I question whether we are looking at the real
problems or reacting to the crisis as we perceive it at the
moment.</div>
<a name="08110441000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000298"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman shares my
conceptual confusion. I listened carefully to what the hon. Member for
Gosport said about differentiating toxic and non-toxic assets and what
the hon. Member for Wellingborough said about how the toxicity of
assets could change. The hon. Member for Gosport then redefined toxic
and non-toxic in terms of certainty and uncertainty, but what is toxic
or non-toxic then itself appears to be uncertain. I wonder whether 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div>we ought to continue to use the term &#147;toxic&#148;, given that
it is largely a metaphor and has no real resonance in economic
science.</div><a name="08110441000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000299"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes my point. The word
&#147;toxic&#148; is trundled out in every news broadcast as though
it means something, but it does not mean anything. It is the actual
value of an asset that we cannot be sure of, and I think that we have
got the approach wrong on that. My hon. Friend the Member for Gosport
suggested a solution that really highlights the issue. The bad bank is
nowhere near as bad as it looks, because those assets have been
provided against time and again by different banks, so it is only
really the first set of debts, where the first loans are in doubt and
part of them will be valuable anyway, that needs to be provided
against. I am not sure that the spiral of debt, which has led to a
spiral of provision against the value, is necessarily the right way
forward.</div><a name="08110441000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000300"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> My hon. Friend has made several excellent points,
and it might be instructive, not only for him, but for my hon. Friend
the Member for Gosport, and perhaps even for the Minister, to have a
look at a new document that has come out today from the Centre for
Policy Studies called &#147;From Boom to Bust: a plain guide to the
causes and implications of the banking crisis&#148; by Mr.
Howard Flight. Reading his analysis might be a helpful guide to the
Minister in coming up with some robust solutions to the current
crisis.</div>
<a name="08110441000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000301"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. I have
not had a chance to read that document, but I am sure it would be worth
reading, because Mr. Flight is a superb author.</div>
<a name="08110441000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, I feel that we should avoid using the word
&#147;toxic&#148; because it is misleading. We just need to look at
the basics of what a company is and what its value is. The banks cannot
have gone from being the soundest investment one could possibly have,
making billions of pounds each year, to having such colossal writedowns
overnight. That just does not make common
sense.</div><a name="08110441000079"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000302"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Perhaps I could begin by responding to the
comments by the hon. Member for Gosport and then move on to the issues
regarding Landsbanki, safeguards, the code and consultation.</div>
<a name="08110441000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept the
broad thrust of the analysis by the hon. Member for Gosport: that the
origins of the global financial crisis were in the sub-prime market in
the United States and that there was insufficient understanding of the
impact of collateralised debt obligations on the whole market system. I
do not particularly like to use the term &#147;toxic assets&#148;
either. However, in this case we are talking about impaired assets in
some shape or
form.</div><a name="08110441000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Gosport sees close parallels with Lloyd&#146;s. There
are some parallels, but there are also different circumstances. In the
case of Lloyd&#146;s and the reinsurance market some years ago, the
company got into significant difficulties but it dealt with them. Banks
or building societies may get into difficulties and they will manage
them themselves. They will adopt a number  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 279</div>of strategies, whether that is writing down the assets or isolating and
separating out bad and doubtful debts. I do not think that there was a
systemic risk to the global financial system in the case of
Lloyd&#146;s, as there has been as a result of the problems in the
sub-prime market. But that is not to say that the hon. Gentleman does
not make a number of valid points about these
areas.</div><a name="08110441000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Wellingborough mentioned the accounting treatment in
this area. He will be aware of changes that were announced a couple of
weeks ago in how the mark-to-market rules are to be interpreted in
distressed economic conditions. That has been a beneficial
clarification. The Government were still right to take the action that
they did on liquidity, recapitalisation and providing debt guarantees
to stimulate inter-bank lending. It is important to recognise that
action needed to be taken on all three fronts because of the financial
situation that we found ourselves
in.</div><a name="08110441000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000303"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> I would submit that the situation at
Lloyd&#146;s and the present situation are very comparable. When the
Minister said that the Lloyd&#146;s case would not have led to the
collapse of the financial markets, he described Lloyd&#146;s as a
company. Lloyd&#146;s is not a company. It is an unincorporated
structure. The people backing Lloyd&#146;s at that time were 30,000
of some of the richest people in the United Kingdom, whose names were
put forward to become names at Lloyd&#146;s. If Lloyd&#146;s had
failed it might well have led to the bankruptcy of some 30,000 leading
citizens and would have had a devastating effect on the City of London
and on financial markets generally. The parallel is closer than his
remarks
indicate.</div><a name="08110441000232"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000304"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I agree of course with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s statement about the legal status of Lloyd&#146;s.
I was trying to draw a distinction between that and the problems that
banks and building societies might face in the
future.</div><a name="08110441000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000305"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I should be grateful for the Minister&#146;s
opinion. He talks about liquidity, which obviously needed to be put
into the banking system, and bank guarantees, which I also understand,
but I query the third element&#151;the capital. If one has written
these doubtful assets down to a level that is far less then they are
worth, one is putting in billions of extra capital that would not be
necessary if one had the right valuation in the first
place.</div><a name="08110441000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000306"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The hon. Gentleman is clearly right that in
distressed market conditions assets get written down. In the case of
banks that would affect their tier 1 capital ratios&#151;hence the
need for recapitalisation. Obviously we have gone through completely
exceptional circumstances over the last couple of months, which is why
there have been substantial international discussions, and why we took
the action that we did across three fronts&#151;liquidity,
recapitalisation and debt guarantees&#151;to get the inter-bank
lending market moving. It is why there has been general consensus, as a
result of those international discussions, that this is the right
approach, and other countries have followed our lead. However, that
does not neglect the need for banks and building societies to take
action to deal with their own situations. The hon. Member for Gosport
is completely right: hiving down the impaired 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div>assets part of an institution to a subsidiary company can be an
effective strategy, and some institutions have done that in the past 12
months.</div><a name="08110441000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000307"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> Did the Government consider converting debts such
as bondholders into equity, as a way of right-sizing the impaired
capital structures of those banks? That would give the balance sheet a
sensible capital structure, as opposed to simply infusing
taxpayers&#146; money to right-size the balance sheet, which would
leave impaired debt in place. I mean junior debt not senior
debt&#151;bondholders, for example. There are many bondholders in all
those banks, and they could easily have been forced to convert their

equity.</div><a name="08110441000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000308"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> We had detailed discussions with the banks on a
wide range of issues concerning their financial position. We believe
that we took the right course of action, in conjunction with the banks,
to help to ensure stability in the financial
markets.</div><a name="08110441000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000309"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> One of the difficulties with using the bad-bank
option as a relatively rapid response to a crisis is that it requires
the unpicking of the asset basis of the various businesses that have
been handled differentially, because of the different approaches to
writedown that banks have taken in short time frames. The Scandinavian
model was facilitated by almost the entire Scandinavian banking system
ending up in public sector hands, which meant that the separation of
assets into a bad bank could be compelled through one coherent
ownership model. That is not the case in the
UK.</div><a name="08110441000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000310"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> That is a helpful clarification for the
Committee, but I repeat that there is nothing to stop individual banks
putting assets into subsidiaries at the moment. It is a perfectly
permissible approach. We will discuss good banks, bad banks and partial
transfers later, but the point emphasises the importance of the
safeguard provisions. I shall speak broadly about them in a moment, and
we will come back to them under clauses 42 and
43.</div><a name="08110441000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000311"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> May I take the Minister back to his comments on
capitalisation and the writedown of asset values? Is it his view that
the Government&#146;s contribution to the recapitalisation of
banks&#151;either subscribed for by private shareholders or
underwritten by the Government&#151;is sufficient to cover historical
writedowns only, or has some idea of future levels of writedown on both
mortgage-backed securities and corporate debt been factored
in?</div><a name="08110441000250"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="08110441000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000312"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I do not want to respond directly, but I will say
that the agreement that the Government have reached with the banks has
been designed to ensure that the banks are able to meet their tier 1
capital ratios. The overriding objective of the Government&#146;s
actions has been to ensure confidence and stability in the banking
system.</div>
<a name="08110441000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000313"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> The Treasury Committee queried an aspect of this
yesterday. It was made reasonably clear that the FSA and the banks had
modelled requirements according 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div>to a variety of circumstances, which would have included a substantial
further loss in their asset base before determining the capital
injection requirement that the Government have subsequently
offered.</div><a name="08110441000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000314"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that comment. I
understand that the Chancellor wrote to the Chairman of the Treasury
Committee providing a significant amount of detail regarding the
announcements that were made in the House on 8 and 13 October and that
that is publicly available.</div>
<a name="08110441000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I move on to
the point about Landsbanki raised by the hon. Member for Fareham. We
can deal with it in more detail in clause 2, if it is felt necessary.
We believe it right to put in place arrangements to ensure that retail
depositors receive their money in full and we continue to work with the
Icelandic authorities to ensure fair treatment for UK depositors and
creditors. There clearly is a difference, which we discussed earlier,
between subsidiaries of an Icelandic bank, which are regulated by the
FSA, and branches, which are regulated by the home country authority.
The Bill does not in general allow the authorities to take control of
branches of European economic area banks in line with our obligations
under Community law. There are clear EU law obligations that we need to
apply.</div>
<a name="08110441000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
differs from the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008 specifically
with regard to new tools to deal with failing banks, such as the
proposals on bridge banks, and the two new insolvency
procedures&#151;the bank insolvency procedure for fast payouts to
depositors and the bank administration procedure to make partial
transfers effective. There are other differences with regard to
preconditions, framework powers and compensation. It might be helpful
if I circulated to the Committee a brief summary of the differences
between the Bill and the 2008 Act. We are able in the Bill to provide a
permanent framework to refine and develop the powers in the Banking
(Special Provisions) Act. In some cases those powers are very broad,
and there was significant stakeholder concern about their broad nature
and the fact that there is not the legal certainty that hon. Members
rightly want. That is why the safeguard provisions, and others that we
will come on to discuss, refine the powers in the
Act.</div><a name="08110441000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000315"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his offer to
circulate a document distinguishing what we have in the Bill and what
is in the 2008 Act. Some elements of the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000 are to do with transfers of property too. As the Minister is
being so helpful, would it also be possible to circulate a summary of
any developments and changes regarding the Financial Services and
Markets Act as
well?</div><a name="08110441000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000316"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I will certainly look to do that as speedily as
possible.</div><a name="08110441000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000317"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Before the Minister moves on, I should like to
return to the comparison between the 2008 Act and the Banking Bill.
Clearly the 2008 Act&#146;s powers have been used to bring about
change in a number of institutions&#151;we have talked about Bradford
&amp; Bingley&#151;but how would those circumstances have been
handled if the wide-ranging powers in the Banking Bill had been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 282</div>available to the Government? Knowing that will help us to understand how
the Government will apply the powers in practice in a context with
which we are
familiar.</div><a name="08110441000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000318"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It may help if I clarify those points directly. A
Bradford &amp; Bingley-type resolution is possible under the Bill,
because clause 2 permits the transfer of banking to temporary public
ownership via a share transfer. Clause 14 permits the partial transfer
of the deposit book and branches, such as in the case of Santander. A
similar result is also possible using direct partial transfer by the
Bank of England to Abbey or any other private purchaser, or,
alternatively, via a bridge bank. The exact resolution option used
would depend on a wide range of detailed factors, but the options
pursued in the Bradford &amp; Bingley case are possible under the
permanent regime if a similar situation arises in the
future.</div><a name="08110441000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000319"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> That is very helpful, but can the Minister go
further and elaborate&#151;not necessarily now, but perhaps when we
discuss the relevant clauses&#151;on the factors that suggest one
course of action rather than another? It will help to build a sense of
how the powers will be used in practice if the Minister uses the same
examples later on and says, &#147;If this happens, we will use these
powers for these reasons and if something different happens, we will
use a different set of
powers&#148;.</div><a name="08110441000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000320"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I shall see what is possible. The range of tools
is an important feature of the regime and how the tools are used
depends on the particular circumstances faced. With Kaupthing Edge,
deposits were first transferred to a company owned by the Bank of
England and then to ING Direct; under the Bill the same effect can be
achieved in a variety of ways, as I have outlined with regard to
Bradford &amp; Bingley. I am happy to write to the Committee setting
out the general differences between the Bill and the 2008 Act. If I
can, I will give examples of how the same situations are still
possible.</div><a name="08110441000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I want to respond to the comments made by the hon. Member for Fareham
about the consultation process on the code. As I outlined in my initial
remarks, on Thursday we intend to publish a consultation document on
the safeguards and on the draft code received by the Committee last
Thursday. I want to highlight the fact that the safeguards will be put
in secondary legislation, which is what stakeholders have been asking
of us. That obviously ensures that there will be proper parliamentary
scrutiny in
future.</div><a name="08110441000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I indicated, I have already shared the draft code with the expert
liaison group and I will ensure its continued involvement. However,
given that we are publishing the draft code only on Thursday and there
needs to be a consultation period, I cannot guarantee that we can have
a further draft of the code by Report, because we will not have been
able to get all the consultation responses. The assurance that I can
give is that the real detail of the safeguards will be in secondary
legislation. That will go through the parliamentary process, which will
certainly ensure a level of scrutiny. Our intention is that
consultation on the code will be finished and we will have the final
version before the Bill completes its parliamentary passage. If there
are any concerns about it there will be an opportunity for them to be
expressed at a later date.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 283</div><a name="08110441000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000321"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
clarification of the process, but two questions arise. First, will the
code to be published on Thursday be significantly different from the
code that members of the Committee saw last Thursday? Secondly, the
Minister will be aware of the concern about the possible gap between
primary legislation being passed and secondary legislation being
debated. What is his view about that gap? Will secondary legislation be
in place around the time of Royal Assent, or will there be a longer
delay? The longer the delay, the greater the uncertainty in the market
about how effective those safeguards will
be<i class="I">.</i></div>
<a name="08110441000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000322"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> First, my understanding is that the code is not
substantially different from the draft that the Committee saw last
Thursday. It has been seen by the expert liaison group at first-cut
level. Undoubtedly there is potential for it to be modified through the
consultation process by the expert liaison group and by others who will
naturally have an interest in it. I completely appreciate what the hon.
Gentleman says about the gap. I would like as small a gap as possible
between the legislation coming into force and the secondary legislation
being improved and that is certainly what we will endeavour to achieve.
The consultation document that we are issuing this Thursday provides
some draft legislation showing what the secondary legislation would
look like. There will be an opportunity for its external scrutiny, and
I hope that it will be in good shape so that we can implement it as
soon as possible after the Bill receives Royal
Assent.</div><a name="08110441000106"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000323"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 87, in
clause 2, page 2, line 28, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) Where a
stabilisation power is exercised in respect of a bank, it does not
cease to be a bank for the purposes of this Part if it later loses the
permission referred to in subsection
(1).&#146;.</div><a name="08110441000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a technical amendment, which makes it clear that the provisions of
part 1 continue to apply to banks in respect of which stabilisation
powers have been exercised, even should such banks lose their
regulatory permission to accept deposits under the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000.</div>
<a name="08110441000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">An example of
where that scenario could be material is as follows: as we will discuss
when we come to clause 57, the expression &#147;residual
bank&#148; is used in subsection (1) of that clause to impose
continuity obligations between a residual bank and a transferee. It is
highly likely that a residual bank will have been placed in the new
bank administration procedure, and in such circumstances the residual
bank would no longer have a valid deposit-taking permission. The
amendment would prevent the argument from being made that a company
without a deposit-taking permission is not a bank, and hence not a
residual bank within the meaning of clause
57(1).</div>
<a name="08110441000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000324"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I should like move to a wider point. There used to
be a well honoured distinction between retail banking and investment
banking, but that has now completely gone in legislation. May I probe
the Minister 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div>a little? Has any thought been given by the Treasury to reinstituting
such a distinction in terms of which regulations may apply to which
type of institution? Over time such distinctions become almost
meaningless, but that is part of the
problem.</div><a name="08110441000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000325"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Before we go wider, the Minister made it
plain, and it is clear, that this is a technical amendment. Ordinarily,
I would be relaxed about having a broader debate, but it might help the
Committee if we deal with the amendment and then have a stand part

proceed.</div><a name="08110441000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000326"></a>Ian

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000327"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I do not need to reiterate the remarks that I made
before, but there is a strong feeling that we might need different
regimes for different types of bank. If there is no capacity to
differentiate types of bank in legislation, it is obviously another
tool that is not in the toolbox. The legislation is clearly being
introduced in response to an immediate crisis, but there must be
far-thinking spirits in the Treasury who are considering what they can
do to give long-term stability to the banking sector as a
whole.</div>
<a name="08110441000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">In America
and the UK, there is some thought that some of the liberalisation that
blurred distinctions between different types of bank was a mistake and
part of the problem. Is the feeling in the Treasury that a bank,
however it is defined, should simply have that sort of global meaning,
or is there capacity to distinguish between types of bank in regulation
and
legislation?</div><a name="08110441000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000328"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I do not normally get excited about the
definition bit of a Bill, but I just want to push the Minster&#146;s
thinking on that point, partly to echo the comments of the hon. Member
for Southport, because he highlighted an important distinction.
Subsection 1 of the clause states
that</div><a name="08110441000235"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;bank&#146;
means a UK institution which has permission...to carry on the
regulated activity of accepting
deposits&#148;.</div><a name="08110441000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
some banks that do not accept deposits&#151;investment banks, in
effect&#151;would fall outside the scope of part 1. Elsewhere in the
Bill, we have already given the Government the power to provide
financial assistance to what would be called, in the context of the
amendment, non-banks and financial institutions that are not
deposit-taking institutions. That was set out in clauses 214 and 215,
which we debated last Thursday morning, so the Bill already envisages
that the Treasury could bail out an investment bank, insurance company
or investment manager. Investment banks make a major contribution not
only to the economy, but to financial stability, so
I  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div>am not clear why they are being excluded. It suggests that the entire
bias of part 1 is to protect depositors, rather than looking at the
broader perspective of maintaining financial stability, which is set
out in the objectives under clause 4. I am a little concerned that the
wholesale operations of banks will not necessarily be covered in part
1.</div>
<a name="08110441000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">If one takes
into account what happened with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the
US, one can certainly see that there has been a significant impact on
the UK as people sought to unwind their trades, and hedge funds tried
to work out their position. Hedge funds were examining whether their
agreements were permitted, whether the transactions between Lehmans and
its accounting partners would hold, whether client money counts, and a
whole host of related issues. I would not want to say that it
undermined financial stability, but it certainly slowed down the
current working of the wholesale markets. I would have thought that
some of the powers in part 1 might be of use if a wholesale bank were
to face financial problems, and I am concerned that
subsection 1 seems to exclude institutions that are commonly
known as banks but that do not accept deposits from
customers.</div>
<a name="08110441000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point is about subsection (3). I touched on it in the previous debate
and the Minister flagged it up for more detailed discussion under
clause 2. Subsection (3) defines a UK institution as one
that</div><a name="08110441000236"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
incorporated in, or formed under the law of any part of, the United
Kingdom.&#148;</div>
<a name="08110441000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The example that I used
to probe the Minister on how far the regime goes the UK branch of the
Icelandic bank Landsbanki. Interestingly, Landsbanki also had a
subsidiary in the UK, which was dealt with differently from the branch.
People&#151;myself included&#151;would say that although it was
important for the Government to protect the interests of
Landsbanki&#146;s depositors in the UK, it was evident that the
Government lacked the tools to look at the bank&#146;s assets, which
is why they had to use the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001
passed in the aftermath of
9/11.</div><a name="08110441000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
will the powers in the Bill affect a branch in the UK? Branches
undertake significant banking activities, and the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme website will list all deposit-takers that are
branches of overseas banks. That will indicate how important the matter
is. In a slightly different area of financial services, rules have been
developed for businesses operating in the UK with headquarters
overseas, to enable the branch arrangement to become more familiar.
However, how Landsbanki was dealt with raises the broader question of
how we manage the affairs of branches where there is financial
collapse, which links to my point on investment banks. One investment
bank that springs to mind&#151;a major player in London&#151;is a
branch of its parent and is, therefore, not incorporated in the
UK.</div><a name="08110441000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000329"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. In
essence, the issue is that under the investment services directive,
prudential regulation for passported institutions is performed by the
home state regulator, not the host nation. At the moment, therefore,
the FSA and the Bank of England do not have a role in regulating
prudential supervision for such branches. It would be interesting to
know what, if anything, is changed by the
Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div><a name="08110441000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000330"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. There is a
distinction between the conduct of business rules, which would cover a
branch operating in the UK, and prudential supervision. We could end up
with the curious situation of a financial services sector in the UK
that had become so internationalised that although the FSA regulated
the conduct of business, it could not say a great deal about prudential
regulation because there was a series of branches. If branches are
excluded from the Bill, the Government will have few tools with which
to protect the UK financial system when its stability is
threatened.</div><a name="08110441000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that the Minister elaborates in his reply how the Bill
affects those branches, and what other tools are available to safeguard
the interests of depositors in branches. As the Landsbanki example
demonstrates, there seems to be a lack of alternatives, other than the
freezing order under the 2001 Act. I do not want to debate
that&#151;we did so last Monday in a Committee on Delegated
Legislation&#151;but it is a good example of the limitations of the
Bill and why the Government need to make clear which tools in the Bill
can and cannot be used in respect of a
branch.</div><a name="08110441000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000331"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Clause 2 sets out the definition of a bank for
the purposes of the Bill. A bank is defined as a UK institution that
has a regulatory permission granted by the FSA under the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 to accept deposits. If such an
institution gets into serious difficulties, the authorities will have
the option of using the stabilisation powers of the special resolution
regime set out in part 1 where that is justified in the public
interest.</div>
<a name="08110441000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
definition of a bank does not include a building society or a credit
union. They have their own particular legal characteristics and the
provisions of the special resolution regime need to be modified
accordingly. Clauses 71 to 75 set out how the special
resolution regime is applied to building societies and clause 76 allows
it to be extended to credit unions. The Treasury will also by order add
to the exclusions from that definition of a bank, which may be
necessary to refine further the precise scope of institutions that may
be subject to the SRR and to take account of future
developments.</div>
<a name="08110441000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two key
points were raised by hon. Members. First, I shall respond to the hon.
Member for Southport&#146;s point that the legislation does not
differentiate types of bank. That is not true. The Bill clearly applies
only to deposit-taking institutions. It does not apply to investment
banks without deposit-taking permissions, which are completely
different. I hope that makes the situation
clearer.</div><a name="08110441000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000332"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I accept that and I am grateful for the
clarification, but I think the Minister would accept that under
subsection (1) it is a necessary condition that a bank takes deposits.
A big bank may do lots of other things as well, so under the definition
of a bank one might find banks that are straightforward, traditional
banks such as the Co-operative Bank, and others where deposit-taking is
a very small, almost incidental, aspect of their business. Their real
money may be made elsewhere and they function in most respects as
investment
banks.</div><a name="08110441000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000333"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is
making but we consulted widely on the point about investment banks, and
it was clear that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 287</div>Bill and the SRR could not apply to non-deposit takers. The Treasury is
considering which steps to take in the case of other types of
institution and we will consult more widely. There is clearly a
significant
issue.</div><a name="08110441000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000334"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Can the Minister explain why it is not appropriate
to apply these powers to investment
banks?</div><a name="08110441000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000335"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> This is an area where we believe that further
work is needed. All the consultation that has taken place to date has
been on the basis of the Bill as it stands and to extend it would be a
significant change. Extending the SRR to investment banks may help to
protect financial stability if a failure were to occur but we believe
such action would have a significant number of downsides. The risks of
such an approach might include the fact that the tools might not be the
most appropriate for non-deposit-taking financial institutions. The
SRR, including the infrastructure, objectives, powers and some of the
tools, has been designed with an emphasis on depositor protection as
well as being part of financial stability. The cross-border nature of
the largest and most systemically important non-deposit-taking
institutions suggests that the national approach on its own might not
be enough. That applies to some extent to any deposit-taking
multinational but the issue is far more acute for investment
banks.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000336"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> This almost falls into that great &#147;Yes
Minister&#148; thing of being too difficult. We are a global
financial centre and, yes, there is a range of multinational
institutions based in the UK, some of which are deposit-takers, some of
which are investment banks. One criticism of the previous arrangements
was that there appeared to be no measures in place to deal with the
collapse of Northern Rock. That had a detrimental impact on
London&#146;s relative standing among global financial centres. We
are a global international centre, yet the Government have shied away
from thinking through the consequences of the impact of the collapse of
a multinational investment bank in the UK. The Government have missed
an important opportunity to think that through and to recognise
London&#146;s pivotal role in international financial
services.</div><a name="08110441000252"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000340"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> I thank the Minister for giving way. My hon.
Friend the Member for Fareham makes an important point. I am curious to
know what representations the Minister has had from the investment
banks, which are all based in the UK, and what feedback he has had
about what the Government
propose.</div><a name="08110441000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000341"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> There is widespread support for the measures in
the Bill, particularly the definition in the clause. The Bill focuses
on deposit-taking institutions.  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div>It is quite right for the Committee to point out that investment banks
are in a different category. Most are not deposit-taking institutions
and to that extent would not be covered by the Bill. As I have
indicated there are potential downsides if we try to include investment
banks in the Bill. It is an issue on which the Treasury is doing
further work, together with the tripartite authorities. We want to
ensure that we take all the action that is necessary to give people
confidence that the overall financial system is in safe
hands.</div><a name="08110441000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110441000342"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): We understand
that. The aim is to protect depositors. However, there are wider
issues, the widest or perhaps most appropriate of which is the fact
that most of the problems for depositors have been caused not by the
deposit-taking and normal banking business of those institutions, but
by the very activities of aspects of the bank that are not
included in these regulations. Therefore, there is a real case for
considering how the regulations can be moved into the
investment banking side and perhaps even for the real
disaggregation of those activities so that they can be separately
regulated.</div><a name="08110441000141"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000343"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point and it is
something that we will want to consider. Investment banks are
represented on the liaison group. They agree that the SRR
should focus on deposit-takers, but there is clearly an
issue for the future, which we are considering.</div>
<a name="08110441000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second point raised by the hon. Member for Fareham concerns our
limitations with regard to branches. As I outlined in the earlier
debate, we need to be clear that the SRR can apply only to
UK-incorporated banks. Under European economic area law, prudential
regulation of EEA branches is for the home state regulator who is
responsible for taking the lead on resolving difficulties with EEA
banks. The powers of the host state regulator are therefore limited.
Even if we sought to take powers to apply the SRR to EEA branches, the
UK authorities could act on those powers only in highly circumscribed
ways. Many of the SRR powers&#151;for example, share-transfer powers,
which have been developed for use in relation to shares and securities
as defined in UK law&#151;would have to be completely redesigned to
be applicable to EEA branches.</div>
<a name="08110441000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The approach
that we have taken is consistent with the principles of home state
regulation of EEA branches. However, the Committee should also note
that the remit of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme extends to
branches of banks from other EEA states, which have joined the top-up
arrangements, as per the directive. Of course, the FSA works closely
with other regulators within the EEA to resolve difficulties with EEA
firms operating in the UK.</div>
<a name="08110441000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
experience with the Icelandic branches has demonstrated the importance
of ensuring that home state regulation is effective. We need to hold
further discussions about that in international forums. A college of
regulators has also been proposed, but we need to ensure that people
putting money into a branch of a foreign bank feel sufficiently assured
that their money is safe, and to ensure that it is made clear which
authority is regulating a bank or building society when people are
investing their money.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div><a name="08110441000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000344"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister has touched upon the distinction
between branches regulated through home/host arrangements and
UK-incorporated subsidiaries. More than anyone appreciated, the
Landsbanki situation revealed the growing gap for consumers between
branches and UK-incorporated businesses. Some measures in the Bill
would enable a wholesale transfer, for example, of accounts from one
bank to another, as happened with Bradford &amp; Bingley. I am not
clear from the Bill and from the Minister&#146;s explanation whether
that type of facility would have been available to the depositors of
Landsbanki as a branch. I suspect that it would not have been, so
depositors will have to understand that there are two levels of
protection and that it will be much easier for them to get continuity
of service and to have instant access to their money if a UK bank is in
trouble, because the safeguards do not exist with foreign-owned
branches. Icesave depositors could be waiting until the end of the
month to get their money. How do the Government or the FSA intend to
communicate the important differences between a UK-incorporated bank
and a branch of a foreign
bank?</div><a name="08110441000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000345"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> An important issue of investor awareness and
information is being raised, which we have all suddenly become far more
aware of over the past few months. It has always been the case that a
person investing in the Isle of Man is investing in a separate tax
jurisdiction with a separate regulatory regime. I do not think that the
situation has been made as clear as possible to individual investors,
whether they are investing in a branch of an Icelandic bank or in a UK
subsidiary of an Icelandic bank. There needs to be greater
clarification in the marketplace, which, I am sure, the Financial
Services Authority, which regulates those matters, is
addressing.</div>
<a name="08110441000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000346"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for accepting an
intervention just before he finishes. From what he is saying, I
understand that there will be a compulsion or a health warning on
foreign subsidiaries in this country&#151;it is a very good
idea&#151;which says, &#147;Certain aspects of your investment are
not protected by British regulations&#148;. Is that what the
Government are
proposing?</div><a name="08110441000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000347"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I certainly want to use that sort of language.
Investors should be aware of the regulatory regime and the deposit
protection measures that apply to any bank in which they consider
putting their money. I hope we all accept that general principle. We
need to ensure that there is clarity of information in the marketplace,
which is perhaps not there to a sufficient extent at the
moment.</div><a name="08110441000149"></a>

assistance&#148;.</i></div><a name="08110441000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000352"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The purpose of the amendments is to provide the
Government with the power to specify assistance that should or should
not be included in the definition of financial assistance for the
various purposes for which it is defined in the Bill, particularly as
it is used in part 1. The term &#147;financial assistance&#148;
appears throughout part 1. For example, it appears in relation to the
trigger conditions for the special resolution regime and in relation to
the valuation principles for the calculation of compensation.</div>
<a name="08110441000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Committee
members will recall that the term also appears in part 7, as we have
already discussed, to provide the necessary parliamentary authority for
the Treasury to use public funds to provide financial assistance to
financial institutions and</div>
<a name="08110441000237"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in connection
with, the provision of financial assistance to building
societies.&#148;</div>
<a name="08110441000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">In all circumstances,
the term includes giving guarantees, indemnities or any other kind of
financial assistance, actual or contingent. The reason for moving the
amendment is to recognise the fact that the Government can provide
financial assistance to failing banks in a number of ways, and they may
not wish some form of assistance to be treated as financial assistance
for the purposes of all of the Banking Bill&#146;s
provisions.</div><a name="08110441000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Financial
assistance is mentioned throughout this part of the Bill, but perhaps I
might explain the purpose of the amendment by referring to two
examples. First, in Clause 9(3), the provision of financial assistance
for the purpose of resolving a threat to financial stability is defined
as one of the conditions for taking a bank into temporary public sector
ownership. However, it is not the Government&#146;s intention that
all forms of financial assistance to banks should mean that such a
condition would be met, as that would provide a serious disincentive
for banks to take advantage of other forms of financial assistance. In
particular, the Government are thinking of the recent financial
assistance that has been offered to the banking market as a whole,
including the recapitalisation scheme and the credit guarantee scheme
for banks to take up on commercial
terms.</div><a name="08110441000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
example can be found in clause 7, which requires the FSA to determine
whether a failing bank remains in compliance with its threshold
conditions. When assessing whether the threshold conditions continue to
be met, it is likely that it will be appropriate for the FSA to
consider the position of the firm without taking into account financial
assistance provided to that firm on an exceptional basis. However, it
may be appropriate for the FSA to take into account any financial
assistance provided under a system-wide scheme&#151;such as
that  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div>provided under the recapitalisation scheme&#151;when considering
whether the firm still meets its threshold conditions. It is difficult
to say now what forms of assistance will be excluded from the
definition. To future-proof the Bill by providing for current and
future schemes of financial assistance to be included or excluded as
appropriate, the Government believe that it is prudent, therefore, to
take a power to specify types of assistance that should and should not
be counted as financial assistance. I hope that hon. Members will agree
that the amendment is a sensible and prudent measure and I commend it
to the
Committee.</div><a name="08110441000253"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000353"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying the
purpose of the amendment and new clause 9. Nevertheless, I want to
question him further. I think that he was trying to draw a distinction
between specific assistance to an institution and system-wide support.
He cited the recapitalisation package, but that has been accepted by
only a handful of banks, so the credit guarantee scheme is available
only to those banks that signed up for it.</div>
<a name="08110441000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
broaden the matter out a little. Last week, the Bank of England
published a consultation document on the types of financial assistance
that it might provide to banks. On the whole, they are system-wide
schemes. They include the operational facilities that it proposes using
to replace the standing facilities; the statutory discount window
facility that will enable banks to borrow, given security against a
wide range of collateral at any time, the type of collateral reflecting
the size of the drawing; and the possibility of permanent long-term
repos against high-quality private sector securities. As far as I am
aware, they are system-wide schemes. Do the Government believe that
they would fall outside the definition of financial assistance and that
they have no mind to accept new clause
9?</div><a name="08110441000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000354"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> On the recapitalisation scheme, the Government
believe that assistance under it should not be of a type that would
trigger certain provisions of the Bill&#151;for instance, the
provision for taking a bank into temporary public sector ownership. Nor
should system-wide financial assistance, including the recapitalisation
scheme, be treated as financial assistance for the purposes of the
FSA&#146;s assessment of whether the threshold conditions have been
met.</div>
<a name="08110441000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the recapitalisation scheme is to recapitalise banks and place them
on a more secure financial footing. It would therefore be inappropriate
if access to the scheme impacted on triggers for the use of the SRR
powers. However, that does not mean that it will be excluded from the
definition of financial assistance for all the purposes of the Bill.
For instance, in some cases, access to the recapitalisation scheme may
be relevant in determining compensation.</div>
<a name="08110441000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The special
liquidity scheme has been mentioned. It does not fall within the
definition of financial assistance, but it is not clear whether such
system-wide assistance should be treated as financial assistance for
the purposes of the trigger mechanisms in the Bill, including the
determination by the FSA of whether a bank meets its threshold
conditions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div><a name="08110441000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000355"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister said that it is not at all clear
whether things such as the special liquidity scheme should be treated
as financial assistance. He will understand that those who are using a
special liquidity scheme would like some clarity on whether it is
classified as financial assistance under the
Bill.</div>
<a name="08110441000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000356"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Let me try to clarify the matter. The special
liquidity scheme falls within the definition of financial assistance,
but I said that it is not clear that such system-wide assistance should
be treated as financial assistance for the purposes of the trigger
mechanisms in the Bill, including the determination by the FSA of
whether a bank meets its threshold conditions. We therefore need to
exclude such assistance from certain provisions of the Bill. I hope
that I have made matters clear.</div>
<a name="08110441000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000357"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am not entirely sure that the Minister has done
so. It would be useful for the Committee to know in which sections it
might be deemed to be financial assistance and in which it will not. My
understanding is that the special liquidity scheme was designed to help
banks through the current liquidity crisis. The Bank of England has
made some proposals, but it would be helpful to know how it might
develop its money market operations to improve liquidity in the market.
What will be the precise interaction between those schemes and the
Bill? That might well affect the extent to which banks take up the
schemes. It also suggests that a bank that takes up a special liquidity
scheme might find itself at risk under the Bill if the scheme is not
excluded from the definition of financial assistance
throughout.</div>
<a name="08110441000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000358"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I hope not to create confusion on that point. I
hope that I was clear in saying that the SLS does fall within the
definition of financial assistance, but that its operation would
clearly not be something that one would want to take account of when
the FSA was determining the threshold conditions. We will need to
exclude that from certain provisions of the Bill, but not all of them.
It might help members of the Committee if I wrote to them to explain in
more detail how we see amendment No.88 and new clause 9 operating in
practice.</div>
<a name="08110441000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000359"></a>Mr.

write to us, and it would be helpful if he indicated in that letter the
sections in which the SLS would and would not be treated as financial

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000360"></a>Ian

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000363"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The clause is an important element of the Bill
because it sets out the objectives that will determine how the various
stabilisation powers will be exercised. I thought that I would perhaps
start with the clause stand part section of the debate and then move on
to the various amendments, because that is probably the most helpful
way of putting the amendments in
context.</div><a name="08110441000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause lists the five objectives to be met through the special

in no particular order, but I think that since our debate about the
types of institution to be covered by part 1, we have all had a feeling
that one of the main thrusts is the protection of depositors, and in a
moment I will deal with how I see that playing out. I will just comment
on the objectives.</div>

the first objective, financial stability, at some length last Thursday,

the definition given in the draft code of practice, because it gives an
indication of the direction in which the Government are travelling. It
is rather a pity that the Committee was not able to see the code of

<a name="08110441000238"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the efficient
operation of financial services and markets for...capital-raising,
risk transfer, and the facilitation of domestic and international
commerce&#148;.</div>
<a name="08110441000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is quite a broad
and helpful definition and I think that it is actually broader than the
definition that was given when we discussed it last Thursday. However,
I am not clear&#151;this is one of the recurrent themes that has
emerged throughout the debate about the objectives&#151;what weight
will be given to the individual objectives when looking at the
operation of the special resolution regime.</div>
<a name="08110441000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
consequences of the way in which the Government used powers to freeze
Landsbanki&#146;s assets was that it affected the efficient operation
of wholesale markets. It created uncertainty about how transactions
would be closed out, and the Government responded to that uncertainty
through their use of clarifications to licences under a separate
clarificatory document. But the action created uncertainty in the
market, prevented the efficient operation of the wholesale market, and
acted as a barrier to international commerce. In seeking to protect
depositors and, potentially, safeguard taxpayers&#146; interests, the
Government undermined the efficient working of capital markets.
Therefore, it would appear that in the context of the
Government&#146;s approach to Landsbanki&#151;given the
Minister&#146;s remarks on clause 2, I appreciate that branches are
excluded from the powers in this Bill; I am just using this as an
example&#151;objective 3, &#147;to protect depositors&#148;, and
objective 4, &#147;to protect public funds&#148;, had higher
priority than financial stability, or certainly that bit of the
financial stability objective that relates to the efficient functioning
of capital
markets.</div><a name="08110441000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the clause states in subsection (9) that there is no priority, it would
be helpful if the Minister could give us some feeling of the kind of
circumstances that might arise and how the objectives fit into them. We
do not know that at the
moment.</div><a name="08110441000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause states that objective 2
is</div><a name="08110441000239"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
protect and enhance public confidence in the stability of the banking
systems of the United
Kingdom.&#148;</div><a name="08110441000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Public
confidence has several dimensions, according to the code. It refers to
the expectation that deposits will be repaid in accordance with the
terms, that normal banking services will be continuously available,
that perceived problems in one bank or building society will not extend
to other banks, and that systems exist to protect the interests of
depositors if a bank does suddenly
fail.</div><a name="08110441000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention of the objective is to drive us towards the view that
authorities will have regard for the need to act in a way that enhances
rather than detracts from people&#146;s confidence in the banking
system, but I wonder to what extent the objective will be looked at in
the context of the crisis. We have had a sustained period of financial
instability, and there is a perceived systemic risk to the banking
system. As a consequence, to use the Minister&#146;s phrase in giving
evidence to the Committee a fortnight ago, the Government will do what
it takes to fix it. Clearly, what it takes in the context of a systemic
crisis may well be very different from what it takes to fix the
problems of a single bank that faces problems in isolation from the
others.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div><a name="08110441000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
in the context of this crisis, we have a de facto 100 per cent.
guarantee for retail deposits, as evidenced initially in respect of
Northern Rock but now in connection with deposits with Icelandic banks
that have not been transferred to ING Direct, but we know from our
debate on the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and the amendments
to the FSA&#146;s rules that the deposit limit is
&#163;50,000.</div><a name="08110441000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that if we were to look at the various powers that are
available to the Government, in normal circumstances, less weight may
be given to objective 2 than in the current circumstances, and in
normal circumstances we would go back to a &#163;50,000 limit rather
than a 100 per cent. limit. It would be helpful if the Minister could
explain how objective 2 would work in periods of financial instability
such as we have now, and how important it would be if we were in more
stable
times.</div><a name="08110441000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Objective
3, which is intended to protect depositors, was largely covered in our
debate on the Financial Services Compensation Scheme at the start of
Committee about what role the FSCS can play in ensuring that there is a
speedy pay-out to depositors. If consumers can access their funds
quickly and speedily, that will give them confidence in the strength of
the banking
system.</div><a name="08110441000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
way of protecting depositors is to transfer accounts to another bank.
That could take place under the stabilisation options as part of the
powers that are available. That is what happened with Bradford &amp;
Bingley. Over the weekend, the accounts were transferred from Bradford
&amp; Bingley to Abbey Santander and, as a consequence, the depositors
at Bradford &amp; Bingley had access to their money from Monday
morning. They would not have noticed a difference in the system,
because it was a seamless transfer, their accounts were not frozen and
there were no problems about paying their bills, whereas those accounts
that were not covered by that type of process&#151;those of Kaupthing
Singer &amp; Friedlander that were not part of the Edge
brand&#151;are being guaranteed by the Government and will be subject
to a pay-out through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. People
with such accounts will not have that same easy access to their money.
From the debate last week about Landsbanki, we have seen that people
with deposits in Icesave will not get access to their money probably
until the end of this month. There is an issue about ensuring that the
tools that we have facilitate easy access to depositors&#146;
accounts. That is an important
objective.</div><a name="08110441000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister may want to correct this impression if he thinks it is
erroneous, but it is clear from the debate so far that, if we were to
consider ordering the objectives, objective 3, on the protection of
depositors, would top the list. I would be interested to find out
whether the Minister disagrees with that interpretation and under which
circumstances it would not be the most important
objective.</div><a name="08110441000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000364"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The hon. Gentleman clearly understands the
clause, including subsection (9), which
states:</div><a name="08110441000240"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
order in which the objectives are listed in this section is not
significant; they are to be balanced as appropriate in each
case.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div><a name="08110441000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yet he is trying to get
the Government to indicate that certain areas are priorities; they are
all priorities for us. We will want to make decisions depending on the
circumstances of particular cases. We believe that we are discussing
the right sorts of areas. I resist his view that one objective is more
important than another; they need to be
balanced.</div><a name="08110441000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000365"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I accept that up to a point. However, this part of
the Bill is limited to institutions that accept deposits, as we
established clearly when we discussed clause 2. I have to say that the
Bill points in a particular
direction.</div><a name="08110441000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s priorities in dealing with the current financial
crisis and with where particular institutions have been under threat
have pushed towards objective 3 taking the lead in respect of how the
crisis is to be resolved. Perhaps that is a presentational issue and if
that is so I would accept that. However, there is a tension between the
objectives and we need to understand how that tension would work out in
practice. If the objectives rank equally, it would be helpful to
understand where the trade-offs between them are, because at the moment
I am not clear that there is necessarily a trade-off between objective
3 and the other
objectives.</div><a name="08110441000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000366"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> My hon. Friend is making an important point.
Clearly, some of the objectives cannot be met at the same time. Is not
the reality of the matter that when panic set in at No. 11 Downing
street, when the crisis was in full flow, the Government&#146;s
objective was presentation? Whatever made the Government look best was
the objective. That is not really the basis for good government. We
need to know the different weighting of the
objectives.</div>
<a name="08110441000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000367"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> My hon. Friend takes an uncharacteristically
uncharitable view of the Government&#146;s objectives on the matter.
However, he makes a point. The thrust of the debate has been protecting
depositors, and there are going to be tensions between the
objectives. Notwithstanding subsection (9), I tempt the Minister to
outline a scenario in which objective 3 would be subordinated to
another objective, and to say where the trade-off is between it and
other objectives. There could be a trade-off between objectives 3 and
4, because the Government could issue a 100 per cent. guarantee of
deposits. That would protect depositors, but at a cost to the taxpayer.
As we discussed in earlier debates, the taxpayer is likely to pick up
the cost of guarantees on amounts of more than &#163;50,000 in
connection with some of the Icelandic banks. There is a tension between
protecting taxpayers&#146; interests and protecting depositors. I am
not being critical of the Government, but in those sorts of cases
objective 3 comes before objective 4, not only in the sequence in the
Bill but in producing an
outcome.</div><a name="08110441000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might be that that trade-off is not quite as clear in more stable
times. The Government may decide that there is not a systemic risk to
the financial system and therefore, for example, that they can give a
lower priority to the protection of depositors through the Financial
Services Compensation Scheme than they give at the moment. However,
given the debate on this clause, a degree of transparency regarding the
importance of the various objectives and how they will work in practice

<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div>needs to emerge. This is one of the key clauses in the Bill, and such
transparency will help people to understand how the special resolution
regime will work in
practice.</div><a name="08110441000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
we are on objective 3, I should like to speak to amendment No. 77,
which would add, at the end of line 19, the
words</div><a name="08110441000241"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and
for the avoidance of doubt, this includes ensuring...continuity of
service; and...unrestricted access to
deposits&#148;.</div><a name="08110441000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
my remarks have indicated, depositors&#146; preference would be the
ability to be transferred seamlessly from bank A to bank B when there
is a financial crisis, rather than having to make a claim through the
FSCS. The amendment would emphasise that that is the best way to
achieve the right outcome for depositors. It is not the only way,
because we have the FSCS, but for the protection of depositors, it is
important to be clear about our expectations when the tripartite
authorities look at the various instruments to be
exercised.</div><a name="08110441000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
great example of when such an approach worked was Bradford &amp;
Bingley. The approach was facilitated in a way that kept the payment
system open so that people could process their transactions,
ordinarily. There is a concern about the way in which one of the
Icelandic banks was dealt with. The payment system in respect of that
bank and its customers was frozen, thereby preventing people from
making payments from their accounts. For a number of reasons, that is
not a good position to be in&#151;neither for the customers nor the
bank. If customers cannot make a mortgage payment to a lender because
their account is frozen, they will be in arrears. That is not good for
the customer and creates a problem for them with their bank. If a bank
suffering from that payment freeze is a mortgage bank, it will not be
able to receive payments from its borrowers, which will create
uncertainty about the value of the book of business. If there is a
problem with consumers, the transfer and the way in which they access
their bank accounts, the best thing to do is to ensure that there is a
transfer from one bank to another, rather than face the consequences of
their account being frozen and then be locked out of that account until
the FSCS has managed to work its way through. That is why, through
amendment No.77, we are trying to be more precise about what we would
like to see: an optimal solution for how to protect
depositors.</div>
<a name="08110441000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
context of objective 4, which is &#147;to protect public
funds&#148;, there is little explanation in either the code or the
explanatory notes of how that objective will work in practice and in
conjunction with the other objectives. We know, for example, that
taxpayer funds are at risk at Northern Rock, but they are also
potentially at risk at Bradford &amp; Bingley. In addition, there is
exposure on Landsbanki and the non-edge accounts of Kaupthing, where
there is a taxpayer guarantee. We know that taxpayer funds have been
used as part of a recapitalisation package for the banking sector, and
last Thursday, in the context of clauses 214 and 215, we discussed how
we can broaden the categories of the financial institutions that could
receive financial support through the consolidated loans fund. Today,
we have talked about broadening the definition of financial
assistance.</div><a name="08110441000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the context of objective 4, we need to understand from the Minister
what value is attached to the use of taxpayers&#146; funds, and
whether the Government will instinctively back a solution that has more
limited 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 298</div>recourse to public funds than one that would require greater recourse to
public funds. Are there options under the various tools available under
part 4 that require a small amount of the taxpayers&#146; fund to
work, and which would therefore be the Government&#146;s preference,
even if they might compromise the stability of the financial
system&#146;s objective in objective 1? Again, we want to be able to
understand the interplay between the
two.</div><a name="08110441000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will come back to objective 5 when we talk about later clauses. One of
the key words in the code that we ought to dwell on for a moment is
&#147;proportionately&#148;. The code says that</div>
<a name="08110441000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the bank or
building society itself, its shareholders or creditors or other third
parties...have a right of control
over&#148;</div><a name="08110441000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">their
property.</div><a name="08110441000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the Bill&#146;s features is that in certain circumstances, it
gives the tripartite authorities the right to interfere with control
over that property. The argument in the code is that</div>
<a name="08110441000243"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The inclusion
of this objective acknowledges the importance of acting proportionately
in exercising these
powers.&#148;</div><a name="08110441000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not clear from the code what &#147;proportionately&#148; means
and under what circumstances the Government think it appropriate to
break those rights of control. The partial transfer mechanism does
break that right of control, and some safeguards will be put in place
over the exercise of that right. It would be helpful if the Minister
threw some light on paragraph 13 of the code. As drafted, it does not
go far enough in setting out the way in which this objective could be
satisfied.</div><a name="08110441000254"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="08110441000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to move to amendments Nos. 74, 76 and 78. We now have an
opportunity to discuss whether the list of objectives in clause 4 is
complete and whether there are other objectives that we should bear in
mind when exercising these powers where there are the stabilisation
tools, and what sort of framework should be used to govern the choice
of tools by the tripartite authorities. I do not want to steal the
thunder of the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall by picking up on
amendment No. 74, but, as he said from a sedentary position, it
complements amendment No. 76, which inserts a new objective 6 to
protect the interests of creditors.</div>
<a name="08110441000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">This brings a
different dimension to the debate about the objectives. We talked about
them in the context of protecting depositors and the taxpayer. We
touched a little on the context of objective 5, but other people have
an interest in how the stabilisation tools are going to be used. There
are creditors who will have an interest, not just trade creditors, but
non-retail depositors. These are people who have money on deposit with
a particular bank who are not covered by the FSCS and whose accounts
will not be transferred across automatically in the way that
we had envisaged in the context of objective
3.</div><a name="08110441000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth just mentioning that objective 3 just talks about depositors.
It is no more specific than that. It does not say retail. The Minister
might argue that objective 3 covers wholesale as well as retail
depositors. This is where some tension arises in the clause. One can
envisage a situation where it is possible to achieve objectives 3 and 4
in the context of a particular crisis by transferring depositors across
to a third party and then 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 299</div>setting off a mortgage book to a separate third party through a fire
sale. That fire sale may raise enough to cover the taxpayers&#146;
exposure, and obviously the transfer deposits would meet the interests
of the depositors, but would it be sufficient to cover the interests of
other creditors? There is insufficient recognition in the clause of the
interests of other creditors. Inserting objective 6 or objective 3A
into the Bill would provide a dimension that is currently
lacking.</div><a name="08110441000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
objective of the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall goes rather wider
than mine in terms of the enterprise value. It will take into account
the interests of shareholders. One of the things that we recognised in
the debate is that shareholders should bear some of the costs of the
failure of an institution. The question is whether having the more
precise definition that we should aim to protect the interests of the
creditors is a good way to ensure that the range of creditors in the
institutions are
protected.</div><a name="08110441000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
area that we need to think about is bondholders. There is some concern
that when we look at the people who provide capital, we often do so in
the context of shareholders and the equity element of the capital in a
business. Clearly, many institutions do raise money through bond
issues. That is where part of the concern comes regarding the adequacy
of the safeguards under the Bill as to whether bondholders&#146;
interests are adequately protected. Explicit reference through either
proposed objective 3(a) or objective 6 would help ensure there is some
recognition of the role that bondholders play in financing businesses
and that their interests are not being disregarded in the pursuit of
any of the other objectives.</div>
<a name="08110441000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
78 will, at the end of line 20, insert the words:</div>
<a name="08110441000244"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and to ensure
that the expenditure of any public or private funds is done in an
economically efficient manner.&#148;</div>
<a name="08110441000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is to make sure
that we look very carefully at the way taxpayers&#146; funds are
being used to resolve financial problems at a particular institution.
In examining the various tools that the Government are looking at, are
we making sure that the best way to get value for our money is
considered? If they are looking at financial support, perhaps through a
guarantee of deposits, is that the most effective way of meeting the
objectives of the Bill? Are there better, more effective ways they
could achieve
that?</div><a name="08110441000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 76 has two more objects. It protects the interests of creditors and
inserts a new objective 7, which is to avoid distorting competition
among banks. Amendment No. 79 amplifies the meaning of
objective 7.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000368"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> This is a very important issue. When the Government
first suggested that Lloyds and HBOS could join together and tear up
competition law, it was because no public money would be
involved&#151;it was going to be a private sector settlement. We have
subsequently seen huge amounts of public money being put into this
mega-bank. If the proposed objective&#151;a very important
one&#151;were included, it would not allow that sort of thing to
happen. It seems a very important addition to the
objectives.</div><a name="08110441000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000369"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Competition is important. It has cropped up twice
in the current financial crisis, initially in the context of Northern
Rock and also in the context of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 300</div>merger of Lloyds and HBOS. Banks and building societies expressed
concern at the time of the acquisition into public ownership of
Northern Rock&#151;which now feels more like
nationalisation&#151;that Northern Rock would be able to use its
position of effectively having a sovereign guarantee, by virtue of
being owned by the Government, to operate in a way which would
undermine the competitive position of other institutions. Having the
guarantee, it could market itself as being as safe as
houses&#151;perhaps not the best analogy, given the state of the
house market. It was seen as a safe bet because the Government were
standing behind it. Arrangements were put in place to ensure that
Northern Rock did not exploit its competitive position vis- -vis
other
lenders.</div><a name="08110441000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000370"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> Obviously, that is exactly what happened. At some
stage Northern Rock had to cease taking certain moneys and products and
also had to ensure it was complying with state aid rules which could be
invoked. So, it is a real situation, which could easily arise again. It
is almost axiomatic that an institution is placed at a competitive
advantage if the Government become involves in that institution and
stand behind
it.</div><a name="08110441000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000371"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Indeed. My recollection is that the start of the
Northern Rock debate was about yield and return, rather than stability.
When we had the second wave of financial instability in the aftermath
of Lehmans and people were moving their deposits around, Northern Rock
became particularly attractive, as did certain Irish banks because the
Irish Government gave a 100 per cent. guarantee. There was a flight to
safety rather than to yield&#151;a change in approach. My hon. Friend
the Member for Wellingborough was about to intervene&#151;perhaps
that covered his point. As I said, we will come on to HBOS in a
second.</div><a name="08110441000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000372"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> That was the gist of the argument that the hon.
Member for South-East Cornwall made. If we have a series of objectives
that have to be balanced in making a decision, is it not important that
this objective is one of them? At the moment it would be excluded from
consideration.</div><a name="08110441000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000373"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> That is why we were trying to tease out from the
Minister why the Government have not included the objective of
competition and distorting competition between banks. My hon. Friend
raised the issue of Lloyds TSB and HBOS. When the deal was
announced&#151;prior to the Government&#146;s recapitalisation
package&#151;both Houses agreed that the competition rules should be
waived to facilitate the merger. Referral of the bid would have slowed
the process, added to the uncertainty in the financial markets and
created more
instability.</div><a name="08110441000224"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110441000374"></a><b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): Does the hon.
Gentleman accept that funds flowing to a certain organisation or people
behaving in a certain way do not mean that the bank or institution
concerned is taking advantage of its position? The Governor of
the Bank of England made that point yesterday in the
Treasury Committee. It is about public perception. The hon. Gentleman
would have to frame an objective that dealt with the intent of the
organisation in trying to exploit its
position.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 301</div><a name="08110441000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110441000375"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Lady makes a good point, which goes back
to the example of Northern Rock. Potential depositors saw Northern Rock
as a safe place to put their money because it was under public control,
not because of any deliberate action on behalf of its management. That
is why proposed new subsection (11) in amendment No. 79 says that
a</div><a name="08110441000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;bank
is prohibited from using its favourable position or Government support
to its commercial advantage and thereby to prevent, restrict or distort
competition in the market for financial services as a whole, or on a
product by product
basis&#148;.</div><a name="08110441000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
tries to limit the opportunities for a bank to use the fact that it is
backed by the Government to engage in distorting competition. That
issue was dealt with in Northern Rock by saying that there was a limit
to how many of its products would appear in a best-buy table. In that
