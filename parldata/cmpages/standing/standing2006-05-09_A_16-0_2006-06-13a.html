<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000476"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):</b> Good
morning, Mr. Benton. I welcome you to the Chair on this now sunny
morning as we come to part 5 of the Finance Bill. The clause provides
for a new basis for determining the market value of oil for petroleum
revenue tax purposes related to the non-arm&#146;s length disposal of
oil. The changes are being introduced because the opportunities that
the current market value rules provide give considerable scope for tax
arbitrage. The current rules that rely on a range of market values
during a month are being replaced therefore under clauses 147 and 148
with prices based around what will be termed the notional delivery day
for the majority of crude oils. They will be known as category 1 oils.
For other blends of oil when prices are less readily available, Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs will work with producers of those
particular blends to arrive at an agreed and acceptable valuation
method.</div><a name="06061357000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under current
rules, as the Committee may be aware, the market value of oil for
non-arm&#146;s length disposals&#151;in other words, generally
disposals within a wider group&#151;is arrived at by taking an
average of arm&#146;s length prices during a month. That calculation
method allows companies to track prices over a month and decide whether
to dispose of oil at arm&#146;s length or non-arm&#146;s length
depending on which was more tax-efficient and produced the lowest tax
charge. The result was a significant tax loss to the public purse, and
contractual and sales decisions based on tax considerations rather than
commercial considerations.</div>
<a name="06061357000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new rules stop such
practices by valuing non-arm&#146;s length sales of oil around the
prices available two days before the delivery date, the delivery date
itself and two days after, the so-called 2-1-2 method. That is commonly
used in commercial contracts. New rules will be introduced to arrive at
a delivery date for all circumstances when oil is disposed of at
non-arm&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column543" />Column number: 544</div>length. Under those rules, the delivery date will be the date of
completion of load or the date of the bill of lading, whichever is
appropriate.</div><a name="06061357000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
pricing method will apply to the major blends of oil for which there
are commonly quoted daily prices. They will be known as category 1
oils. Other oils where such prices are less available or not
appropriate will be known as category 2 oils, and HMRC and the
producers of such oil will reach agreement on the most appropriate
method for valuing such oils. On that basis, I commend the clause to
the
Committee.</div><a name="06061357000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061357000477"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Paul Goodman</b> (Wycombe) (Con): Welcome to the oil section
of the Finance Bill, Mr. Benton. I know that it will be an unbelievably
exciting experience for you, as it will be for the rest of us. The
heading &#147;New basis for determining market value&#148; is
probably the most eye-catching of the headings of clauses 147 to 155
that cover the oil section, although that might not be saying very
much. It must be said that some of the remaining clauses, especially
clauses 153 and 155, are more
significant.</div><a name="06061357000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must
confess that I have recently become used to Ministers moving clauses
formally, so I was not necessarily expecting to hear the lucid
explanation of the clause that the Financial Secretary has just given.
However, since I have, I wish to ask him a couple of questions. The
provisions are presented simply as an anti-avoidance clause. If it is
such a clause, obviously we welcome its aim. It is important to
eradicate attempts to take unfair advantage of the tax rules. I should
like to hear an assurance from the hon. Gentleman that the clause is
unconnected with the other tax changes that are proposed under the
remaining clauses. Perhaps he would give us an idea of how much revenue
it will
raise.</div><a name="06061357000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061357000478"></a><b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): It is useful to consider what
the Treasury Committee said about the pre-Budget report. It welcomed
the Treasury&#146;s promise of no further increases in North sea oil
taxation in the length of this Parliament, <i class="I"></i>not least because any
further subsequent increases might increase uncertainty about future
taxation of oil companies and might serve as a disincentive for future
investment in the North sea.</div>
<a name="06061357000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">In January, the Institute for
Fiscal Studies&#146; green budget pointed to the problem of the type
of tax regime introduced in 2002 and the supplementary charge being
introduced. They said
that</div><a name="06061357000402"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the neutrality of
this tax regime rests crucially on the constancy of the tax rate. If
the tax rate that applies to future returns is expected to be higher
than the tax rate at which upfront investment costs attract tax relief,
then projects with a positive net present value in the absence of tax
may become unattractive to
investors&#148;.</div><a name="06061357000403"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
key thing about both the Treasury Committee and the IFS is that one
called for certainty and the other called for constancy. While there
may be disagreements over tax rates and over new and unnecessarily
complex regulation, I agree that clause 147 provides a solid and
comprehensive framework for determining the market value of oil, and
clause 148 provides for its introduction. I welcome the comprehensive
nature of clause
147.</div><a name="06061357000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000479"></a>John
Healey:</b> The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie)
ended rather sooner than I had expected. I thought that he was going on
to add a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column544" />Column number: 545</div>caveat to his welcome for the mechanism set out in clauses 147 and 148
for determining market value. He calls them solid and comprehensive as
a framework and I welcome that. Particularly in relation to his
amendments to clause 153, we will no doubt come on to debate the nature
of stability and certainty in the tax regime and how that can best be
delivered or, in some cases, undermined by some of the
proposals.</div>
<a name="06061357000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Suffice it to say that I
emphasise to him and to the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) that
the measures in clauses 147 and 148 and in the two sets of clauses that
are coming up, before we get on to the question of supplementary charge
rates, are revenue protection measures. On Second Reading, the hon.
Member for Dundee, East said in a discussion with my right. hon. Friend
the Paymaster General, which was subsequently confirmed and clarified
to him in a letter on 4 May, that they are revenue protection measures
and are not connected with the question of the level of taxation of
North sea oil and gas.</div>
<a name="06061357000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can inform the hon. Member
for Wycombe that the measures in amendment No. 147 were announced at
the pre-Budget report. They were published in a discussion document for
the industry in July last year. The industry has been looking at them,
helping us develop the detail and expecting them to be introduced. The
hon. Gentleman asked what the revenue protected will be. Alongside the
announcement in the pre-Budget report in December, we confirmed that
the estimated revenue protected, using the new method of calculating
market valuations, will be &#163;40 million this
year,&#163;80 million next year, &#163;80 million the
following year and &#163;80 million ongoing.</div>
<a name="06061357000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, it is a revenue
protection measure. It is necessary. It is based on the experience that
we have had, not of all companies but of some companies stealing a
march on their competitors by the system of tax arbitrage to which the
current laws leave us open. On that basis, I urge the Committee to
support the Clause and Schedule
18.</div><a name="06061357000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

amendment would require that the power to make regulation with regard
to attribution of blended oil should not come into force until the
Chancellor has laid a report before both Houses on the extent of tax
avoidance in relation to blended oil. The reason is straightforward.
The Economic Secretary previously mentioned a letter to me from the
Paymaster General dated 4 May, in which the Paymaster General explained
that the proposed
changes</div><a name="06061357000405"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;are being
introduced to remove tax-driven distortions of oil company
behaviour.&#148;</div><a name="06061357000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
four occasions in her letter she gave further detail. She
said:</div><a name="06061357000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs is aware that not all companies
operating in the North Sea are involved in this tax-driven
behaviour&#148;.</div><a name="06061357000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
indicates, of course, that some companies are. She also refers to
revenues being lost because of tax-driven behaviour by some oil
companies. She
says:</div><a name="06061357000407"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Clause
149 has been introduced to reduce the flexibility in the current oil
allocation systems, which allow oil companies to pick and choose when
deciding which contributing fields are the source of a particular oil
delivery and so minimise their oil tax
liabilities.&#148;</div><a name="06061357000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">She also
says:</div><a name="06061357000408"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Companies
have been exploiting the current flexibility in the allocation rules to
minimise their PRT liabilities by allocating oil to non-PRT fields when
the price is high and from PRT fields when the price is
lower.&#148;</div><a name="06061357000428"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="06061357000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
therefore clear. It is further described inthe regulatory
impact assessment, in which the Government describe manipulation of the
current rules. That costs &#163;45 million a year, with the loss of a
further &#163;35 million through the replacement of equity oil with
purchased third-party oil. The industry tells us, however, that there
is a technical explanation for blending, which is not simply about tax,
although tax 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column547" />Column number: 548</div>will be a consideration in any commercial transaction. I am told that
blending is due to a multiplicity of fields feeding into a gathering
system, each of which has a different quality or grade, which itself
can change over time. On a stand-alone basis, each grade would trade at
either a discount or a premium to the price of the blend, depending on
whether it was of higher or lower quality than the average. Although
tax is taken into consideration, there are technical reasons for
blending. </div><a name="06061357000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, the
background note in the explanatory notes provides another very useful
description of the process. It
says:</div><a name="06061357000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
number of pipeline systems blend production from oil fields, some of
which are subject to PRT and others, which are not. An issue arises for
tax purposes when the oil is sold, concerning how to allocate the sale
for tax purposes across the producer&#146;s different field
interests.&#148;</div><a name="06061357000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on to
suggest that</div><a name="06061357000410"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;many small
producers of oil may sell their oil entitlement to larger producers
under what are termed &#145;month of entitlement&#146; contracts.
Buyers of such oil, which is not subject to PRT or supplementary charge
when on-sold, can choose to satisfy sales contracts with this oil
instead of their own
production.&#148;</div><a name="06061357000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
issues arise. First, tax advantages might well accrue from blending,
but they are the result of the blending process and not a deliberate
act of tax avoidance. Secondly, following on from the description in
the background note, what might the knock-on, perhaps unintended,
consequences be for small producers should the large producers choose
to source only from their own equity oil, and not to purchase from
small producers elsewhere? Amendment No. 374 seeks to have the
Government publish a detailed report on the extent of genuine tax
avoidance in the sector, and perhaps to contrast and compare that with
tax advantage that is gained not directly as a result of an avoidance
measure but simply as a consequence of blending for good technical
reasons.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000482"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> I want briefly to congratulate the hon. Member
for Dundee, East on having found a device that enables the Committee to
find out from the Financial Secretary the main intention of companies
that carry out the blending. Do they do it because they have to for
technical reasons, or to what extent is it to do with tax avoidance?
Just in case the hon. Member for Dundee, East was not clear&#151;I
think that he was entirely clear&#151;I point out that we want to
hear the Financial Secretary&#146;s assessment of whether blending
takes place so that the companies involved can avoid tax? Do the
companies agree with his assessment? However, I warn the hon. Member
for Dundee, East, although it has probably occurred to him, that I
shall not be at all surprised if the Financial Secretary suggests that
the hon. Gentleman might be eying a tax avoidance device a bit too
favourably. We shall
see.</div><a name="06061357000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000483"></a>John
Healey:</b> The hon. Member for Dundee, East began his
comments on the amendment by making a series of much wider points. In
many ways, I do not want to anticipate the debates on the supplementary
charge rate. As we explained in the pre-Budget report, the tax changes,
the supplementary charge rate and the package that came with it were
made in response to the increase in oil prices over the medium term.
They were not a response to short-term fluctuations and spikes, as he
indicated. Principally, the measures were taken to ensure that the rate
of tax and therefore gain to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column548" />Column number: 549</div>British taxpayer and Exchequer is appropriate and fair. In other words,
it will ensure a fair share of return to the UK public for the
exploitation of a natural national resource. In a sense, the changes
reflect the current situation and balance of factors rather than the
assessment that we made and the package that we introduced in 2002.
That is why we believe that the overhaul is justified, necessary and
sustainable. We think that it sets an appropriate level of taxation for
North sea oil and gas for the duration of this
Parliament.</div><a name="06061357000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
speak to the more specific nature of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment. As he explained, it seeks to delay the implementation of
clause 149, which seeks to ensure that the tax price for a disposal of
blended oil is allocated appropriately based on the producer&#146;s
field entitlements. As I indicated earlier, and to which he referred,
he raised the matter on Second Reading with my right hon. Friend the
Paymaster General. On4 May, in a letter to him, she explained
in much more detail the reason for clause 149.</div>
<a name="06061357000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that my explanation will
deal also with the point made by the hon. Member for Wycombe.
Essentially, the issue arises because a company&#146;s lifting of
blended oil may be derived from three different sources: from fields
subject to petroleum revenue tax, from fields not subject to petroleum
revenue tax and from oil bought in from other producers. The hon.
Member for Dundee, East indicated the degree of flexibility in the
current system of allocations. In effect, there are few, if any, rules
that govern the way in which those allocations are made for tax
purposes. In practice, blending goes on, and clause 149 will mean that
the commercial benefits and practices derived from blending will not be
affected.</div> <a name="06061357000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">A problem
arises with the allocation for tax purposes of oil that goes into a
particular blend. The existing rules for allocating blended oil to
particular fields for tax purposes are too flexible; some companies
have been able to allocate oil to non-PRT fields and to buy it in when
the price of oil is high, and then to allocate it to PRT fields when
prices are low, irrespective of from where the oil that composed the
blended oil derived. Those allocations do not reflect therefore the
actual proportions that each field contributes to a particular lifting
of oil.</div><a name="06061357000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs consulted the industry widely on
that issue, and we set out the issues in the discussion document that
we published in July last year. Since then, the matter has been
discussed fully with the industry, including with oil terminal
operators. The industry confirmed those discussions, and HMRC&#146;s
further analysis confirmed the extent of that tax-driven practice. The
analysis and discussions support fully the extent of the protection
required and the impact of our proposed measures. As the Red Book
explained, we expect those measures to protect revenue of &#163;20
million this year, and &#163;35 million next year and &#163;35
million ongoing in the following
years.</div><a name="06061357000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Dundee, East focused his amendment on the date of implementation.
Indeed,the industry was concerned early on&#151;following
the discussions kicked off in July 2005&#151;that the Government
might want to implement the measures on 1 January 2006. It told us that
that would give companies little time to reorganise their internal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column549" />Column number: 550</div>compliance procedures. At the time of the pre-Budget report, we
announced that the changes to the valuation of non-arms-length
disposals of oil would run from1 July 2006, rather than 1
January. That also allowed us to take further into account some of the
other representations about the technical detail.</div>
<a name="06061357000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">To reassure the Committee, I
point out that although the industry body, the United Kingdom Offshore
Operators Association, has some concerns about the regulatory and
administrative impact on its member companies, it notes
that</div><a name="06061357000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Government has listened to specific concerns raised by the industry
during the consultation process about unforeseen economic, technical or
practical consequences and that it has amended its original
proposal.&#148;</div><a name="06061357000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are introducing a necessary, proportionate measure in a way that has
responded to the detailed discussions and points put to us by the
industry. The industry expects the measure to be implemented
from1 July and has expected that to happen since we confirmed
it in the pre-Budget report in December. The amendment tabled by the
hon. Member for Dundee, East may have been useful in opening up some of
the broader discussions, but I hope that he will not press
it.</div><a name="06061357000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000484"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> I have listened to the Financial Secretary. He
spoke at the beginning about the balance of factors in 2006 being taken
into consideration, rather than the situation in 2002, and explained
that oil and blending could be derived from PRT oil, non-PRT oil and,
indeed, third-party purchased oil. He also referred to the
consultation. I have seen the comments on the UKOOA website, and so
on.</div><a name="06061357000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was telling
that the Financial Secretary said that some companies have been able to
allocate oil to their tax advantage, irrespective of the blending
requirements. He also said that the proposed measures were
proportionate. My difficulty is that I am none the wiser about the
value of the tax benefit that comes from the purely technical process
of blending and what part of the tax advantage comes through active tax
avoidance.</div><a name="06061357000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I heard

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000505"></a>John
Healey:</b> I rise briefly at this point because this set of
amendments to clauses 150, 151 and 152 introduces the changes to the
nomination scheme that, we believe, are required. It may help the
Committee if I say a word about clause 150, which is the context for
the amendments that we are considering.</div>
<a name="06061357000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 150, together with
clauses 151 and 152, provides for changes to the nomination scheme for
petroleum revenue tax purposes. The nomination scheme is an
anti-avoidance one introduced by the previous Government. It was
designed to stop the process of what was known as &#147;tax
spinning&#148;, which is when companies enter into a range of
forward-sales contracts enabling them to decide which to deliver their
equity oil through so as to minimise their PRT liabilities. In the past
18 months, HM Revenue and Customs has become aware that the time limits
in the nomination scheme still provide an opportunity for companies to
tax spin. Therefore the aim of the scheme is being undermined. That
results in a considerable loss of tax, particularly with the rise in
oil prices. The tax saving provides those companies that have the
facility and, more particularly, those that use the flexibility in the
rules to tax spin with an unfair commercial advantage. It is for that
reason that the Government believe that it is time to tighten up the
rules. The clause therefore provides for changes in the way that
nomination excesses are calculated under the revised nomination
scheme.</div><a name="06061357000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
consulted the petroleum industry on the changes and have significantly
redesigned our original proposals to tackle the issue because of
industry concerns about repercussions that were not intended by the
measures.</div><a name="06061357000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments allow for nomination excesses that are brought into charge
for ring-fenced corporation tax and supplementary charge purposes to be
deductible against non-ring-fenced corporation tax profits. The
amendments add a relieving provision to the clause. They allow such
excesses to be deductible in arriving at a company&#146;s
non-ring-fenced profits. That ensures that the scheme can be effective
and that companies are not taxed unfairly. It also meets a concern
raised by the oil industry during discussions on the oil tax pricing
measures contained in the clauses. I commend the amendments to the
Committee.</div><a name="06061357000104"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<a name="06061357000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the $40
scenario, 24 projects would be deterred, resulting in a reduction of
field investment of some &#163;1.13 billion and of operating costs of
&#163;1.1 billion,and lost production of 189 million
barrels. Under the $30 scenario, 24 fields or projects would be
deterred, the likely reduction in investment would be about &#163;1.8
billion, the reduction in operating costs would be
about&#163;1.3 billion and the reduction in production would
be about 230 million
barrels.</div><a name="06061357000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
increase in the supplementary charge, combined with the high world oil
price, gave the Government a significant windfall last year, and is
likely to do so again this year, if the world price falls, and the tax
rate remains high, there could be hugely detrimental effects on the
industry and Exchequer yield.</div>
<a name="06061357000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over the next 30 years, that
current short-term gain could be outweighed by a loss of &#163;18
billion in oil-tax revenue if the price were to fall to $40 a barrel
and the tax rate remain high, and a further loss of
another&#163;18 billion if it were to fall as low as $25 a
barrel. Those figures are based on calculations from Professor Alex
Kemp, published last week, which suggest that over the lifetime of the
sector, some 3 billion barrels of potential output could be lost from
the North sea if the oil price were to fall to $30 a barrel and the tax
rate remain
high.</div><a name="06061357000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061357000509"></a><b class="B">Rob
Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): The hon.
Gentleman has given us a welter of figures, but will he disaggregate
the effects of varying oil prices and the supplementary tax? One needs
to disaggregate the two in order to make sense of those figures, unless
he did so and I missed it, in which case I apologise. If not, please
will he disaggregate the effects of those two
factors?</div><a name="06061357000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000510"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> The precise purpose of the research was to
aggregate the consequence of both factors. The conclusion might be
different if the world price fell and tax was lower or higher, and
likewise, if tax was lower or higher and the oil price stayed the same,
there would be a different result. The point of the research and the
amendments is that the factors are aggregated because that is the
current situation. We must take both price and tax into
consideration.</div><a name="06061357000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000511"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> But let us say that the world oil price falls to
$25 a barrel and the supplementary charge remains at 20 per cent. If
that happened, we would have his figures. However, if one were to strip
out the 20 per cent. charge, and find that exploration, for example,
remained almost totally unaffected by not having that supplementary
charge, or having it at 10 per cent., one would know that the world oil
price was the predominant factor, about which it is hard for the
Government to do anything.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column553" />Column number: 554</div><a name="06061357000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000512"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is trying to
say. I shall give him sight of the report later, and he will see that
it is not simply extraction that tails of, but exploration and
development, and likewise with the high tax base and low world oil
price&#151;I shall come on to the low world oil price in just a
moment.</div><a name="06061357000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I do
that, I shall speak briefly to the amendment itself, which is designed
to provide a balance between protecting extraction from marginal fields
when the oil price falls, and protecting Exchequer yield when the oil
price remains high. We need to consider that and put the mechanism in
place now because it is clear that future investment decisions will be
driven by current tax and oil price forecasts. Those decisions take a
long time to put into place; people have to forecast what is likely to
happen in the
future.</div><a name="06061357000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the tax
rate, price is a driver, and we cannot count on oil prices easing much
in the near future. It is likely that the price will average $40 in the
medium term. In the long run, it might be $25 or $30. Those are not my
words; that is what Lord Brown from BP said yesterday in Der Spiegel.
In short, the UK risks losing out on some &#163;60 billion of oil
production, and potentially &#163;18 billion of oil revenues if the
world oil price follows the pattern suggested by Lord Brown and the tax
remains high. Amendment No. 375 is designed to tackle that. Should the
oil price fall to less than$30 a barrel, the increase in the
supplementary charge, which is equivalent to a 25 per cent. rise in
corporation tax, will cease to have effect. However, it is not designed
to be a one-way regulator. If the price rose again, the Chancellor
could, by order, reinstate the increase.</div>
<a name="06061357000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061357000513"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): I am interested in the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s analysis. Has he done a sensitivity analysis on
the effect of the $10 shift from $40 to $30 in terms not just of the
cost to the Exchequer but of jobs, inward investment, balance of trade
and security of supply? They are just as important as the revenue
issues that the Government seem to be focusing
on.</div>
<a name="06061357000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000514"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> When I have as many civil servants as the Treasury,
I shall complete the full analysis for the hon. Gentleman. The key
point is the change from$40 to $30. Because each field is
different, the tipping point into or from viability is also different.
Amendment No. 376 tackles that problem. Should the world oil price fall
to below $40 a barrel but stay above $30, the Chancellor would be
obliged to report to Parliament options to vary the supplementary
charge. If the fall was to $38 or $39 a barrel, and it was estimated
that that was a short-term blip and it was likely to rise again, the
option might be to keep the charge as it was. If it dropped to $33 or
$34 a barrel as part of a long-term downward trend, the assessment
might be to reduce increases in the supplementary charge or to take
some other action.</div>
<a name="06061357000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intention of both the
amendments is clear. It is to create a framework that allows a fair tax
yield while encouraging investment now and development and extraction
from the North sea well into the
future.</div>
<a name="06061357000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000515"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> Again, I congratulate the hon. Member for Dundee,
East on the ingenuity with which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column554" />Column number: 555</div>he has framed his amendments. He is right, in commenting on this clause
and others, to draw attention to the context in which this part on oil
operates&#151;namely, the main proposal to double the10 per
cent. surcharge on corporation tax, which the Chancellor announced in
the pre-Budget report last year. The Chancellor also announced that
there would be no further rises in North sea oil tax during this
Parliament. We would not mind hearing confirmation from the Financial
Secretary that that is stillthe Government&#146;s position.
The Chancellor also announced that companies would be given tax
incentives to help them to explore and develop &#147;the most
difficult fields&#148; by extending the exploration expenditure
supplement to all ring-fenced activity that we will consider in a later
clause.</div> <a name="06061357000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to note that the reaction of the oil industry to that package
of announcements was unfavourable. Malcolm Webb, chief executive of the
United Kingdom Offshore Operators Association,
said:</div><a name="06061357000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At a
single stroke, the Treasury has rewritten the Industry&#146;s future.
It will severely undermine business
confidence&#148;.</div><a name="06061357000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect
that Ministers&#146; reaction to those words, and other words of
disapproval that were spoken at the time, was to say in
private&#151;they would not put it so undiplomatically in
public&#151;&#147;Well, the oil companies would say that,
wouldn&#146;t they?&#148; That response might in some quarters, but
certainly not in Scotland, find a sympathetic public ear, because the
oil companies are not an immediate source of public affection. They do
not, for instance, command the same popularity as fluffy kittens. None
the less, they are important contributors to the economic prosperity
not only of Scotland but of the UK&#151;which fluffy kittens, on the
whole, are
not.</div><a name="06061357000430"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="06061357000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The industry
ranks among the top 10 global producers. It provides employment for
more than 260,000 people, many of whom work in Scotland, though not
all&#151;it is a UK-wide issue. To cite a random figure, 11 per cent.
of that number are in the north of England and East Anglia. In the last
financial year, furthermore, the Treasury gained some &#163;7 billion
from the industry, and the proposed increase will result in a further
&#163;2 billion intake. So clearly it is necessary to consider
whether Mr. Webb might be
right.</div><a name="06061357000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, the
North sea competes with other basins. Reserves are being depleted and
tax increases are unlikely, to put it mildly, to make the North sea
more attractive. According to the industry, the new incentives to which
the Chancellor referred in the pre-Budget report, which we shall
consider later, are unlikely to compensate for the doubling of the
corporation tax surcharge. Indeed, according to the UK Offshore
Operators Association, the corporation tax increases will reduce the
post-tax value of new discoveries by about 16 per
cent.</div><a name="06061357000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ministers and
others might say that the industry was previously wrong to issue such
warnings, because tax increases did not damage profitability. That is
true, but at this stage we must consider the relationship between
profitability and high oil prices which we have already 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column555" />Column number: 556</div>explored this morning. Having introduced the supplementary charge in the
2002 Budget, the Treasury is coming back for a second bite at the
cherry. The industry is a convenient source of revenue while profits
remain large and revenues
high.</div><a name="06061357000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The quote of
Lord Brown that the hon. Member for Dundee, East has just provided
illustrates my point that there is a clear danger&#151;I put it no
higher than that&#151;that the Treasury is gambling on oil prices
remaining high. If they do not remain high and the gamble goes wrong,
the industry will be hit by the double whammy of higher taxes and high
exploration costs, as the Treasury Committee
warned.</div><a name="06061357000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
parallel with pensions taxation. Pension funds seemed to be an easy
source of income in 1997, when most boasted surpluses, and the oil
companies seem to be an easy source of income now, while they are
making very considerable profits. However, just as the
Chancellor&#146;s decision to take the easy option on pensions led to
unexpected consequences for the pensions industry and for pensioners,
there is a danger that the increase will lead to unexpected
consequences for the oil industry and those who work in
it.</div><a name="06061357000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Dundee, East probably agrees with me that the arrangement proposed
is not ideal. Ideally, a commodity tax should be set at a level that is
robust enough to accommodate any fluctuations in the price of that
commodity. He is making the best of a bad job by suggesting that the
tax contains dangers and should be adjusted according to rises and
falls in price. That does not provide the stability and certainty that
the industry would ideally wish
for.</div><a name="06061357000139"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000516"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> What does the hon. Gentleman consider to be a fair
tax, to avoid the necessity of a regulator as I am
proposing?</div><a name="06061357000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000517"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Gentleman with
my response. If he is asking me at what level I think the tax should be
set, I have to answer that the Opposition are not in government, but we
expect to be in 2009 and we shall give him that information shortly
before the election. I cannot do better than that this
morning.</div><a name="06061357000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those
reasons, my hon. and right hon. Friends and I are not immediately
attracted to the amendments, but we want to hear the Financial
Secretary give a clearer and fuller explanation than we have heard to
date of the need for the changes and their effect on the industry
generally, particularly on employment. We believe that the Financial
Secretary should explain, for example, what assessments&#151;the
latest updated assessments&#151;the Treasury has made of how the new
tax regime will compare with that operated by our competitors, what
impact the surcharge increase will make on costs and what impact the
new tax regime will have on employment in the industry and its supply
chain. We should be grateful if he addressed all those
points.</div><a name="06061357000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061357000518"></a><b class="B">Julia
Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): I have a couple
of short points to add. The hon. Member for Wycombe was talking about
the need for a stable framework and said that the amendments tabled by
the hon. Member for Dundee, East did not achieve 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column556" />Column number: 557</div>that. There is also a point to be made about the fact that the
announcements on increasing the supplementary charge are adding
instability and uncertainty to the system. Ultimately, the proposals
were advanced and justified on the basis of high oil prices, but we
have never heard about any framework that explains what will happen in
the event of oil prices falling. The hon. Member for Dundee, East has
done a good job in raising this
issue.</div><a name="06061357000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000519"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I find the hon. Lady&#146;s remarks
extraordinary, coming as they do from a member of a party that has just
announced its intention to increase green taxes. This is an increase of
tax on oil by the Government, which is a green tax, whether she likes
it or not. Can she tell us whether she supports an increase in green
taxes?</div><a name="06061357000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000520"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I have never heard the Chancellor of the
Exchequer describe this as a green tax. We are talking about certainty
for the market, which is what our proposals are about, although I am
sure that it is not in order to talk about those in this
forum.</div><a name="06061357000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Prime
Minister is worried about energy security and talking about what we
need to maximise on our doorstep, he needs to ensure that fields are
not decommissioned too early, because every barrel of oil that stays in
the North sea oil fields will neither pay tax nor employ any people.
Again, that is an important issue. I shall appreciate hearing the
Financial Secretary&#146;s comments on what impact he feels the
changes will have and what efforts his Department is undertaking to
ensure that there is market certainty in this area, because currently
there is
not.</div><a name="06061357000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000521"></a>John
Healey:</b> I am interested in the fact that the spokespeople
for the three Opposition parties are trying to question, criticise and
contest the decisions taken in the pre-Budget report on this new
package of tax rates and provisions. They could have chosen to debate
the matter more fully on the Floor of the House as part of proceedings
of the Committee of the whole House rather than in Committee this
morning. Nevertheless, I am grateful for the chance to do
so.</div><a name="06061357000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Dundee, East essentially says that he wants two things from the tax
regime. First, he wants a degree of stability and certainty. I caution
the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy), who says
that she is concerned about that as well; she needs to look carefully
at the amendments tabled by the hon. Gentleman, because, as I shall
explain in a moment, they are likely to have precisely the opposite
effect.</div> <a name="06061357000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
hon. Gentleman wants a fair tax regime for the North sea&#151;the UK
continental shelf. In that, he is with the Government. He did not
explain it, but our objectives for the North sea tax regime are
twofold: we want a fair tax system that delivers for the public the
appropriate returns from the exploitation that the companies are able
to make of a finite natural national resource; and we want a tax regime
that will encourage and support the levels of investment that will lead
to the fullest possible exploration, exploitation and recovery of those
resources.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column557" />Column number: 558</div><a name="06061357000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000522"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> Does the Financial Secretary recognise that we are
seeking through the amendments to take cognisance of what could happen
to investment and extraction, particularly in marginal fields, should
the oil price fall? Does he not think, whether he agrees with the
amendments or not, that considering the future and taking cognisance of
it in order to deal with such things now is
sensible?</div><a name="06061357000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000523"></a>John
Healey:</b> I shall deal in a moment with specific proposals
in the amendments. To begin with, however, I am trying to deal with the
more general and sweeping arguments that he and the hon. Member for
Wycombe raised.</div> <a name="06061357000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) was
absolutely correct when he referred to the press release and the use of
the Aberdeen study conflating two different impacts onthe
projections of future North sea oil tax revenues. The study conflates
the effect of a fall in global oil prices from $40 a barrel to $25 a
barrel with the impact of the increase in supplementary charge that we
are proposing from 10 to 20 per
cent.</div><a name="06061357000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The study from
which the hon. Member for Dundee, East quoted is interesting. He did
not draw on some sections. It suggests that a total investment of less
than &#163;1 billion over a period of 30 years might not go ahead
because of the increase in North sea oil taxation that was announced in
the pre-Budget report. It also forecast that there may be a loss of
less than 1 per cent. in total production, again during a 30-year
period. To put that into context, our initial calculations suggest that
the tax change might reduce tax revenues by less than &#163;1
billion, again over 30 years. That compares with an increase in tax
revenues of &#163;8.3 billion that we predict during the next four
years owing to the PBR changes. The importance of the study is that it
supports the conclusions of the Government&#146;s analysis that there
is little risk of a substantial change to investment because of the tax
increases that were announced in the pre-Budget report in
2005.</div> <a name="06061357000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Wycombe quoted the reaction of the United Kingdom Offshore
Operators Association. It may have been understandable, but let me
update him on the situation and commentary at the time of the changes.
On 6 April, <i class="I">The Scotsman</i>
reported:</div><a name="06061357000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
irritation and in some quarters outright anger at Chancellor Gordon
Brown&#146;s apparent &#145;smash-and-grab&#146; raid on the UK
earnings of the North Sea oil and gas sector has now sunk beneath the
surface and been largely
forgotten.</div><a name="06061357000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">No great
projects that anyone is aware of, or is shouting about, have been
cancelled, and life appears to have resumed its course much as
before.&#148;</div><a name="06061357000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The <i class="I">Aberdeen
Press and Journal, </i>which follows such matters particularly closely,
reported at the end of May that the United Kingdom Offshore Operators
Association was not expecting a collapse in the level of North sea
investment this decade. That should put into context and perspective
for the Committee the likely impact of the package of tax changes that
we announced in the pre-Budget report, give the lie to some of the more
overstated reactions that were made at the time, and undermine the
overstatement of the case that some still make against
them.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column558" />Column number: 559</div><a name="06061357000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000524"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> For the sake of clarity, I want to inquire in the
wake of newspaper cuttings whether the Financial Secretary has read
that UKOOA now supports the changes that have been
proposed.</div><a name="06061357000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000525"></a>John
Healey:</b> I suspect that the association might find itself
in some difficulty with its members if it came out in outright support
of the tax increase. However, to deal with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point about competitive taxation, it acknowledges
that</div><a name="06061357000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the UK still has
its advantages and that is why people still want to do business
here&#148;.</div> <a name="06061357000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2005, the
UK&#146;s oil tax regime was described by external commentators as
one of the most lenient in the world. A comparison of global tax
regimes showed that the North sea tax system before January 2006 was
one of the most favourable, with the Government&#146;s tax take on
new field developments being less than that in the United States of
America, Denmark, Italy, Norway, Australia, Indonesia and more than 50
other oil-producing regions. The UK&#146;s oil tax regime will
continue to be broadly comparable with other competitor regions
following the increase in supplementary charge, and it will continue to
be considerably more favourable than that in Denmark, Italy and
Norway.</div>
<a name="06061357000431"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="06061357000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the
amendments that the hon. Member for Dundee, East was proposing in the
context of a concern about stability, certainty and fairness in the
regime and its ability to promote the level of investment and
development that we would wish to see. Can I say to him at the outset
that I am not convinced by the arguments that he puts forward? I hope
that I can explain that to the Committee so that if he proposes to
press his amendments to a Division, the Committee will oppose
them.</div><a name="06061357000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important
to emphasise, as it has been questioned, the rationale for the changes
we announced in the pre-Budget report. In his concluding remark, the
hon. Gentleman said that he was looking for a fair tax yield. Let me
put the issue in context. As Committee Members will be aware, North sea
oil companies have recorded extremely strong profits in recent years.
They have recorded extremely strong profits because of a sustained
increase in global oil prices. Increased oil prices in the industry
feed directly into the profits from the North sea because oil prices
are set in the global market and are not affected by the local costs of
production in the North sea. Therefore, North sea companies make
significantly higher returns on capital employed than other companies
operating in the UK.</div>
<a name="06061357000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2004, typically those
companies had a pre-tax return of approximately 30 per cent. compared
to less than 13 per cent. for other non-financial companies. A recent
Office of National Statistics report suggested that those returns
increased to nearly 35 per cent. in 2005. Those strong profitability
levels are forecast to continue because of the upward shift in the
expected price of oil in the medium term.</div>
<a name="06061357000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, the increase in the
rate to the supplementary charge, announced in the pre-Budget report,
rebalances the North sea oil and gas fiscal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column559" />Column number: 560</div>regime; it rebalances the fiscal regime between oil producers and
consumers. It is an appropriate response to the sustained rise in oil
price levels and to the increased expectations of oil price outlook. It
amends the fiscal regime that we introduced in 2002 and does so to
reflect the world four years on.</div>
<a name="06061357000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would introduce
a price indexation into that system for the fiscal regime for the North
sea. One of the main requests made by North sea oil and gas companies
is for as much stability in the fiscal regime as possible. We
appreciate that. As a result, we are committed to no further increases
in North sea oil taxation for the lifetime of this Parliament. That
gives oil companies a degree of fiscal stability in the medium term
that we understand is important to their investment decisions. However,
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments would make the North sea fiscal
regime subject to short-term oil price fluctuations&#151;both up and
down. That would have an adverse effect on the stability and certainty
that he is keen to encourage. It would make it harder for companies to
make investment choices for the North sea.</div>
<a name="06061357000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Gentleman
understands, the North sea oil tax system, like all our fiscal regimes
in the UK, is kept under review carefully Budget by Budget. We will
continue to aim to deliver the twin policy objectives of first ensuring
that the Exchequer and the public receive a fair share of the revenues
from the UK&#146;s oil and gas reserves and secondly of promoting the
investment that the North sea needs for the
future.</div><a name="06061357000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, and
this may be of interest to members of the Committee, we place great
importance on the state of the North sea oil and fiscal regimes and the
changing nature of the companies&#146; investments that are made in
the UK continental shelf. We have recently opened discussions with the
industry to hear their concerns about the structure of the North sea
tax system and how well it is suited to the next stage of life of the
basin. Those discussions will continue for a large part of the rest of
this year. If companies wish to raise the issue of how the tax regime
will respond to changes in world oil prices, we will, of course,
discuss that with them and will consider any information, advice or
evidence that they might want to put to us. However, let me say
emphatically and finally that I am absolutely unconvinced that such
considerations should be linked to short-term movements in the level of
oil prices, which would be the effect of the amendments. I hope that,
on that basis and having had a wide- ranging debate, the hon. Gentleman
will consider withdrawing his amendments. If not, I shall have to ask
my hon. Friends to oppose them.</div>

Secretary&#146;s remarks, he spoke of ongoing consultations on
fluctuations in world prices. The Committee will understand that the
fundamental aim of the amendments was to probe whether that was to be
the case or whether there was to be a punitive tax regime when the oil
price was low, which would damage future development and ongoing
extraction. Given his comments, and the arithmetic of the Committee, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000528"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> This clause is more welcome to the industry and
to us than clause 153. Given that the ring-fence expenditure supplement
is intended to help companies exploring for oil or gas in the
development phase, can the Financial Secretary give us his latest
assessment as to how much additional development will result from the
introduction of this RFES&#151;considered, of course, in the context
of the overall package that he has put forward
today?</div><a name="06061357000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000529"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> The explanatory notes to the clause
state:</div><a name="06061357000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Companies
involved in exploration, appraisal and development activities in the
North Sea will typically incur losses in early years&#148;,</div>
<a name="06061357000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">which is self evident. They
add:</div><a name="06061357000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The EES
enables those companies to claim a 6 per cent. supplement per annum, on
the pool of qualifying exploration and appraisal expenditure that is
carried forward from one accounting period to another, until the
allowances can be used against income...This Schedule now extends
that principle to all unrelieved
expenditure.&#148;</div><a name="06061357000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is, of
course, welcome, but it would have been better had the Government been
able to go further: to level the playing field for new entrants by
increasing the extent to which unrelieved allowances are reimbursed, so
that new entrants have a stronger incentive to enter into exploration
in the North sea. Although it is UK policy to encourage the entry of
new players, those in a non-tax paying position are penalised by
comparison with existing players, because they cannot obtain immediate
tax relief on all exploration and development costs.</div>
<a name="06061357000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently, new entrants can
carry forward unrelieved allowances at 6 per cent. That could be
increased to reflect either the cost of capital for new
players&#151;at little cost to the Government&#151;or the marginal
rate of tax, which was the bolder incentive offered in Norway. When the
Government brought forward the proposals, did they consider increasing
the allowances to cover the full cost of capital for new entrants? Have
they examined the Norwegian model, which offers relief to the marginal
tax rate of 78 per
cent?</div><a name="06061357000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000530"></a>John
Healey:</b> This is a useful part of the package that clause
155 and schedule 9 introduce and I am glad that it has been welcomed in
principle by the Scottish nationalists and the main Opposition
spokesman.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column561" />Column number: 562</div><a name="06061357000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason for the provision is
to try to encourage a vigorous and active North sea industry, along
with levels of investment that will allow exploration and exploitation
to the fullest extent. That is the reason for the ring-fence
expenditure supplement. It is a measure that is targeted particularly
at companies that are new entrants to the North sea, and, given the
mature nature of the basin, I think that all hon. Members will
recognise that that is a small but key sector for the future North sea
industry.</div><a name="06061357000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point
made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East, we considered other options,
as he would have expected. However, our conclusion was that the right
move was to deal with the provisions and with the way that the
ring-fence expenditure supplement operates. The changes increase the
value of unused expenditure that is carried forward from one period to
another by a compound rate of 6 per cent. per annum, and they apply to
all unrelieved expenditure from 1 January 2006. It will be possible to
claim for a maximum of six accounting periods, and those periods will
not need to be
consecutive.</div><a name="06061357000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
answer to the question that was asked by the hon. Member for Wycombe is
more complex and has to be seen as part of a combination of factors
affecting investment. The RFES targets a small but increasingly
important subsection of the North sea oil industry. Its score in the
Red Book was relatively modest, but we expect its impact to be
significantly greater than the direct cost to the Exchequer, because it
will apply to losses over a number of years, so that its full tax
benefits, along with the activity that it may encourage, will not be
reflected simply in current Budget costings. I hope that hon. Members
on both sides will support the clause and the
schedule.</div><a name="06061357000182"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000531"></a>The
Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</b> Good morning, Mr.
Benton. The clause increases inheritance tax thresholds to
&#163;312,000 for transfers of value on or after 6 April 2008, and to
&#163;325,000 for transfers of value on or after 6 April 2009. That
follows the precedent set last year by the Government in establishing
the level of inheritance tax threshold beyond the immediate tax year,
when they set a level of &#163;285,000 for 2006-07 and
&#163;300,000 for 2007-08. By pre-announcing future increases at more
than the forecast level of statutory indexation we shall continue to
provide a fair and targeted system and certainty for
families.</div><a name="06061357000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
increased threshold for 2006-07 means that the number of tax-paying
estates in the current year will be about 37,000. Despite all the
recent scare stories in the media, it remains the case that only some 6
per cent. of the estates of those who die in 2006-07 will be subject to
IHT. The yield from tax-paying estates this year will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column562" />Column number: 563</div>be about &#163;3.6 billion. The full cost of the increased threshold
is some &#163;30 million against index-based, and I commend the
clause to the
Committee.</div>
<a name="06061357000432"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="06061357000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061357000532"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Theresa Villiers</b> (Chipping Barnet) (Con): House prices
have risen by 154 per cent. sinceMay 1997, and the extent of
inheritance tax has grown since the Labour party was elected.
Inheritance tax thresholds have risen by only 32 per cent. over the
same period and, as we have heard, the Government&#146;s income from
inheritance tax has increased considerably&#151;from &#163;1.6
billion to the &#163;3.6 billion to which the Paymaster General just
referred. According to HBOS, the number of estates that will pay
inheritance tax has more than doubled since 1996-97. Halifax estimates
that the number of properties in the UK valued at more than the current
threshold of &#163;285,000 now stands at about 1.5 million, or 8 per
cent. of all owner-occupied properties.</div>
<a name="06061357000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 1997, only one town in the
country, Gerrards Cross, had average house prices in excess of the
threshold. At the last election, that figure had risen to 87 towns.
Halifax has projected that that will nearly triple to 4.2 million
properties by 2010 if the threshold is increased only in line with
retail price inflation. It also anticipates that the revenue raised by
the tax could rise to &#163;5.5 billion by 2020.</div>
<a name="06061357000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The increases in the threshold,
which the Paymaster General outlined, will go some way to mitigating
those projected effects, but the fact remains that IHT is not just a
tax on the wealthy. It affects an increasingly wide range of people on
middle incomes and with modest assets. The effect is felt most keenly
in London and the south-east but, with rising real estate prices
acrossthe country, the IHT net is spreading. That is one of
the many reasons for our opposition to the proposed new IHT charges on
trusts contained in schedule 20, which, far from affecting a privileged
few, will impact on a range of ordinary
families.</div><a name="06061357000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000533"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls):</b> Will the
hon. Lady give the Committee her definition of middle income for these
purposes?</div><a name="06061357000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000534"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I do not have a precise figure for that.
However, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that the average house price
in London has certainly put a lot of people within the IHT
net.</div>
<a name="06061357000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000535"></a>Ed

define middle for these
purposes?</div><a name="06061357000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000536"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I think that I have answered that sufficiently.
I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for his
intervention.</div>
<a name="06061357000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000537"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Given the concerns that the hon. Lady is
raising about the IHT threshold, does her party plan to propose an
alternative threshold that she considers would be
fairer?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column563" />Column number: 564</div><a name="06061357000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000538"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> No, we are not making commitments on tax
thresholds at the moment because, as the shadow Chancellor made plain
in a speech in Manchester just a couple of weeks ago, we are not yet in
a position to know whether the country will be able to afford up-front
tax cuts at the point when, as we hope, we become the Government in
2009. Therefore, we are making no promises about reducing taxes. In the
long term, we will seek to share the proceeds of growth between
reducing taxes and generous funding for public services. However, in
the shorter term we are not in a position to make up-front promises
about tax
cuts.</div><a name="06061357000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000539"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Lady&#146;s position is ridiculous.
To suggest that one can say that an individual will be subject to
inheritance tax simply by taking the price of his house is typical of
the scare tactics in which the Conservative party unfortunately
engages. Let us be clear; in March 2006 the average house price for the
UK was &#163;159,950. However, let us take London. In fact, a lot of
the population does not live in London&#151;that might come as a bit
of a surprise to Conservative Members. In London, that figure is
&#163;235,000.</div> <a name="06061357000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady missed out two crucial points. Conveniently, she continues to
ignore the fact that only 6 per cent. of estates pay inheritance tax
because the majority of transfers, particularly of property, take place
between spouses and therefore are exempt, as she knows. We will discuss
that during consideration of another clause. Being a home owner does
not automatically bring a person into inheritance
tax.</div>
<a name="06061357000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000540"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> Does my right hon. Friend agree that the hon.
Member for Chipping Barnet overlooks the fact, as Conservatives often
do in the debate on house prices, that most of the people in the
south-east in London who might be caught be the provisions are actually
being taxed on death on a windfall profit from a rise in house prices?
That does not seem a bad tax at
all.</div><a name="06061357000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000541"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> In the debate on clause 157 and schedule 20
there will be discussions on the inheritance tax, and the point at
which it is levied and why. It does not do the House justice if some
Members frighten the living daylights out of citizens by
misrepresenting the facts and encouraging citizens to believe
incorrectly that they are in a particular tax
net.</div><a name="06061357000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000542"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> In the Paymaster General&#146;s opening
remarks, she referred to the threshold change as a fair and targeted
system, which is echoed in the Red Book. On what basis did she
determine the rise in figures put forward today for that fair and
targeted system? How did she determine that those figures represent a
fair system? On what basis did she make that
decision?</div><a name="06061357000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000543"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I did so by looking at the percentage of
estates within inheritance tax, recognising the cost to the
taxpayer&#151;&#163;30 million&#151;and by responding to
questions about how the tax system works in terms of income and
wealth.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column564" />Column number: 565</div><a name="06061357000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000544"></a>Mr.

would be good if they got the basic facts right in the first

Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): I welcome you to the
Chair, Mr. Benton. I shall make a straightforward point on the
Paymaster General&#146;s comments. She said that it is important to
get the facts right. Surely, one of those facts is this: according to
Halifax, if the threshold for inheritance tax had been increased in
line with the increase in house prices, that threshold would now be
&#163;425,000. The best that the Government can do in the Finance
Bill is to make the threshold &#163;325,000 by 2010. Is it not right
that, because of that measure, more people will be caught by the
tax?</div><a name="06061357000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061357000547"></a><b class="B">Stephen
Hesford</b> (Wirral, West) (Lab): The Opposition Front-Bench
spokesman has just said that his party is unable to state its position.
The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) made his point
based on the facts, and his position is that the rate would rise to
&#163;425,000, but his Front Bench cannot make that point. What are
the
facts?</div><a name="06061357000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000548"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman misunderstands me;
I am stating the facts. Those are the facts, and I note that he does
not argue that those are not the facts. I am making the point that if
the Government were genuinely concerned to ensure that only the same
proportion of the population as previously affected by inheritance tax
were still affected by it, the threshold would have to be
&#163;425,000. It is clear that they are not concerned with doing
that.</div><a name="06061357000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000549"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> Will my hon. Friend give way to save me giving me
a speech later? Does my hon. Friend accept that the point that the
Paymaster General is missing is the concept of fiscal drag? That is not
a form of economic cross-dressing. I can see the Economic Secretary
getting excited there. Fiscal drag is pulling much of middle Britain
into the inheritance tax system, and that is what we should be arguing
about.</div><a name="06061357000210"></a>

It is fiscal drag that I am discussing. This is not accidental. The
Government are deliberately taking more people into the ambit of
inheritance tax than was previously the case. That is the point and it
will be objected to by many of my constituents and those of other
Committee members.</div> <a name="06061357000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is clear that people are being penalised, as the hon. Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West quite properly says, on a windfall on the
property that they have gained. The Government do not choose to tax
that windfall only by inheritance tax, they also do so by stamp duty,
which has also increased dramatically. The Government should be honest
about what they are trying to do, which is to tax property more heavily
than they have
previously.</div><a name="06061357000212"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061357000551"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): I echo a lot of
what has been said. Property prices have had a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column565" />Column number: 566</div>dramatic effect on the issue of inheritance tax. While the Liberal
Democrats have not decided on the rates or anything else, I believe
that death is an appropriate time to take some tax. Without doubt,
property prices have resulted in a windfall for many people to which
they have not contributed, so this is an appropriate
tax.</div><a name="06061357000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000552"></a>Mr.

who buys a house is making an investment and therefore should be

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000553"></a>Mr.

have bought in more recent times have paid expensively for what they
have acquired. Whether they will see the investment returns in the next
10 years or so that may have been made in other years is a debatable
point.</div> <a name="06061357000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">The principle
is that an inheritance tax should be at an appropriate level. That is
where we come to the point about fairness. Most people are beginning to
think that the tax is hitting those who are in the &#163;300,000 to
&#163;500,000 bracket, whereas those who have significant wealth have
found means of avoiding substantial amounts of inheritance
tax.</div> <a name="06061357000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know that
only 6 per cent. of estates pay inheritance tax&#151;I do not know
whether it should be6 per cent. or 5 or 10 per
cent.&#151;but what we should be considering is the fairness of this.
While 370,000 estates fall into this category, I would be interested to
learn, if the figure is available, the average estate value. I suspect
that it is significantly lower than many of us want to see. That is
part of the problem.</div>
<a name="06061357000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The inheritance tax system, as
it is currently drawn, is not tackling the high levels of wealth that
is inherited from one to the other. There have been too many means by
which such people can avoid this tax. The incomes of those who are now
being caught progressively more on fiscal drag, and so on, is being
generated from estates of much lower average values. That is where some
of the perceived unfairness derives from.</div>
<a name="06061357000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">While the level remains at 40
per cent., that is a significant proportion of an estate worth between
&#163;300,000 to &#163;500,000. It is in that area that there needs
to be some new thinking. I hope that in the months and years to come in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000555"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> As I say, we are not making announcements here.
These matters are still the subject of considerable debate in which I
am participating. At present, there is an inherent unfairness in the
sense that more lower value estates&#151;although obviously above the
threshold&#151;are being hit at 40 per cent. and higher value estates
are able to avoid that 40 per cent. charge 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column566" />Column number: 567</div>on far too many occasions. How we tackle that problem is a matter that
needs to be
addressed.</div><a name="06061357000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should be
interested to know the average size of those 37,000 estates. I suspect
that it is low in respect of the thresholds. That means that they form
a significant proportion of the &#163;3.6 billion of tax that is
raised rather than that tax being generated at much higher
levels.</div><a name="06061357000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000556"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I do not have to declare an interest because I do
not own property that is worth more than &#163;285,000, let alone
&#163;312,000. I must be in the lower income bracket rather than
middle. I have lived in the same house in Wolverhampton for the past 22
years.</div><a name="06061357000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I applaud the
Government. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright)
has a point. More people will be paying inheritance tax&#151;although
not the vastly inflated figures that have been bandied around by
some&#151;because of increasing prosperity. House prices are
increasing because of lower interest rates, economic stability and
increased prosperity and employment. That is a jolly good thing and it
will lead to more people paying inheritance tax. I support
that.</div><a name="06061357000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
earlier, inheritance tax is one of the least insidious of the taxes,
especially given house prices. Most people out of that 37,000 will be
paying because of a windfall gain on a property that they bought many
years ago. If they had bought it recently it would still have a
mortgage on it and, if they die unexpectedly young, that will be netted
off the value of the property and their estate will not be above the
threshold. I cannot think of a less insidious tax than on a windfall
gain that no one has done anything in particular to deserve&#151;it
is just the way in which the house prices have gone&#151;and which is
paid on death. The Government need taxation revenues and, if we can
have an uninsidious tax, that is a jolly good
thing.</div><a name="06061357000225"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061357000557"></a><b class="B">Sir
George Young</b> (North-West Hampshire) (Con): The logic of
what the hon. Gentleman said is that people should pay capital gains
tax when they move from one house to
another.</div><a name="06061357000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000558"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> It has been a long-standing tradition that all the
three main parties have encouraged home ownership throughout the
country and no capital gains tax has been paid. Buying properties and
doing them up with a view to a profit is susceptible to capital gains
tax under the capital gains tax Act 1970, I think, but as far as I know
that provision has never been enforced. Most hon. Members would have
come across people who buy a succession of houses and do them up with a
view to profit, not just to live in them, as the hon. Member for
South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) said earlier. Under the tax regime that
has been in place for more than 30 years, those people are liable to
capital gains
tax.</div><a name="06061357000227"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061357000559"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): I caution
the Government on their attitude that a lot of people do not live in
London and the south-east as a result of which inheritance tax does not
matter in many parts of the country, so it is a non-issue. The fact is
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column567" />Column number: 568</div>inheritance tax is widespread in a large part of the country. In my
constituency, average house prices in Berkhamsted, Tring and
Rickmansworth are above the threshold. The hon. Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West, in his characteristic candid way, set out a
respectable argument that it is a windfall tax and so on. I do not
necessarily agree, but such an argument can be made. However, to deny
that there is an issue given that relatively modest houses are over the
inheritance tax threshold in many parts of the country is to deny the
true
position.</div><a name="06061357000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000560"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I should be interested to know whether most
properties in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency have a current
market value that is above or below the inheritance tax
threshold.</div><a name="06061357000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000561"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I accept that my constituency is not necessarily
typical of the whole country, but the Halifax report had three of its
towns in the top 10 on house prices. However, many constituencies have
such properties.</div>
<a name="06061357000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000562"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> Just to redefine the question, would the hon.
Gentleman say that the majority of houses in his constituency were
currently valued above or below the inheritance tax
threshold?</div><a name="06061357000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000563"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I would have to check the figures. I suspect that a
majority are now or will be in that position in the next four or five
years. I do not know whether the Economic Secretary has the figures. I
have no doubt that they will be produced. I understand that the
majority could well be in that situation&#151;but a substantial
number are.</div><a name="06061357000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is all
very well to dismiss that and say that it is not really an issue and
does not matter. I am sure that it is not an issue in
Normanton&#151;I have no doubt about that&#151;but the Economic
Secretary will not always represent that seat. Were he ever to
represent a seat in south-east England, he might find that his
constituents raised that matter on many
occasions.</div><a name="06061357000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000564"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I should like briefly to respond to one point
made by the Paymaster General. She may feel that the number of estates
affected by inheritance tax is not significant, but the tax is causing
real anxiety in middle England and is impacting increasingly widely, as
the statistics I mentioned
show.</div><a name="06061357000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000565"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I agree that it is causing real anxiety,
because some people are perpetuating the myth that every person who has
a house over the threshold now&#151;even though the event of their
death might not occur for 30, 40 or 50 years&#151;is liable for
inheritance tax. That is not
true.</div><a name="06061357000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000566"></a>Mrs.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000567"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> We now turn to the point made by the hon.
Member for South-East Cornwall aboutwho pays inheritance tax.
Clause 157 introducesschedule 20, and together the clause and
schedule make important changes to how certain types of trusts are
treated for tax purposes. In particular, they bring the tax regime for
accumulation and maintenance and interest-in-possession trusts into
line with the mainstream tax regime that is already in place for
discretionary
trusts.</div><a name="06061357000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since the
Government announced these changes, there has been an enormous amount
of discussion, and some considerable misunderstanding, about what the
new rules do. The speculation about the magnitude of the changes and
the number of people affected by the proposed measures has been blown
out of all proportion. I freely admit that I have been taken by
surprise by the force with which the exaggerated figures have been
advanced, given the comments that I have made at every stage, on Second
Reading and in Committee of the whole
House.</div><a name="06061357000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bearing in mind
the apparent confusion, I thought that it would help, at the beginning
of a detailed series of debates, if I set out briefly precisely what
the measures are designed to achieve&#151;and why. A moment ago, we
touched on the fact that inheritance tax is a tax on the transfer of
wealth that is generally levied when someone dies and bequeaths
substantial assets to others, over the threshold of &#163;285,000. If
there are assets of &#163;286,000, the tax is not levied on the
&#163;286,000. That is, perhaps, another common
misunderstanding.</div><a name="06061357000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
majority of people who have assets leave them to others outright when
they die, but some choose to set up trusts as a way of passing on their
wealth. Because trusts do not die, there is no natural occasion on
which inheritance tax might be paid, so it disappears into a labyrinth.
It is to that labyrinth that schedule 20 addresses
itself.</div>
<a name="06061357000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000568"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> The Paymaster General says that there is no
death on which IHT can bite, but there clearly is in an interest in
possession trust. Why is the Paymaster General seeking to align the
rules on interest in possession trusts with those on discretionary
trusts when the problem that triggered the regime on discretionary
trusts&#151;the lack of a death to which to attach the IHT
charge&#151;does not exist in relation to IIP
trusts?</div>
<a name="06061357000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000569"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I am coming to that. As we move through the
debate, it is important to keep in view the facts, as opposed to
speculation and the smokescreens that have been put up to suggest that
we are considering something that we are not. On discretionary trusts,
the tax regime already recognises the reality that a trust does not die
or come to an end, so there is no natural occasion on which inheritance
tax will be paid. To make up for the missing potential 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column569" />Column number: 570</div>inheritance tax, special IHT charges apply when money is put into a
trust, periodically while the assets remain in the trust and again when
they leave.</div> <a name="06061357000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
make it clear that I am talking about assets in excess of the current
threshold of
&#163;285,000.</div><a name="06061357000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000570"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Will the right hon. Lady give
way?</div><a name="06061357000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000571"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Let me finish the point.</div>
<a name="06061357000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The two types of trust that
have, until now, been exempt from the charges are accumulation and
maintenance trusts and interest in possession trusts. There is no clear
rationale for privileging those trusts in that way, and it has become
clear that some wealthy individuals have taken advantage of that
special treatment as a convenient way of sheltering their wealth from
inheritance tax. That is clearly unfair, as the hon. Member for
South-East Cornwall suggested, and contributes to the widely held
notion, which has already been expressed in this Committee, that IHT is
optional, at least for the very rich.</div>

Goldsworthy:</b> If somebody wishes to put his estate into a
trust, does he not have to tailor that trust so that it complies with
existing inheritance tax and trust legislation even if his assets are
below the IHT threshold? Will not such a person, whether he is a long
way or only just below the threshold, have to comply with the new
legislation?</div><a name="06061357000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000573"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> No, the hon. Lady misunderstands. There is a
nil band that covers everything up to and including the threshold.
Inheritance tax becomes operational once all the assets are in excess
of the threshold and are not protected by any exemption.</div>
<a name="06061357000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are in danger of entering
into debate on the schedule, and I am trying first to lay out the
Government&#146;s intentions, and to explain why there is no apparent
rationale in relation to the two types of trust that I mentioned. The
measure that was announced goes to the heart of the difference between
money put into trusts and outright gifts. Under the old rules,
accumulation and maintenance trusts and IIP trusts received the same
tax treatment and the transfer was potentially exempt from IHT. If the
person making it survived for seven years, no IHT liability
arose.</div> <a name="06061357000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is somewhat
simplistic to think that the two activities are identical just because
they received the same inheritance tax treatment in the past. The
recipient of a gift can do whatever they want with it. There is
certainly no need to ask permission from the person who gave it to
them. Things are quite different for the beneficiary of a trust. The
beneficiary will only get what the trustees decide to give them. That
might be the income generated by the trust assets or the right to live
in a house owned by the trust, but the beneficiary will often have no
say whatever about what happens to the capital in the trust. If
trustees decide to give trust assets to someone else, there might be
nothing at all the beneficiary can do about it. In short, someone
making a gift relinquishes control of whatever they are giving. Someone
setting up a trust does the opposite.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column570" />Column number: 571</div><a name="06061357000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">By leaving instructions for the
trustees, the control of those who set up trusts can linger long after
they have died. As I have said, it is control that makes the crucial
difference. There is no reason why money in trusts should continue to
be treated as akin to an outright gift when it is clearly not. Since
there is already a tax regime designed to properly capture IHT on trust
assets, it seems entirely logical for A and M trusts and IIP trusts to
come under these rules.</div>
<a name="06061357000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I mentioned, there has been
a great deal of confusion, one aspect of which was the idea that
millions of people will be affected by the new rules. I repeat that
that is simply not the case. We have no specific provision for existing
trusts, and in future only new trusts with substantial assets in excess
of the IHT threshold of &#163;285,000 can attract a charge.
Commentators have also said that the charge is retrospective. That is
incorrect: there is no retrospective tax charge. Some old arrangements
might have different tax consequences in the future, but there is
nothing new in that. That is how the tax system works.
</div><a name="06061357000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to touch
on some areas that the Committee may consider important. The first of
these is trusts for children. The Bill makes special provision for
trusts set up by a parent who wants to provide, in the event of their
death, for any of their children who are minors. The Government have
said from the outset that such trusts should receive special tax
treatment, but not where they are intended to continue to provide
benefit after the child reaches adulthood: the age of 18. At that age,
special tax treatment stops and the trust begins paying income and
capital gains tax. It is the age at which children will be entitled to
the money in their child trust fund.</div>
<a name="06061357000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear that some
commentators would like the special rules to run on. Some would like
them to run on indefinitely, and others until the age of 25, which is
the age currently embedded in the legislation. Others have suggested
that the Government are somehow forcing young people to inherit money
that they will simply fritter away. I, for one, have more faith in our
young people. We have provided for trustees to be able to give children
trust assets when they reach adulthood at the age of 18 and pay no
inheritance tax, or to choose to keep the money in trust until the age
of 25 while paying a small amount of tax. We shall debate that aspect
later.</div><a name="06061357000434"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="06061357000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other area
of great concern, about which there has been considerable confusion, is
that of spouse relief, particularly trusts set up on the death of a
spouse or civil partner. It has been suggested that the measure was
conceived as an attack on the long-standing spouse relief exemptions
built into IHT rules. I said it in the Committee of the whole House and
on Second Reading, and I say it again now: that is not the case. We
have been absolutely clear from the outset&#151;and I have made it
absolutely clear to Parliament at every opportunity&#151;that the
measure has nothing to do with spouse relief. There is no question of
spouse relief being jeopardised in straightforward cases. That has
always been the Government&#146;s position, and I have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column571" />Column number: 572</div>covered that before. We will discuss the matter later, when I can expand
on those points.</div>
<a name="06061357000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also the question of
life insurance policies. Again, it has been repeatedly made clear that
life insurance policies written into trust before Budget day will
benefit from pre-Budget rules, just as with any other pre-Budget trust.
Despite some truly spectacular comment, and speculation that millions
of policyholders would be affected, following discussions and improved
guidance notes the industry accepts that that would not be the case. Of
course, people read those reports and were unnecessarily worried, and
naturally they are seeking further reassurance, even though it is not
necessary. We will debate the matter later, but I make it absolutely
clear, again, that the position of life insurance policies is as the
Government originally stated. At one stage, it was claimed that some
4.5 million people would be affected by the measure, but that is
absolutely not the
case.</div><a name="06061357000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response to
the point made by the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall, the
Government recognise that trusts have an important role to play in
helping people to manage their affairs, and the exemptions are there to
do that. We believe that there should be no artificial incentive for
setting up trusts because they provide an opportunity for an unfair
inheritance tax advantage. For that reason, over the past few years the
Government have made a number of changes, and are closing loopholes in
the inheritance tax regime in this Finance Bill. There has been
considerable discussion at each point. The tax regime for trusts is
being brought into line so that, as the hon. Gentleman said, there will
be more fairness in how and when the rules bite.</div>
<a name="06061357000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new inheritance tax rules
for accumulation and maintenance trusts, as well as interest in
possession trusts, are a logical step in that process, and are part of
that fairness argument. They will make inheritance tax fairer, in terms
of who pays it and under what circumstances. People will feel that it
is fairer because they will no longer see others taking advantage of
trusts to pay it. That is a huge driving force in people&#146;s
perception of the tax system, and it influences their behaviour if they
feel that that is a way
through.</div><a name="06061357000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I commend the
clause to the Committee, and I look forward to our detailed debates
this afternoon as we move through amendments to the
schedule.</div><a name="06061357000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000574"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I do not want to anticipate the lengthy debates
that we will have in the next few hours, but I feel obliged to pick up
on some of the points made by the Paymaster General. For example, she
repeatedly suggested that the types of trust targeted by schedule 20
are, at the moment, somehow privileged. They are not privileged; they
are, broadly, treated in the same way as outright gifts. That has been
a principle of taxation for many years, and the Government repeated
that in their consultation process on the modernisation of trusts. The
Government now seek to depart from that principle by treating such
trusts in a more penal, punitive way than outright gifts.</div>
<a name="06061357000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a fact that the
discretionary trust regime was devised to meet a particular concern
about a particular type of trust in which there was no death on which
the inheritance tax charge could bite; that, as I pointed out in my
intervention, is not the case with an interest in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column572" />Column number: 573</div>possession trust, where the full property is taxed at40 per
cent. when the life tenant
dies.</div><a name="06061357000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000575"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> The hon. Lady talks about death. Is there not a
charge when a discretionary trust is eventually wound up, after 80
years or whatever it is&#151;she will know the figure, given her
background&#151;because of the law against
perpetuities?</div>
<a name="06061357000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000576"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> The discretionary trusts will be wound up
eventually. They are subject to the periodic charge regime, so at that
point we are talking about 6 per cent. every 10 years. Whatever the
proportion since the last 10-year anniversary will be paid when the
discretionary trust is wound up.</div>
<a name="06061357000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">We shall explore the fact that
the measures are retrospective simply because it is not always possible
to vary a will or a trust. It is also not possible for a settlor to
wind back the clock and take the decision on whether to set up a trust
again. The Paymaster General denies that the provisions in schedule 20,
as drafted, force parents to give large amounts of wealth to teenagers,
but it severely penalises those parents who want to postpone the
vesting of a gift until 25 has been reached.</div>
<a name="06061357000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Paymaster General says that
schedule 20 has no impact on spouse relief. I am therefore interested
to hear why she has tabled significant amendments to the provisions on
IIP trusts, which would have a significant impact on spouse relief. I
welcome the amendments that she has tabled on that matter, but if
schedule 20 had no effect on spouse relief, why is there any need for
her to have tabled about 30 amendments to her own
proposals?</div><a name="06061357000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
worried that while the Paymaster General referred to current life
insurance policies not being covered by the schedule, she made no
mention and gave no reassurance in respect of life insurance to be
written in trust in the future. If all these are scare stories, why has
she tabled so many amendments&#151;many of which are
welcome&#151;to her own
schedule?</div><a name="06061357000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come now
to a few general remarks of my own. I repeat that this is a tax and a
schedule that impacts on middle-income people and middle England. It
penalises responsible behaviour and thrift<i class="I">. [Interruption.]</i> If
Labour Members believe that inheritance tax does not impact on
middle-income people, they are clearly living in a different country
from me.</div>
<a name="06061357000270"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061357000577"></a><b class="B">Helen
Goodman</b> (Bishop Auckland) (Lab): I do not know whether the
hon. Lady is aware that the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr.
Letwin) has made a number of interesting comments in his attempt to
help the leader of her party reposition. In particular, he has said
that inequality is a problem. Does she agree with that? Her remarks on
inheritance tax do not suggest that she
does.</div>
<a name="06061357000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000578"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> That is nothing to do with the issue that we are
currently discussing, which is a tax that penalises thrift and
responsible behaviour. It penalises not only the rich, but ordinary
middle-income families of modest means who are just trying to get
by.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column573" />Column number: 574</div><a name="06061357000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Trusts have been incorporated
into a vast array of different transactions and settlements. They give
rise to few, if any, tax advantages and most are set up for reasons
that have nothing to do with tax. The Opposition would be happy to
support targeted measures to clamp down on attempts to use trusts as
part of aggressive and artificial tax avoidance schemes. However, the
vast majority of those creating trusts of the type affected by schedule
20 tend to have social, family and human reasons for their
actions.</div><a name="06061357000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Trusts tend
to encourage long-term planning and the responsible management of
property, and have played a significant role in conserving our cultural
and environmental heritage. They can be used to guard against
profligacy and imprudent behaviour, assist vulnerable people struggling
with addiction, ill health, disability or mental
illness<i class="I">&#151;[Interruption.]</i> If the hon. Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West does not believe me on that point, he should
talk to Mind about its concerns about schedule 20.</div>
<a name="06061357000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Trusts can also be used to
ensure that the proceeds of life insurance are paid out promptly to
help a bereaved family cope with the financial consequences of
premature and tragic death. Above all, they allow families to provide
for their future in a considered, flexible and responsible way. They
enable the different and often competing interests of family members to
be balanced fairly. For example, a trust can be an invaluable aid in
achieving the difficult task of mediating between the interests of
step-parents and stepchildren.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000580"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I would say that the majority who have made a
will would have a family trust in it. There is little doubt about that.
Anyone who has drawn up a will, who has children and has had
professional advice is likely to have a trust in that will.</div>
<a name="06061357000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government do not seem to
have understood that trusts are included in wills to deal with
contingencies and events that might never happen. There are far more
trusts in wills than end up being created because people are encouraged
to plan responsibly for unforeseen events, such as the death of a child
before the parent. It is likely therefore that more or less anyone with
children who has drawn up a will on professional advice in the last 10
years or so will have included a trust in that
will.</div><a name="06061357000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000581"></a>Rob

General from the one that I have, and she has read a different Finance

abolition of
trusts.</div><a name="06061357000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are talking

proportion of people die intestate, either in her constituency or the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000582"></a>Mrs.

make wills. It is hugely important that as many people as possible make
wills.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000583"></a>Stephen
Hesford:</b> The hon. Lady mentioned that those who make a
will will almost certainly make it on the back of financial advice. Is
that advice not usually tax-avoidance
advice?</div><a name="06061357000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000584"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> No, it is not. Tax can come into that, but the
reason that trusts, as I have said, are generally included in wills is
to provide for the different interests of family members. For example,
trusts can be hugely useful in making the assets of a divorcing couple
stretch over two households&#151;another important area in which they
are used frequently. They can help to look after elderly relatives when
old age affects their mental capacity or provide for bereaved children.
They can comply with sharia principles while at the same time provide
properly for a spouse, or simply provide flexible answers for people
who are not confident that they can foretell all family circumstances
that will apply in a few years&#146;
time.</div><a name="06061357000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Trusts are an
important tool for thousands in this country enabling them to manage
the complications of family life and well-being in modern Britain.
Imposing punitive new taxes on trusts ignores the realities of modern
family life. Trusts provide an invaluable aid for those juggling what
are sometime conflicting interests of different family
members.</div><a name="06061357000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Resistance to
the new charges, which the Paymaster General dismissed as scare
stories, was instant and wide-ranging. Strong protests have been
registered by the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners, the
Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Chartered Institute of
Taxation, the Law Society of England and Wales, the Law Society of
Scotland, the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, Mind, the
Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society, the Association of Chartered
Certified Accountants, the Association of British Insurers, the
Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers, and
most recently, I gather, the National Autistic Society. They have been
joined by hundreds of lawyers, accountants, companies and ordinary
individuals affected by the proposed
changes.</div><a name="06061357000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that all those people are taken in by scare stories; they are
genuinely worried about the impact of schedule 20. The Treasury
Committee also asked the Government to look again at their estimate of
how many people would be affected. The national media has waded into
the debate in the tabloid and broadsheet press and on broadcast
personal finance programmes.</div>
<a name="06061357000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Deep concern has been expressed
about the Government&#146;s complete failure to consult on the
proposals, the retrospective impact of schedule 20,the genuine
threat to the spouse exemption posed by schedule 20, the penal
treatment of trusts that vest at 25 years of age, the threat of IHT
being applied in divorce cases, the impact on the disabled and the
vulnerable, the impact on millions of life insurance policies and the
huge cost of reviewing and redrafting the millions of potentially
affected wills.</div>

to make it clear that she had not even started on the invective. Yet
she responded directly&#151;I welcome that response&#151;to a
number of the serious concerns that I expressed, particularly about
conditions 3 and 4 in new section 49A of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984
on immediate post-death
interests.</div><a name="06061357000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000585"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> We have not reached the amendments yet and I
will deal with those questions when we
do.</div><a name="06061357000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the hon. Lady
agree that what I said on the Floor of the House and what is in the
Bill, with the amendments, is entirely consistent?
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i>No, we did not change our mind. I do not
want to drift into that, but if the hon. Member for
Rayleigh(Mr. Francois) intervenes and asks me exactly what
happened when we reach the amendments, I will tell
him.</div><a name="06061357000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady

wills and to do this and that, but she cannot even tell us what middle
income is, so how does she know the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000586"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> As I have said, it is patently clear that
millions of wills will have to be rewritten. Evidence for that has been
provided by the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners. I
acknowledge that the Government&#146;s amendments will significantly
mitigate the problem. I repeat that if there was nothing wrong with
schedule 20, why has the Paymaster General found it necessary to table
so many amendments to it, particularly on the spouse exemption that we
raised and discussed? I believe that middle England has spoken out and
I welcome the Paymaster General&#146;s 11th-hour reprieve for many of
the trusts that would have been subject to the new charges had schedule
20 remained unamended. However, as we will see from the discussions
that follow, despite the real and very welcome changes in some of the
amendments in the long list of Treasury amendments to its own Bill,
real and serious problems remain in schedule 20, which is why I shall
ask my colleagues to vote against the clause to demonstrate our
continuing concern about the schedule that it puts into
effect.</div><a name="06061357000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000587"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I shall keep my introductory remarks to one
of the most controversial and amended parts of the Bill brief. I note
that the explanatory notes to the clause
state:</div><a name="06061357000423"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;So far
as new trusts are concerned...it continues the current special
treatment for &#145;interest-in-possession&#146; trusts created on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column576" />Column number: 577</div>intestacy and straightforward interest in possession trusts created by
will; and for &#145;accumulation and maintenance trusts&#146; to
trusts created on the death of a parent where beneficiaries will take
the trust assets at age
18.&#148;</div><a name="06061357000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">They also
state:</div><a name="06061357000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Trusts
for &#145;disabled persons&#146; will also continue to enjoy
special
treatment&#148;.</div><a name="06061357000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
echo the comments of the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet. If the matter
is so simple and straightforward, why has it been necessary for the
Government to introduce so many amendments to their own legislation? On
the face of it, if the Bill had provided for that it would not be
necessary to amend
it.</div><a name="06061357000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have been
representations from the industry and amendments have been tabled by
the Government and the Opposition. It is clear that a huge amount of
concern and confusion has been generated by this part of the Bill. Even
with the Government&#146;s amendments, the changes in the clause and
schedule represent fundamental changes to trust inheritance tax,
perhaps the greatest for 25 years. Even if those concerns are
misunderstood, they undeniably exist throughout the industry and may be
due in part to the fact that there was no consultation prior to the
proposals being put forward. That contrasts with the action taken by
the Government in 2003 when they announced measures and that there
would be consultation on proposals to tackle tax avoidance using trusts
with measures relating to income tax and capital gains tax.</div>
<a name="06061357000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rationale behind the
changes is still not clear and it is not clear why they were introduced
so suddenly if they would have such a small impact on tax revenues.
What mischief are the Government trying to tackle and how much do they
expect future revenue to change as a result?</div>
<a name="06061357000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have listened carefully to
the Paymaster General&#146;s comments and there is clearly a genuine
feeling that there is mischief that must be overcome, but if there is
an anomaly, surely it is in relation to potentially exempt transfers,
whereby people who are cash rich can make lifetime cash transfers that
are not liable for inheritance tax. However, those individuals whom the
Liberal Democrats refer to as middle-income households, have assets
that may be tied up in property, so they do not have the option to make
those cash gifts.</div>
<a name="06061357000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000588"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Is the hon. Lady suggesting that the Liberal
Democrat policy is to abolish potentially exempt
transfers?</div>
<a name="06061357000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000589"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I am simply saying that if the Government are
trying to address an anomaly, they should look into that area, not
simply into the taxation request.</div>
<a name="06061357000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should be interested to know
why the Paymaster General thinks that so many amendments are necessary.
They will all be dealt with in turn, but I cautiously welcome many of
the Government amendments that help to provide greater clarity, such as
those relating to spouse exemption. They have allayed the many fears
that have been flying around during the past few months. However, other
amendments, which relate to life insurance policies,

<div class="Column"><a name="Column577" />Column number: 578</div>were deemed incomprehensible by representatives who were trying to help
me to get to grips with this aspect of the Bill.</div>
<a name="06061357000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are further
inconsistencies in those amendments. Although the Government have gone
to great lengths to provide transitional protection in the area under
discussion, in others they have absolutely neglected to do so. Any
greater clarification of the clauses is welcome, but the intervening
period since the original announcements has created a great deal of
worry for many.</div> <a name="06061357000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
of the amendments will help to smooth some of the Bill&#146;s rough
edges, but the concern is that there will be plenty left. If the
Government have been tabling amendments in the past few days, what
other areas are going to come to light as those detailed and complex
proposals are put into practice in the months to come? The concern is
that year after year, there will be endless tweaking to try to get the
legislation to do what it was intended to do. I am concerned that we
will not deal with all those rough edges
today.</div>
<a name="06061357000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000590"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet was right
about some things. There are many reasons why people have a trust,
write a trust or whatever, and they are not all financial, nor are they
for tax avoidance purposes. However, I note with interest that, two or
three weeks ago, the Channel 4 money website said:</div>
<a name="06061357000425"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Two in every three
trusts deeds written are used to reduce liabilities to Inheritance
Tax.&#148;</div><a name="06061357000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that I
practised law rather longer than the hon. Lady did, and what the
Channel 4 money website said is consistent with my albeit limited
experience.</div>
<a name="06061357000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000591"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I choose to respond to that point in the same
way that I responded to a similar point that the Paymaster General made
in Committee of the Whole House. I quoted a lengthy list of
organisations that highlight the fact that the majority of trusts hit
by the provision are set up for family reasons, not tax reasons. I
would believe people from the Institute of Chartered Accountants or the
Low Incomes Tax Reform Group over the Channel 4
website.</div>
<a name="06061357000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000592"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady, because she leads
me nicely to my second point. I hope that the Paymaster General, or any
other hon. Member, feels free to intervene on me if I am getting it
wrong, but my understanding and recollection is that in this country,
there are four types of trust: interest in possession, life interest,
discretionary and accumulation and maintenance. As far I am aware, and
please could the Paymaster General correct me if I am wrong, none of
them is being abolished under the Bill or the amendments. Yet, the
tenor of the comments from the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet is that
somehow in a Finance Bill, the Government are abolishing or seeking to
abolish one or more of those four trust categories. That is not the
case.</div>
<a name="06061357000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000593"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> As a lawyer, the hon. Gentleman knows that the
imposition of penal taxes on a particular type of legal arrangement has
an impact on whether people feel able to use it to deal with their
family
problems.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column578" />Column number: 579</div><a name="06061357000436"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000594"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> Of course it will have an impact. However, as I
said, the tenor of the hon. Lady&#146;s remarks, as we heard them on
this side of the Committee, was that one or more of the four categories
of trust would be abolished. That is not the case. Affected, yes;
impact&#151;to use her word&#151;yes; abolished, no. It is not the
case; it is not being abolished. Is any of the four being
abolished?</div>
<a name="06061357000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000595"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> A and Ms will virtually
go.</div>
<a name="06061357000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000596"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> The hon. Lady says that accumulation and
maintenance trusts will virtually go. That is not abolition; her use of
the adverb &#147;virtually&#148; characterises, if I may put words
in her mouth, what she would describe as a very severe impact. What she
says about middle income seems to be very ill defined, as is the term
&#147;middle England&#148;. I have the honour to represent a
constituency in England in which approximately 80,000 people live, and
about two thirds of them are middle class. If all 37,000 of the people
who died this tax year and paid inheritance tax lived in my
constituency, they would still make up fewer than half its residents.
That is just one constituency. If we are going to talk about middle
income and middle England, we must bear in mind&#151;before somebody
intervenes on me, I know that there are more trusts than
that&#151;that only 37,000 estates pay inheritance tax. Again, before
the hon. Lady intervenes on me, I am aware that trusts are used by far
more people than those
37,000.</div><a name="06061357000314"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000597"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> The Paymaster General cited as one of the
justifications for her figures for the number of estates affected by
inheritance tax the fact that inheritance tax did not bite when there
was a transfer between spouses. In reality, schedule 20 would have a
severe impact on such transfers, and would make significant inroads
into the number of estates covered by inheritance tax. Because of the
Paymaster General&#146;s about-turn, that threat has been averted,
but the schedule could still have a significant impact on the number of
estates hit by
IHT.</div><a name="06061357000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000598"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> The hon. Lady used to lecture in law, but she did
so a considerable time after I learned my law in the 1980s. At that
time, we had what was called capital transfer tax. Transfer in that
context meant a gift between person A and person B. The hon. Lady just
used the phrase &#147;transfer between spouses&#148;. To my
generation of lawyers, if not to hers, that means a gift&#151;not a
gift into a trust as a mechanism but a gift.</div>
<a name="06061357000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon. Friend the
Paymaster General, indeed, used the word &#147;transfer&#148;.
Although she is perhaps wearing rather better than I am, she is of my
generation; she was talking about a gift between spouses, not via a
trust. So far as I am aware, outright gifts between spouses upon death
will not be affected at all. If the hon. Lady thinks that they will,
she can tell me. Outright gifts will not be affected, although they
might be but when refracted through a trust. That is different. In that
sense, as I understand the legal position, my right hon. Friend was
absolutely right to make it clear that transfers between spouses would
not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column579" />Column number: 580</div>be caught by inheritance tax either under the old regime or under
whatever regime comes out of the proposals in this Bill.</div>
<a name="06061357000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also say to the hon. Lady
that, although I appreciate that it might be different in her part of
north London&#151;I am prepared to concede that&#151;the majority
of people who die each year in the United Kingdom die intestate. They
go nowhere near a trust under a will, because they do not have a will.
If they were smart, they would join a trade union and they would get a
free will from that trade union.</div>

Gentleman will recall from his days as a lawyer that statutory trusts
arise automatically on intestacy. Section 32 of the Trustee Act 2000
applies to such trusts, and schedule 20 would therefore apply the new
charges to trusts arising as a result of intestacy. Therefore, those
who die intestate could still be affected by the changes. Section 32
has that impact because it imports sufficient flexibility into a trust
arising under intestacy to make it breach condition 4. Condition 4 is
going as a result of the Paymaster General&#146;s amendment, and
mine, so it is no longer a problem, but as

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061357000637"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I shall come to the breakdown of the amendments
that I have tabled in due course. In the spirit of compromise I have
tabled a number of alternative formulations, which makes the
Chairman&#146;s task of reading them out rather
complex.</div><a name="06061357000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would alter the schedule&#146;s treatment of accumulation
and maintenance trusts and those trusts that vest in children at 25.
Such trusts have traditionally enabled parents and grandparents to make
long-term financial provision for children. They were devised in the
1970s by a Labour Government, not to help the super-rich shelter their
wealth from inheritance tax, but to help parents and grandparents
provide prudently and responsibly for children. Until the child is 25,
trustees, usually the settlors and a solicitor, can retain control over
the income and capital. After the age of 25, the beneficiary gets the
right to receive the income. In some cases, the trust will also provide
that the capital passes to the beneficiary at age 25, but more often
the trustees will retain some control over that capital for a
period.</div><a name="06061357000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 20,
as drafted, seeks to penalise such trusts by bringing them within the
framework of rules for discretionary trusts, unless they fall within
the narrow category of &#147;trusts for bereaved minors&#148;.
Under the schedule, the beneficiaries under such settlements must be
given the property, income and capital outright at 18, if not, a 20 per
cent. charge will be made on property transferred into the trust, with
a 6 per cent. charge every 10 years thereafter, along with an exit
charge on capital advanced out of the
trust.</div><a name="06061357000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">We come now to
the highly controversial aspect of schedule 20. The new regime for
accumulation and maintenance trusts and bereaved minor trusts thus
imposes a tax penalty on those who wish to provide financial support
for their children, but wish to restrict the control and access to the
money until their children reach 25. The schedule actively encourages
the transfer of significant wealth to 18-year-olds. Indeed, where such
trusts are already in operation, it more or less forces the trustees to
do that. At least for new trusts, the settlor can take a decision about
whether to make the gift at all. In the case of existing trusts, the
&#147;no transfer&#148; option is no longer available. Either the
trustees opt to vest all the property in the 18-year-old or the trust
is hit by the unexpected and punitive tax bill. That seems to be
contrary to common sense and certainly contrary to the principles of
prudence to which the Chancellor used to subscribe.</div>
