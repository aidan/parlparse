                        <p class="tabbed">I will
briefly explain the rationale behind the amendments. Norwich and Exeter
city councils clearly want unitary status; that is a matter of record.
Not only the authorities but the people who live in Norwich and Exeter
have demonstrated in opinion poll after opinion poll that they would
prefer the authorities to take charge of their own destiny. Unitary
councils in Norwich and Exeter would save taxpayers’ money,
which is important in the current climate, and they would help to
deliver economic growth in the region. It is well known that cities are
the drivers for economic growth in their regions, and giving both
Exeter and Norwich unitary status would help them to promote the
economic regeneration agenda. Importantly, doing so would create jobs
for local people, not only for those who live in Norwich and Exeter but
for those in the surrounding areas.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000016">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 4<a class="bkMark" name="Column4">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Secretary
of State is on record as saying that he wants to put town halls back in
charge of local affairs, so why not in Norwich and Exeter? We
acknowledge that each application must be considered on its merits, and
on a case-by-case basis, but a two-tier structure makes local
leadership more difficult and accountability considerably more opaque
for local communities. The Conservative party used to support unitary
councils, and it created a considerable number of them when it was in
government before. My local authority benefited from that policy at the
time. Similarly, before the general election, the Liberal Democrats
said that they favoured a unitary or single-tier structure for local
government. I hope that that commitment will not go the same way as
their commitments on VAT and tuition fees. The Labour party can
justifiably claim to be the true champion of localism, which is why we
supported Norwich and Exeter becoming unitary councils when we were in
government. Surely allowing local areas to control their own destiny is
the basis of localism.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 3
would leave the door open for the Secretary of State to reconsider
applications from Norwich and Exeter by requiring him to report within
three years on whether he will entertain any further proposals for
unitary status, and if so, on what basis. The Government need to be
straight with the people of Norwich and Exeter about the future of
their cities. Are the Government rejecting applications for unitary
status for the time being, or will they never allow Norwich and Exeter
to run their own affairs as unitary authorities under any
circumstances? Singling out Norwich and Exeter in such a way is grossly
unfair, and the amendment maintains the possibility that Norwich and
Exeter could become unitary councils. As I have said, the Secretary of
State is on record as saying that he wants local authorities to run
their own affairs in such a way. The amendment would not require the
Secretary of State to invite any proposals. It would simply require him
to publish the basis on which he would invite proposals. That is a very
modest proposal. It would allow the people and their democratically
elected representatives from Norwich and Exeter to know where they
stand. As things currently lie, people have been thrown into a state of
confusion.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000018">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
period of three years gives the Secretary of State time to see what
happens in the interim, how local authorities are coping in the new
financial environment, where savings and better services could be
delivered by unitary councils and where the people in Norwich and
Exeter still want unitary authorities in their areas. I believe that
there is a need for clarity on this issue. There is a danger of a mixed
message being delivered by the Government because part 1 of the Local
Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 has not been
changed.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Are
the Government open to creating new unitary authorities, including
Norwich and Exeter or not? If so, on what basis will those decisions be
made? As I have said, we need clarity on this. The people of Norwich
and Exeter deserve that clarity and the amendment would provide
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000020">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">

                              <strong>Mr
Ben Bradshaw</strong> (Exeter) (Lab):<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000272">&#160;</a>
                           </span> I shall speak in favour of
the amendment for a number of reasons. We have heard throughout the
debate that the Government are keen on localism. Indeed, at one stage,
the Secretary of State was quoted as saying that his three priorities
in office would be, “localism, localism, localism”. We
have 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 5<a class="bkMark" name="Column5">&#160;</a>
                           </div>not had a satisfactory or convincing explanation why, in Norwich and
Exeter, that principle should not apply. Why, when we have overwhelming
public support in Exeter and Norwich from all the local stakeholders
and business communities and, in the case of Exeter, the support of all
the four political parties on the city council, including the
Conservative party, for Exeter’s unitary status, does localism
not apply in those two particular
cases?<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">By
withdrawing the unitary status that has at long last been granted to
Exeter and Norwich after their 36-year campaign to right the wrong of
the 1974 local government reorganisation, no one can argue that by
giving those powers back up to the upper-tier authorities—in the
case of Exeter, to Devon, and in the case of Norwich, to
Norfolk— that that is localism. It is the opposite of localism.
It is giving power up. It is centralising power to the bigger, more
remote, less accountable authority. At no point has anyone on the
Government Benches or, indeed, on the Liberal Democrat Benches tried to
make a convincing or satisfactory argument about how the Bill is
consistent with localism. The amendment that my hon. Friend has tabled
would at least leave the door
open.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
other reason why the amendment is worthy of support is that it is not
clear to me whether the Bill, as drafted, would prevent only Exeter and
Norwich from reapplying for unitary status or whether it applies to all
local authorities in the country. It would be helpful to the Committee
if, in his reply, the Minister could give absolutely clarity on that
matter. We did not receive it on Second Reading. We could, for
argument’s sake, imagine the situation in which there was a
Conservative-controlled county council and a Conservative-controlled
district council. In my experience, all the local authorities in one
area being of the same party generally helps in matters of local
co-operation. Let us suppose, faced with the very severe spending
restrictions and savings that they are having to make over the next few
years, that they think, “Come on, unitary local government in
our area makes sense. We can work together. We can deliver more cost
savings.”<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
we all acknowledge, unitary authorities are better value for money;
they are cheaper; they are more efficient. Are we really saying that
the local authorities in those areas should not be allowed even to make
an application or suggest to the Government that they think they can
run the services in their area more cheaply, more effectively, and more
efficiently if they were allowed to pursue unitary status? Is the Bill
a de facto, in-principle road block to bottom-up local government,
which is exactly what the Government claim they are in favour of? They
are looking for localism. They are looking for
bottom-upness.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000024">&#160;</a>

                           </div>that there would be a unitary Norfolk and a unitary Devon, a unitary
Exeter and a unitary Norwich, with the rest of those counties remaining
two-tier—was not the cheapest option. Of course, the most
expensive option is the status quo, which I will be coming on to
shortly. What the Government are ensuring is that we stick to the most
expensive, most wasteful
option.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000026">&#160;</a>

the hon. Gentleman may be in favour of a unitary Norfolk or a unitary
Devon but, if he knows anything about the subject, he will recall that
those proposals commanded the least support. In fact, the most
opposition came from within Exeter and Norwich, and also within those
county areas—not least from the districts. Turkeys do not tend
to vote for Christmas, as the old political saying goes. Those
proposals, which would have delivered even greater savings than a
unitary Norwich and a unitary Exeter, had no political support. They
were a complete non-runner. They were never going to happen and that is
what the accounting officer in the Department at that time was talking
about.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000027">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
move on to savings. The Government are keen on constantly saying that
they are interested in making savings—we are all interested in
making savings, particularly in the current economic climate. So it
seems to be complete madness to rule out—depending on what the
Bill actually does—a bottom-up approach coming from either
Exeter or Norwich in the next few years, which would deliver the sort
of savings that the Government’s own Minister in the House of
Lords, Baroness Hanham, made quite clear would be greater under unitary
government.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000028">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The overall
cost within two years would be just under £2 million for Exeter,
but after that, the savings would be much greater every year going
forward. Those savings are really significant. Are we saying that other
local authorities around the country—for argument’s sake
again, Conservative-controlled authorities—who want to work
together and move to unitary government should not be allowed to do so?
In the case of Cornwall, the Liberal Democrats are great supporters of
unitary government, and the Labour Government delivered that using
exactly the same arguments. Are we really saying that in this day of
economic and public spending restrictions, this more affordable, more
accountable and more efficient model of local government should not
even be proposed by the people at the bottom? The Government are
supposed to be in favour of localism and bottom-up democracy, but in
the Bill, they are doing exactly the
opposite.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000029">&#160;</a>

analysis of the Government’s stance on unitary authorities

been done in the context of a specific piece of legislation, in a way
that is wholly devoid of history. Actually, the background to how we
arrived at the situation we are in  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 7<a class="bkMark" name="Column7">&#160;</a>
                           </div>is rather important, as I shall demonstrate in responding to the points

                        <p class="tabbed">I will start
with textual analysis of the amendments. Simply, if the amendments were
made, they would allow the Secretary of State to make a replacement
order, and that replacement order would have the same effect as a
relevant order. A relevant order, as defined by the Bill,
means<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“an
order implementing…a proposal received by the Secretary of State
before the commencement of this
Act”.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000235">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>In
other words, the proposals relate to Devon, Norfolk and Suffolk, and do
not go any broader than that. The measure does not, in fact, achieve
its purported objective of requiring the Secretary of State to publish
criteria by which any future proposals for local government
restructuring would be judged.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That leads me
into a very short recapitulation of the background and why we are here.
The purpose of the Bill is to draw a final legal line, so to
speak, under the restructuring proposals for Devon, Norfolk and
Suffolk. It therefore puts an end to a process that began when a Labour
Secretary of State invited bids for unitary status from local
authorities some years ago. All the bids, except those three, have one
way or another been resolved. For reasons that I have explained, those
three remain in a sort of legal limbo that now needs to be rectified.
So, the Bill puts a full stop to what has been described as a torrid
saga, the previous Government’s attempts to force through plans,
which were unaffordable, unwanted and unwelcome, because it is not
realistic to look at changes to the two cities
concerned—<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000034">&#160;</a>

significantly to undermine the viability of the counties that remain.

all the areas that I can think of, many of which are
Conservative-controlled, where in former shire counties the main urban
areas have acquired unitary status—Wiltshire, Swindon, Dorset,
Bournemouth and Poole—those counties have been perfectly all
right? In fact, they have performed better than Devon. If we look at
all the performance criteria over the past few years, counties that
have lost their main urban centres have performed better because they
have been able to focus on their rural
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000041">&#160;</a>

those counties. The particular rurality of Devon, for example, is
reflected in the fact that if Exeter were removed, the largest urban
unit in the remaining county would be Exmouth, with a population of
37,000 people. It is well known that there are considerable extra
costs—potentially—for local authorities in delivering
services to overwhelmingly rural populations. Also, a considerable part
of the tax or rate base would be removed, and they cannot be seen in
isolation.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000042">&#160;</a>

Norwich from their respective counties. Does he accept that it would
provide an economic benefit not only to Norwich and Exeter but to the
surrounding counties? There is common ground between us. Cities are the
economic drivers in their locality, so that would be a huge benefit to
people living in the county. Furthermore, does he not also concede that
in terms of the cost of providing services—I am not minimising
the difficulties of delivering services in rural
communities—many of the most significant challenges faced by
local authorities are those challenges posed by providing services in
towns and cities where there are often large deprived communities,
which require significant resources from the respective local
authorities. By removing Norwich and Exeter, that demand would no
longer be required of the respective
counties.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000043">&#160;</a>

the Member for Tiverton and Honiton first. He represents the hinterland
of Exeter in the county of Devon, and makes two cogent points. First,
as we all know, consultations and responses to them produce varying
results. It is not realistic, sensible or in the interest of good local
government arbitrarily to disaggregate the impact on the services of
the county from what happens within the city boundaries. In that
context, the most recent consultation took place between last December
and January 2010, and more than half of the respondents from Norfolk
and 85% of those from Devon did not want any change. It depends which
figures one looks at, so I do not think that bandying particular polls
about advances the
argument.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000054">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for
putting the record right. I will not argue with him, but he leads me
neatly to my next point. As I said before this flurry of helpful
interventions, when the previous Labour Government sought proposals,
they published criteria by which they were to be judged and stated that
they would not be accepted unless they met all the criteria. The then
Secretaries of State—the right hon. Gentleman’s right
hon. Friends—judged that the unitary proposals in Exeter and
Norwich did not meet the financial criteria and that the Norwich
proposal did not meet the value for money criteria. That is why the
proposals were
rejected.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
boundary committee was asked to advise on alternative formulations and
it proposed county-wide unitaries, to which there was considerable
objection. The previous Government concluded that they did not want to
proceed with those either. The then Secretary of State, in trying to
find a politically convenient solution, ignored the advice of his
officials and the opinion of the independent boundary committee and
pushed through proposals for Exeter and Norwich that did not meet his
Government’s criteria. That is why this Bill is needed. At the
end of the day, he suddenly invented exceptional reasons that had not
previously been articulated for departing from the criteria. As a West
Ham supporter, I am conscious of what it is like to be robbed by a
last-minute goal when all seems well, but even though  it
seemed like it, nobody actually moved the goalposts at Arsenal last
Saturday. The then Secretary of State moved the goalposts without
proper consultation, which is why his proposals were ultimately struck
down by the High Court. That is the background to this
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000059">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I have been
asked about our views on restructuring. My right hon. Friend, the
Secretary of State has made clear his stance that it is common sense
that through closer collaboration and more joint working, councils can
not only save money, but improve the services on offer to people. That
is absolutely right and councils do not have to become unitaries to do
that. We do not have to spend that £40 million or so, or go
through such a lengthy and disruptive process. During previous
reorganisations, there was general agreement to the process of creating
unitaries, but costs and disruption inevitably
arise.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
the record, the Government have no plans to invite new restructuring
proposals from councils. However, if the Government decided that it was
necessary to invite new unitary proposals, the amendment would still
not be helpful. Kicking things back for three years would not help the
process one way or the other. The 2007 structure, with the ability of
the Secretary of State to invite proposals from local authorities,
remains in place. Putting in an artificial three-year limit would not
change the situation. There is nothing in the Bill that would stop the
Government from inviting proposals for new unitaries if that was deemed
helpful for local government. Nothing in the Bill would preclude
Norwich, Exeter or anywhere else from putting forward proposals if that
occurred. We are not closing the door, but, equally, we are making it
clear that we do not have such plans, because, frankly, we do not think
that structural reorganisation is a priority at the current time. In
the current economic climate, the priority has to be the efficient and
cost-effective delivery of local services to people in the relevant
areas, which can just as readily be delivered through joint working.
There are some excellent examples of joint working in the counties that
we are talking

welcome the greater involvement that local authorities will have in the
provision of public health services as a result of the
Government’s proposals, which are entirely consistent with our
policies of localism and handing back power to communities. The
palpable difference is that here the joint working is by sovereign
local authorities working together, rather than being forced together
into unnatural units. That is why there are many examples of
this.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000067">&#160;</a>

is good collaboration between districts in Somerset and East Devon. In
three of the Devon districts there is good collaborative working on the
insurance arrangements. There is a Devon procurement partnership, with
which I hope Exeter will be closely involved. It is clear that the
development of economic opportunities involves close collaborations.
Exeter airport, for example, is outside the boundary of the city
council, so it is important that surrounding districts work together.
In Norfolk there is

authorities, and I believe that a joint structure plan is in place. So
there is collaboration. What we seek to do can be more effectively
achieved through collaboration than through the costly upheaval of an
enforced reorganisation, so I hope that the Committee will reject the

he does not want the disruption of further local government
reorganisation at this time, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Scunthorpe has pointed out, the Government are embarking on a massive
reorganisation of the health service, so there is a considerable degree
of inconsistency. If it is acceptable for the Government to reorganise
the national health service—in their view, to make it better or
more effective—why is it wrong for local government to be
reorganised in some form for the same purpose, particularly when local
government is faced with significant reductions in its
budget?<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000071">&#160;</a>

that—yet he has rejected this proposal, which would have reduced
the number of councillors in Norwich and Exeter, thereby reducing the

                           </strong> My hon. Friend may wish to comment on the
Minister’s point about the potential for collaboration and give
his views on whether he thinks that this has any chance of having the
same status as unitary government. In the case of Devon and Exeter,
such collaboration is virtually non-existent. Exeter city council has
just been deliberately excluded by the county council from the local
economic partnership, which is one of the reasons that that local
economic partnership has been a total
shambles.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000074">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My right hon. Friend points out a significant
problem with local collaboration. While I welcome local
collaboration—we all want to see collaboration between
authorities and between the different agencies providing public
services—it is clear that if the structure is not right, it
makes it extremely difficult to wring out those savings that are
absolutely vital in the present climate, when all public sector
organisations will see a large reduction in their budgets, and local
authorities will see a reduction of 28% over the next few

                           </div>years with most of those cuts being front-loaded. To rule out a proposal
that could wring out significant efficiencies, in a much more effective
way than collaboration with other authorities in a two-tier structure
could bring, is complete and utter madness. I repeat my point that I
hope that Government Members will reflect on how they vote based on the
remarks of Opposition

                           </strong> I will come on to that point when we are
considering the next amendment. The Minister is not giving all of the
facts when he makes that comment. What he is ignoring—this was
made clear in the impact assessment that was provided by his
Department—is that while the costs of restructuring in Norwich
and Exeter would be £40 million, the savings over that same
period would £39.4 million. The total cost, therefore, is around
£600,000. The Minister is also ignoring that there would then be
ongoing savings in excess of £6 million a year. For
Government Members to claim that they favour value for money and then
to ignore this opportunity and the advice and information provided by
their civil servants seems again, to repeat the point, to be complete
and utter
madness.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000077">&#160;</a>

relevant, particularly when one considers that the hon.
Gentleman’s Government have just agreed cuts in local authority
funding of 28% over the next four years, which will see at least
500,000 local government workers made redundant. His argument does not
stack up. He cannot argue that point on the one hand and then sign up
to making wholesale massive cuts—unheard of in living
memory—to local government jobs, which are far higher than
occurred under Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative Administration.
Whether severance pay is too high is not the point, irrespective of the
level of severance pay given to some of the higher paid officers within
the

purpose of the amendment is to improve the access to and the quality of
information available to the public in the areas under discussion about
how and where their money is spent. We have heard much in the debate
about the importance of collaboration and of local authorities working
closely together. In order to hide the Government’s
embarrassment at ignoring their support for localism in the two areas,
and the forcing on both Exeter and Norwich of a more expensive form of
government than is necessary, there has been much talk about the
importance of partnership
working.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have already alluded to an example where the Government have signally
failed in the past few weeks. The story of their proposal to replace
the regional development agencies—on the south-west coast, we
had a very successful one with local economic partnerships—has
been “a complete shambles”. Those are not my words; they
are the words of the director general of the Confederation of British
Industry. We have fallen back into the bad old ways of local rivalry
and political parochialism. In virtually all the south-west, there has
been a failure to come up with proposals, because such collaboration
simply has not existed. Cornwall and Bristol are the only places that
have had their proposals granted.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One reason
why the Devon local economic partnership has been such a shambles is
that Devon, Torbay and Plymouth—Torbay and Plymouth are the two
unitary authorities that were granted such status by the previous
Conservative Government—have given absolutely no recognition of
the role played by Exeter in economic development in those areas. In
fact, even worse than that, Exeter has been completely excluded from
the process despite a letter from one of the Minister’s
colleagues, saying that in these areas it is important that the role of
cities such as Exeter that are districts, but have an important
economic role, be
realised.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000124">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is an example of an area where collaboration is simply not working.
Even today, one of the Minister’s old ministerial colleagues
admitted that the local economic partnerships are set to be a failure
in parts of England. I could have told him that. Many of my local
businesses and business organisations could have told him exactly the
same.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
very strong view is that one reason for that collaboration and
partnership not working well is that there is no transparency whatever
in how council tax payers’ money is spent. My constituents in
Exeter, for example, do not know, and they cannot find out at the
moment, what proportion of the council tax that they 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 16<a class="bkMark" name="Column16">&#160;</a>
                           </div>pay and of the money that Devon gets from the Government centrally to
spend on services is actually spent in
Exeter.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is a strong view, which is supported by common sense and the data that
are available, and it was alluded to by the Minister in his statements
earlier. He gave the game away a bit when he said that one reason why
he opposed Exeter’s and Norwich’s unitary status was that
their counties would lose the tax base. They would lose the milch cows,
which we have long-suspected that we are in Exeter and Devon, in terms
of the subsidy that our council tax payers provide to help with the
costs of services in rural
Devon.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">You
can think of a range of examples, Mr Brady, perhaps even from your own
area, where the cost of keeping small village schools going is high. It
is absolutely right that those schools should be kept going. In respect
of the cost of road maintenance in a county the size of Devon, the
amount of money that is spent proportionally in such rural areas far
exceeds the amount of money that is spent in Exeter, for example. The
relationship between the money that is raised from council tax and
business rates in Exeter bears no relation whatever to the provision of
services in that
city<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is not only a financial problem, but a broader political problem. We
have had several recent examples where decisions affecting Exeter have
been made by Devon county council, where not only was Exeter not
consulted, but no Exeter councillors were part of the decision-making
process. The decision, for example, to site a waste incinerator in my
constituency was made by the county council with no Exeter city
councillors having any influence, and there are many such
examples.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000129">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Similarly,
I understand that, when the process was ongoing in Norwich, it was
found that Norwich high schools were underfunded to the tune of
£12 million. On the long history of educational performance, in
the case of Exeter and Norwich, our schools were rather good before
local government reorganisation in 1974. Since then, looking at the
trajectory, there has been an unfortunate and disappointing decline in
school performance. In recent years, it has got much
better—certainly in Exeter’s case—with a big
improvement in the performance of our high schools thanks to the extra
investment by the previous Government, reform and, of course, the
capital rebuilding of all of our high schools. Those schools are still,
however, significantly underfunded, as are my primary schools, when
compared with schools in rural
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment’s impact would be that we would finally know how the
public’s money is spent, and I cannot see that anyone would have
a problem with such information being available. It would also clear up
some of the claims and counter-claims that have dogged this whole
process. While I have always asserted—I think the Minister
agrees—that Norwich and Exeter massively subsidise Devon and
Norfolk county councils in terms of the amount of council tax that we
pay compared with the amount of spending in our cities, that has been
contested at times. At one stage, Devon county council tried to suggest
that, because of the high number of young people with special
needs—we have an internationally renowned school for the blind
and for the deaf in Exeter—and the costs of funding their
education and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 17<a class="bkMark" name="Column17">&#160;</a>
                           </div>needs as adults, it subsidises Exeter. We need to know the truth about
that, and the public certainly need to know the truth.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In another
recent example, we had the same situation with Exeter airport, which
was an asset owned jointly by the people of Devon. When we tried to
find out how much of the proceeds of the sale of Exeter airport have
been spent on Exeter, the county council would not tell us. My
suspicion is that it is very little. Indeed, a number of projects have
recently been cancelled—for example, a new library and a
redevelopment at Haven Banks on the Exe in the middle of my
constituency—while a number of what one might call pet political
projects in other parts of Devon have been given the go-ahead. A lot of
money was spent on and, in some cases, wasted on those
projects.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If the public
can have an accurate view of how their council tax is spent and whether
they are getting a fair deal—not just because the public have a
right to be given that information, but because it would help to
resolve some of these disagreements and disputes—it would aid
the sort of collaboration that the Minister thinks will help to at
least reclaim some of the savings that we would have made if we had
moved to unitary status. How can the Government show that they are
serious about making savings and about joint working and collaboration?
There tend to be examples of collaboration between the two districts of
Exeter and East Devon, rather than between Exeter and Devon because the
relationships between those two authorities have been so damaged by
Devon’s opposition to Exeter breaking free. There cannot be that
collaboration unless people know what the figures are, who is spending
what where and who is paying for
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
is not simply a matter of justice for the council tax payer in Exeter;
I am sure that the council tax payers of the other Devon districts of
East Devon, Torridge, West Devon, South Hams and elsewhere would like
to know where their money is being spent and whether they are getting a
fair share of the cake. In terms of improving those collaborative
relationships and moving forward on the basis that the Minister claims
he would like to, I see no reason why he should not support my
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000134">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I support my right hon. Friend the Member for
Exeter in the points that he has made. I speak as somebody who became
leader of a unitary authority for six years after its creation by the
previous Conservative Government. There was certainly a perception in
the Humberside area that all the money was being spent in the Hull
area, and that nobody really knew about the accountabilities or
transparencies because of the how the two-tier government was
working.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000135">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Certainly a
unitary council creates a greater closeness between the elected members
and the people they serve, and leads to clarity and transparency about
purpose and accountability. I recognise that that will not be achieved,
despite the wishes of the people of Norwich and Exeter. It is important
that those transparencies and accountabilities are put in place in the
way in which the amendment describes because, as my right hon. Friend
says, having such clarity would assist us to create a platform for
proper, honest and open collaboration. That is clearly how the
Government are arguing these areas should be better served in the
future. So let us 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 18<a class="bkMark" name="Column18">&#160;</a>
                           </div>have the transparency and accountability in place, as it will allow that

approach will benefit people in these localities and develop the
localism to which I think we are all

effect of delaying the Bill’s coming into force. An order would

That is the real motive, I respectfully suggest, that underlines the

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government are clear that the future of Norwich and Exeter must be
settled once and for all. I thought that that was also the view of the
hon. Member for Derby North on the Opposition Front Bench. We have
dealt with that with the minimum of delay and it has been a tortuous
process, but concluding the matter and providing clarity is a
priority.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000138">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment suggests that the only way to get councils to co-operate and
to achieve transparency is by enshrining the matter in statute. Those
are the arguments that have been put forward by the right hon. Member
for Exeter and the hon. Member for Scunthorpe. I do not accept their
proposition, however, that we must go down that complex and
deliberately delaying route to achieve transparency.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000139">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This
Government are more committed to an increase in transparency of local
authorities than any other. The requirement to publish all local
authority spends of over £500 online is part of the transparency
agenda. That will achieve far more openness and accountability than the
complicated bureaucratic rigmarole of going through a statement and
orders. That is practical transparency. We are not, therefore, going to
take any lessons on the transparency
agenda.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000140">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not accept that the recognition to change the status of the city
councils has impacts on the surrounding county council, which should be
assumed to lead to subsidy. There are varying costs, and to
disaggregate in the ill-considered manner that is proposed would not
deal with such an issue. It is worth remembering that it was the right
hon. Member for Salford and Eccles (Hazel Blears), the previous Labour
Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, who said that
the proposals on the unitary cities did not meet the financial
criteria. Our view is consistent with hers. It is the Opposition who
have changed their view, so that does not hold water. It was the
accounting officer of the Department who warned that the financial
criteria were not being met by the proposals that the Bill seeks to
reverse.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000141">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I have made
it clear that we do not think that the amendment is necessary to
achieve transparency—it would be a delaying tactic. It also goes
against the thrust of localism as we see it. It would impose enforced
collaboration rather than encourage organic collaboration from the
bottom up.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000142">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Of course,
the new era of collaboration requires an element of trust and there
must be more accountability. I have indicated the practical steps that
we have already taken to deal with that. Local authorities must work
together and share information, which is already happening. Listening
to some of the arguments, some people might think that the people of
Exeter and Norwich are not

                           </div>represented on the county council; they are—they are represented
by democratically elected county councillors. As members of the county
council, such people have the same rights as those who represent any
other part of the county. There is no democratic deficit in that
regard.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000143">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My experience
has been in two-tier areas, and very often district-led county councils
can work together collaboratively. I hope that that will be the case in
those cities. That should not mean, however, that at the first sign of
any difficulty Parliament must lay down a set of rules. We must treat
local authorities and their elected members as adults. It does not mean
that we should adopt a more command-and-control approach. Councils have
the maturity to work together, and that is already happening.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000144">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In Norfolk,
there is a joint investment plan for buses, which is signed by the
county and the city councils, and First Eastern Counties buses. The
shared legal service in Norfolk is made up of 70 lawyers from the
county council, the city council and Great Yarmouth borough council.
That will lead to real efficiencies, savings and improvements in
quality of service. A procurement can be saved through that
collaboration.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000145">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is worth
remembering that the city boundary in Norwich does not reflect many
such opportunities. It was observed in the other place that only 14% of
the planned housing and economic growth for the Norwich policy area
actually lies within the city boundary, so collaboration has to take
place to the benefit of all. The same applies to Exeter, where many of
the great development opportunities, and the airport itself, which has
been mentioned, are outside the boundary of the proposed unitary
authority. To carve out unitary status on that basis would be an
impediment, rather than an enhancement, to collaboration. I hope that
the Committee will reject the

the Bill, but the unitary bids are not going through anyway—they
have been stopped by the courts. If he is right and there would be a
small delay in the Bill’s coming into force, it would make no
practical difference, as the Government have taken away the unitary
status of Exeter and Norwich, and the counties have done that through a
court challenge. A slight delay, if that is the effect of the

transparency that the Minister talks about does not happen in practice.
The chief executive of my local authority sent me an e-mail about the
amendment that  I told him I was tabling. He pointed out that
if the authority had become unitary, its spending would have become
transparent and accountable; but, as it is, the two-tier system allows
the county to evade clarity about exactly what citizens are getting for
the large amount of council tax that Devon county council demands of
them each year. Thus it evades proper
accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000148">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
received a similar e-mail from Norwich. I will not go into it at
length, but it set out a series of examples of decisions made by the
county council, such as switching off the street lights in Norwich, the
proposed closure of the Silver rooms and Essex rooms and the
restructuring 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>of the county’s children’s services. Those decisions were
all made without proper consultation with Norwich, which is the most
important district in the Norfolk area, and certainly the economic
powerhouse of the wider Norfolk economy.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000149">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not
accept the Minister’s point that transparency can be delivered
under the current system. Devon county council failed to answer my
request for simple and straightforward figures about how much money the
county has spent on the sale of Exeter airport. Although the Minister
talks very well about transparency and collaboration, what happens when
authorities simply refuse to collaborate and to be transparent?
Absolutely
nothing.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000150">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I have already mentioned, in relation to local economic partnerships,
Exeter was deliberately excluded from the Devon proposals in the face
of a ministerial instruction that that should not happen and that
districts of Exeter’s and Norwich’s economic importance
should be included in local economic partnerships. What will the
Minister do, or what can I do—he might have a
suggestion—when a recalcitrant county council such as Devon
refuses to be transparent or to collaborate with a city such as Exeter?
The Minister has no answer. While he is driving through a Bill that is
taking away our localism, he hides behind a façade of localism
and collaboration. That may exist in some places, but where it does
not, what will he do about it? Nothing. That is a betrayal of my
constituents.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000151">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
says that everything is all right because county councillors represent
Norwich and Exeter on the county councils, but they are a tiny minority
on the authorities. Virtually every decision that affects
Exeter—about schools, social services, transport and strategic
economic development—is taken by a majority of county
councillors from Barnstaple, the South Hams and East Devon. They are
not from Exeter and are usually of a different political persuasion
from the Exeter councillors.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
consistently fails to acknowledge that cities and rural shire counties
have very different histories, characteristics and needs.
Exeter’s needs in relation to economic development, education
and poverty are very different from the sparsity needs and rural needs
of Devon and Norfolk. I have already given him examples of county
council decisions over which not a single Exeter city councillor had
any influence, and I am told that the same has been the case in
Norwich, so I do not accept his reasons for rejecting the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
talks about disaggregation, as if only Exeter would be affected, but it
is he who is trying to introduce this divide with Exeter and Norwich.
Many rural districts in Devon would be equally interested in knowing
exactly how much of the money that they give the county council
actually comes back to them. This is simply a matter of openness and
transparency, and he cannot tell us what happens when a recalcitrant
shire county will not co-operate, is not open, and will not give
Members of Parliament the information to which they are
entitled.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000154">&#160;</a>

new clause would require the Secretary of State to report within two
years on whether the existing arrangements in Norwich and Exeter
represent value for money. We have had a long discussion this morning
about the merits and demerits of unitary status for Norwich and Exeter.
Indeed, we have discussed whether giving those two cities unitary
status would provide value for money. The new clause would clarify the
situation and ensure that it was a matter of record whether the
existing arrangements provided the value for money to which the
Minister has referred through better collaboration with the county
council.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000160">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Councils are
soon to lose about a third of their funding. Indeed, in some parts of
the country, the reduction will be even greater when the abolition of
the area-based grant is taken into account. Devolving power down to
local authorities is fine on one level, and we certainly support it,
but it is being done at a time when they will be subject to the most
horrendous cuts. There is therefore a danger that the Government will
essentially be devolving blame for those cuts. In that context, it is
even more important that we know whether the existing arrangements
provide value for
money.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000161">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Creating
unitary authorities in Exeter and Norwich would at least mitigate the
worst impact of the coalition’s cuts, and the economies that
would be achieved are clear. The Secretary of State himself says that
he favours value for money, but he does not believe that creating
unitary authorities in Exeter and Norwich would offer that value for
money, because of the set-up costs. To some extent, we dealt with that
in an earlier debate. However, the impact assessment undertaken by the
Department showed that although the set-up costs were about £40
million, the savings during that same period would be £39.4
million, while the ongoing savings would be £6.5 million. It is
therefore important to test these things and to ensure that the
Secretary of State is placed under an obligation to bring back a report
on the whole value-for-money question.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000162">&#160;</a>

we get value for money is essential at any time, but in the current
stringent economic circumstances in which the country finds itself, the
self-imposed strictures on local government and other public services,
as a result of the increased cuts recently announced by the Government,
make it even more vital that value for money is provided.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000163">&#160;</a>

the financial pressures under which all local authorities will be
coming in the next four years, which were not known at the time of the
previous impact assessment, there is now an even stronger case for
looking again at the financial benefits of creating unitary councils in
Norwich and Exeter. If Ministers continue to cling to the notion that
their decision is about value for money, what possible objection could
they have to an independent evaluation of whether the existing
arrangements deliver the best value for taxpayers in Norwich and
Exeter?<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000165">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will say a quick word about the High Court striking down the proposals
to create unitary councils in Norwich and Exeter, to which the Minister
referred earlier. The judge did not comment at all on the merits of the
case. He said that the Secretary of State was perfectly entitled to
create unitary councils in Norwich and Exeter. His only criticism was
about the length of the consultation period, which was brought about as
a result of the extended judicial review proceedings. When we refer to
the High Court, let us be clear that it made no comment at all about
the merits or demerits of unitary status in Norwich and
Exeter.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000166">&#160;</a>

thing is absolutely certain: the existing arrangements are the most
expensive method of delivering local council services in Norwich and
Exeter, which is something to which my right hon. Friend the Member for
Exeter eloquently referred earlier. It seems to me that any Member who
votes against the new clause will be setting themselves up as the enemy
of value for money for taxpayers in Norwich and Exeter. For that
reason, I urge the Committee to support the new clause so that we can
ensure that we know whether value for money is being provided by the
existing arrangements. What is wrong with that? What is wrong with
getting the information that we need to make legitimate decisions? We
surely should not be closing our minds, so I urge the Minister not to
close his mind to the proposal but to support it so that we can all
know where we
stand.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000167">&#160;</a>

beguilingly, but I am afraid, as is often the way, that the reality is
somewhat different. It is worth examining what the new clause would do:
it would require an assessment to be carried out. That seems to bear
little relation to real need with regard to what is set out in the
Bill. We have looked carefully at the issue, which has also been

I indicated in the earlier debate, the implicit assumption is that
savings can be made only through restructuring, and therefore the
assessments, which set out costs of some £40 million, made
assumptions about what savings would be made. However, the assessments

itself.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000170">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Prior to the
High Court case, the Department’s accounting officer, the
permanent secretary, wrote to the then Secretary of State about those
costings. He said that the costings, which were broadly in line with
those cited by the hon. Member for Derby North, were effectively of
£40 million, with gross savings of about £39.4 million,
then £6.6 million or £6.5 million of ongoing savings.
Although he said that he recognised that if the Labour
Government’s proposed approach of the two city unitaries
achieved the economic gains envisaged, and that there might be
offsetting benefits to the public purse from increased jobs and extra
revenues, he went on to say:<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000171">&#160;</a>

                        <p>For that reason, as
well as a number of others, he argued that the unitaries proposal,
which the Opposition wish to sustain, was ill advised and would not
represent value for money. With respect to the hon. Member for Derby

which had absolutely no support. The extra savings he said he was not
convinced by were not the savings that he acknowledged and which the

would deliver savings to the public purse within six years for both
cities, but the extra savings that we argued would accrue because of
the economic driving role of Norwich and Exeter in the interim

admitted that the accounting officer accepts his own
Department’s cost-benefit analysis. We have all got it here in
front of us, or at least I hope Government Members have because they
have displayed a quite extraordinary lack of knowledge in this area.
That analysis, quite categorically, showed savings to both Norwich and
Exeter over six years. What he is talking about are the savings above
that, which we argued would be made because of the importance of Exeter
and Norwich as economic drivers within the five-year period. Those two
things are quite different. There is no doubt that there would be
savings over six years and then every year after that. The letter
refers to our perfectly justified claim that, because of Norwich and
Exeter’s economic importance, we would achieve even greater
savings by moving to unitary status.

million, roughly, to implement unitary status in Norwich and Exeter,
and that the savings over the period would be about £39.4
million. The ongoing savings thereafter would be about £6.5
million or  £6.6 million. Surely that in itself
demonstrates that the change is value for money, without taking account
of the other points raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for

hon. Member for Salford and Eccles (Hazel Blears), rejected those bids
on the grounds that they did not meet the financial criteria. The
Secretary of State then proposed saying that there were new
circumstances that enabled a departure from

that course—that led to the judicial review and a successful

set out.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000180">&#160;</a>

£40 million, as well as savings. The

respect to the right hon. Gentleman, the Government do not seek to set
out and quantify a set of figures. We have been talking throughout on
the basis of the figures that were submitted by the local authorities
themselves as part of their bid, which the right hon.
Gentleman’s own Government initially thought did not give value
for money. The accounting officer questioned that judgment, and Members
opposite are very keen to forget it—they seem to wriggle out if
it. I am not as presumptuous as the then Secretary of State; I do not
think that I know better than the accounting officer and do not seek to
quantify things. I am, however, happy to set out for the right hon.
Gentleman on Report the significant savings made by many local
authorities across the country, through joint working, including those
made by many authorities in Devon and Norfolk. I hope that the two city
councils will join in those collaborative arrangements and drive out
some savings. So, with every respect to the right hon. Gentleman, I
will not take any lectures on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000192">&#160;</a>

transparency, and I fully support the view that local authorities can
work together in partnership, as we are already seeing in Norfolk. We
keep hearing the right hon. Member for Exeter referring to LEPs, and I
think that Labour should consider how Norwich city council has behaved
rather than looking at some of the other councils in Norfolk that have
worked well together, including shared services as the Minister has
mentioned. But with transparency coming through with the requirement to
publish expenditure, does the Minister agree that the right way to
ensure that local people get to see how the money is spent is surely to
allow that transparency to follow through and then to do what we
should—I guess in theory—all believe in, which is to
allow democracy to take its course? If people do not like what their
local authorities do, that is what local elections are for, rather than
having a centrally controlled diktat that takes away the power of
people on the street in local
elections.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000198">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Transparency in
its true sense is about accountability to the resident, the local voter
and the local community, rather than a reporting-up type of
transparency, which is reporting to the boss back here in Whitehall.
That is the old mindset. I am afraid that the new clause betrays that
mindset and I hope that hon. Members will reject
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000199">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Not only is
the proposal patronising, but it seeks to treat Norfolk, Devon and
Suffolk differently from every other county in the country, and the two
cities differently from every other city in the country. Why should
there be a report on the arrangements only in those areas, but not
anywhere else? It is a patronising and top-down approach that betrays
the Opposition’s view. They might not accept that localism will
deliver for the citizen. That is the implicit message, because they are
not prepared to trust people to get on with it. They want to
second-guess and double check it, and I am sorry that that is the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000200">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend’s point has considerable
force. One of the sadnesses of opposition, I found, was the disruptive
element that those unitary restructuring bids had in many parts of this
country, particularly those two counties. When I was in Norfolk, for
example, it was particularly sad that a good deal of shared working
that was going on was potentially disrupted with the whole structure of
local government being thrown up in the air. There are specific things
that can be done and are being done, which I think is the way forward.
There might be a genuine difference in philosophy between us and the
Opposition on that point, but the coalition Government have a mandate
to develop a genuine localism that is consistent with our coalition
agreement and the platforms on which both parties stood. The top-down
reporting requirement approach, with its additional burdens, is
absolutely not the way to do that, so I hope that the Committee will
reject the  new

adequately rebutted in any way, shape or form the cogent argument that
we put forward on how the proposal would affect value for money. As for
the accusation that Labour would treat Exeter and Norwich differently
from other parts of the country, it seems to me that it is the
Government who are seeking to do that. In his valiant attempt to try to
justify the Government’s position, he was metaphorically on the
ropes, because his claims were inadequate in the face of the strong
argument in favour of value for
money.<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000204">&#160;</a>

a new transparent regime and so on, but clearly there will be cuts and
reductions in the amount spent, because they are making massive cuts in
the grant to local government. We are looking for value for money over
and above that so as to mitigate the full impact of the massive cuts
that they will impose on the people of Norwich and Exeter. I simply do
not recognise the Minister’s description of our position, which
he says is patronising. How on earth can it be patronising to insist
that the people of Norwich and Exeter have adequate information about
the value for money provided by their local
authorities?<a class="bkMark" name="10110259000205">&#160;</a>

are committed to transparency, as the Minister claims they are, surely
providing information so that people can make informed decisions is
something that all of us could support. That is all the new clause
seeks to provide. I simply do not understand why the Minister is so set
on opposing this proposal. Perhaps it is only because it is has been
made by the Labour party. Such a partisan approach is entirely
inappropriate. Surely it is reasonable that we provide information to
