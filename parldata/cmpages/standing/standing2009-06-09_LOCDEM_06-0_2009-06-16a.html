<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000663"></a>The
Minister for Regional Economic Development and Co-ordination (Ms Rosie
Winterton):</b> We had quite a wide-ranging discussion at the
start of my responding remarks. At this stage, I do not want to repeat
the arguments why we need regional decision making and regional
strategies&#151;we went through those clearly this morning. However,
it is worth noting the support that we have received for this part of
the Bill. Margaret Eaton, chair of the Local Government Association,
said that the Bill
will</div><a name="09061777000600"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;give
councillors the power to effect real economic change in their local
areas.&#148;</div><a name="09061777000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich read out a
letter that the Committee received from 4NW about the views of the
people in local government. I would like to add to those comments, some
remarks from the chairman of the South West Strategic Leaders Board,
Councillor Angus Campbell, a
Conservative:</div><a name="09061777000601"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On
behalf of the South West Strategic Leaders Board I&#146;m delighted
that Government has confirmed the early transfer of the
Assembly&#146;s functions. The Board brings Council Leaders together
in the most effective decision making grouping for the South
West. I believe the Assembly achieved a great deal but now is a
time for a change. This announcement is a milestone in taking
forward more effective decision making in the South West. I look
forward to working with the Board of the Regional Development Agency as
we drive forward into a new phase for the
region.&#148;</div><a name="09061777000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Arthur
Barker, from Yorkshire and Humber,
said:</div><a name="09061777000602"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;'Throughout
Yorkshire and Humber we have a strong track record of working with
cross party
support&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09061777000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Arthur
Barker is a Conservative, as the right hon. Member for Skipton and
Ripon will
know&#151;</div><a name="09061777000603"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on
issues to shape our region and make our communities better places.
Local Government in the region is strong and these new arrangements
will help to maximise the value we can add for our communities by
collaborating at the sub-regional and regional
level.&#148;</div><a name="09061777000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061777000664"></a><b class="B">Julia
Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): The Minister is
going through some of the representations that she received on the
proposals. Will she tell us whether she received any representations
from members of the public, given that the Bill is about local
democracy, which the previous Secretary of State said is about engaging
people? What evidence does the Minister have to suggest that the
proposals will help to engage people directly with the process of
government?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div><a name="09061777000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000665"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> There are two issues. Earlier on, we explored
the idea for increased engagement through petitions, and through
councils promoting understanding of how local people get involved, all
of which the hon. Lady voted against. The reason why she opposed those
measures is completely beyond me&#151;but then again, trying to marry
the different Lib Dem approaches to policy and non-policy has been a
completely enlightening
experience.</div><a name="09061777000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of people&#146;s responses to the proposals, we indeed
consulted. We know that people want a powerful voice for local
government to draw up strategies with regional development agencies.
This morning, the hon. Lady voted against having any regional
strategies, under the spurious excuse that somehow, the regional
boundaries were wrong. However, in doing so, and in continuing her
voting record on the Bill, she is at every turn voting down proposals
that will strengthen local democracy and decision making, particularly
at regional
level.</div><a name="09061777000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will finish by quoting Councillor Mick Henry, who is a Labour member
and chair of the Association of North East Councils. He
said:</div><a name="09061777000604"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
opportunity for us to more effectively shape and determine our own
economic future in the region is strongly welcomed and we will be
working closely with partners as part of a commitment to making
implementation of the SNR proposals a success in the North
East&#148;.</div>
<a name="09061777000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061777000666"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Stewart Jackson</b> (Peterborough) (Con): The right hon. Lady
is perfecting the technique of body swerving legitimate questions put
by Opposition Members. She was asked about a specific point. Of course,
we are happy to hear an encyclopaedia of civic life throughout Britain
and views on her particular policies, but the hon. Member for Falmouth
and Camborne asked a specific question&#151;how many representations
has the Minister received from members of the public that support her
proposals? It is a simple question.</div>
<a name="09061777000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061777000667"></a><b class="B">Ms</b><b class="B">
</b><b class="B">Winterton:</b> Obviously, the hon. Gentleman will know
that I cannot name every individual who responded to the proposals.
However, I can say that we had a number of responses to the
consultation from local government. Although the Opposition spent most
of the morning sneering at both councillors and their input,
councillors are able to reflect the views of local people. In
particular, the view they have taken with regard to ensuring that the
regional development agency works closely, through the leaders&#146;
board, with local councils is exactly what the public want.</div>
<a name="09061777000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition say that the regional development agencies are unaccountable
and that they do not believe there is adequate local government
representation. However, as soon as we bring forward proposals for that
representation and partnership, they sneer about sashes and grand
approaches by councillors. If they took the time to consult their own
councillors, they would find that our proposals have been welcomed as a
good way forward. I hope that the Committee will support the clause. It
is about getting the right partnership between the RDA and local
authorities in the area so that they can draw up an effective regional
strategy that will help local people, local communities and local
businesses.</div><a name="09061777000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall briefly address the issue about representations from members of
the public. As I said, it is not possible for me to name every
individual, but in the interests of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div>being helpful I can tell the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne that
we summarised the feedback from the consultation in our Government
response in November 2008. I am more than happy to make available to
the hon. Lady or any other Committee member an analysis of the
respondents.</div>
<a name="09061777000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
address two other things. We do not want to assert from the centre that
leaders&#146; boards will look the same in every region. What we want
to do is recognise that local authorities are obviously mature bodies
that are able to have discussions about how to constitute the
leaders&#146; boards. That is why we have said that we want them to
have their own arrangements. The overall purpose is to give local
authorities a stronger collective voice at regional level. We have
tried to provide a transparent process for establishing the mechanism
that will enable the local authorities to act collectively and with
authority. It is encouraging for our approach that approximately five
of the regions have put together ideas about their leaders&#146;
board. There have been a number of discussions in those regions with
local authorities on exactly what the board should look
like.</div><a name="09061777000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to reassure the Committee that within that process, we
have been anxious to ensure that there is scrutiny so that the
voluntary and trade union sectors, for example, can retain in their
discussions with local authority leaders some of their input to
regional
assemblies.</div><a name="09061777000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061777000668"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Curry</b> (Skipton and Ripon) (Con): As we have said, it
is expected to take five years to produce a plan, but the complexion of
local government in any area could change quite dramatically in that
time. The plans must be approved by the Secretary of State. Does the
Secretary of State have any notional guidelines on the maximum number
of people for a leaders&#146; board? Is the leader appointed
personally or ex officio? The south-east region has 77 councils to
represent. If the leader represents a bunch of district councils, for
example, should there be arrangements for changing them in the event of
a significant change of political complexion during the five years of
drawing up the plan? What would be the term of office? What would the
Secretary of State regard as a sensible period of appointment for
someone on the board?</div>
<a name="09061777000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000669"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> That is the point of establishing the scheme. I
am not sure whether the official Opposition did not want a scheme or
whether they voted with the Lib Dems that there should not be a scheme,
but the idea of the scheme addresses exactly the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point&#151;it enables participating authorities to
set out both the composition and operation of the board. We would
expect it to include information, for example, on how the
leaders&#146; board proposes to resolve differences of opinion within
the board, between the authorities that it represents, and between the
board and the RDA.</div>
<a name="09061777000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
representation, we have said that the representatives on the
leaders&#146; board do not have to be leaders. However, we will
advise that they should be people of sufficient stature so that, for
example, they can make decisions on behalf of the authority and
represent
it.</div><a name="09061777000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000670"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> But elected.</div>
<a name="09061777000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000671"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> All elected members. Of course, leaders&#146;
board members need to be able to command the authority of the council
that they represent, but we are not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>dictating that they have to be the leaders of those councils. The person
must be someone whom the authority believes to be a good and strong
representative of its views.</div>
<a name="09061777000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061777000672"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Lilley</b> (Hitchin and Harpenden) (Con): The Minister
has exposed a lacuna in the Bill. I can find no clause that defines
what the leader on the leaders&#146; board is supposed to lead. She
spoke as if the leaders are to be leaders of local authorities, but as
I understand it, they could be leaders of business, trade unions,
churches, charities or any kind of leader. There is no restriction in
the Bill to say that the person has to be an elected member of a
council. Indeed, a council official could be appointed to the
leaders&#146; board. If I am wrong, perhaps the Minister could point
me to the clause that would expose my
error.</div><a name="09061777000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000673"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> The clause makes it clear, and we have always
been clear, that we are talking about representatives. That is the
democratic accountability that we have built
in.</div><a name="09061777000618"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="09061777000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061777000674"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Raynsford</b> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab): I believe
that the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden was not able to be
with us this morning, so he did not hear me read out a letter from 4NW,
the regional leaders&#146; forum for the north-west of England. It
gave a very clear indication of the composition of the leaders&#146;
board being set up in that region, which comprises leaders of relevant
local authorities&#151;not all the local authorities, but the main
local authorities in the area&#151;along with representatives of the
business community, the voluntary sector, trade unions and other
people. They are people who will act in a leadership role within the
region to help to drive forward the economic development agenda, which
is what the Bill is all about. I thus strongly urge my right hon.
Friend the Minister to be robust in defending the principles that are
set out in the Government&#146;s policy, which the Conservatives seem
to have some difficulty
appreciating.</div><a name="09061777000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000675"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> My right hon. Friend is
absolutely&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> As I have said,
the basic problem, which my right hon. Friend has once again put his
finger on, is that the official Opposition really do not want anything
to do with regional strategy at all and, frankly, they do not believe
in the economic model that we have established. Therefore, on every
occasion, they are basically doing what they can to undermine the
principles that we are trying to establish in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09061777000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061777000676"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Paul Goodman</b> (Wycombe) (Con): Which part of clause 68
defines who these leaders will be?</div>
<a name="09061777000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000677"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Regarding how the leaders&#146; boards are
constituted, we have said to the individual authorities that they will
need to come forward with a scheme that will then be put forward to the
Secretary of State. That is set out very clearly in clause 68(3).
Members of the Committee will see that, within that measure, the
following authorities are obviously set out:</div>
<a name="09061777000605"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a district
council...a county council...a National Park
authority...the Broads Authority.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div><a name="09061777000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is the participating
authorities themselves that must prepare the scheme. Inevitably, it
will be the elected members of those authorities who must agree who
will go forward to represent each authority. We have also made it very
clear that the person who goes forward on to the leaders&#146; board
must be somebody who is not necessarily the leader of the council or
authority, but a representative who is able to make decisions,
particularly about the allocation of funding or resources. That person
must be able to be a representative of the council or authority
itself.</div>
<a name="09061777000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">In all the
cases that have emerged, the people who have been put forward by the
local authorities have been elected representatives. For example, in
the Yorkshire and Humber area, they have been joining in with the joint
boards themselves. That is why the schemes themselves will look very
closely at democratically elected representatives. This is what local
authorities have asked for. They asked for the schemes to be
established in this way so that they themselves can have elected
representatives on the leaders&#146;
board.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000678"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> I seek clarification. My understanding is that the
central decision-making unit, to put it that way, would be composed of
nominated members of the regional development agency, although perhaps
not all the members. However, in the case of Yorkshire and Humber,
there would presumably be eight members. The other half of the board
would consist of people who were exclusively elected local authority
representatives so that there would be a balance between the quango
representatives and the local authority representatives. Are we now
saying that the leaders&#146; board may include people who have not
been elected? Secondly, does the Minister have any guidelines in mind
as to whether or not there should be some broad political balance among
those people who are elected to serve? It is easier to achieve that in
some parts of the country than others. It would be quite difficult to
do that in the south-east at the moment, but there have been times when
it would have been difficult in the north-east, for example.
Alternatively, is a desire to seek political balance not a relevant
consideration?</div><a name="09061777000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000679"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Taking Yorkshire and Humber as an example of
how the scheme has been drawn up, there has been agreement in that
region to have, as the right hon. Gentleman said, eight members of the
leaders&#146; board out of approximately 22 local authorities. That
has been agreed by the local authorities and all councillors who are
represented. Below that, there are a number of subsidiary boards
relating to housing, transport, planning and economic
regeneration&#151;those are roughly the advisory
committees.</div><a name="09061777000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
Yorkshire and Humber&#151;I am sure this applies to other regions as
well&#151;there has been a keenness to involve people who might
previously have been on the regional assembly. That is sometimes
achieved as part of a scrutiny role, and sometimes there has been
consideration of co-opting people on to some of the boards that have
been established, such as people from the voluntary sector and the
trade union movement, and representatives of the faith movement or
environmental groups. There are a number of ways in which people can
remain involved in the decision-making
process.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div><a name="09061777000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000680"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> But the holding company&#151;if I may use that
expression&#151;that makes a decision is composed exclusively of
members of the regional development agency and elected local authority
representatives, whether or not they are leaders of individual local
authorities.</div><a name="09061777000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000681"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> The current interim bodies have to abide by
existing legislation, which requires the regional planning body to
include other stakeholders. However, as I have said, regions such as
Yorkshire and Humber have been keen to ensure that other voices are
heard, whether by scrutiny or by the ability co-opt members, as
sometimes happens. The new legislation itself will not require other
stakeholders to be involved, but I think there has been sensitivity
about ensuring that people do not feel that they have been excluded
from the drawing up of regional strategies. In fact, people felt that
there was a good reason to have a regional strategy on the environment
and other areas.</div>
<a name="09061777000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are aware
that the leaders&#146; board schemes might, outside the scheme
itself, want to involve other stakeholders in scrutiny, or involve them
through the local authority structure. We will also make it clear in
our early advice about the leaders&#146; boards that we expect the
inner leaders&#146; board&#151;if you like&#151;to be made up of
elected members. We are keen to ensure that there is sensitivity about
the fact that there are many other groups and organisations that want
to have an input&#151;they have already been doing so through the
assemblies. We will therefore look at how we can encourage scrutiny of
proposed plans.</div>
<a name="09061777000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000682"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> There is no point in getting rid of the existing
regional assemblies if, in practice, they are then duplicated in the
new structure. May I be absolutely clear that the main decision-making
body will be exclusively made up of RDA and local authority people who
have been elected and have their own mandate, and that whatever
subsidiary bodies they bring in, that central core remains exclusively
elected people on the
RDA?</div><a name="09061777000077"></a>

again if the right hon. Gentleman would like me to: the early advice
will make it very clear that we expect the leaders&#146; board to be
made up of elected members. Having said that, I think that the clause
is the right way to get a balance between elected democratic
representation and the strategic focus of the regional development

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000699"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I rise to make a few brief comments. We
discussed on the previous clause the extent to which leaders&#146;
boards and the indirectly elected representatives who, it now seems,
will sit on them give a gloss of legitimacy to the work that the RDAs
undertake. The clause reveals who actually is in charge. Although on
earlier clauses we asked, &#147;Is this really necessary?&#148; the
key question in the next few clauses is, &#147;Who is in charge of
the process?&#148; The clause makes it clear that the RDA is the
first among equals in the partnership between it and the
leaders&#146; board because, if I understand the clause correctly,
the leaders&#146; board can be suspended and, if that happens, the
RDA stays in
charge.</div><a name="09061777000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
earlier amendments tried to firmly establish that even though the
leaders&#146; boards were indirectly elected&#151;we wanted to find
ways to make them more directly and democratically representative and
accountable&#151;the responsible regional authority had some kind of
democratic legitimacy and would not be overpowered by the RDA. Our main
concern about the clause is that it will still give a huge amount of
power to the RDA and undermine a clear chain of
accountability.</div><a name="09061777000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000700"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I support the hon. Lady&#146;s comments because
this short clause seems to encapsulate a fundamental dichotomy between
what the Minister says is its purpose, which is essentially to require
the leaders&#146; boards and RDAs to act jointly, and its substance.
Subsection (2) is effectively open-ended. It could give rise to an
open-ended arrangement whereby a leaders&#146; board is unable to
operate effectively for unspecified reasons, which may come to light
and we may have more information about via regulation. We do not know
on what basis that might happen&#151;it might be a problem with a
group on the board having an agenda over regional issues at variance
with another group  on the leaders&#146; board, or it might
be a financial or organisational issue.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000701"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> The hon. Gentleman will understand that we
highlighted in our discussion the need, wherever possible, to give
discretion and freedom to local authorities to develop appropriate
arrangements in their areas. The Government&#146;s intention is that
local authorities should have a good measure of discretion, within a
framework that ensures that the new leaders&#146; boards work and
that is subject to approval by the Secretary of State. Is the hon.
Gentleman suggesting that that is wrong, that there should be no such
discretion and that there should be no scope to have different
arrangements and, if necessary, to decide not to have a leaders&#146;
board? If that happens, the means to continue the arrangements must be
in place. Unless the regional development agency is in a suitable
position, we could be in stasis. Does he recognise that the measure is
a necessary safeguard against that?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div><a name="09061777000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000702"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> The right hon. Gentleman makes some key
philosophical points about the relationship between local and central
Government, but that is not relevant to subsection
(2).</div>
<a name="09061777000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000703"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I wonder whether the right hon. Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich has got things the wrong way round. The previous
clause requires leaders&#146; boards to be established and gives the
Secretary of State the right not to go ahead with them. Whether or not
they are established is within the gift of the Secretary of State, not
the local authority.</div>
<a name="09061777000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000704"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000706"></a>Mr.

to the hon. Gentleman, as long as he does not wax lyrical about

<a name="09061777000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000708"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> It is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s job, but
perhaps not in this Committee. The issue is about the Secretary of
State&#146;s powers. The practical ramifications of the clause are
that the Secretary of State could maintain an open-ended arrangement in
which there was an RDA but no leaders&#146; board ad infinitum, thus
subverting the democratic voice of local people. Incidentally, we would
like to say on record that the regional assemblies do not get a
mention&#151;they are dead and buried in a schedule&#151;so, in
terms of democracy, they are gone. The subsection allows the Secretary
of State, if he or she wishes, to have only the RDAs making decisions,
and that situation could drag
on.</div><a name="09061777000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Royal Town Planning Institute in particular draws attention to the lack
of a dispute resolution process. The Minister may say that that will be
covered by regulations, and I will accept that in good faith. There may
be contested policy positions that will not be improved if a
leaders&#146; board is not in situ and the RDA is governing alone.
There may be delay and deadlock as a
result.</div>
<a name="09061777000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000709"></a>Ian
Stewart:</b> I point out that there are integrated transport
issues in the
Bill.</div><a name="09061777000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am perplexed by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s line. First, he put it to
the Committee that leaders&#146; boards may not go ahead by local
decision, and he then accepted an intervention from the Liberal
Front-Bench spokesperson who said that the decision-making power was
with the Secretary of State. How can the hon. Gentleman reconcile those
two
positions?</div><a name="09061777000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000710"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I am merely reading the relevant subsection. If
there is any inconsistency in the argument, it is in the drafting of
the Bill and this clause in particular. I hope the Minister will
clarify the situation; but as it stands, we have serious
concerns.</div><a name="09061777000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000711"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Clause 69 identifies the responsible regional
authorities referred to throughout the remainder of this part of the
Bill as the regional development agency and the leaders&#146; board
for the region. Subsection (2) is quite explanatory. It
states that</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div><a name="09061777000606"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if during any
period after the coming into force of this section there is no
leaders&#146; board for a
region&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09061777000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">for
example, if the local authorities cannot agree on the constitution of a
leaders&#146; board, or if nobody in the region wants to
participate&#151;the responsible regional authority will be the RDA
on its own. We do not want that to happen&#151;we want
leaders&#146; boards to be properly constituted&#151;but we have to
plan for an eventuality where the leaders&#146; board breaks down or
has not been properly constituted, to ensure there would be a
responsible regional authority in the area. There is nothing sinister
about that; it is a fail-safe in the Bill for the reasons that I have
set out. That is why I urge the Committee to support clause
69.</div><a name="09061777000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000726"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I have two concerns about the clause on
sustainable development. We touched on the issue in debates on earlier
clauses. I am concerned about the wording. The Campaign to Protect
Rural England strongly makes the point in its briefing that the wording
is not strong enough to be meaningful. The CPRE is making a value
judgment between the previous objectives of regional development
agencies&#151;effectively to drive residential housing development
and disperse significant housing numbers from central
Government&#151;and the wider remit of social and economic growth and
sustainability. Therefore, we do not think that the wording in the
clause is sufficiently robust and, on that basis, do not support
it.</div><a name="09061777000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
be helpful, the Minister will also know that the CPRE made the sensible
suggestion in its submission to the Committee that the purposes of an
RDA, as set out in the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998, should
be amended, so that it is required to contribute to the achievement of
sustainable development in all the work that it undertakes, rather than
only</div>
<a name="09061777000607"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where it is
relevant to its area to do so&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 182</div><a name="09061777000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">All members of the
Committee will have received that briefing. For those reasons, we think
that there is an alternative route for the Government to look at
sustainability and sustainable development. We do not think that the
clause&#146;s current wording is sufficiently robust and, on that
basis, do not feel disposed to support
it.</div><a name="09061777000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000727"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I want to add to that briefly. The debate
goes back to a discussion that we had on a previous clause. That
provision seems to have been added as a footnote to the range of things
that the regional strategy needs to consider. The core function of the
regional strategy is to set up policies on sustainable economic growth;
but on development, it only sets out policies in relation to the
development and use of land in the region. Because neither
&#147;sustainable&#148;, nor &#147;sustainability&#148; are
included in its core mission, it is difficult to see how they can have
some additional regard to that. If it is really part of their core
duty, why is that not set out in the earlier clause, rather than just
added in parenthesis at the
end?</div><a name="09061777000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000728"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> I am slightly puzzled by subsection (2). Either
something is sustainable or it is not. I am curious about why we have
that little special reference to &#147;good design&#148;. Which
lobby is responsible? Is this Lord Rogers striking again? I agree with
the comments that the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich made
on Chelsea barracks, which I thought were absolutely spot on. It is
curious that the clause stresses the importance of good design. How
about stressing the importance of fuel efficiency, of trying to have
combined heat and power or of not having to travel by private vehicle?
Why has that one little point about design suddenly popped up? I would
have thought that either we had sustainability or we did
not.</div><a name="09061777000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000729"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> This has all the hallmarks of a subsection
inserted in another place, where I understand that there is a powerful
lobby for design interests, and that perhaps gives a flavour of how
curiously legislation can be
amended.</div><a name="09061777000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000730"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I hope that the Committee will support this
important clause, which relates to sustainable development. It will be
extremely worrying if the Liberal Democrats, after all they have said
on sustainability, decide to vote against it. It uses the standard
legal formulation used in various pieces of legislation that have been
passed by the House, most recently the Planning Act 2008. As my right
hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich suggested, the design
reference is replicated from the 2008
Act.</div><a name="09061777000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000731"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Let me make the Liberal Democrat position
clear. We think it better that the provision is included as a separate
clause than not at all, but we are unhappy that it was not set out in
the core function of the strategy in earlier clauses.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000734"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I am glad that there is some consensus among
Opposition Members about the aspect of the Bill that deals with review
and revision by responsible regional authorities. At the risk of being
repetitious, I believe that the clause exemplifies the over-mighty
powers of the Secretary of State, especially subsections (4)
and (5). That is why I will be speaking primarily to our
amendments dealing with those subsections, and supporting the Liberal
Democrat amendment to remove one of them, as well as discussing clause
stand part. We believe that if the subsections remain, they will
invalidate the whole clause.</div>
<a name="09061777000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
demonstrates an underlying distrust in local authorities, which are
closer to changes and variations in local economies, industry,
demographic factors, society and so on than regional bodies are. Once
again, the central tenet, as advanced by Ministers, that the Bill is
all about sharing power and devolving it from the top down, is
undermined. The philosophy that the Bill is all about local people and
decisions&#151;it was advanced strongly by the right hon. Member for
Salford (Hazel Blears), whom we miss already&#151;is barely
credible.</div>
<a name="09061777000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know that
the Government missed an opportunity last July to put flesh on the
bones of community empowerment, which is nowhere contained in the Bill,
but the clause shows that the Secretary of State wants to be involved
in the minutiae and to reach into every nook and cranny of local
decision making, particularly in the area of directions such as draft
revision and the direction under subsection (5) about the timetable and
its content. In our opinion, a generic template or format will be
rolled out across the country, with the ultimate power in Whitehall,
and diversity of provision, ideas and local decision making will be
cast to one side. For those reasons, we will vote for our amendment and
that of the Liberal Democrats, and we will vote against clause stand
part.</div><a name="09061777000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000735"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Our two amendments are very similar and raise
essentially the same question: once again, who is in charge of the
revision process? It is clear from the clause&#151;particularly from
subsection (4), which the amendments would delete&#151;that the
Secretary of State can reserve the right to require changes at any time
that he or she feels appropriate, and can direct the responsible
regional authority to do so.</div>
<a name="09061777000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear
that the Secretary of State can initiate a review. What I am not as
clear about is which half&#151;whether it is either, one or
both&#151;can initiate a review of the regional strategy. Under the
previous clause, the responsible 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div>regional authority is made up of the regional development agency and the
leaders&#146; board. We know from clause 71 that the responsible
regional authorities may prepare a draft revision. Must any revision by
agreed by both the leaders&#146; board and the regional development
agency before the revision can go ahead? Can one of them veto it? If
the regional development agency wanted to revise its strategy and the
leaders&#146; board said no, who would win that debate? The clause is
not at all clear on that.</div>
<a name="09061777000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">To understand
the power relationship between the leaders&#146; board and the
regional development agency, it is important to understand exactly how
the process would work. We are concerned about the extent of the powers
that are being withheld, and held instead by the Secretary of State,
but we also want to understand exactly what the relationship would be
at the level of the responsible regional
authority.</div><a name="09061777000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000736"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> The hon. Lady touches on an important point.
Clause 71(2) effectively gives the Secretary of State a double lock,
because the Secretary of State has that power and also has indirect
power, having appointed the RDA. Notwithstanding that it might not even
have been constituted by that time, under the previous clause, the
leaders&#146; board can be outvoted, but its members are the elected
people and they are closer to the action when it comes to revising
regional
strategies.</div><a name="09061777000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000737"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> The hon. Gentleman reinforces my point.
Again, I draw hon. Members&#146; attention to the title of the Bill,
which is supposed to be about local democracy. This measure exposes,
again, that more powers are being retained and kept within the gift of
the Secretary of State than are being held by people who are directly
democratically accountable for their decisions. The measure is another
example of the Government talking the talk&#151;saying that they want
to improve participation and accountability&#151;but not walking the
walk.</div>
<a name="09061777000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000738"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> The clause addresses the issues that the right
hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon raised when he talked about how long
particular strategies would last. He noted that circumstances might
change, and that is exactly why the clause is in the Bill. It allows
the responsible authority to say, &#147;We believe it is expedient to
revise the strategies that we have at the moment,&#148; so it
addresses his previous point. I am therefore slightly confused as to
why the Opposition want to take this clause
out.</div>
<a name="09061777000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000739"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> On clause 71(4)(a), I presume, then, that rules and
regulations will specify when the regional body, rather than the
Secretary of State, can decide to make a revision. Is that the point of
that measure? Of the two parts to this clause, does one provide for the
initiative to come from the regional body, and the other for it to come
from the Secretary of State? Have I read it
correctly?</div><a name="09061777000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000740"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b><b class="B"> </b>Subsection (4)(a) is saying that, after
consultation, we will set out in regulations where there might be
appropriate points for the Secretary of State to say that there should
be revisions. Subsection (2) sets out our belief that the responsible
authorities should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 185</div>have the power to revise something if they feel that that is right. Over
and above that, to answer the point raised by the hon. Member for
Falmouth and Camborne, yes, we would want the leaders&#146; board and
the RDA to trigger a revision jointly, but where there is disagreement,
and one body does not believe that it should be revised, the fall-back
is in subsections (4) and (5), which the Opposition are trying to
remove. I urge the Committee to reject the amendments and to vote for
the clause, which builds into the whole process many of the points that
have been raised.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i></div><a name="09061777000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000741"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I was stunned by the eloquence, charm and wit of
the Minister, Mr.
Illsley&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i>&#151;but, unfortunately, not by
the content of what she said. She and I are seeing a lot of each other
this week, as we debated the much less interesting topic of business
rates last
night.</div><a name="09061777000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
final point is that the Minister has not sufficiently addressed the
concerns raised by the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne about the
imbalance between the respective centres of power. Earlier, we heard
about the Lilley lacuna. We also have the Goldsworthy
lacuna&#151;</div><a name="09061777000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000742"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> The Goldsworthy gap.</div>
<a name="09061777000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000743"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> The Goldsworthy gap. My right hon. Friend the
Member for Skipton and Ripon helps me out in his customary way. There
is an imbalance between the respective centres of power of the RDA, the
Secretary of State and the leaders&#146;
board.</div>
<a name="09061777000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000744"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> From the Minister&#146;s explanation, the
situation is worse than I had feared. It seems as if the regional
development agency and the leaders&#146; board could say that they do
not want a revision, and the Secretary of State can impose one. Perhaps
the leaders&#146; board will say that it does not want one, and the
RDA will say that it does, and the Secretary of State can still impose
it. The presumption is always in favour of a revision, which it seems
will always be within the power of the Secretary of
State.</div>
<a name="09061777000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000745"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> Exactly. Let me make a tangible contribution by
way of an example. Suppose there was a west midlands regional strategy
in an area where there were going to be significant job losses in the
future at an important regional employer, such as in automotive
engineering or the manufacturing industry. The leaders&#146; board
might consider that regional strategy worthy of a rewrite and a
significant revision, in order to take into account the economic,
social and demographic factors consequent to that significant
macro-economic change, which had perhaps involved the loss of 5,000 or
6,000 jobs. The Secretary of State, working with the regional
development agency in the west midlands, might decide that that rewrite
was not appropriate and that there were other priorities. The
Conservative party believes that the important flexibility is not built
into the clause. For that reason, we are not minded to support
it.</div><a name="09061777000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000776"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> Welcome back to the Chair, Mr.
Illsley, as we continue to make our way through the Bill with
cross-party consensus. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Well, a
two-party consensus, at
least.</div><a name="09061777000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
move on to the issue of community involvement, which relates to how
responsible regional authorities will involve people in the exercise of
their functions. That is a crucial matter for whatever those new bodies
will be. It has struck me and my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth
and Camborne that the clause allows responsible regional authorities to
define for themselves who should be involved. That definition will then
be referred to the Secretary of State, but it is really left to those
who will carry out the function to determine who they will consult
about how well they are doing. That does not seem robust enough in
terms of allowing people in the relevant regions to scrutinise what
their regional authorities are doing on their behalf. The amendments
seek to address the
issue.</div><a name="09061777000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
112 states that those who pay tax to local authorities and their
elected representatives at all levels, which include, for example,
parish councils, would have to be consulted on a regional
authority&#146;s proposals for its region. Amendment 115, which was
tabled after consulting the county councils network, is an alternative
way of addressing the issue, and was tabled for the purposes of debate.
It sets out in a more detailed way the sorts of authorities that might
be included. The amendments are not necessarily prescriptive, but they
are intended to prompt debate. We feel that there  should be a
little more prescription that clearly sets out that all the people in a
region and their democratically elected representatives ought to be
consulted about what is being proposed for their region, as opposed to
allowing the regional bodies to determine who they will ask
about whether they are doing a good job. Amendments 113 and
114 are consequential
amendments.</div><a name="09061777000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 112, I would like to hear more from the Government about who
they feel should be consulted and why, and what checks, other than the
Secretary of State rubber-stamping what comes from the regional
authorities, will be in place. People who live in the relevant regions,
and who pay local and national taxes that fund the regional
authorities&#146; work, need to feel confident that their views are
being taken into
account.</div><a name="09061777000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000777"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> We will support the amendment, principally
because a clause that supports community involvement, such as clause
72, needs to use more circumspect language. It is inappropriate to use
a phrase such as &#147;have an interest&#148; in that context,
because it refers to a value judgment of an interest that someone might
have. An interest can have one meaning for one person and a different
meaning for another person. The definition and terminology are too
loose, and for that reason alone we are minded not to support the
clause.</div><a name="09061777000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000778"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> The hon. Gentleman said he believed that there
was a need for more circumspect language. Will he tell the Committee
why it is appropriate to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div>support an amendment that refers to the domestic rates, which, as I
understand it, were abolished some 20 years ago? Is that really
circumspect
language?</div><a name="09061777000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000779"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> Well, the Liberal Democrats are nothing if not
mischievous, and I suspect they are attempting to keep esteemed and
statesmanlike parliamentarians and Privy Counsellors, such as the right
hon. Gentleman, awake and abreast of the debate. I have to say that I
had not spotted that particular mistake myself, but I suspect that the
Liberal Democrats will now be seeking a new legislation drafting
intern.</div>
<a name="09061777000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Notwithstanding
the deliberate error, the substance of the amendment is correct.
However, the need for a wider and more focused consultation should be
more explicit in the Bill. Linked with that is amendment 115, which is
explicit. We all have a great deal of time for our colleagues in the
county council network&#151;I suspect that the right hon. Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich has fewer colleagues in that network than he had
two weeks ago&#151;so the Opposition support this amendment. Although
we believe that it is important to have significant community
involvement, the wording of the clause is too loose. The amendment
would ameliorate that deficit, and on that basis we support
it.</div><a name="09061777000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000780"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Well, Mr. Illsley, what can I say?
On the one hand the Opposition say that the wording is too loose and on
the other they want to replace it with wording on a subject that does
not even exist. It is beyond belief. Seriously, we need to consider how
prescriptive this Committee should be about the consultation. I say
that because the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Falmouth and
Camborne would have the effect of removing from the consultation some
non-governmental bodies that might have an interest in the subject
matter of the strategy. I do not think that any of us wants to see that
happening. It might be important that in some areas it is not just
domestic and non-domestic ratepayers who are
consulted.</div><a name="09061777000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the other place, we gave a commitment that we would issue guidance
about types of bodies that should be involved in the process. However,
I do not think that it is appropriate to attempt to set that out in the
Bill itself. I therefore urge that the Committee rejects these
amendments and supports the clause standing part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09061777000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000781"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I seek your guidance, Mr. Illsley,
about whether it might be possible to call for a separate vote on
amendment 115 and not on amendment 112, which is the initial
amendment.</div><a name="09061777000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
his usual eye for detail, the right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich has hit upon a slight drafting error in amendment 112. It just
goes to show that in discussion, it pays to be a little clearer when
drafting such things. The principle behind the amendment is clear. I do
not like to use the word taxpayers to describe residents of an area,
but those who contribute to funds that will pay for work on behalf of
their area should be consulted, as should their elected representatives
at every
level.</div><a name="09061777000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000782"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> I get slightly squeamish when I see the words
&#147;parish councils&#148;. Some parish councils cover cities of
15,000 people. The town councils of Ripon and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 189</div>Skipton are both parish councils in constitutional terms. The village of
300 people in which I live has a parish council. I had better not say
what I think of it, but I would not entrust it with cutting the grass
along the river. I am slightly
concerned&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> There is no point
in being daft. Some councils are very effective and others are rather
less so, to use the words of the Bill. What parish councils does the
hon. Gentleman have in mind? We could spend a lifetime on

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000783"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The whole point of community involvement is that
information is made available and people have the chance to respond. If
smaller parish councils choose not to respond, that is within their
rights. Of course there will be capacity issues. As the right hon.
Gentleman pointed out, there are some quite large parish councils. In
my constituency, Truro city council is a parish council, although those
who do not know the area well might think that is a principal
authority. It would no doubt want to contribute. Parish councils are
made up of elected representatives of local people. There will not be a
problem if they choose to respond and it would be
welcome.</div><a name="09061777000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000784"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="09061777000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000785"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I will in a second or two. The Minister said she
felt that the amendments were too prescriptive. There is a certain
irony in the Government saying that they want to draft things loosely
when a huge amount of the Bill goes into great detail about how
councils should reply to petitions. To repeat the phrase used by the
right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, let a thousand flowers
bloom.</div><a name="09061777000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention behind the amendments, particularly amendment 115, was to say
that such authorities must be consulted. We do not want to say that
other people cannot be consulted, but to be a bit more prescriptive
about those who will be. Should regional authorities want to consult
other people or organisations, they would be perfectly able to do
so.</div><a name="09061777000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000786"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> Does it not show a certain wooliness of
thinking on the part of the Liberal party that two of its amendments
would require that every one of the 8,000 parish councils be
consulted&#151;some of which may not be paragons of good, efficient
local administration, as the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon
pointed out&#151;while amendment 112 would ensure that nobody who
pays council tax would be
consulted?</div><a name="09061777000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000787"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his helpful
intervention. There is a serious point about the involvement of parish
councils, which I feel strongly about. It is clear from speaking to the
National Association of Local Councils that parish councils do great
work in their communities. They are quite often the first port of call
because parish councillors are often well known and visible in the
community, sometimes more so than principal authority councillors. I do
not think that there is any harm in saying that they should be written
to. Whether or not they hold a parish meeting for a whole day to decide
on their response is up to them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 190</div><a name="09061777000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000788"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> Following the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about
the lowest level of democracy, is he aware of the lengths to which
parish councillors go to ensure that they do not have to have an
election because doing so costs money? Little village parish councils
go to huge lengths to ensure that the number of people standing
corresponds exactly to the number of vacancies. The idea of having an
election is enough to give apoplexy to the entire village
community.</div><a name="09061777000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000789"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I thought we were talking about consultations
rather than elections. I am interested to hear about the practices used
in parish council elections in the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s part
of Yorkshire. The  70 parish councils in my constituency, some
of which go down to parish meeting size, take such issues very
seriously and there is usually a great deal of involvement. There are
perhaps one or two parish councils that are not contested, but I can
think of some recent elections that have been highly contentious and
vigorously fought. I do not want to be sidetracked, but I think parish
councils are worth getting involved in, and there is no harm in listing
parish councils as bodies that need and ought to be
consulted.</div>
<a name="09061777000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000790"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> To help the hon. Gentleman, the term
&#147;parish council&#148; can be generic. A township of about
12,000 people in my constituency that was developed by Peterborough
Development Corporation is an urban area, but it is represented by a
body called Bretton parish council. The people who are elected to it
would of course want an input to the regional strategy in my
area&#151;currently, my constituency is within a sustainable
community area and has a significant amount of housing mooted for it.
Parish councils are not just about representing the 60 residents of
Little Snoring by the Tamar; they can be quite large entities. Such
local democracies are as close as many ordinary voters who are not
interested in politics get to civic
administration.</div>

Goldsworthy:</b> I beg to move amendment 116, in
clause 73, page 53, line 4, leave

&#145;must&#146;.</div><a name="09061777000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000807"></a>The

amendment 117, in
clause 73, page 53, line 16, leave

(5).</div><a name="09061777000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000808"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> The clause relates to the circumstances under
which the responsible regional authorities can call in for an
examination in public any draft revisions that they make to their
regional spatial strategy. We tabled the amendments because we are
concerned that the Bill gives responsible regional authorities only the
option of calling for such examinations, not a requirement to do
so.</div>
<a name="09061777000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000809"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> I am slightly puzzled because I recall a group of
amendments that the Liberal Democrats tabled that sought to replace the
word &#147;must&#148; with the word &#147;may&#148;, and
amendment 116 seeks to replace the word &#147;may&#148; with the
word &#147;must&#148;. I am confused about where we are
heading.</div>
<a name="09061777000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000810"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> We are trying, in all aspects of the position
that we are taking on the Bill, to encourage people as much as possible
to make a contribution and to have an impact on the process. Our
concern is that the responsible regional authorities alone have that
option; individuals might have huge concerns, but they have no recourse
to get them
heard.</div><a name="09061777000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that the Minister, in her response, will say that there is a
route for people to call in if they have concerns. For example, if the
responsible regional authorities undertook a revision that they said
was not significant enough to require an examination in public, what
would the process be if members of the public felt that those revisions
were significant? At the moment I do not see any ability for there to
be a call-in for an examination  in public, which is why
amendment 116 replaces  &#147;may&#148; with
&#147;must&#148; and why we have consequential amendment
117, which is a mechanism to ensure that people have the option to get
those examinations heard and on the record. Whether we press the
amendments to a vote will depend on whether we are satisfied that such
a call-in option and process is available.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div><a name="09061777000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000811"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I am confused by the hon. Lady&#146;s
amendment, because she proposes to substitute &#147;may&#148; for
&#147;must&#148; in subsection (1) but does not propose to
eliminate subsection (2), which leaves to the body the discretion to
decide whether to arrange for an examination in public. If she follows
down subsection (2), she will see exactly her points of
concern&#151;an examination in public should occur when there is an
issue of sufficient material relevance or which arouses sufficient
public interest to merit it, but there should not be an obligation for
an examination in public for a de minimis alteration, perhaps just
changing one small detail. Does she not understand that the clause as
currently drafted allows exactly that discretion, with the safeguard of
the Secretary of State being able to insist on a call-in for an
examination in public if the authority fails to do so? The hon.
Lady&#146;s concern appears to be met rather better by the clause as
drafted than by her
amendments.</div><a name="09061777000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000812"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> As I was explaining when the right hon.
Gentleman intervened, this is a series of probing amendments, to make
sure that the safeguards are in place. As we have seen in a number of
other clauses, the instinctive response of the Government seems to be
to provide safeguards by giving a power to the Secretary of State. We
would like to approach it from the opposite perspective: we think the
safeguards need to be put in place by giving the powers to people. We
shall listen carefully to the Minister&#146;s comments, but she needs
to go further in demonstrating how the entire process is designed to be
responsive to the views and needs of people rather than to those of
various quangos and other interested parties, which seems to be the
main thrust behind an awful lot of the previous clauses
debated.</div><a name="09061777000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000813"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Illsley. I
seek your guidance. Are we debating just amendments 116 and 117, or are
we debating stand part as well? Forgive
me.</div><a name="09061777000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000814"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We are just debating amendments 116 and
117.</div><a name="09061777000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000815"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> In that case, I shall be extremely circumspect
and say that we will reserve judgment on the amendment and on how we
vote&#151;if there is a Division&#151;until we have heard the
specific answers of the
Minister.</div><a name="09061777000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000816"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> As has been said, the aim of the clause is to
provide for the regional strategy to be subject to testing by an
examination in public held by an independent person. That principle was
endorsed by the feedback to our consultation last year. As has been
said, the Liberal Democrat amendments would make the EIP mandatory.
What we have tried to achieve in the legislation is to enable the
responsible regional authorities to consider the extent of revisions
and the level of interest when deciding whether to arrange for an EIP.
It is important to give the responsible regional authorities that
discretion, because, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich
and Woolwich said, if there were only minor and uncontroversial
adjustments to a strategy, it would be ridiculous to say that there had
to be an examination in public by an independent person, which then had
to be  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 193</div>sent to the Secretary of State. We are trying to capture the idea that
the strategies will be able to be scrutinised, but at the same time
find a reasonable way to do it.</div>
<a name="09061777000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
responsible regional authorities ignore the extent of the revisions and
the level of interest and say, &#147;We are simply not going to have
any kind of examination in public,&#148; the Secretary of State has
the option of arranging one instead. That is why we have a fall-back in
subsection (6). We certainly feel that that is an important reserve
power, which amendment 117 would remove. I think that we have struck
the right balance: the provision is not over-burdensome to the
responsible regional authorities, but at the same time, we have a power
whereby people can make representations if they feel that the
responsible regional authorities are ignoring their views. For that
reason, I hope that the amendments will be
withdrawn.</div>
<a name="09061777000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000817"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Our question is: what happens in the event of
a dispute over whether the revisions are significant? At the very least
we want reassurances that if the Secretary of State is to be the person
who makes that decision, a low threshold needs to be set for making the
decision to call the matter into an examination in
public.</div>
<a name="09061777000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000818"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> By way of support, the right hon. Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich used the term &#147;de minimis&#148;. We
know from our experience and from consultation with our constituents
that &#147;de minimis&#148; can mean different things to different
people. If one looks at matters such as the Gypsy and Traveller policy
or density targets in the east of England&#151;the regional spatial
strategy&#151;and the whole question of examinations in public, one
sees that the revisions there are not de minimis in anyone&#146;s
book. I very much empathise with the hon. Lady in that respect and I
can see the dangers that she highlights.</div>
<a name="09061777000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000819"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> To make a perhaps mischievous point, given
that we have eight pages of primary legislation on how local
authorities should respond to petitions, perhaps some provision should
have been made for responsible regional authorities to respond. Some
form of a petition system would be the best way for people to register
concerns if they felt that the revisions were significant enough to
warrant an examination in public. I would have preferred to see a
mechanism such as that, which allows people to get their voices heard,
rather than having to appeal to the Secretary of State to make a
judgment. If the Government were being consistent in the application of
their principles, perhaps we would have seen a petition system to allow
for the matter to be called in, instead of seeing recourse to the
Secretary of State. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061777000268"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div><a name="09061777000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are concerned about

of revision by Secretary of
State</div><a name="09061777000314"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000852"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I beg to move amendment 118, in
clause 75, page 54, line 27, leave
out subsection
(2).</div><a name="09061777000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000853"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following: amendment 119, in clause 75, page 54,
line 31, leave out subsection
(3).</div><a name="09061777000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
120, in
clause 75, page 54, line 36, leave
out subsection
(4).</div><a name="09061777000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000854"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> In the hope that we can move swiftly on, I will
be brief. The amendments reflect our suspicion of the Secretary of
State&#146;s role in overriding what might have been agreed under
arrangements already in place. We have said before that those
arrangements are imperfect, but if we are to have a slightly more
accountable system, we really prefer that it stand, rather than have
the Secretary of State able to nitpick every revision made by regional
bodies. It undermines the whole purpose of any form of regional
government in which local government is involved if the Secretary of
State can overrule it.</div>
<a name="09061777000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000855"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> We passed rather rapidly over the clause 74,
which required the responsible regional authorities to take account of
regional strategies in adjoining areas. In the event of the regional
body approving a strategy that is completely in conflict with that of
another region and that other region objecting strongly, the revisions
that the hon. Gentleman is proposing leave no mechanism for resolution.
Does he not recognise that there will be circumstances in which some
sort of higher authority has to take a look at situations in which
there is a conflict between the regional strategies prepared by
different regions? Frankly, it is not satisfactory to remove the role
of the Secretary of State without providing an alternative mechanism
for resolving such disputes.</div>
<a name="09061777000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000856"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The preceding clause refers to the need for the
responsible regional authorities to &#147;have regard to&#148;
certain matters. If they do not have regard to the matters listed, we
have a problem, because those strategies cannot come into force unless
the regions get together and resolve the
issue.</div><a name="09061777000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am concerned about the fact that, as is often the case when discussing
such matters, if there is a reserved power for a Secretary of State in
a Bill, the Government say, &#147;It will only be used very
sparingly, and you must trust us that it is absolutely fine.&#148; We
tend to take a slightly more suspicious view, which is that the
instincts of Government and Whitehall are not to be charitable when
handed power, but to interfere more if the power is there for them to
do so. I think that we differ in our view of how Government
works.</div><a name="09061777000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
principle behind the amendments is to allow responsible regional
authorities to make amendments to their strategy. I am mindful of the
previous clause, which we did not oppose, and that there are other
issues that need to be dealt with. However, we hope that it will not be
for the Secretary of State to be involved with and sign off
everything.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div><a name="09061777000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000857"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I can be brief because my right hon. Friend the
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich set out one obvious scenario in which
the effect of the Liberal Democrat amendment would be to remove the
ability to sort out cases in which there were differences in regional
strategies between regions. If, for example, the responsible regional
authorities in one area do not agree, the Secretary of State needs to
have this power, because it is important that there is an arbiter.
Also, if any agreed strategy had completely ignored any of the
priorities set out nationally&#151;perhaps through this
House&#151;it is important for the Secretary of State to be able to
intervene in those circumstances. That is why I hope that the Committee
will not accept the
amendments.</div><a name="09061777000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000858"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> One of the important reasons for tabling such
amendments is to get clarification from the Minister on the record
about the sort of circumstances in which the power would be used. We
have done that and we are mindful that people will now have something
to reflect back on in the future, and that, of course, any future
Secretary of State can be reminded of what was said if the Bill comes
into force. Although I am not entirely convinced that the power will
always be used in the way that the Minister has set out, I hope that
that is the case and, on that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061777000324"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09061777000325"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000859"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I beg to move amendment 55, in
clause 75, page 54, line 31, leave
out subsection (3) and
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3) If after
proceedings under subsection (2)(b) the Secretary of State proposes to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000860"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 56, in
clause 75, page 54, line 44, at
end insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;including the reasons for making
any changes to the submitted draft
revision.&#146;.</div><a name="09061777000327"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000861"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and
Camborne and I were discussing earlier the principle I was debating
with the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, which is that
the Liberal Democrats seem to see the worst in central Government and
the best in local government. When a party is in government, perhaps it
tends to see things the other way around. The principle behind
amendments 55 and 56 is to ensure that, where the Secretary of State
has the power to approve or not approve draft provisions&#151;we have
moved on from the debate about whether or not the Secretary of State
will have that power&#151;and intervene in that way, the reasons
behind his intervention and the type of changes that he wishes to make
are published for consultation, so that Secretary of State must consult
widely before taking any action that the Bill would allow him to
take.</div>
<a name="09061777000328"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000862"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Again, I understand that the amendments may be
probing. However, they are unnecessary because the Bill already
requires that there is public consultation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 197</div>before the Secretary of State finally approves the strategy and the
responsible regional authorities publish it. It has become established
practice to give reasons for any changes that are made to the draft
strategies. I hope that the amendments will be
withdrawn.</div>
<a name="09061777000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000863"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The Minister sees that the principle behind the
amendments follows on from the principle that we were debating earlier.
We must ensure that every opportunity is given to members of the public
to comment on revisions, which may well be significant. From the
viewpoint of Whitehall, they may not seem highly significant, but a
small revision to an overarching regional strategy could have huge
consequences for a community or area and be a very contentious issue.
We must therefore ensure that there is ample opportunity for people in
such areas to comment on any revision to the strategy that may affect
them greatly. Furthermore, the Secretary of State must accept the need
for that consultation and seek to consult as widely as
possible.</div>
<a name="09061777000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
having received those assurances from the Minister, I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
76</h4>
<a name="09061777000014"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Reserve powers of
Secretary of
State</div><a name="09061777000352"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed, </i>That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09061777000353"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000879"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> We have expressed suspicion about the Secretary
of State having reserve powers, but clause 76 is the heart
of the matter. In effect, it says, &#147;If you don&#146;t get on
and do it, we will impose a strategy or a significant revision to a
strategy.&#148; I have concerns about that. Once again, I would like
to hear the Minister&#146;s clarification of the purpose of the
clause and her explanation of the circumstances in which it might be
used.</div>
<a name="09061777000354"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000880"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Clause 76 sets out the Secretary of
State&#146;s reserve power to revise a regional strategy, in whole or
in part, where the responsible regional authority has failed to do so
at the time specified in regulations or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div>directions. The clause also makes a saving provision for any steps
already carried out in relation to a revision of an existing regional
spatial or economic strategy at the time that the clause is
commenced.</div>
<a name="09061777000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the hon. Member for North Cornwall will probably not agree with what I
am about to say, but we do not believe that the powers afforded to the
Secretary of State are excessive. Indeed, the Secretary of
State&#146;s powers in this part of the Bill are broadly similar to
those in the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 and the
Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. The only wholly new powers
are in relation to the leaders&#146; boards, but that is because the
mechanism is a new
one.</div><a name="09061777000356"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="09061777000357"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000881"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> Will the Minister explain subsection
(6), which
states:</div><a name="09061777000610"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the Secretary of State thinks it necessary or expedient to do so the
Secretary of State may at any time revoke all or any part of a regional
strategy&#148;?</div><a name="09061777000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Expedient&#148;
is an interesting word, and although it might be customary in such
cases, it seems a little wide-ranging. To revoke all or any of a
regional strategy is the nuclear option. We have a whole Bill about
consultation and involving people, but this tiny little subsection
effectively says that if the Secretary of State does not like it, we
can rewrite the whole thing at a moment&#146;s notice. That is a
problem.</div><a name="09061777000359"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000882"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Again, I can assure the hon. Gentleman&#151;I
suspect that he will greet this with hollow laughter&#151;that we
intend that the Government will use reserve powers sparingly and as a
last resort. I do mean that. Obviously the word
&#147;expedient&#148; implies that there would be extremely good
reasons for doing so. I must emphasise that the Government have taken
enormous steps to devolve power to regional authorities. It is not the
Government who, throughout the course of the Bill, have voted against
the ability to draw up regional strategies and for there to be
democratic accountability through the leaders&#146; board.</div>
<a name="09061777000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
see the strategies working effectively. There is no reason why they
should not, because we believe that this is a good way to deliver
economic prosperity and improve competitiveness in the regions. The
principle here is that things have to be done at regional level. The
circumstances in which the Secretary of State would wish to intervene
in such a way would necessarily be as a last resort, and we believe it
is important to have these powers as that last
resort.</div>
<a name="09061777000361"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000883"></a>Mr.
Lilley:</b> Will the Minister elaborate a little on a point
that I think she made: the reserve powers here are similar to existing
powers. As far as I can see, the reserve powers here allow the Minister
to revise a regional strategy only if the relevant authority has not
done so. I get the impression that, at present, the Secretary of State
can revise a regional strategy, even if the regional body has itself
revised it. Perhaps she will acquaint me with what the change in the
Bill is, or what the existing legislation
is.</div><a name="09061777000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will give the Minister a case in point. The regional spatial strategy
covering Milton Keynes to Luton was prepared, revising the existing
strategy, and published.  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column199" />Column number: 199</div>Naturally it did not include Hertfordshire because that is not part of
the area. The relevant councils then decided to revise it and to
include among their preferred areas of development parts of north
Hertfordshire that had not been in the existing area. Indeed, they held
a meeting with the developers proposing to build in my area with Luton
council. People from her Department were there, although I do not blame
her because she was not in the Department at the time. This secret
meeting was held without inviting North Hertfordshire district council,
in whose area they were planning to
build.</div><a name="09061777000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
the Minister saying that the councils were acting outwith their powers?
This clause would not give them such powers. Will there be an
improvement on the present situation in such circumstances? Will the
clause prevent the Secretary of State from getting into bed with local
authorities that are re-revising their strategy after they have been
through all the
consultation?</div><a name="09061777000364"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000884"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> Will the right hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="09061777000365"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000885"></a>Mr.
Lilley:</b> I give way to the defender of the
indefensible.</div><a name="09061777000366"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000886"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. I
simply refer him back to clause 75, which we approved a moment ago and
provides for the circumstances about which he is concerned. Clause 76
simply makes provision for a failure by the responsible regional body
to come forward with a regional strategy. In such circumstances, the
Secretary of State has to act because of the failure of the regional

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000887"></a>Mr.
Lilley:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is correct. I intended to
catch the Chairman&#146;s eye on the previous clause, but I am having
to try to relate my remarks to this clause instead. His point is well
made and well taken, and I withdraw my epithet. None the less, a
question still arises: does the clause significantly change the
Secretary of State&#146;s powers to intervene in the kind of
circumstances that I
described?</div><a name="09061777000369"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000888"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Let me set out the range of the powers in the
clause. There are powers that enable the Secretary of State to give a
steer to the regional authority through guidance and regulations,
powers that relate to the Secretary of State&#146;s role and
responsibilities at specific stages of the strategy-making process, and
reserve powers as a fall-back. As I said earlier, there are existing
reserve powers in respect of the preparation of regional spatial
strategies. The Secretary of State has not had to resort to them, so
obviously did not on the occasion that the right hon. Member for
Hitchin and Harpenden mentioned. These wholly new powers apply to the
leaders&#146; board, which is a newly constituted
organisation.</div><a name="09061777000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
it is difficult for me to comment on the case to which the right hon.
Gentleman refers. If he wants to write to me about the circumstances, I
am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div>more than happy to have a look at it. However, as I said, the existing
powers are in section 10 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act
2004.</div><a name="09061777000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think that the powers set out in this clause would be used
excessively because, as I tried to explain, that is not what we want.
We want regional strategies to be drawn up, but we need a reserve power
in case it is necessary to attend to exceptional
circumstances.</div><a name="09061777000372"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000951"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> We are on the home stretch, Mr.
Illsley.</div><a name="09061777000455"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposals could be designated as the Local Government Association new
clause and amendment. They arise from the delegation of powers from
RDAs to local authorities, which is important, and flow from discussion
and consultation on the sub-national review, which we have mentioned.
The Minister often prays in aid the panjandrums of the LGA. We are
grateful for their leadership in local government, but they do not
always agree with the Minister and the Government. On RDA delegation,
the briefing that the LGA provided on Second Reading specifically
stated:</div><a name="09061777000611"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is disappointing that despite the Government&#146;s assertions that
the Bill is designed to empower communities there has been no movement
to allow elected councils to have increased powers and funds to effect
real difference in their local areas, particularly during the
recession.&#148;</div><a name="09061777000456"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
LGA makes a number of key points in support of the new clause&#151;I
referred to this when we talked about regional government generally,
but it nevertheless merits repetition. Its research showed that
although there is a national
economy,</div><a name="09061777000612"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there
is no evidence that the current Government office boundaries define
&#145;regional&#146; economies. Below the national level, markets
for goods and
services&#148;</div><a name="09061777000457"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
so
on</div><a name="09061777000613"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;operate
at sub-region and city region level.&#148;</div>
<a name="09061777000458"></a><div class="hs_Para">The LGA also makes the
point that there are</div>
<a name="09061777000614"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;roughly 50
&#145;sub national&#146; functional economic areas in
England&#148;</div><a name="09061777000459"></a><div class="hs_Para">alone,
and
states:</div><a name="09061777000615"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Many
decisions...need to be taken at sub-regional, rather than regional
level...Our most recent research focuses on the differential
effects that the current recession is likely to have on local
economies. The research suggests that in the current economic climate
it is more important, not less, to delegate decision-making and funding
to the level at which it can most effectively be
deployed.&#148;</div><a name="09061777000460"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
point was also made in the Lords. The LGA specifically mentions what
the Select Committee on Business and Enterprise has said about the need
to delegate functions. There has been some debate and contention about
whether it is necessary to be exact in specifying all the functions and
responsibilities for funding that could be delegated to local
authorities.</div>

Goodman:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that despite all the
Divisions, we now have a chance to achieve consensus on this matter?
Were the Minister minded to look favourably on the amendment, we would
be able  to look favourably on clause 85, which sets up the
bare 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div>bones of economic prosperity boards, leaving aside all the other clauses
that give her a lot of centralising power. In that way, the Government
would have the boards, the LGA would have its amendment and everyone
would be happy.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000954"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I am not entirely sure whether I would call
my remarks a peroration, but I hope that they add something to the
debate this evening. I would like to return to a comment that I made
earlier today about drawing a distinction. Although I should say at the
outset that we broadly support what the amendment and the new clause
seek to achieve, it is important to draw the distinction between
delegating functions and devolving decisions. If anything, we would
like the proposals to go further and not only pass down functions to a
lower level, but give greater discretion in the decisions that are
taken, not simply delivering Government policy at a lower
level.</div>
<a name="09061777000466"></a><div class="hs_Para">I like the
fact that the amendment and the new clause provide us with probably the
only opportunity in the discussion so far to talk about devolution and
the delegation of functions as a process rather than simply an event.
Many of the provisions about petitions involve setting up not only an
immovable structure that will be exactly the same in the future but the
framework through which it will be necessary to view all future events.
There should be a process. Every six months, there should be reviews to
discover what else could be passed down. That is another aspect that
gives the proposals merits.</div>
<a name="09061777000467"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman called my hon. Friend and myself Cornish crusaders. I would
like to think that the Liberal Democrats are not crusading for
Cornwall, but across the country. May I be parochial for just a moment
to elucidate something that will be a great benefit? Although in
earlier debates, the Minister dismissed Cornwall&#146;s appetite for
some kind of greater representation and recognition as a region in its
own right, the proposals would, if the Government accepted them, give
people in Cornwall an opportunity to satisfy that appetite&#151;to
pass down decision making and the administration of important things
such as objective 1 funding and its successor programme, Convergence.
That would provide an opportunity to administer those funds at a much
more sensible level. At present, Convergence is administered at a
regional level, even though the resources are only available to people
in Cornwall. That seems to create a ridiculous situation: the
allocation of those funds and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 204</div>the decisions about which projects should go ahead are affected by other
problems that the RDA is experiencing. If those powers and resources
were devolved to Cornwall, it would make much more sense for those
decisions to be made there. That is a practical example of how the
proposals could make a real difference.</div>
<a name="09061777000468"></a><div class="hs_Para">I see nothing
controversial in the proposals. This is a good opportunity to
demonstrate that the Government are willing to engage in the process,
rather than simply produce a Bill. I hope that they will consider
supporting the
proposals.</div><a name="09061777000469"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000955"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I am sure that the LGA will be delighted to
know that it has now been called a panjandrum, or whatever phrase was
used by Opposition Members, who are excelling themselves today in
insults to local councillors. Labour Members are full of praise for the
work that councillors
do.</div><a name="09061777000470"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000956"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> Not parish councillors,
though.</div><a name="09061777000471"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000957"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Parish councillors have come in for further
abuse from some Opposition Members. However, we have been considering
how councillors can contribute at both local authority and regional
levels to increase economic prosperity in their
regions.</div><a name="09061777000472"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
key to our discussions on the new clause is the partnership work that
we envisage, regarding the regional development agencies&#146;
overall strategy, drawn up in consultation and discussion with the
leaders&#146; boards, which represent the local authorities. That
will ensure that RDAs and local authorities work together closely in
planning and implementing the regional strategy. We must also ensure
that local authorities&#146; economic strategies contribute to the
region&#146;s overall economic
prosperity.</div><a name="09061777000473"></a><div class="hs_Para">Financial
assistance could be given to local authorities. We could probably all
point to examples within our regions of how RDAs have worked very
closely with local authorities on such issues. However, RDA&#146;s
cannot delegate decision making on where finances are directed, and it
is important that RDAs retain the final accountability for funding
passed through them. I hope that I can offer the Opposition enough
comfort for them not press the amendment or the new clause. We want to
ensure close partnerships, and we certainly accept that, in some
instances, financial assistance might be given to local authorities.
However, we do not believe that it is right to delegate decision-making
powers, as set out in the amendment and new
clause.</div><a name="09061777000474"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777000958"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I thought that we would see the sinner repenting
over the new clause&#151;I was full of hope, but it is now dashed! We
had an opportunity to recognise the reality of the situation. The
Government have given a written commitment on this matter. Also, in its
submission to the sub-national review, One North East mentioned the
delegation of functions to, among other things, special purpose
vehicles, economic development companies and urban regeneration
companies. In practical terms, there is that recognition among
organisations such as the East Midlands Development Agency, which,
according to evidence that it gave, has devolved 43 per cent. of its
budget to local authorities. It would have been nice if the Government
had recognised that progress, following the sub-national review, and
formalised it by accepting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 205</div>our amendments, and I am sorry that the Minister has not done so. On
that basis, we cannot support the clause.</div>

and their
areas</div><a name="09061777000575"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09061777000576"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777001034"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair,
Mr. Illsley. We now move to part 6 of the Bill entitled
&#147;Economic prosperity boards and combined authorities&#148;. If
someone was to read clause 85 on its own, rather than together with the
other clauses governing conditions under which the proposed economic
prosperity boards should be set up, they might conclude that, on paper,
those boards look remarkably like the enterprise partnerships proposed
in our Green Paper, &#147;Control Shift&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div><a name="09061777000577"></a><div class="hs_Para">The conditions
set out in clause 85 are essentially inoffensive on their own, and it
would be out of order for me to delve too deeply into the other clauses
that relate to economic prosperity boards. However, given that we are
in the process of exploring those boards for the first time, it is
important to say something generally about the centralised restrictions
under which they will operate.</div>
<a name="09061777000578"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not go
through the clauses in detail as that would be premature, but they make
remarkable reading. The Secretary of State can establish the boards,
set their voting powers, membership and voting weight, decide who is on
them, dissolve or abolish them and revise their boundaries. Their
functions are described in clause 88 only in the broadest
possible terms, and there is also a question about funds. In short, we
are where we have been often with the Bill, not so much with this
clause&#151;I concede&#151;but with many other clauses that relate
to economic prosperity boards. The great question is why so many of
those clauses have to be on the statute book at all.</div>
<a name="09061777000579"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we
discussed clause 80 and new clause 14, I thought that we had a chance
to reach a consensus and let the clause stand. I agree with the hon.
Member for Falmouth and Camborne that it was not perfect to have power
flowing down in that way rather than up, but it seemed that a
compromise was possible. Sadly, that was not to be.</div>
<a name="09061777000580"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
considering where the EPBs fit in to all the various schemes that have
been proposed. As we go through the Bill clause by clause, we see
Labour Members seeking ways to deal with the fact that elected regional
authorities did not turn out to be a runner. The only proposal to date
that went to the ballot box was defeated. The right hon. Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich said that that was not a vote against regional
development in general&#151;we will have to wait to read his memoirs
to find out what he meant&#151;but it was undoubtedly a defeat for
that scheme.</div>
<a name="09061777000581"></a><div class="hs_Para">When one
considers the various devices proposed by the Government in the Bill,
one can only conclude that, on the one hand, it is possible to have
elected regional government controlled by elected people&#151;not a
policy with which we agree and we have never thought that it would
work&#151;or, on the other, we can have the type of bottom-up
approach that we very nearly arrived at in new clause 14.</div>
<a name="09061777000582"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill has
a series of halfway houses that are extremely confusing. Alas, the
economic prosperity boards are a part of that. We have spent most of
the day debating the regional element of the Bill and the
leaders&#146; boards that ultimately will not have power over RDAs. I
await elucidation from the Minister, but it is far from clear to me how
the boards, which, as I have said, would have the potential to be an
enterprise partnership if clause 85 stood alone, are going to work in
conjunction with the regional structures that the Government have set
up elsewhere.</div>
<a name="09061777000583"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have messy
mechanisms: the stand-alone economic assessment; the multi-area
agreements, which we will discuss later; and the peculiar conjunction
of the regional structures that the Minister described. We also have,
on the one hand, the leaders&#146; board and, on the other, the
economic prosperity boards, which, one sees if one turns to a later
clause, will deal expressly with economic development and
regeneration.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div><a name="09061777000584"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777001035"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="09061777000585"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777001036"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> Ah, yes, the right hon. Gentleman has been very
energetic this
afternoon.</div><a name="09061777000586"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777001037"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> If I follow the hon. Gentleman, and he must
correct me if I do not, he is not opposed to economic prosperity boards
in principle, although he has expressed a lot of concerns about their
mechanics. Indeed, when we debated new clause 14, he indicated that
there might be a deal, and that if the Government accepted the new
clause, the Opposition would be happy to support all of this part of
the
Bill.</div><a name="09061777000587"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777001038"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b>
No.</div><a name="09061777000588"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777001039"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> Perhaps I got the hon. Gentleman wrong on that,
but he certainly has not suggested that he is opposed in principle to
the concept of the boards, simply that he has anxieties about some of
the details. Will he explain why the Opposition have not tabled a
single amendment to this part of the Bill? The only amendment that is
due to be debated has been tabled by two of my hon. Friends who,
unfortunately, are not members of the
Committee.</div><a name="09061777000589"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777001040"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> It is, indeed, unfortunate that they are not
members of the Committee, but that is a mystery on which only the Whips
can cast
light.</div><a name="09061777000590"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
our debates on the previous part of the Bill, I said that if the
Government had accepted the new clause, we would have had no problem
with clause 85 on its own, which simply sets out the basic framework.
The problem&#151;I am afraid that the right hon. Gentleman is going
to have to sit through this clause by clause&#151;is the highly
centralising power that nearly all the other clauses give to the
Secretary of State. They seem to us so wretched as to be incapable of
amendment.</div>
<a name="09061777000591"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
want to end on a point that will bring a little light and joy into the
life of the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich. If the
Minister can speak satisfactorily to this clause, which sets up the
bare bones of economic prosperity boards, we will consider not dividing
the Committee on it, which will be a rare occurrence in today&#146;s
proceedings.</div><a name="09061777000592"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061777001041"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I agree with a great deal of what the hon.
Gentleman said. We have debated how real regions could be formed by the
coming together of local authorities and the communities they represent
to constitute a region. From that point of view, this offer might be an
avenue for local authorities to come together and work in partnership
to deliver some aspects of regional policy.</div>
<a name="09061777000593"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
have also debated the Government&#146;s intentions on the wider issue
of regions. They feel that the current government boundaries are right,
and that is why I am not inclined to think that this is the start of
something more meaningful. This idea is very much confined to one set
of policies&#151;indeed, the name &#147;economic prosperity
board&#148; implies that it is confined to one, albeit important,
aspect of policy&#151;and it might conflict with the regional
arrangements that are to  be in place.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div><a name="09061777000594"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
duplication that the hon. Gentleman pointed out is a problem, as is the
potential for confusion in people&#146;s minds as to what an economic
prosperity board does, when set against the regional arrangements that
we have talked about. It would be far clearer to have a process that
worked towards having meaningful regions. However, we have debated that
and I shall not detain the Committee on it, although I still hold that
view.</div><a name="09061777000595"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to draw the Minister&#146;s attention to a few issues, the first
of which concerns a point that the right hon. Member for Skipton and
Ripon made. When we discussed regions, he pointed out how ludicrous it
is that the south-east&#151;taken together with the eastern region, I
suppose&#151;wraps around London, and he discussed whether it is
possible to have meaningful discussion about the economy of the
south-east, as it is currently constituted, without London being part
of it. Subsection (4) takes the approach that it would be impossible to
have that for an economic prosperity board, and that there could not be
one local authority in the middle that is not part of something that
goes around it. There is inconsistency in Government
policy.</div>
<a name="09061777000626"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div><a name="09061777000596"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the risk of showing my colours as a Cornish crusader, or whatever was
said about that earlier, I have a query about subsection (7), which
mentions &#147;county  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div>council&#148; and &#147;district council&#148;. Will the council
of the Isles of Scilly be covered by that measure and be able to
participate? Suppose that Cornwall wanted to take something forward; it
is now a unitary authority, and it might not have community interests
with Devon on some interests, but it might want to do some things with
the council of the Isles of
Scilly.</div><a name="09061777000597"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich said that the Opposition
have tabled no amendments, but one amendment is supported by a number
of Opposition names. It would leave the whole part out, and would mean
debating whether economic prosperity boards are worth having. I think
they could be, but only as part of a process that would take us towards
getting the real regions that we want and that would allow for the
bottom-up approach that we have debated in relation to other clauses.
However, I am convinced that the Government do not want to take that
approach, and that the boards are to be an extra body, alongside
regional arrangements. I have real concerns about whether EPBs will be
able to achieve what the Government want them to
achieve.</div><a name="09061777000598"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Ordered,
</i>That the debate be now adjourned.<i class="I">&#151;(Mr.
Watts.)</i></div><a name="09061777000627"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.1
pm</div><a name="09061777000599"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Adjourned
