<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Todd </B>(South Derbyshire): On a point of order, Mr. Malins. As I was not present on Tuesday for the sittings motion, I want to declare a notional interest. I own about four and a half acres of property that has a public footpath running across it. I derive no income from it, but it will be affected by the Bill.

Amendment moved [this day]: No. 86, in page 2, line 9, at end insert—

<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 92, in clause 2, page 2, line 24, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) he enters by means of a designated access point,'.<P>

<P>
No. 97, in schedule 2, page 40, line 6, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) leaves access land by means other than a designated access point,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): To assuage any concerns that the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) may have about not declaring an interest earlier, it has occurred to me that I have a non-declarable interest that I should like to mention. When I listed the various bodies to which I belong—there is no pecuniary interest; I acted in the spirit of openness—I forgot to include the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, which is also worried about the Bill.
<P>
Information about the control and management of access is central to the Bill. Although we will have an opportunity to discuss its impact on wildlife in subsequent debates, there is one aspect that should be highlighted now. Users of open country should be provided with information on what they might see when they walk across land so that there are no misunderstandings or serious actions taken.
<P>
The Game Conservancy has produced a chart outlining the main periods of gamekeeping activity on grouse moors. It is clear that there is significant activity during every month of the year. It is not, as the Minister implied, something that happens only on shooting days. Grouse moors are permanently managed. Trapping, fox control and heather burning, which occurs in March, April and October, could worry walkers who are not informed. The only way to ensure that such information is adequately provided is to position it where people enter open land. That is why access points are necessary.
<P>
Although Labour Members give short shrift to anything connected with gamekeeping or grouse shooting, studies show that there is a huge increase in other bird life on moors that are keepered. For example, there are three breeding pairs of curlews per 100 hectares on a keepered grouse moor and only 1.5 breeding pairs on an unkeepered moor. That is twice the number of breeding pairs on keepered moors. Those birds are not part of the shooting system but are beneficiaries of gamekeeping practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice </B>(Pendle): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Only if the hon. Gentleman is going to make a sensible comment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> Far be it from me to admit to such a thing, but do the figures include birds of prey? Documented evidence suggests that the population of hen harriers has fallen dramatically in the Forest of Bowland. There is anecdotal evidence that gamekeepers have been targeting birds of prey.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. I do not have the figures for birds of prey, but I am an avid reader of the type of document to which he refers. I know that there are concerns about that activity. Let me make it clear: birds of prey are protected in this country. No gamekeeper or landowner has any justification for killing them, and I would condemn them for breaking the law. There is a variety of opinion on the effect that they have on the number of grouse and other birds. The Langholm study, which was carried out by the Game Conservancy, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and other groups, produced mixed results. There was no positive conclusion that all the organisations could sign up to, which is a pity. As the law stands, there is no doubt that birds of prey are protected. My point relates to protected birds that are typical of moorland. The picture is similar for the curlew, lapwing and snipe.
<P>
My example illustrates the need to provide information for people who walk on moors. I hope that the Minister will agree that that should be provided at points of access. We can talk about the detail another time. However, if he does not agree, how does he anticipate informing people not only about their responsibilities and schedule 2 restrictions, but about the localised aspects, which will vary in each location?
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I feel a sense of inadequacy because, unlike the landowning classes on the Government Benches and the conservationists on the Opposition Benches, I have no interest to declare.
<P>
The amendments deal with an important aspect of the practical workings of the Bill. Amendment No. 86 is sensible. However, I am less convinced that it would be appropriate to make it an act of trespass if someone did not use a designated access point. The Bill's purpose is to provide access not only to people who are equipped with the best of maps and knowledge of how to read the circumstances of the countryside—the ``professional'' walker or rambler—who will have the wit and ability to find out about restrictions, but to the general public. They will also want access to important areas of the country but, because of the many restrictions that will be imposed, they will need information about what they can do and when they can do it. They need to know where public access land stops and starts, and when it is closed for a purpose. I am at a loss to understand how that would happen. As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) said, it is impossible to envisage how the general public will know that unless there is a process of signage, which requires a recommended point of access. Otherwise, the countryside will be littered with notices posted on every farm gate, and that is profoundly to be deplored.
<P>
Bodies that manage our best landscapes have to cope with countryside access. I used to sit on the Exmoor national park committee. Clear signs to show when one entered the park, and the provision of information on recommended access points to Exmoor, caused some difficulties, but there were also benefits. Such signs do not have to be an expensive business, as simple way-marks located at the point of entry to indicate that one is entering access land are often all that is needed. Unless the map that is drawn up for such purposes defines points of access, there is no way of knowing where the signs should be located or how the arrangements can be policed. There is an ancillary argument about whether the resources that the Government are making available to countryside bodies, national parks authorities, local authorities or individual landowners are sufficient to meet the requirements involved in making the Bill work adequately. However, that is a separate matter and must be addressed later during our consideration of the Bill.
<P>
What matters is that people who want to walk on access land know where they can enter that land, where it starts and what they are allowed to do while they are there. I cannot envisage a mechanism that will prevent people from unwittingly breaking the law and becoming trespassers if such information is not available. Perhaps the Under-Secretary can envisage an alternative mechanism. The proposed arrangements would help to protect the countryside and its habitat and would benefit people who own or farm the land and who have to advise people. Mostly, however, it is intended for the benefit of the people who want to visit the land. The Bill currently contains a glaring deficiency, which the amendment would address by ensuring that designated access points were shown on the map. If the Under-Secretary is not disposed to agree to the amendment, will he suggest another mechanism that would stop people becoming unwitting trespassers and would operate in the context of the provisions set out in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): The democratic will of the large majority of hon. Members is that the Bill should be enacted. The purpose of the Committee is to see how it can be improved and made to work better. I echo the sensible comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire and commend the measured way in which the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) approached the subject.
<P>
Having been brought up in the countryside and having lived there all my life, I believe that it is eminently sensible to introduce designated access points. During the previous parliamentary Session, I was glad to have the opportunity to visit a number of our national parks with the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs. The visits demonstrated that if one did not go to the places where the majority of walkers started off and obtained the information that was available there, one could easily get lost and perhaps encounter considerable dangers. Many of the areas in question contain downland, moorland and mountains and are dangerous even in the summer, let alone in winter. Unless designated access points are specified, the number of walkers who get lost or into other difficulties will increase and the task of the rescue services that have to find them will be made more difficult.
<P>
The amendment would benefit walkers, farmers and landowners, mostly through the provision of information at access points. A considerable amount of information can be supplied, not only about safety, but about the interesting places to walk. Unless people bother to read up about the area that they are visiting, they could miss the interesting features that they have come to see, whether they are geographic features or natural features. At particular times of year, it will not be sensible to walk in some places because birds are nesting or because certain farming operations are being carried out. Access to our great national parks and other areas could be made more sensible if everyone exercised a little sense and took a detour rather than walking in certain places.
<P>
I come from an area of the Cotswolds where there are miles of dry stone walls. They are a very welcome feature of the landscape, considerably enhancing it, but are expensive to maintain. It would make sense if people stuck to designated stiles over the walls, rather than trying to climb them indiscriminately at other points. The soft Cotswold stone is easily crumbled; it is easy to damage the walls by climbing over them at unsuitable places.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The tenor of the Bill is not only improved access to the countryside but improved protection of some of our precious and most rare wildlife. Again, it would seem that the prime purpose could be defeated unless there were access points with proper information. How might people entering a national park containing sites of special scientific interest otherwise know where they were? They might blunder into an SSSI and do huge damage without realising what they were walking over. The measure seems totally pragmatic and would only enhance the Bill. Unless we have designated access points on maps, many problems will occur.
<P>
Many people visit our national parks to walk, and that involves many cars. By and large, it is better if cars are parked in designated car parks. When I visited some of the parks, I found that many of the roads were narrow and twisty. If cars are parked all over the place, access to the parks for buses, which we wish to encourage, will become more difficult. On a summer's day, it will be impossible for buses to enter some places. I hope that the Minister will consider the sensible and practical amendment. If he will not, I hope that he will explain the way in which the difficulties that I and my hon. Friends have raised will be dealt with.

<P>

<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): The amendment moves to the heart of the Bill, addressing the means by which we want walkers and others to enjoy the countryside. The Government know well that the Opposition have argued in favour of sensible managed access for many years. We have accepted that we have lost the argument—the right to roam will be introduced because the Government have a substantial majority. As my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said, the important point for the Committee to consider is making the right to roam work as well as possible, despite our fundamental reservations.
<P>
Providing properly arranged designated access points seems central to the issue. I should touch on a couple of points that hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome did not raise. I was struck by a good quote in the standard letter on the Bill from the National Farmers Union that, I dare say, all members of the Committee were sent. It said that the Bill went ``some way'' to balancing the interests of walkers and farmers, but that it appeared
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to be stronger and clearer on spelling out the duties of owners and occupiers of land than it is on the responsibilities of walkers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
By stipulating the way in which designated access points would work, the amendment would go some way towards rebalancing those parties' interests. First, surveys show that most walkers—90 per cent., I think—seek circular routes along clearly marked tracks within a mile or two of their house. The exceptions are the many people who take longer hikes across the countryside, but they constitute a small percentage of the total.
<P>
I know from personal experience—I do a lot of hill walking in Scotland in particular—that even those who venture on to mountains and moorlands, whom the Bill is designed to accommodate, prefer to walk on a track. They do not necessarily want to walk across the heather because, apart from anything else, it is much more difficult to walk on, although one can enjoy the scenery and the atmosphere. So although people will have the right to go wherever they wish across moorland, it seems sensible to encourage them to stick to relatively clear tracks. One of the Bill's aims is to encourage greater access to the countryside for the disabled, which could be done by providing gates, clearly marked spots and clearly marked tracks. It seems unlikely that someone in a wheelchair would want to trudge across the more rugged heather lands.
<P>
We are encouraging easy and convenient access to the countryside and the use of particular tracks and routes. That will have benefits for walkers, who can be encouraged to go to areas that have the best views and where they can see the most interesting wildlife, as well as for landowners. There will be less risk to the walkers because the track will take them along relatively safe routes, which means that there will also be less risk of damage to property.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) mentioned Cotswold stone walls. I would claim that my constituency is in the Cotswolds, although doubtless he will say that it is peripheral to the Cotswolds. None the less, there are many Cotswold stone walls in my constituency. I played a part in the recent study by the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs of field boundaries, which emphasised the risk to dry stone walls both in the north of England and in the Cotswolds. Unless we find some way of giving people properly managed access points, the risk of damaging dry stone walls, Cotswold stone walls and farmers' ordinary fences is considerable.
<P>
The Bill stipulates times of the year when access will not be available to walkers. We believe that the period of 28 days, in addition to the management period, is insufficient, although we welcome the fact that the matter is included in the Bill and look forward to discussing the relevant provisions at a later stage. However, there is no point including provisions on the exclusion of walkers during certain times of year unless there is some mechanism by which to exclude them. That is the central problem of not having designated access points.
<P>
Some moorlands—I can think of one in Scotland, but I am sure that there are others in Northumberland, Yorkshire, Wales and elsewhere cover tens of thousands of acres, so there could potentially be thousands of designated access points, especially if the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) has his way. In those circumstances, there is no way that the landowner, local access forums or anyone else could possibly pass on the information that walkers need.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire mentioned deer stalking, but the same applies to shooting of all kinds and a variety of farming activities. It would be dangerous for walkers not to know that those activities were taking place. The only way that walkers could know would be if there were a notice on the path. It is not possible to inform them by putting a notice in the local paper because they might not read the local paper and it cannot be done by putting up a notice up in the town hall; it cannot be done by putting a fence around the land because most of the areas are very large and it would probably spoil the land. The only way to exclude walkers for the periods specified in the Bill is to put up a notice saying: ``You are not permitted to enter this land between the 1 March and 28 March,'' or whatever it might be. One cannot have notices without proper access points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I meant to raise in my speech the point that the Bill is surely intended, if possible, to reduce the tension between walkers and those who make their living or get their recreation from the countryside. Without access points, conflict could be considerably increased.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> That is precisely right. Walkers will enjoy themselves less, because they will do things that are not allowed by walking on land during excluded periods, and landowners will suffer significant stress and hardship as a result. Tension between them will increase rather than decrease.
<P>
One way of addressing the problem would be to establish properly managed access points, as has been described. Another pretty good example of possible approaches, which was, I think, mentioned earlier, is the way in which access to Ministry of Defence land is now managed. The previous Government passed a law encouraging access to Ministry of Defence land for recreational purposes. Now people can walk, ride or do whatever else they want to do on more or less all MOD land, apart from the impact areas and other particularly dangerous areas.
<P>
A small number of access points—redettes, in military language—are used. They have gates, soldiers in charge when, for example, the range is live, and fences that go down across the road. When the barrier is down, people cannot enter the range, and when it is up they can. There are also flagpoles at the redettes. When the red flag is flying one may not enter, and when it is down, one may. That is proper management of access. The message it gives is that people are welcome on Salisbury plain and may by all means go to see the stone curlews—without disturbing them. They may go to Otterburn or to the Welsh mountains, but not when they are being used to fire live, because people who do that will die. The way to stop people doing it is a barrier across the road. It is reasonable that people will not want to go on to Salisbury plain while the barrier is down or the red flag flying.
<P>
Unfortunately, the sensible, commonsense way that access to Ministry of Defence land has been managed for many years is not adopted in the Bill. There will be no mechanism to tell walkers that it is dangerous to walk over a grouse moor because of shooting. Walkers will not know about that unless they have taken precautions in advance, by consulting the local paper or the local forum.
<P>
The next question that arises was highlighted in the intervention by the hon. Member for Pendle, the very absurdity of which was perhaps useful. He suggested an access point every 10 ft, although he might as well have said 10 in. It was a useful intervention in that we need—and perhaps the Government will agree to—detailed discussion of the number of access points available. The answer is of course that that will vary from place to place. There would be no point in setting an interval of 10 ft for the Yorkshire moors, which cover tens of thousands of acres. There would be hundreds of them. By contrast, I think we discovered last week that Clapham common will be covered by the Bill; I may be wrong about that. It might be sensible to provide many access points for small areas of land in the south to which many people want entry.
<P>
The Under-Secretary wrinkles his nose; I have perhaps chosen a bad example. My point was that in the south of England where many people want to access land, and where there are several possible places to do that, it might be sensible to provide more access points than for bigger areas where control would be more difficult. They would require small access points, at the road, the car park, the view point or the notices about scenic views. Probably the bigger the area, the fewer access points would be appropriate.
<P>
It should not be the Government, but local people—the local access forums— who decide about the access points. They should have the right to assess the land and decide that it would be logical to put an access point on a particular road or over a particular fence and to ask the landowner to build a proper stile. At the moment they do not have that right. Local bodies, including local access forums, local landowners, local walking groups and local rambling associations are unable to arrange proper access points of the sort that we have described. I therefore ask the Government to think again about the merits of properly organised access points, and about the upsides for walkers as well as for landowners.
<P>
The Under-Secretary might want to respond to this point at a later stage, but the Government should consider how such access points should be managed. Should they be like the MoD access points on Salisbury plain, with vedettes and red flags, or should they be every 10 ft, as suggested by the hon. Member for Pendle? How else could they be organised, or should the matter be left entirely to local access forums? Those are important points. If the Bill makes no stipulation about access, it will be unworkable.

<P>

<B>Miss Anne McIntosh </B>(Vale of York): The amendment goes to the heart of the Bill. It is a rather serious omission that the Bill contains no reference to designated access points. As has been said, we are here to improve the Bill and to try to reduce the potential conflicts that might result from its implementation and application. I welcome the amendment, as it would correct a serious omission. It would also help those who need access to know what is access land and what differentiates that from land that is not access land.
<P>
My constituency includes only a small part of the North York Moors national park. The Vale of York is rather flat, as its name suggests; it does not include any of the moors, only a small part of the national park. The first parliamentary seat that I fought was Workington in Cumbria, which includes part of the northern lake district. That area includes part of the original John Peel hunt, and when I was a candidate for that seat, I became an aficionado of the hunt.
<P>
I have received a letter from the national park officer of the Lake District national park authority on the subject of access. He writes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This is a very important piece of legislation but you may not be aware that parts of it will have a significant impact upon the Lake District National Park. We have had long experience of managing de facto public access over much of the National Park and are having to deal with a material increase in the use of recreational 4x4 vehicles.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I believe that the Under-Secretary will be minded to accept the amendment, but if for any bizarre reason he is not, the policing of the Bill's provisions, particularly in the national parks of north Yorkshire and the lake district—[Interruption.] It seems that a lake district informant is now speaking to the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mrs. Brinton) to inform her of the seriousness of this point.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Helen Brinton </B>(Peterborough): I am aware of the hon. Lady's seriousness, which is why I was so swift to stop my pager. I know that Conservative Members, too, have pagers, and I hope that, when I speak in Committee, the hon. Lady will do the same.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Pagers should, of course, not be audible.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I assure the Committee that I am online and on-message; I do not need a pager to remind me what to say.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will respond positively and that the Government will adopt the amendment. The national parks are aware of the material increase in the use of recreational 4x4 vehicles. I should like to speak later about the impact of the use of such vehicles at night, but it would not be appropriate to make such comments now, so I shall confine my remarks to 4x4 vehicle access during daylight hours.
<P>
If the Under-Secretary is not minded to accept the amendment, how will he enable national park officers to police the new arrangements introduced by the Bill and to inform users of the designated access points to access land? Clearly designated access points might deter people from climbing walls and fences, especially when a gate is only 50 m away. Other hon. Members have mentioned the problems involved in such activities. The amendment would help the Government by reducing the likelihood of injury or damage being caused by climbing walls and fences. If it could prevent such injury or damage, there would be one less source of conflict and fewer potential claims against parties such as national parks officers.
<P>
I shall reserve my other points for our discussion of amendments dealing with night access.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> We have had a sensible debate in which the difference between the Government and other parties might not be as great as some hon. Members imagine. The Government recognise the importance of many of the points made about the desirability of access points and the need to encourage them. The difference between us and other parties lies in whether access points- are made a condition of access, but I shall come to that in a moment.
<P>
When one hears descriptions of the horrors that lie in wait for unsuspecting walkers, one has to pinch oneself to recall that the type of access that is proposed is already available on millions of acres in Britain, some of which are situated in the constituency of the hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh). Such areas are accessed without any of the difficulties that have been described. Points were made about the north York moors, which come close to the hon. Lady's constituency, which do not have designated access points and which are also not so far from where I- live. A walker can set off from almost any location on them, and, as far as I know, none of the serious problems anticipated by some hon. Members have occurred in the North York Moors national park. I have no doubt that that is true of many of the other thousands of acres where open access is currently available.
<P>
However, I acknowledge the seriousness of some of the issues raised. For example, the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire spoke about walkers coming into contact with people engaged in hunting or culling deer, and I shall try to address some of those serious issues. The hon. Member for Cotswold said that walkers would cause damage to SSIs, but the main damage to SSIs is caused by farmers ploughing them up, not by people walking. There are problems with SSIs, but difficulties tend to be caused more by landowners than by people seeking quiet enjoyment of the countryside.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Under-Secretary makes a contentious point. Let us imagine that he is right and that farmers cause damage to SSIs in the way that he describes. Such farmers are breaking the law. The Bill proposes that there should be a new means of causing damage to SSIs—walkers. It seems flawed logic merely to say that farmers break the law and cause such damage anyhow, so yet another means of disturbing SSIs will be found.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I was not really making that point, but it is true that we are not in favour of damage being done to SSIs, whether by landowners or anyone else.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lepper </B>(Brighton, Pavilion): In view of what my hon. Friend has just said, I remind him of an incident to which I have often referred in debates on this issue. At Offham down, near Lewes, it was walkers, concerned about the damage being done, who made public the fact that the farmer was ploughing up the SSI. I understand that the restoration programme is now almost complete.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am grateful for that example. It is possible that we know a little more about what happens in areas such as SSIs that have hitherto been closed to the public, the outcome will be beneficial. My hon. Friend gives an interesting example.
<P>
The idea of designated access points is a good one. There is not an enormous difference between us on this. Certainly, the Government wish to encourage the provision of relevant information and guidance. We support—as do the Countryside Agency and nearly all the other agencies involved—the provision of information points where people could go—and be advised to go—to find out about the access opportunities in an area, including any restrictions that may be imposed from time to time. The Countryside Agency is looking carefully at the idea along with other, off-site information sources such as the internet, telephone information services and local information outlets. Information points that are on the land concerned should be seen as only one—albeit an important one—means of getting information to the public.
<P>
The provision of information points would be helpful in managing access in the more popular areas, and I would expect such points to offer a means of entry on to access land. The Bill already provides powers in clauses 19 and 32 for local authorities to enter into agreements with landowners to construct means of access and to erect notices at access points. However, and here I come to the difference between us, such means of entry should not be mandatory. Were the legislation to require people to enter and leave by statutory access points, that would greatly reduce the opportunities provided by the legislation freely to wander across open country and registered common land. Such a requirement would be susceptible to abuse by those intent on frustrating the purpose of the legislation. Used restrictively, such a measure would greatly curtail the freedom provided by the new right and could in practice allow landowners to deny effective access to large areas of open country and common land. Such a requirement would also be impractical. It suggests that anyone gaining access to access land other than by a designated access point would become a trespasser. In many areas, this would be nonsense—for example, where, as is often the case, open moor runs alongside a highway.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire raised some important points about safety, and gave shooting as an example. There was some misunderstanding about that on Second Reading. I think that everybody now understands that landowners will be able to close land for 28 days without having to meet any conditions, or restrict access to particular routes. The Bill provides for further closures and restrictions on application for land management or safety reasons. We will need to ensure that there are effective ways of communicating to people when land is subject to closure or restrictions. That will depend in part on the nature and type of closure. The Countryside Agency is exploring various mechanisms, which could include physical signs, local guides, the internet and a telephone answer point. All those things are in use to a greater or lesser degree where access is already permitted. For example, deer and grouse are hunted on land crossed by rights of way without great difficulties. A modus vivendi has been worked out in such areas. I have walked along public rights of way that cross grouse moors and seen red flags up or come to a sign saying that one should not proceed because there was shooting that day. I have walked all around the Otterburn military range. I saw none of the cadets that the hon. Member for North Wiltshire seemed to think stood guard, but did see the odd red flag and heard the boom of the guns, which was sufficient.

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> ``Vedettes'', is a French word meaning ``gate''. ``Cadet'' is a young soldier.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I stand corrected—I had difficulty with the hon. Gentleman's rich rural accent.
<P>
As I was saying, I saw the odd red flag. There were no fences around large parts of the area. I walked all around the range and had no difficulty avoiding the guns—they are quite loud, apart from anything else. The military have been doing such things for a long time. A firing range crosses part of the coastal path close to where I live in Sunderland; the military just put up flags and people walk around the area. The problem is not difficult when one makes the effort.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> There is an oscillation in the Under-Secretary's argument between saying that having designated access points is a good idea, as is borne out in the national parks and in areas operated by the National Trust and others, and saying that the proposal is unnecessary. Not many members of the public will use the internet, telephone or whatever before going out to walk. When there is a closure, with a prospect of danger to people exercising what they believe to be their rights of access, whose responsibility is it to make them aware of a potential problem? Is the responsibility the landowner's, the countryside body's or their own? Where does the resource implication fall?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> A balance must be struck but, in the first analysis, it is the walker's business to make sure. Like others, I normally check when I go walking whether the area is open and whether there is a reason not to go. When going to Farndale, near the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Ms McCafferty), I usually check whether the daffodils are out. It can be done, and facilities already exist. Bodies such as the National Trust have extensive experience of people walking on their land. They provide voluntary key access points to help with effective management of access. There is no reason why others should not follow the example.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire mentioned mapping. We would certainly encourage countryside bodies to provide information about agreed access points to Ordnance Survey and to others, especially when agreement has been reached, as it can be under chapter III. That already happens on Ordnance Survey maps in respect of land under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, but the access points are non-statutory, which is the difference. We are at one on the desirability of access, of mapping and of ensuring that information is available. We disagree on making the provision of access points statutory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Under-Secretary is right on that, but is wrong on a particular point. Ministry of Defence access points are statutory—anyone walking on to British defence land other than through the vedettes may be removed by the Ministry of Defence police.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I did not see many police when I walked round the Otterburn military range. I used my common sense, which I found adequate for the purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We ought not get too bogged down in the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> It is not a matter of getting too bogged down—we are dealing with the law. The Under-Secretary might get round the law when he walks on the MOD range at Otterburn, but he is required, by law, to go through the proper access points. If he does not, the police may remove him. Saying that he does not see any policemen is as about as potent as saying that he drives down the M4 at 100 mph because there are never any speed cops. It remains against the law. We are discussing putting into the law the precise provision that already applies to Ministry of Defence estates. How can he pooh-pooh the idea in that way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The MOD has used Dartmoor, where there is no legal requirement to use access points. The system has worked perfectly well over a long period. We are looking for difficulties where none necessarily exist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I participated on an armed forces scheme with the Royal Air Force and visited RNAS Culdrose, which each year rescues dozens of people, many of whom are seriously injured, from Snowdon and elsewhere.
<P>
We are opening up a huge amount of dangerous mountain land to people who are less educated in countryside matters. I see the potential for innocent walkers getting into trouble as the danger is greatly increased. As other people will be listening to the Under-Secretary's reply to the debate, not least through the Pepper v. Hart mechanism, will he say that it should be an obligation on the countryside agencies and the mapping agencies at least to give an indication as to where the main information points will be for walkers in large areas where there are likely to be difficulties?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I fully expect that the countryside bodies will share with the mapping agencies information about access points and I encourage them to record the points for interested parties to see. There are many ways besides maps in which one can find out about access. In Scotland, there is de facto access to countryside.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> And people get into difficulties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes, they do, but not on the scale that the hon. Gentleman anticipates. People will always get into difficulties; but that is not a sufficiently strong reason for statutory access. However, there is not much of a difference between us on the desirability of information about access and of people using access points. It makes sense, especially for the many inexperienced walkers, to stick to designated access points, and I would certainly encourage them to do that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Vale of York referred to 4x4 vehicles. Part I is not about such vehicles—it is about walkers. The use of a motor vehicle off the road is an offence under the Road Traffic Act 1988. Only a couple of weeks ago, I encountered the problem of people using 4x4s off the road in North Yorkshire. The problem is often one of enforcement, but it is not relevant to this part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> How do walkers get to those areas if they do not go by 4x4 vehicles?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Most of the walkers that I know do not own such vehicles. The ones that I know who do own one tend to go no further than the Asda car park. It is possible to reach all sorts of access points on the north Yorkshire moors—an area familiar to both the hon. Lady and I—without a 4x4 vehicle. I am sure that she knows that and does not need me to go into any more detail.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> The point that I am trying to make, perhaps in a somewhat frivolous manner, is that the Minister identified a problem with 4x4 vehicles. I realise that those vehicles are covered by other legislation, but there is a plea from the national parks that they should be brought within the remit of the Bill, or at least excluded from night access.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> There might be an opportunity to discuss that in relation to another clause, but it does not relate to this part of the Bill.
<P>
People value the opportunity to explore more widely areas of beautiful countryside that have been off limits for generations, and I can see the benefits in encouraging people to go to particular points to pick up information. However, that is entirely different from forcing them to enter or leave land at what might be few or remote points. Unless there are legitimate reasons to restrict access—there are some, and they are provided for in the Bill—people should be able to enter and walk across access land. Therefore, I hope that the amendments will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I welcome the Minister's general approach, including taking seriously the points that we have raised, and I accept his remark that there is little difference between us on the issue. However, I fear that some of his arguments are seriously flawed. My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire said that we favoured managed access but that we had lost the argument. I would argue that we lost the vote, which is not synonymous with losing the argument. However, we accept that there will be freedom of access, and we are now considering the wider issue of how that should be managed in everyone's interests.
<P>
The Minister said that there might be too few access points, which might be remote or used by landowners as a means of restricting access to land, but I made it clear that we want to discuss the principle of the matter. We are not considering where the access points should be—I replied to the somewhat frivolous point raised by the hon. Member for Pendle—we are simply considering the principle. We can discuss the detail later. We shall consider the role of the local access forum in relation to the next group of amendments. I have never suggested that it should be up to the landowner to decide where the access points should be; the local access forum or the Countryside Agency could do that, but those are details and we are considering the principle.
<P>
The Minister said that that situation already exists in significant parts of the country, but the genesis of this part of the Bill is that, somewhere out there, there is demand for increased access. Therefore, one assumes that there will be a significant increase in the number of people walking and, as he suggested, many of them will be novices who lack information. Although I welcome the Minister's acknowledgement that they would be wise to start out from access points so that they are fully informed, I doubt whether they will. I have made it clear that I am all in favour of people walking in the countryside. The issue is not whether, but where they walk.
<P>
The Under-Secretary referred to his own experiences of walking. He said that he had been out walking in areas where people were shooting and had seen red flags and signs, but, excluding military activities, when there is a linear path—he used the phrase ``on a footpath''—the landowner or sporting tenant knows where to put the signs and red flags or where to post a man to say: ``Don't go over there for the next hour because we are shooting.''
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The freedom to roam means that walkers could emerge from any part of a territory and find themselves in the middle of a grouse drive or between a shooter and a red deer that was being stalked. There is no opportunity for the landowner or whoever is responsible to inform the walkers that a moor is out of bounds. Although the Under-Secretary said that he could always find that information, I do not understand where the average walker—which he might not be—would find or even think of finding information on deerstalking. In many areas, there is deerstalking nearly every day for about four months. Stalkers start with stags early in the season. The culling of hinds, which is prescribed by the Red Deer Commission in Scotland and other bodies in England—they determine how many have to be culled to keep the population under control—can take place nearly every day in November, December and January.
<P>
Walker safety is a serious issue. How will walkers be informed to stay away from an area on a particular day? I am concerned not about closure for 28 days, but about when in the calendar one of those days might occur. I want the Under-Secretary to respond to those important points. I would not dream of saying that he has not understood them, but he has not assuaged my concerns.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Hon. Members will find that the overwhelming majority of walkers will want to stick to existing rights of way and paths. No one enjoys being forced into bogs and diversions. There are many areas in which grouse shooting or deer hunting is managed alongside rights of access. In the Peak district, the national park authority and the owners satisfactorily manage closure of access land even though there is free access over the moors. That has been going on for a long time. It does not pose the problem that the hon. Gentleman envisages. The disagreement between us is not whether it is desirable for people to use access points and existing rights of way and paths, but whether that should be a condition of access and we are not willing to enforce that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's attempt to respond to my comments. There is good will between us. I accept his firm belief and agree that access is managed in some places, but unless the Bill will not significantly change the number of people who go out walking, which would negate its purpose, relying on what happens today is not necessarily the right approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that although the Under-Secretary cannot go all the way and accept that there should be designated access points, he would, nevertheless, underline his apparent enthusiasm for the idea of identified access if the countryside bodies or access authorities had a duty to identify access points during the mapping process? Indeed, that would be consistent with clauses 33 to 35, which make provision for places where there is a lack of access.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. Perhaps the Minister will reflect on that suggestion.
<P>
Several of my hon. Friends have said that this is one of the central features of the Bill, and that, to a large extent, its success or failure will depend on the provision of information. We may wish to return to the matter on report, perhaps along the lines suggested by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Some of the issues that have been mentioned in previous debates also arise in this group of amendments, but rather more starkly—particularly the safety of walkers. Amendment No. 87 would, broadly speaking, restrict the hours of access to daylight hours, although we wish to be reasonably flexible about the definition of daylight. Amendment No. 148, tabled by the hon. Member for Pendle, is about camping. Before speaking to that amendment, I shall listen to what he has to say.
<P>
We seek to strike a balance between safety and access. As with the previous group of amendments, both sides of the Committee may want to achieve the same ends, and there may be relatively small differences between us. One of the differences that may remain perhaps we can explore it—is to what degree one should be absolutist about rights of access. The thrust of our argument is that even if one supports a free statutory right of access to open land, it is possible to take a balanced view of when it should be allowed; the when is as important as the where.
<P>
To allow freedom of access everywhere, always, day and night, would be rather dogmatic. It would be more sensible and provide a greater balance of welfare if we restricted access to the hours of daylight and a certain time either side of it, as suggested in the amendment. The principle argument against that is that many thousands of people wish to enjoy roaming across the countryside at night. One is entitled to be a trifle sceptical about whether there is a vast, pent-up demand for access throughout the night. I am sure that many people will have enjoyed access to the countryside at night. I regret that mine usually involve long-lost student occasions that were fuelled by alcohol—precisely the sort of people who should not be allowed on open land late at night.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> My hon. Friend probably has not spotted that, under schedule 2, improper purposes are excluded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I was not aware that I had suggested that I was on open land for improper purposes, even as a student; it was probably unsafe for us to be there in the state that we were in. I move swiftly on.
<P>
A serious point must be made about safety. It is obvious that anything that may be slightly unsafe during the day is likely to be very unsafe at night. My hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire pointed out in relation to the previous group of amendments that one of the purposes of the Bill is presumably to encourage people who are inexperienced in the ways of the countryside and may be exploring it for the first time, to enjoy access. That would be a laudable effect of the Bill. Therefore, the argument is all the stronger that these people probably should not be encouraged to blunder around the countryside at night in places which may well be dangerous. This is a basic safety argument, which I hope the Minister can address.
<P>
<B>Mr. Huw Edwards </B>(Monmouth): Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that much of his argument is based on the presumption that people are fundamentally irresponsible? However, many of those who use the countryside are fundamentally responsible, including people night camping as part of the Duke of Edinburgh scheme or there in the hope of observing what are basically nocturnal animals. There is a presumption on the hon. Gentleman's part that the clause must be inserted because of people's fundamental irresponsibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman has said. He is right. The vast majority are responsible, however if he cannot accept my word, perhaps he will take the word of English Nature, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We believe the majority of walkers are responsible people who value wildlife and respect the countryside.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree with that. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However, statutory controls proposed in the Bill are extremely limited in relation to the small minority who will not accept the responsibilities which accompany the right of access.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are not my words; they are the words of English Nature and they are germane to this group of amendments. We are talking about a small minority who would be irresponsible; however, it is not unreasonable when considering such legislation to take into account what might happen to them.
<P>
The issue goes beyond people who may act irresponsibly. There will be public safety risks even for people who are experienced. The Committee will be aware that pest control activity often has to take place at night. Essentially, this involves shooting vermin at night. Foxes—I hesitate to mention the word ``fox'' in the Committee as some of the more somnolent Labour Members may wake up and become excited. They will be aware that if other means of controlling the fox population are no longer available, then operations such as lamping—shooting foxes at night—will become all the more necessary. The blood runs cold at the prospect of this occurring while there are people inadvertently and—as they would think—responsibly wandering across the land. There are serious practical safety points to be considered which the Bill fails to address. Indeed, the Bill is moderately incoherent in that it specifically rules out camping at night.
<P>
If we want people to be able to go camping at night—as the hon. Member for Pendle is about to tell us he does—the logical consequence is that we have to allow 24-hour access. However, the Bill does not permit that. I think the hon. Gentleman is wrong about this, but he has an arguable case. If we were to allow night camping, we would have to allow 24-hour access. However, since access is for the specific purpose of walking, night-time access seems to fall on the wrong side of the balance.
<P>
Again, there is the issue of a small irresponsible minority, which the Committee should legitimately recognise. That minority can politely be described as ill-intentioned: those who are on private land at night not for decent and good purposes of recreation, but for more nefarious reasons. It is transparently obvious that their lives will be made easier if they can legitimately say: ``I am hanging around on the edge of the curtilage of this building.'' I don't suppose they would use that kind of language, but that is effectively what they would be saying. They would say: ``That's all right, I'm just here having a quiet walk across the moor at night.''
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Borrow </B>(South Ribble): The hon. Gentleman claims that the Bill would create a problem, but the activities to which he refers are not perceived as a problem on land that is currently accessible. I have walked through the night across the north York moors and in the Yorkshire dales in the middle of the night. Problems or crimes caused by people being out at night have not been raised with me as a Member of Parliament in relation to areas of the open countryside that are currently accessible at night. What is different about the land that we propose to make accessible at night but which is not currently open?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> The short answer is that there is currently a problem. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, because just as I prayed in aid English Nature, I can now pray in aid the Association of Chief Police Officers. ACPO has said that it shares the concerns expressed by people who are anxious about night-time access and would support a change in the Bill to restrict access to daylight hours. The hon. Gentleman and I should defer to ACPO in this matter, as it will know the balance of risks in controlling criminal activities and the advantages if all-night access is allowed. If ACPO is against the measure, that should be good enough for the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman extend the proposed ban to land where open access is currently permitted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I would take advice from the police. The Under-Secretary seeks an inconsistency in my position, but I could refer to cliches about motes and beams. Night-time access to urban parks is not allowed, but the Government say that it is all right in rural areas. I suspect that a discussion of the matter would initiate a wider debate, which you, Mr. Malins, would no doubt curtail. Will the Under-Secretary explain why it is correct to restrict access to green land in urban areas but not to rural land? He is in danger of exposing his own inconsistencies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice:</B> I was unaware that access to urban parks was determined by legislation agreed to by Parliament. I thought that it was ordinarily a matter for bylaws, which are usually passed by local authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The fact is, however, that public parks are closed at night. I do not know whether the Government wish to end that practice, but the vast majority of public parks are closed at that time and the Government have made no proposals to change that. Why do they believe that what is right in towns is not right in the countryside? There may be arguments for their policy, but they have not advanced any of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> As there is lots of muttering from the Labour Benches, I should point out that the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee recently completed a study on town and country parks. One of the matters that we examined was the hours that they are open, and we concluded that most urban parks were closed overnight.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I participated in a debate in Westminster Hall on that report in which this point arose. The Government should get their ducks in a row before they pursue their current line of argument.
<P>
Apart from the safety and crime control considerations involved in the question of night-time closure, straightforward wildlife protection issues also arise. At night, people cannot see very far, so groundnesting birds are much more likely to be disturbed from their nests by people walking around and not knowing where they are or what they are doing. Such disturbance could potentially cause the loss of a brood. In response to the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards), I should point out that that could happen even with the most responsible walker, who is more likely to do something accidentally wrong at night than during the day. No matter how responsible a person might be, he could damage wildlife.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> It has been argued that people who walk during the day may spot something going wrong on a site of special scientific interest. The opposite applies at night when there is no one to spot fires that are accidentally started by walkers or stock that has been let out. Considerable damage can be done by morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. The reverse of the argument advanced, not unreasonably, by the hon. Member for Monmouth, applies.
<P>
It would be good for local authorities to use wardens to help to enforce the law and control the activities of walkers. Two facts are obvious. First, given the extra risks to walkers at night, it is all the more important to have someone on hand. Secondly, those local authorities that appoint wardens are unlikely to be able to afford to provide 24-hour cover. The vast majority of people who want access want it during daylight hours, which is when wardens will work. If there is an accident at night, such as someone tripping over and breaking an ankle—a small-scale accident—it is less likely that a warden will be on hand to help. Responsible local authorities might decide to cover that eventuality, which would be an added strain on their resources.
<P>
The amendments do not flatly say that there should be no access outside daylight hours. We suggest that ``hours of daylight'' should be defined as being an hour before sunrise and an hour after sunset. People who want to enjoy sunrise and sunset in open areas should be able to do so. No one would deny them that. Denmark has a comparable regime. It is more rigid than our proposed system, but it attempts to achieve a similar objective by permitting access between 7 am and sunset. However, we want to avoid such rigidity. People should be able to enjoy sunrise and sunset on the moors without being trespassers if they are there either side of those times.
<P>
The sum of the arguments is that there are a number of powerful reasons why access should be restricted to daylight hours. Some people will want to enjoy access at night, but the argument forcefully comes down in favour of restricting access to the hours of daylight. We hope that the Under-Secretary will take our considerations seriously.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> Amendment No. 157 is based on the same principle as the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green). It is a finely balanced argument; I hope that it will not be portrayed as a collision of absolutes.
<P>
I thought long and hard about the matter. My predisposition is that if we allow access to land, it should be freely open with the minimum of restrictions that are consistent with good management. I then thought long and hard about the balance of arguments on access during the hours of darkness. I, too, picked up on the inconsistency to which the hon. Member for Ashford drew attention—the fact that the Bill forbids camping at night. Camping would be a good reason for walking across a moor at night, as the hon. Member for Monmouth said in his intervention; he pointed out the merit in adventure training of being able to bivouac overnight. There would some logic in making night-time access available.
<P>
We must then ask ourselves what are the advantages and potential disadvantages for good management of the land in question of walkers being allowed unrestricted night-time access. The more that I thought about it, the more I realised that there would be a significant potential disadvantage for a minority of people; night-time walkers might abuse the freedom accorded them under the Bill.
<P>
The biggest problem is that that small minority—those with a nefarious intent who are on land under cover of darkness—would be free from proper challenge and that would create problems for the police, wardens and owners. It is not true to say that if access restrictions were placed on that class of land, there would be no access to the countryside at night. Not only is some land available and free from bylaws, but rights of way remain patent during the hours of darkness. There is nothing to stop people walking across a moor on a right of way at any time of night; they are perfectly within their rights to do so.
<P>
There will be some—I hope not many—who will be on the moor because they wish to steal eggs from a nest, which is contrary to environmental protection measures, or because they have some other intent that is contrary the law. No one will be able to ask them why they are there; those people will be exercising their right to be absolutely anywhere on that private land during the hours of darkness by virtue of the Bill.
<P>
I am not entirely satisfied; I share the concerns expressed by the Association of Chief Police Officers and by those who job it is to manage open spaces, such as wardens. The hon. Member for Ashford said that local authorities and others would not employ people to be on duty at night. That is not quite true; the Quantocks have a warden service and rangers patrol Exmoor; they certainly see it as part of their job to be around at night. Indeed, they consider it to be an important part of their job—mainly to protect wildlife—as many people would be happy to exploit the situation.
<P>
Having realised that a potential difficulty might exist, I wondered whether it could be mitigated without stopping people's legitimate enjoyment of open spaces at night. My opinion differs from that of the hon. Member for Ashford in that I want it to be made clear in the Bill that night-time walking should not be restricted, but only with the express permission of the owner, as provided in amendment No. 157. The hon. Gentleman's definition of darkness is far better than mine because it gives more latitude.
<P>

<P>
There are reasons why people may want to use open spaces at night, and they should be allowed to do so. The Bill should make provision for people to watch wildlife or take part in adventure training of one sort or another. However, there is a potential difficulty with creating a general right to be on any land at night without being subject to any inquiry as to one's purpose. That might seem a strange position for a Liberal to take, but I have been involved in policing and local authority land management, so I am concerned. We do not need to get too lurid about the consequences of night access, but it does create a potential difficulty. On balance, I am not persuaded of the need for unrestricted access at night, as opposed to managed access at night, which is suggested by amendment No. 157.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice:</B> I rise briefly to speak to amendment No. 148, which would allow camping in remote situations in association with an activity defined in clause 2(1).
<P>
Where are all the problems to which Opposition Members keep referring? If we consider the European experience, there are no restrictions on night-time access in France, Germany, Norway and Sweden. In Denmark, an example that is frequently cited, night access is restricted, but only on private land, not public land. I do not believe that there is a problem. ACPO might identify a problem, but that is just a group of chief constables. A report was published a couple of days ago in which chief constables argued for our drugs laws to be turned upside down. We hear what the police say, but there should not be a knee-jerk reaction to endorse the views of chief constables.
<P>
The amendment was inspired by my friends at the British Mountaineering Council. They spend all their leisure hours climbing mountains, so they have experience of these matters, to which we should give weight. They tell me that high-level and remote mountain camping and bivouacking are an integral part of mountaineering, but they also say that it can be essential, for safety reasons, to stay on the mountain. For example, if there is poor visibility, the cloud comes down and it is getting dark, the worst thing to do is to try to get off the mountain—otherwise their friends from RNAS Culdrose might have to clamber into helicopters to carry out a mountain rescue. That is a very important point. They also tell me that a few tents located in isolated areas have an insignificant impact on the environment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee how often the body that he seeks to represent has asked permission of the landowner to camp on land at night and been refused?
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> I have absolutely no idea. I am not entirely sure how germane that is. It may not be possible in remote areas to get to the mountain, climb it and get back down again between the hours of sunrise and sunset, even with the flexibility that the Opposition want to build in—an hour before sunrise and an hour after sunset. I checked with the Library this afternoon to find out the times of sunrise and sunset in Glasgow, which is close to mountains, on the shortest day of the year. I am sure that not many people will want to climb mountains on the shortest day of the year—it is 21 December—but sunrise is late at 8.44 am and sunset is early at 3.43 pm. That is six hours and 59 minutes of daylight. The further north one goes, the shorter the time of daylight.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I accept that it is colder on the east coast than the west coast, but is not the hon. Gentleman drawing attention to the fact that no one would want to walk after sunset near Glasgow at that time of year?
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> I would say that no one in their right mind would want to ski off piste, but the heir to the throne does so frequently. Mountaineers will have a problem doing what they want to do, which is to climb mountains, if the Bill is amended as suggested by the Opposition.
<P>
In recent years, we have seen the growing popularity of the long-distance challenge walk. In the Yorkshire dales, we have the three peaks race, in which people rush round trying to climb three mountains within 24 hours. They would be impossible if the Bill were amended. I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will take on board the concerns expressed by the British Mountaineering Council and others. I hope that the Government will consider amending the Bill as suggested in amendment No. 148.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> As we said during the debate on the previous group of amendments, this fundamentally bad provision will work only if a balance is struck between the legitimate interests of walkers who want access to the land and the very different interests of those who own it. That is a difficult balance to achieve. Any imbalance and the Bill will not achieve its purpose.
<P>
In that context, one must balance the advantages of leaving the access land open for 24 hours a day against the cost of doing so. I have yet to hear one convincing argument for leaving the land open—with the possible exception of some specialist groups, such as the mountaineers referred to by the hon. Member for Pendle. Other hon. Members have spoken about people wanting to observe animals who can be seen only at night. Anyone who knows about the subject will know that such animals—mostly foxes and badgers—usually inhabit deep undergrowth. The likelihood of seeing those animals on heathland at night is extremely remote. Some specialist naturalists with night-sight infra-red equipment might be able to observe such animals mating, but normal walkers or countrymen are unlikely to want to do that and would probably not be able to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend will recall that in the infamous article in The Guardian of a couple of days ago, the Ramblers Association was quoted as saying that people might want to go badger watching at night—a perfectly laudable thing to do. I raised that topic with the National Federation of Badger Groups later that day, which pointed out that the sort of land that we are talking about is not the sort of land where badgers live.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. The same applies largely to foxes, which tend to live in woodland. I do not accept that many people are desperate for access to land to which they currently do not have access simply to see animals. There may be a few such people, but they are very few and they would want such access only in special circumstances. I do not accept that normal people or families would want to walk across dangerous heathland at night. I cannot imagine wanting to do that; it seems a bizarre thing to do. Although one or two fanatics may enjoy stumbling around in the dark on moorland, it is hard to imagine such people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> What about people who want to observe the stars and need to get away from conurbations because of light pollution? Such people might want to observe the constellations in an area of tranquillity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, which brings me on to the issue that I was just about to raise. People who want to do anything sensible and normal in the countryside, such as taking one's girlfriend into an entirely black place to look at the stars—as the hon. Gentleman has doubtless often had to do—can do so on roads, tracks, rights of way and millions of other places—[Interruption.] I hear the suggestion that a lay-by would be more appropriate. Obviously, some of us have a slightly different approach.
<P>
Of course people should have access to the countryside. There is currently exactly the same access across tens of thousands of miles of rights of way and the Opposition are not suggesting that that should change. We are speaking only about night-time access to the land opened up by the Bill. Leaving aside some specialists, it is extraordinarily difficult to think of anybody who would want such access.
<P>
The hon. Member for Pendle mentioned one or two groups that might want night-time access. He referred to experienced mountaineers who want to climb mountains that require more than a one-day expedition. It is extremely difficult to think of any such mountain in England, although there are one or two in Wales. All of the hill climbing that I have done in Scotland—I have climbed most of the Munros at one time or another—has been on mountains that one can climb and return from in one day. It is hard to imagine any hill that could not be climbed in one day.
<P>
I accept that some ascents are more difficult than others and that some might take more than a day. However, even if there are such mountains, I am not certain that it is the Government's duty to encourage people to climb them. The activities involved are extremely specialist and dangerous operations; only professional mountaineers would undertake such climbs and go bivouacking up mountains. Such people currently have their own ways of achieving access to mountains and they form a group of only half a dozen or a dozen individuals in the United Kingdom. The rest of the Bill is aimed at providing access to land to a large number of people who currently do not have access. I do not believe that any of those people would want to bivouac up a mountain overnight. Even if they sought to do so, I am not at all certain whether the Government should encourage them. What happens if boy scouts think: ``I must go up mount whatever-it-is in the middle of the night because the Government say that it's all right to do so''? We should bear in mind the tragedy that might occur.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kevin Hughes </B>(Doncaster, North): How silly!
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Government Whip comments from a sedentary position that I am making a silly point, but I do not think that it is silly. [Interruption.] I am not certain whether parliamentary language—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must have missed that sedentary comment, and it is probably a good thing that I did so. I remind the Committee that sedentary interventions are generally to be discouraged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> There is no legitimate demand for the sort of access that we are discussing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The fact that the hon. Member for Pendle, who sought to represent the British Mountaineering Council, could not tell the Committee how many times a landowner had refused permission for requests for overnight camping suggests that there is no problem. If there is no problem, we should not seek to provide for one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. There is no problem; landowners are perfectly content to give the odd experienced mountaineer access to Snowdon, Glencoe or wherever else. The Bill is designed to help large numbers of ordinary people to achieve access. The hon. Member for Pendle spoke about people who ski off-piste and prayed in aid HRH the Prince of Wales. I am not sure whether the Government should encourage people to ski off-piste, which is a hazardous occupation. I do not know see why we should agree to a Bill that may damage landowners, wildlife and groundnesting birds in order to accommodate a small number of people who like to ski off-piste and bivouac up mountains, as those are specialist interests. We have heard from our hon. Friends about the problems that 24-hour access would create in respect of land management. The Government would be wise to take a lead from most local authorities, which, for good management reasons, choose to close public parks at night. They cannot be certain what will happen in the park over night, or what will happen to the plants and animals, so they close the gates. Even the park on the Embankment on the way to Lambeth bridge closes at seven o'clock for the sensible reason that it cannot be managed after that time. The Government should take a lead from the sensible approach of local authorities and also restrict access at night to access land.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>

<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> The Under-Secretary was kind enough to say that he was aware of the problem to which I referred in the Vale of York. It is a common problem in north Yorkshire at present. The concern I wish to raise in supporting amendment No. 87 is the fact that the police are warning that, without the amendment, the problem will be compounded. Perhaps I can explain the position. If I understood him correctly, the Under-Secretary said in summing up the Government's view in response to the last group of amendments that he thought there could be a problem with enforcement. At the moment in north Yorkshire, 4x4s and other vehicles with their lights blazing and one or two people inside are accessing public areas and even privately owned lands from the main road.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must remind the hon. Lady that part I of the Bill does not affect the position with respect to 4x4 or other vehicles. Schedule 2(1)(a) just defines the right of access for drivers of vehicles. The hon. Lady may be able to raise her concerns when we come to part II of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> In that case, I will restrict my comments to night-time access. However, the Under-Secretary was kind enough to raise the issue, so perhaps he will take this on board in at a later stage.
<P>
The police should have the Government's ear on this. They foresee problems with night-time access, that we believe would be eradicated if the Government accepted amendment No. 87. I wish to declare an interest in that I have spent a great deal of time in Denmark being half Danish and having studied at a Danish university. Contrary to what the hon. Member for Pendle says, the information I have gained from conversations with landowners in Denmark suggests that their provisions for night-time access work well. To put the hon. Member for Pendle's mind at rest, express consent could still be sought from the landowner for legitimate purposes. The change would not prevent any voluntary agreement between the landowner and those desiring such access to allow managed night-time access for specific purposes.
<P>
My particular concern, which other hon. Members have raised in moving the amendments, is that the new right which the Government are seeking to introduce and which the amendment seeks to exclude, could be used as a cover for unlawful activities including poaching—for its own sake or, as is often the case, as the prelude to burglary—and egg stealing. Therefore, for the reasons that I gave in supporting the last group of amendments, which I will not repeat, if the Government wish to have access with the least possible conflict, the Under-Secretary should support amendment No. 87.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas </B>(Clwyd, West): I shall speak briefly to amendment No. 148, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle. I must tell my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and the Committee that although I do not always agree with my hon. Friend, I see considerable strength in his argument. There are circumstances in which people who have travelled long distances while high mountain walking cannot get off a mountain safely and have to bivouac or camp. I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will give careful attention to what is a meritorious amendment and return to the subject on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> As the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said, the argument is finely balanced. There are no absolute rights or wrongs. The Government have tried hard to balance the interests of landowners with those of the wider public. Some of the concerns are sensible, and the Bill caters for them. Some, however, were exaggerated. People already have access to large parts of the country at night and that has not caused significant problems. Uncultivated land is usually miles from where most people live; it is mountain, moor, heath and down. The Bill contains safeguards to take account of genuinely held concerns about night-time access. For example, the right of access does not apply to buildings and their curtilages. If there is a reason to restrict night-time access, that can be done through local restrictions on access or byelaws, which happens with local authority parks.
<P>
The Bill provides the flexibility to deal with genuine problems at a local level without the need for a draconian blanket ban. Clause 22 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The relevant authority may by direction, on an application made by a person interested in any access land, exclude or restrict access to that land . . . if the authority are satisfied that the exclusion or restriction . . . is necessary for the purposes of the management of the land by the applicant.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the problems raised by Opposition Members are found to exist, the Bill allows for access to be excluded or limited.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> If there are no managed access points, how can we let people know that night-time access is banned? They might think that the law allows them to ramble at will over such categories of land. The Under-Secretary said that an order could be introduced to stop that, but how would we inform ramblers of that without there being managed access points?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Member for North Wiltshire brings me to my next point. A blanket ban would be unenforceable, as would managed access points. If we want the law to be taken seriously, it behoves us to ensure that we pass enforceable laws. Clause 22 addresses the legitimate concerns of Opposition Members. However, a blanket curfew across millions of acres is neither justified nor enforceable. That view is shared by the National Trust and other bodies that have extensive experience of night-time access.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Ashford said in his opening remarks, we are not dealing with a huge pent-up demand for night-time access. We do not face a great problem. Those who enjoy night-time access, for whatever reason, already do so in the millions of acres that are not restricted. It is unlikely that many more such people will suddenly spring to life; it is more likely that some of the same people will want to explore new territory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denis Murphy </B>(Wansbeck): Has my hon. Friend ever met the people described by the Opposition? It was said at the beginning of the debate that on the day after the Bill receives Royal Assent, an urban family will drive in a 4x4 to the Cotswolds, because that is where the softest stone is, park between the gateposts, climb over a wall and at all costs avoid the paths. They will wear designer gear and make a three or four foot-wide path over difficult terrain for several miles, carrying a canoe so that they can ford a stream. When they get there, they will sleep with the grouse, waiting until the morning to be shot at dawn. Has my hon. Friend ever known such a family?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> My hon. Friend makes his point forcefully. I shall not go so far as to say that such people do not exist, only that there are not many of them about.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I shall return to the here and now. The Under-Secretary prayed in aid clause 22 as the clause that would provide for closure under the suggested circumstances. I may be a little obtuse in my reading of that clause, but is he saying that the period could be specified as a particular time of day rather than part of the calendar year, or he is referring to another part of the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes, that is exactly what I am saying. If it turns out that there is a problem at night in a particular area—perhaps birds' nests being vandalised—it would be open to the owner to apply to the relevant authority for a night-time restriction. Indeed, should the damage occur also in the daytime, it would be possible to apply for total closure for as long as necessary, subject to the condition that the relevant authority—the national park authority, the Countryside Agency or the Countryside Council for Wales—would have to be convinced that is was necessary.
<P>
That problem can be dealt with under the existing provisions, which is why the amendments are not necessary. The question is whether it would be extremely difficult to enforce a total night-time curfew. It is true that access in Denmark is limited to daylight hours, but that is the only example that I can find. However, Denmark does not have many mountains. I once walked up its only mountain and it was not particularly high.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> Just in case the Under-Secretary has forgotten—I refer to the earlier comments of my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire—it is called the Mountain of Love.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I thank the hon. Lady for that stunning information. If I ever knew it, I have forgotten it.
<P>
Nocturnal restrictions are likely to be more appropriate on smaller tracts of enclosed land close to where people live—heathland and small commons. Such land tends to have limited access points, at which notice of restrictions can be posted. However, that would not be possible over huge tracts of moorland at night.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice:</B> The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire took delight in ridiculing the ramblers who suggested that people might go out at night to watch badgers. He may have had in mind mountain or moorland, but badgers are commonly observed on downland, which is also access land. The Minister might want to comment on that.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The Minister would not want to make too much of a meal of it because hon. Friend has made his point.
<P>
Amendment No. 148 is designed to allow camping in remote locations. I have much sympathy with my hon. Friend's arguments. Generally, we should not seek to restrict activities that do not cause damage. However, we cannot go as far as extending the new right to camping for reasons of which I am sure he is aware.
<P>
The Bill is a careful balance. As my hon. Friend knows, we have gone to great lengths to consult the relevant interests. The balance at which we have arrived, after that careful process of debate and discussion, is to give access to walkers. The day might come when we discover that general access to walkers has not had the terrible consequences that some imagined and a Government wish to go further. When landowners see that the measures do not have the consequences that many of them fear, they might be generous in allowing permission for camping. However, I am afraid that the Bill cannot do that. The new right that it gives is intended to provide for only the most modest forms of open-air recreation, principally walking. There is nothing to prevent someone wishing to camp or to participate in night-time activities, such as Duke of Edinburgh award expeditions on Dartmoor, to seek the landowner's permission. I am sure that, once a modus vivendi has been worked out between the landowners' and the general public's interest, it will become easier to get permission for such benign activities as my hon. Friend mentioned. However, the Bill is not the place for such a measure, so I am afraid that I must ask him to withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall start with the points made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, whose amendment is broadly sensible. He said that there were rangers at night on the Quantocks and that that was seen as a normal part of the enforcement and protection mechanism. That is true, but when we get a massive expansion of the area of land that must be covered by such services, it is all the less likely that local authorities or other bodies will have the means to meet the standards seen in places such as the Quantocks even if they have the will. The hon. Gentleman was generous enough to say that our definition of night time was better than his, so I shall reciprocate by saying that one of the improvements that would be made by his amendment concerns access by agreement and that managed access can always be available.
<P>
That deals with the point made by the hon. Member for Pendle. As has been clearly established, the activities that he seeks to encourage can always be made available by agreement with landowners and already are. His amendment deals with a problem that does not exist. I confess that I do not understand why the best example that he could adduce in favour was based on sunrise and sunset in Glasgow for a Bill devoted solely to England and Wales, which did not seem to be the strongest point he could have made in support of his argument. The Under-Secretary said that many of the problems that we have raised could be dealt with under clause 22. I simply observe that the purpose of our amendments is to prevent problems from arising in the first place. As it is conceivable that some of the problems might lead to people facing serious accidents, or even death, it would be desirable to anticipate the problems-that is, forestall them-in legislation, rather than to rely on the fact that we have included a provision elsewhere in the Bill to deal with the problems if they arise.
<P>
The Under-Secretary made one point with which I absolutely agree; we must pass law that is enforceable, and he concluded that a permanent night-time curfew would be difficult to enforce. It is not obvious to me that a standard, permanent curfew for a recognisable period is any more difficult to enforce than curfews that operate for certain times of year—28 days or more, for example—or at times that appear to outsiders to be random. A landowner will know when he wishes to close the land for two or three days' shooting, but that curfew will appear to be completely random to anyone who turns up to walk across the land.
<P>
If our aim is to pass law that is enforceable, then there are serious problems ahead with respect to other parts of the Bill. If it is generally known that people have the right to roam at day but not at night, that is a fairly simple law that most people would obey. The Under-Secretary and I agree that there is not an enormous pent-up demand among tens of thousands of people for night-time access, but if people know what the rules are, because they are standard and permanent, they are more likely to observe them. Other parts of the Bill provide for much more random restrictions than our amendments.
<P>
This is one of the most important points in the Bill, relating to safety and practicality, to which we hope to return at a later stage in our proceedings. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is an objection to withdrawal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice:</B> I listened carefully to what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said and was disappointed. I understand that the Bill is the product of extensive negotiations and a careful balancing act between competing interests. I thought that what I said, perhaps unusually, was common sense because there are safety considerations for mountaineers. Sometimes, it is impossible for them to do anything other than camp on a mountain, and the fact remains that they are reliant on the goodwill of individual landowners. I do not know how often consent is refused, but it is certainly an issue. We might need to return to that matter on Report. I was about to ask leave to withdraw the amendment—
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I should be grateful if the amendment were withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The amendment cannot be withdrawn as it has not been moved. We are considering the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Ashford, who sought leave to withdraw his amendment. The hon. Member for Pendle objected. He tabled amendment No. 148, which was grouped with amendment No. 87 for convenience, but a decision on that amendment will not be reached for a quite some time. Therefore, he does not have to ask leave to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Thank you, Mr. Malins. I wanted to increase the sum of human happiness by telling my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle that the Bill allows for camping to be removed at some future date from the list of restrictions contained in schedule 2 without the necessity for primary legislation to be made. That possibility always remains.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
