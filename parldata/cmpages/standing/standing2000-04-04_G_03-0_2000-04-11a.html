<B>Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I beg to move amendment No. 120, in page 44, line 17, leave out paragraph 18 and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. Each local board shall refer complaints to the Prisons Ombudsman.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 62, in page 44, line 18, leave out ``prescribed persons'' and insert ``any person''.
<P>
No. 63, in page 44, line 20, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2)(a) the Secretary of State shall appoint an independent person to determine any complaints made against a local board;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the complainant or the local board may appeal against the decision of the independent person to such tribunal as the Secretary of State shall appoint for the purpose of hearing appeals;
<P>
(c) the independent person or any tribunal appointed under subparagraphs (2)(a) or (2)(b) may be appointed in respect of more than one board.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Amendment No. 120 relates to paragraph 18 of the schedule, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Regulations may require each  board to make and publicise arrangements for dealing with complaints.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There should of course be a complaints system, but if that system is to have the public's confidence, it should be robust and seen to be independent of the organisation about which there has been a complaint. The amendment suggests that complaints should be referred to the prison ombudsman-a new ombudsman for the probation service should not be created-because that would help to place the probation system on a national footing and strengthen its links with the Prison Service. The position of a probation ombudsman does not currently exist-all complaints are dealt with internally. I should be interested to hear the Minister's response to our sensible suggestion.

<P>
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) will speak to amendments Nos. 62 and 63. We have no problem agreeing to amendment No. 62, which would widen the range of people who can make complaints, but I do not understand amendment No. 63, which is vague about who an independent person would be. I look forward to the hon. Gentleman's explanation of that matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): The hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) and I are thinking along similar lines. We also look forward to hearing the Minister's response to the amendments.

<P>
Amendment No. 63 involves the independent consideration of complaints. We understand why the Liberal Democrats suggested that an ombudsman should be used, but we are not convinced that the prisons ombudsman involves the right approach. The scope for an ombudsman in this context is clear. We hope that the amendment, which would ensure that complaints were considered independently, would persuade the Government of the need to involve a separate ombudsman or someone who has the role of an ombudsman.

<P>
We are not convinced that the approach involving the prisons ombudsman is appropriate-that position might be misunderstood. Different regimes will apply in relation to the new National Probation Service and prisons. We do not want a huge expansion of new officials but, if the Government agree to amendment No. 120 and involve the prisons ombudsman, that position might need to be renamed. I notice that the hon. Member for Taunton is nodding. If the official who is currently the prisons ombudsman also had that independent responsibility, the new position could be given a new title-perhaps the probation and prisons ombudsman, or something similar.

<P>
We want to be constructive in this regard. I hope that the Minister understands the spirit in which the amendments were tabled-the public will have more confidence in the system if they know that complaints will be considered independently-and that he and his officials will take the matter away, consider it and return on Report with Government amendments that contain the spirit of our amendments. The Government should accept that there is a need for independent consideration.

<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Taunton for saying that she is happy to support amendment No. 62. We want the Minister to explain who will be precribed persons-his explanation will be intersesting. It should be clear in schedule 1 that complaints may be received from anyone, and it is a cause of concern that the Government are saying that only prescribed persons may complain when it is not clear from the Bill who those prescribed persons will be. Whatever the Minister's explanation, based on advice from his officials as to what was intended, he would be wise accept our amendment and allow complaints to be accepted from anyone, perhaps with independent scrutiny to enable vexatious or frivolous complaints to be struck out.

<P>
We believe strongly that is is wrong to limit complaints because a variety of people may have complaints about the way in which the new system operates. They may not have official standing within the criminal justice system and could include people who suffer a crime committed by someone under one of the probation service orders. These are not merely probing amendments; they raise serious matters for consideration. I hope that the Minister will agree to consider them with his officials and perhaps table suitable Government amendments on Report or in another place.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I rise to support amendment No. 120, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton. It is important to have independent scrutiny of complaints. My hon. Friend will deal with the name to be given to complaints to the ombudsman, but the amendment is important not just for people on probation, but for the public. We need an independant system, not an in-house system. There have been problems in the past with in-house complaint systems. We need transparency, openness and greater acountability, and amendment No. 120 would provide that.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office </B>(Mr. Paul Boateng): A complaints procedure needs credibility and the capability to deliver remedies close to the ground where they will do most good-locally where the complaint arose. Our scheme envisages a strong local element. That is important for credibility and also for management, so that we do not create an unwieldy bureaucratic structure and we have a clear idea of who is given a locus. Offenders, prisoners and victims of crime have a direct interest in how the probation service operates. Local citizens and sentencers may have an indirect interest, and it is important to have appropriate channels for their views to be heard, but the complaints procedure is not the appropriate channel. The complaints procedure needs a clearly defined focus around the offender, prisoner and victim. The concerns of sentencers and those whose interest in the criminal justice system is wider than local law and order issues should be reflected in a wider forum.

<P>
I welcome this short debate, which has touched on some important issues, but I oppose the amendments. I oppose amendment No. 120 because, initially, complaints should be handled locally so that a local remedy can be delivered.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> If I may, I shall finish my point, and the hon. Lady can decide whether she is satisfied with my response.

<P>
There may be potential for an overview and an appeals system, and we are considering how that might best be delivered.

<P>
As I have said in this Committee, on Second Reading elsewhere, there will be ever-closer working relationships between prisons and the probation services, rather than a takeover of one by the other. In the view of the hon. Member for Taunton, that suggests that the prisons ombudsman might have a role to play. Consideration could be given to that, although I must again stress that the probation services' complaints function would not be taken over by prisons. Nevertheless, there is a clear synergy that may be worth exploring.

<P>
We oppose amendment No. 120 because it would remove the power to require boards to have their own complaints procedures. Boards should retain those procedures, but I understand and will reflect on the point made by the hon. Member for Taunton.

<P>
We have made it clear in relation to amendment No. 62 that the complaints system is intended to deal not with representations from other people or organisations-such as contractors, partner organisations, sentencers or staff representatives-but with complaints from those whom I have described, who will form the category of prescribed persons. We use the term ``prescribed persons'' because it is unwise to establish a category that is completely closed. As the service develops and the pattern of work begins to emerge, it may be necessary to include other persons, and we shall certainly reflect on that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I understand the Minister's point, but he does not make it clear where an initial list of prescribed persons will be set out. I accept that lists should not be closed and that we must depend on the development of the new service, but the use of the word ``prescribed'' connotes prescription in some form. How and where will that happen?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Persons will be prescribed by the Secretary of State under his order-making powers.

<P>
This has been a useful debate that has to some extent highlighted the views of Opposition members of the Committee, which will feed into our own reflections. We intend to give hon. members the opportunity to hear our proposals and express their views at a later point, although not necessarily on Report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> In responding to the amendments, the Minister seemed to say that he accepts the need for some form of independant complaints procedure. He talks about returning to the matter at a later stage, but I have to say that he should make himself clearer, and I shall invite my hon. Friends to press the matter to a vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> That is entirely a matter for the hon. Gentleman, but there may be merit in considering the role of an ombudsperson in this respect. We are reflecting on that and shall, in due course, notify the House of our intentions. It is important to have an oversight of the complaints procedure, which must be locally based. I believe that the hon. Member for Taunton will not be disappointed when we put forward our proposals.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I am content with the Minister's helpful response, although I am disappointed and surprised that the Government did not consider a higher-level complaints authority before the Bill reached this stage. I accept that the amendment is flawed in that is says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. Each local board shall refer complaints to the Prisons Ombudsman.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I took the view that complaints should initially be dealt with locally, and if it proved impossible to achieve reconciliation at that level, they should then be taken on to an independent and higher level. In the case of most services, the majority of complaints are resolved at a local level, and only people with the most serious complaints-or the most persistent complainers-go to the ombudsman.

<P>
I am pleased that the Minister is to consider how such an overarching system can best be delivered. I noted that he made no promises about what will happen on Report. However, it would be useful if the provision were included at some point during the passage of the Bill, either in this House or another place.

<P>
On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Schedule 1 agreed to.

<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Functions of local boards</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 33, in page 3, line 12, leave out ``(for example)''.

<P>
I shall be brief in moving this amendment, which seeks to delete the words ``(for example)'' from clause 5(2). We have tabled it because it is not clear whether the Government intend that arrangements above and beyond those listed should be made. The words ``(for example)'' are followed by paragraphs (a) and (b), and I ask the Minister to explain exactly what other arrangements he and his officials have in mind.

<P>
This is not a particularly elegant way of drafting legislation; it is unusual for a Bill to contain the words ``for example'' without giving a comprehensive picture of its provisions. The amendment seeks to probe the Government's intentions and to discover what they have in mind beyond the examples given. Perhaps the Minister and his officials, given more time, will conclude that this drafting is rather inelegant and that the Bill could be improved in another place or on Report. We shall wait to hear what the Minister has in mind, while making it clear that this is a probing amendment to discover the Government's intentions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Elegance is all very well, but the Government place a premium on effectiveness and utility. Furthermore, I must admit that elegance is not the characteristic that I would most associate with the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
Be that as it may, the clause is all about effectiveness and utility. If we were to remove the words ``(for example)'' as the hon. Gentleman urges, the arrangements listed in subsections (2)(a) and (b) would be the only ones that a board could make, apart from using its own staff, to fulfil its functions. That would never do, because it would limit unnecessarily a board's scope for finding new, effective and creative ways of delivering its services.

<P>
I shall give the hon. Gentleman some examples. Local boards should be free to establish partnership arrangements with organisations such as the police or local authorities, which will form part of the local structures set up under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. It makes sense that they should be able to deliver their services, on occasions, through such partnership arrangements. It will also be important for them to establish co-operative arrangments with neighbouring local boards to enable services to be delivered more cost effectively by sharing resources and facilities.

<P>
If we examine the finer points of drafting, the word ``include'' is often used in such provisions. However, on this occasion, the parliamentary draftsman has chosen to use ``for example''. Plain language and plain speaking are what we are all about. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to urge us to adopt these rather esoteric points of drafting, that is a matter for him. We aim to be effective and utilitarian; those are the characteristics of this Government.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Dismissing the more airy-fairy comments in which the Minister has just indulged, I would say to him that if he were to substitute the words ``may include'' for ``may (for example)'' in another place or on Report, that would allay our concerns. He may conclude on reflection with his officials that, despite his rhetoric, that drafting would be better. As a long-standing supporter of the plain English campaign, I am very much in favour of effective language.

<P>
We have probed the Minister sufficiently, and we have made our point. The Minister and his officials, despite the Minister's jibes, understand the matter to which we are drawing their attention. In the light of Pepper v. Hart, it was important that we debate the issue.

<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 34, in page 3, line 13, after ``with'', insert ``appropriate''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 35, in page 3, line 15, after ``with'', insert ``appropriate''.

<P>
No. 36, in page 3, line 19, after ``designate'', insert ``appropriate''.

<P>
No. 46, in clause 8, page 4, line 35, after ``an'', insert ``appropriate''.

<P>
No. 47, in clause 8, page 4, line 36, after ``or'', insert ``appropriate''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> We seek to insert the word ``appropriate'' before references to the organisations and individuals who will perform the functions delegated by boards under clause 5 and the support services referred to in clause 8.

<P>
With the amendment, we are probing the Government to find out what kind of individuals and organisations are envisaged in the Bill. It would be important and useful for the Minister to clarify that in a short debate. Will they be public, private or voluntary bodies-or any or all of those? We suspect that it may be any or all.

<P>
It is also important for us to know what supervision the Government envisage. That is another reason why the Government should accept an amendment that would specify ``appropriate'' bodies and individuals. If it was right for the Government to argue in an earlier debate that, under schedule 1, complaints should be made only by ``prescribed'' persons, it is equally right to say, in the context of clauses 5 and 8, that it should be only ``appropriate'' bodies and individuals. The logic is inescapable and, although we do not expect the Minister to say today that the insertion of the word ``appropriate'' would be helpful, we hope that, on reflection, the Government will consider that it is as correct to specify appropriate bodies or individuals in these clauses as it was to specify prescribed persons in schedule 1.

<P>
What kind of checks will be made on the bodies? Sadly, many tragedies have arisen from the involvement of inappropriate people in such areas. If we needed to be reminded, the Waterhouse inquiry into the terrible situation in north Wales revealed, once again, how many things can go wrong in the welfare services. The same issues are bound to arise with checking the appropriateness of individuals and bodies in this context. Those are serious matters, and I hope that the Minister will treat them accordingly. I look forward to hearing his response.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> We oppose the amendments. Far from improving the Bill, the amendments would introduce the term ``appropriate'' in circumstances in which it has no real meaning. The different between ``appropriate'' and ``prescribed'' is that the Secretary of State will determine who will be prescribed. Who will determine what or who is appropriate? The amendment gives no indication as to who would make that judgment and adds nothing to the clauses. If a board were to behave inappropriately, the Secretary of State would direct them to do otherwise. The National Probation Service has been designed to ensure that that would happen. The service might have a relationship with a voluntary organisation running, say, a hostel delivering a service to people coming off drugs-a detox facility. The hon. Gentleman asked what sort of organisation might be involved in a relationship with the service-that is an example. Such an organisation might have a track record of delivering anti-substance misuse packages to offenders, ex-offenders and those on licence. It is important to manage the process in such a way as to assist rather than to hinder. We are all aware of tragic examples that show that if the process is badly managed, it will hinder.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
In relation to amendments Nos. 37 and 38, probation committees currently contract out such work to partner organisations and individuals because it is necessary and expeditious so to do-voluntary sector organisations and local authorities have expertise that is not otherwise available in the service. The amendments would make contracting out more difficult and expensive because there would have to be constant references back in the system, which would hamper the boards in their attempt to achieve best value for money when they buy in the services in the first place.

<P>
The contracting-out and partnership arrangements should be robust, transparent and evidence-based-that will ensure that the right decision is made. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath will appreciate that in this context, there are similarities with running a business-once one has decided with whom one should enter into a contractual relationship, one lets then get on with it but one ensures that one checks the outcomes and that the initial establishment of the relationship was based on a proper evaluation of what was on offer. I hope that the hon. Gentleman feels that I appreciate the thinking behind the amendments and that on reflection, he agrees that they would hinder rather than help and that they are inappropriate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving us an idea of the Government's thinking about which organisations and individuals may be regarded as being appropriate. Even if the Minister does not accept the word ``appropriate'', it might be worth while for the Government to give the matter further thought. It would be helpful if the Bill issued further guidance. The Minister did not respond in detail to the question about the way in which organisations that are chosen to be partners will be supervised.

<P>
I welcome the seriousness with which he treated the amendments and I hope that he and his officials will give the matter further thought. We may return to it on Report and in another place. I am grateful to the Minister for responding to the amendments in a constructive spirit-this is a serious matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 39 in page 3, line 22, after ``giving'', insert ``appropriate''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 40, in page 3, line 24, after ``providing'', insert ``appropriate''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The amendments once again involve the word ``appropriate''. The relevant arguments are similar to those that were used in relation to amendments Nos. 34, 35, 36, 46 and 47 but, in this context they may be even more pressing. It is essential to make it clear that the assistance that is given to those who have been on remanded on bail should be appropriate, as should the accommodation that is provided in respect of those who have been charged or convicted. That raises questions about the nature of the help that will be given by local boards. Will there be minimum national standards, and how will they be assessed? Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 are not probing amendments-they raise important matters and I hope that the Minister will take them seriously. If he cannot accept them, I hope that he will consider tabling Government amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> You will appreciate, Mr. Maxton, given your previous life in which you instructed young people-[Laughter.] You still do, come to think of it. In the more rigorous teaching establishments, a certain kind of English teacher, when reading essays, keeps and eye out for words that are repeated by recalcitrant young persons. When I was just such a person-

<P>
<B>Ms Bridget Pentice </B>(Lewisham, East): Never!

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Incredible as it may seem, I repeatedly used the word ``actually'' in essays. The constant repetition of that word drives a rigorous English teacher to distraction. My teacher would take every sentence in which I had used it and ask me to explain what it had added. I should like to ask the same of the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. What is added by the use of the word ``appropriate''? The answer is nothing, because if something is not appropriate, it should not be happening. The management structures must ensure that a particular form of conduct is appropriate. The repeated use of the word ``appropriate'' adds no more to a Bill than the word ``effective''-in that if something is not effective, one should not be doing it.

<P>
I understand what the hon. Gentleman is getting at, but he must recognise that we cannot accept the amendment. The addition of the word ``appropriate'' would not in any way add to the elegance-let alone anything else-of the Bill's drafting. The Secretary of State will, where necessary, direct boards that behave in an inappropriate way. The Secretary of State and the national director will produce guidance on a range of issues, which will be developed in consultation with the chief inspector in the usual way. Boards will be given plenty of guidance to help them to arrive at appropriate decisions, and the Secretary of State will have adequate powers to direct boards that take inappropriate decisions, as Liberal Democrat Members pointed out.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> More than adequate powers.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The powers are certainly adequate. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to reconsider the matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am a little disappointed by the Minister's response. When we tabled earlier amendments of a similar nature, he at least did the Committee the courtesy of taking them seriously. I urge him not to trivialise these matters.

<P>
The Minister referred to his experience as a younger person. Last week, I was fascinated to discover that as a slightly older person than he was then, but younger than he is now, he was employed by the Central Office of information to extol the virtues of Milton Keynes and, having heard his recent radio documentary voiceover, I wonder whether he would regard that as appropriate. I do not want to lead the Committee down as long a byway as he did.

<P>
I accept some of what the Minister said towards the end of his remarks, when he began to address the issue. I shall not press amendment No. 40, given that the Bill contains the phrase ``approved premises''. However, in terms of amendment no. 39, giving appropriate assistance would provide an important safeguard. The Minister did not respond to that serious point. I referred earlier to some of the sad and tragic cases that have resulted in recent enquiries and we have all seen that, sadly, the sort of work that has been done, particularly with young offenders and those in care, has sometimes been inappropriate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> indicated assent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am glad to see the Minister nodding, because I believe that he understands the seriousness of our comments. The word ``appropriate'' in the context of giving assistance is significant. It would provide an additional safeguard and perhaps the Minister will understand that on reflection. I shall press the amendment to a Division.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) The National Audit Office will be responsible for reviewing the performance standards of the Inspectorate.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We are anxious to secure a thorough and independant scrutiny of the performance of the inspectorate, but it is always difficult to monitor the performance of inspectors and judges. At 1 o'clock this morning, the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, joined the hon. Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) and me on the Floor of the House during my Adjournment debate on magistrates courts. I am reluctant to lapse into Latin, but I shall try. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Who will guard the guardians? The answer to that conundrum is the independent national Audit Office, which will give advice on management, management systems and other aspects of the running of the inspectorate and to ensure consistency, fairness and openness. The inspectorate should be accountable. Its tasks are important and we want to ensure that they are discharged to the highest standards.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I support the comments of the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett). Independent scrutiny is always important and the same motivation lies behind other amendments that we have tabled and to which I referred earlier. We shall return to the matter regularly in the Committee. We have said in previous sittings that the Home Secretary has taken to himself too many unfettered powers in the Bill, and introducing levels of independent scrutiny can only be a good thing. On this occasion, the Liberal Democrats are right to say that the National Audit Office should undertake an inspection role. We have a high regard for its work, as, I hope, do all Committee members. If the hon, Member for Torridge and West Devon intends to press this particular amendment to a vote, I shall invite my hon. Friends to support it.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I have a high regard for the chief inspector of probation and the National Audit Office. On the question of who guards the guardians, the inspectorate is already subject to review by the National Audit Office and will continue to be subject to such review. Therefore, the amendment, although well-intentioned, is unnecessary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Under what systems, statute and powers does the National Audit Office scrutinise the work of the inspectorate?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Under the powers vested in the National Audit Office by Parliament. It carries out that function on the basis of the inspectorate's public funding expenditure. In the light of that expenditure, the National Audit Office is rightly empowered to inspect, and form a view on the inspectorate's work, and it will continue to perform that valuable and important task. The amendment is fine but it adds nothing-it simply states the current law. We cannot accede to it, but I can again assure the hon. Gentleman that the National Audit Office oversees the inspectorate and will continue to do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> We were anxious for the Minister to put those words on record, and we are grateful to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath for his support. In the light of the Minister's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 44, in page 4, line 25, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4A) The Secretary of State shall publish any directions given by him under subsection (4).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 43, in page 4, line 27, after ``Parliament'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`within one month of receiving the report'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Our amendment would require the Secretary of State to publish directions to the inspectorate on the format and content of, reports on local boards. It is important that the matter be open to scrutiny. The public should know the criteria by which the Secretary of State judges boards, so that there might be a general debate through which other criteria could be suggested.

<P>
Amendment No. 43 would ensure that no Secretary of State could delay presentation of the report to Parliament. One can envisage that a Home Secretary might be tempted to delay passing to Parliament a report that criticised a particular action on his or her part. It would help if the Bill imposed a requirement on any Secretary of State to ensure that the report is available to Parliament at the earliest possible opportunity.

<P>
Having stated briefly what we seek to achieve, I suggest that our proposal should encourage the Government to provide genuine freedom of information. Many of us spent a great deal of time in the main Chamber last Tuesday and Wednesday debating into the early hours amendments tabled on that issue by the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Tony Wright) and the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher).

<P>
The Government have stated repeatedly that they are in sympathy with the whole concept of freedom of information. Amendments Nos. 43 and 44 would require the Government to provide more information. We hope that they will be accepted at a later stage, either in another place or on Report, or that the Government will at least accept the spirit in which they have been tabled.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I understand what lies behind the hon. Gentleman's amendment. We all know where he is coming from on this issue. Can he give the Committee any examples that occurred during the 18-odd years of the stewardship of the previous Conservative Administration of Ministers subjecting themselves to the sort of discipline that he seeks to impose on them and their Departments by requiring them to lay the inspector's report before the House within a fixed period-in this case, a month?

<P>
Can the hon. Gentleman think of a single example of Government business being conducted on that basis? I suspect that he cannot, and there is a good reason for that. This is not simply a matter of Departments or Ministers resenting time limits being placed on their operations. This concerns the practical, day-to-day business of government. Not so much time has elapsed since the hon. Gentleman's party lost power that he could have forgotten the day-to-day disciplines of government. The notion that it is possible to conduct Government business on the basis that, within a month of a particular event, some other action must occur is a fanciful one.

<P>
Of course it is right that the inspectorate's report should be laid before Parliament without undue delay. It is right that Government and Departments should be criticised if there is undue delay. However, that should be a matter for the judgment of Parliament and the Opposition. It is not something that one would wish to flag up by fixing a specific time limit in statute. There might be particular reasons why it would be impractical or undesirable to publish within a set period.

<P>
I entirely accept the spirit of the amendment, which is that there should be no delay. The hon. Gentleman is right to exercise the function of the Opposition of drawing to the Committee's attention the need to avoid such delay. However, it would unduly restrict the flexibility of the business of government if we were to alight on a time limit of a month, or any fixed term, as a marker in this context. We oppose the amendment for that reason.

<P>
I shall make a further point in opposing amendment No. 44. It refers back to an earlier debate, possibly during the Committee's first sitting. The relationship between a chief inspector and Ministers is an important one. There must be confidence, trust and a capacity to give directions in such a manner and with such content as to enable that trust and confidence to continue, and to enable a degree of operational effectiveness.

<P>
I can foresee circumstances in which the publication of some directions might be fraught with hazards. If a service were failing, there might be implications for particular members of staff or board members whose conduct was thought to have contributed to that failure. If directions to the inspector were published, the consequences might be serious. Where such directions are confidential and a particular form of advice is sought, and in the light of consequences for individuals, it may be better for directions to remain confidential.

<P>
On reflection, the hon. Gentleman may feel that the amendment is unduly prescriptive, given the nature and sensitivity of the relationship between the chief inspector and Minister, and between the chief inspector, Minister, local board and service. For that reason alone, it would not be appropriate to accept the amendment. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but the amendment is not the way in which it should be dealt with.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> All members of the Committee will know that, when a Minister is challenged to produce background information and his officials cannot provide an instant answer, he is inclined to say that he will write to the hon. Gentleman concerned and members of the Committee. Perhaps I may therefore use the same formula in response to the Minister's own gentle challenge. Given a little time and work by the excellent Library staff, we may discover that many statutes impose some time limit. I accept that, as the Minister says, one month may be too short a limit, but the Government may decide that, on reflection, some time limit woudl do no harm. It would ensure that no Home Secretary could delay unduly a report's presentation to Parliament.

<P>
We have had a useful debate and it was worth while ventilating the issue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng indicated assent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I see the Minister nodding in acceptance. I do not propose to pursue the amendment because the issue has been discussed and the Government may propose a time limit at a later stage-perhaps on Report.

<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for taking amendment No. 44 seriously. It is clear that he intends to consider the matter, but he did not give a sufficient reason why the requirement for publication should not be included in the Bill. The amendment is not unduly restrictive. If the Bill were to require publication of the criteria, discussion could take place, and to signal the importance that we attach to the matter, we shall divide the Committee on amendment No. 44.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No.124, in page 4, line 32, after ``any'', insert ``support''.

<P>
No. 45, in page 4, line 44, at end add-

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the local boards;

<P>
(b) the chief inspector;

<P>
(c) any other person who appears to the Secretary of State to have an interest in the standard or efficiency of the exercise of the functions of the local boards.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The clause covers support services and gives the Home Secretary the power to privatise those services, although no criteria is given as to what would trigger such a decision.

<P>
I am not opposed to privatisation per se and I am happy to put that on the record, but some Labour Members in a previous life might have been opposed to privatisation. I accept that it is sometimes in the interests of best value and effective delivery for services to be outsourced from the core authority. However, that decision should be made by local boards, which will have been appointed by the Home Secretary. He will control the appointments to the board, so he does not need further powers to order individual services to be privatised.

<P>
Amendment No. 123 would not curtail the Home Secretary's powers, but we may return to the matter on Report because, by then, I might have had time to count the powers that are being given to him under the Bill. No one else has admitted having done that homework during the past week. Amendment No. 23 would not curtail his powers, but would require him to take account of representations made by the local board and chief inspector before using those powers.

<P>
Amendment No. 124 would make it clear in the Bill that the clause refers only to support services and not core services. The clause heading refers to support services, but the drafting of the clause is not specific and I hope that the Minister will clarify what is in the Government's mind. Do they foresee an extension of privatisation by order, or will that be restricted, as the clause suggests, to support services?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Amendment No. 45 would have the same effect as that of the hon. Member for Taunton. We are aiming at the same target and I hope that the Minister will bear in mind all our views. I believe, as does the hon. Lady, that it is important to state clearly in the Bill the requirement on the Secretary of State
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to have regard to any representations that may be made to him by-<P>

<P>
(b) the chief inspector;

<P>
(c) any other person who appears to the Secretary of State to have an interest in the standard or efficiency of the exercise of the functions of the local boards.
<P>
We can think of no reason for the Government to oppose the amendment. The Minister may say that he will keep the matter under consideration and I hope that he will do so, because I would be happy to see the Government introduce their own version of our amendments. We have raised a legitimate issue and I am sure that the Minister will acknowledge that. The matter is important and if the hon. Lady wishes to press her amendment to a vote, I shall invite my hon. Friends to support her. The Minister may have some satisfactory answers, but, if not, either our amendment or those of the Liberal Democrats would improve the Bill.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The measure has been included to make it possible for the Secretary of State to make arrangements for support services for local boards to be undertaken centrally by his staff or to be contracted out. He will be able to do that only if, by so doing, better efficiency, higher standards or greater value for money could be achieved. That could be of particular use if economies of scale could be achieved by grouping boards regionally or nationally and letting a contract for the provision of a service. The nature of the services that might be covered is deliberately not tightly defined in the clause. The services are defined only as those
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>which are required by local boards in connection with the exercise of their functions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They could include cleaning services, payroll provision-where real economies of scale can often be achieved by grouping numbers of employers together-staff training or the equipment and provision of vehicles that are used for the transport of offenders when they go to sites where work is being carried out as part of a process of reparation or restorative justice.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Does the clause also cover the monitoring and supervision of offenders and the delivery of courses to offenders?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I was coming to that. The clause is not designed to cover the contracting out of core activities involved in the supervision of offenders. Local boards may contract out the delivery of such services under clause 5(2), but the board concerned would-rightly, in our view-retain responsibility for ensuring that the arrangements that it had made were to its satisfaction. When the Secretary of State appoints boards, he or she demonstrates a degree of trust in their judgment, and it is right that there should be an opportunity for them to exercise it-as they do under clause 5(2). It is also right that boards should retain responsibility for ensuring that a contract that they have let is being fulfilled by the contractor-to return to the point that was made by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 45, 123 and 124 would either be unnecessary or would constitute an undue fettering of the Secretary of State's discretion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Perhaps we can return to this during the stand part debate. However, I point out to the Minister that the National Association of Probation Officers has strong views about the clause, and feels that the Government's proposal is likely to lead to fragmentation and inefficiency. Will the Minister deal with that point?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I do not accept NAPO's view; it is misconceived. The whole purpose of the measure is to promote efficiency and counter the fragmentation that currently exists in the service, and it is bizarre to argue the contrary. It is odd for the hon. Gentleman-who purports, through the amendment, to be seeking to achieve a better quality of service and value for money-to mouth that concern on the part of NAPO.

<P>
I understand why the hon. Gentleman tabled the amendment, and he is right to probe the issue, but I assure him that the clauses and subsections are designed to achieve better value for money and a higher standard of service. I hope that he will therefore feel able to support the clause as it stands, and agree that the powers given to the Secretary of State in relation to the support services are the best way to achieve our directive. The Secretary of State will, of course, have regard to the views of a range of persons. Indeed, one of the unsatisfactory things about the amendments is that they seek to fetter the Secretary of State's capacity to consult a wide range of people and take their mind on a particular matter. He will consult as necessary, and restricting his flexibility is not the way to arrive at the best result.

<P>
In the light of what I have said, I hope that the hon. Lady will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The Minister referred to the possibility of enabling the Home Secretary to make economies of scale by grouping boards and merging services. Certainly, many local authorities are now considering putting their payrolls together. That would make sense, because the same system operates in many authorities. I do not understand, however, why that cannot be left to the judgment and discretion of local boards or why it has to be done by order of the Home Secretary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The hon. Lady and I share a common experience of local government. My experience tells me that, however reasonable, sensible or apparent a course of action might be, one has one's work cut out when it comes to bringing together hitherto separate entities and persuading good decent folk who have served on a local authority for many years to surrender any power at all to a neighbouring local authority. That is my experience of local government. I do not knock it; I support local government. It is a great, democratising institution. However, the hon. Lady's notion that we can rely on the good sense of folk on the ground to recognise when it would be best to share, say, parole or cleaning or catering services suggests that she has a naive belief that reason would previal in that context. That is why the Secretary of State is required to take that action.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That was a slightly long intervention.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The Minister forgot who was speaking. I must correct him; we do not share a common experience of local government. My experience has been of Liberal Democrat-led authorities, which, obviously, have much better sense than the authorities on which he has served. I have served on two authorities-I was deputy leader of one and leader of the other. We do not have that much in common; I do not want the Minister to get carried away.

<P>
The Minister said that the clause is not designed to cover core services. I welcome that. However, it is weird-I cannot think of a better word-for him to say that he trusts the good sense of local boards and will give them the responsibility to exercise their judgment in respect of core services, but not in respect of support services. We may think that support services are not so important. The Minister referred to cleaning services, and I can imagine no circumstances in which they would have a fundamental role in the delivery of the probation service. However, as hon. Members will be aware, many health professionals have lived to regret the day that cleaning in hospitals was contracted out. It is quite possible that services that currently come under the heading of support services are as important to the delivery of the probation service as cleaning is to the delivery of the hospital service. I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind.

<P>
I do not accept that amendment No. 123 fetters the judgment of the Home Secretary. It adds to his ability to make the right decision before exercising yet another of his order-making powers. The amendment said that the Home Secretary should take into account
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any representations that may have been made to him by the Chief Inspector and the Local Board.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not an exhaustive list; the Home Secretary can, of course, consult anyone else that he wants to and take their advice. The Minister suggested that we were allowing the Secretary of State to listen to just two people.

I would like to press amendment No. 123 to a vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> We need to have only a brief stand part debate. In an earlier intervention, I referred to the views of the National Association of Probation Officers. I am sure that the Minister agrees with me that it is a serious and important organisation whose views should be taken seriously.

<P>
NAPO has reservations about the clause. We feel that it is important to ventilate its views-it appears that no one else is going to do so-but we do not want to suggest that the Opposition agree with it on all occasions. For all that we know, this may be the last Bill for 10 or 15 years that involves a major reform of NAPO's work, and when it expresses strong views, it would be wrong not to discuss them or those parts of the Bill about which it is concerned.

<P>
NAPO was kind enough to send me a briefing, which states that the clause could lead to fragmentation and inefficiency. Those are strong words, and the Minister should respond to them. It states in a reasonable and moderate manner that the roles and responsibilities of probation service staff have changed significantly during the the past few years. We referred in earlier debates and on Second Reading to the fact that the probation service has a hard task, and we all recognise the important work that probation officers do. Many of us, including the Minister and me, have much experience at the sharp end-we have worked with probation officers and we are are aware of their valuable work. I am sure that the Minister joins me in paying tribute to them.

<P>
When a national organisation expresses concerns, they should be discussed. NAPO feels strongly about the clause. I am sure that other Committee members have, like me, received briefings from probation officers in their area. We should take their views seriously.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): The hon. Gentleman makes an eloquent case on behalf of NAPO. Does he agree that experience under the previous Government suggests that privatisation led to the fragmentation of services?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> No, I certainly do not. I was careful not to say anything that opposed the concept of privatisation. I agree with the hon. Member for Taunton, who said, when she moved an earlier amendment, that the private sector has a vlauable role to play. We shall not oppose the clause, but when a serious national organisation raises concerns, it is important to debate them. Far too often, clause stand part debates are a rubber-stamping exercise. The Minister will surely agree that it is important to debate the concerns raised by organisations.

<P>
I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say. We shall not oppose the clause, but the Minister should clarify the Government's intentions and respond to the concerns of NAPO.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am happy to respond to NAPO's concerns, but I do not believe that they are well founded. NAPO has briefed the Opposition spokesman on the basis that privatisation of parts of the probation service would lead to fragmentation and communication problems, but we do not believe that that would be the case. The Opposition spokesman has not shared his opinion with us. His view remains unclear and I repeat my question: does he believe that privatisation of parts of the probation service would lead to fragmentation and communication problems?

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am thinking of the Conservative Opposition spokesman.

<P>
Answer comes there none, so we must presume either that he is acting as NAPO's mouthpiece on certain occasions and his party's mouthpiece on others, or that he does not know what he believes. All those things could be true.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Before responding, I was waiting, I hope courteously, for the Minister to finish attacking NAPO in what I am sure he feels was an elegant way. It is valid for any Committee member to raise the genuine concerns of any national organisation, just as the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) sought to do. I hope that I made it clear that the concern to which I referred is a valid matter for debate. The Minister is well aware that those outside this House who read our debates want to see that all clauses have been discussed thoroughly and properly-that is the purpose of a Standing Committee. When a national organisation expresses valid concerns, they should be ventilated. We do not oppose the clause or the Government's proposals in this regard, but we are entitled to raise the concerns that have been expressed.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It might be worth my while to point out that interventions should be brief.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The hon. Gentleman could have said yes or no, but he did not, and we will draw our own conclusions from that.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I have a simple question, to which, I hope, the Minister will be able to answer yes or no. Can he think of examples of the unsuccessful privatisation of support services?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I can certainly think of examples of a company assuming a particular function that it was manifestly incapable of delivering to an acceptable standard. Many hon. Members will recall instances of the contracting out of certain services by local institutions that resulted in a diminution in standards, so the answer to the hon. Lady's question is yes. That is why it is important to approach the issue on an entirely pragmatic basis. How best can we deliver a quality, cost-effective service? That is the question to which Ministers and boards should direct their minds and to which I ask NAPO to direct its mind. Instead a knee-jerk reaction against any form of privatisation, which is then mouthed by the Conservative spokesman who reads its briefing, NAPO should take the view that the Secretary of State should have the power, where appropriate, to examine issues of quality and value for money and to direct that services would be better delivered by a private sector organisation, a voluntary sector organisation or a combination of organisations. It is not an ideological issue, but relates to quality and value. That is why we believe that the clause should remain in its present form. I urge my hon. Friend and Opposition Members to think again and to vote for it.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) The total expenditure incurred by the Secretary of State under this section in any period of 12 months shall not exceed such sum as may be specified in a resolution of the House of Commons, unless a further resolution of the House of Commons determines otherwise.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> These amendments and amendment No. 76 are particularly important. We believe that there should be much more scrutiny in relation to bail hostels, community rehabilitation hostels and similar property, because many hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff) and myself, and perhaps Labour Members too, have had extensive experience of the controversy that the establishment of such hostels can cause. I make no apology for drawing on personal experience of dealing with a bail hostel issue.

<P>
Together with other hon. Members, I was involved in a campaign where there was huge public concern about the proposal to estbalish a bail hostel in what turned out to be a wholly inappropriate site. It was proposed that people who had been convicted of serious crimes of violence, including violence against women, or who had been convicted of and served sentences for offences against children, including sexual offences, should be housed in hostel estbalished in a building on a fairly major road, past which many mothers took small children to school every day. In those circumstances it is not surprising that there was a huge protest campaign.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire will no doubt tell the Committee about his experience, but as a result of all the campaigns and public protests on that issue, I am well aware of the passions that can be aroused when proposals are made. The Bill must include provisions that ensure proper scrutiny of such proposals. That is why we have tabled the amendments.

<P>
Amendment No. 49 would add a subsection (4), which would impose a control on the amount of expenditure. We believe that the grants should be limited. If the Secretary of State is to have powers over taxpayers' money, it is incumbent on all members of the Committee to ensure that there is proper scrutiny and that proper limits are set. What sums does the Minister think will be involved and to whom will they be paid? Will there be any scrutiny of value for money in relation to the grants? The public will want to be sure that there is proper scrutiny.

<P>
Is the Minister simply assuming that the Secretary of State will always secure value for money? Secretaries of State have recently indulged in panic measures, which have led to the most extraordinary expenditure of taxpayers' money. Recently my hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) discovered that the Government had, for example, wasted a vast amount of taxpayers' money on buying umbrellas for people waiting in queues outside passport offices, none of which would be recouped.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
That is a small example, but not a trivial one, because it was revealed in a written answer. Even on small matters such as that, the Government should be scrutinised. On something as central as the provision of taxpayers' money for bail hostels, we must be sure that there is proper parliamentary scrutiny and accountability and, in particular, proper limits on the amount of money spent.

<P>
I know from personal experience that proposals are sometimes made, perhaps with the best of intentions-we all know that, sadly, the road to hell is paved with good intentions-to use accommodation that turns out to be wholly unsuitable for bail and probation hostels. Therefore, we feel strongly about the lack of limitation in the Bill. If Labour Members have not yet encountered controversies over bail and probation hostels, I hope that they will watch out when proposals are made in their own constitutencies, because these are extremely serious issues when they arise, and I know that many hon. Members feel strongly about them.

<P>
Therefore, I beg to move amendments Nos. 48, 49 and 75.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps I should make it clear to hon. Members that when a group of amendments is taken, only the first amendment on the list is moved.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's speech. There is no more difficult, sensitive and important area of operation for the probation service than that which arises from the provision of residential accommodation. It is vital from the point of view of public protection and rehabilitation, yet it is always subject to some of the most difficult and challenging managerial and operational decisions that any service must make, and the last thing that the probation service wants is political interference in its operations. One of the dangers of the amendment is that it would lead to just that-even greater controversy about its decisions in this area.

<P>
It is important that there are close working relationships on the ground between the police, the local authority, the probation service and, where relevant, the health authority and that appropriate resources are made available. Indeed, the Bill envisages that money would be paid to a local board, if it runs a hostel, or to a voluntary organisation, if it runs a hostel. There is no change from the existing arrangements. Therefore, I am not clear about the purpose of the amendments, which seem opportunistic and designed to stir up further controversy through the nature of the arrangements that they would put in place.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Luff </B>(Mid-Worcestershire): On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. I was hoping to catch your eye regarding amendment No. 76, on which the Minister appears to be anticipating a debate. Have I misread the amendment paper in some way?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister may be doing that, but the hon. Gentleman who spoke to the amendment also strayed into amendment No. 76 to some extent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am obliged to you, Mr. Maxton. Having responded to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath on his presentation of the amendments, I am happy to discuss them in more detail.

<P>
Amendment No. 48 would limit to what is reasonable the amount that the Secretary of State could pay towards the maintenance or development of approved hostels. Adding the word ``reasonable'' would have no useful effect, and would leave open the judgment as to how much expenditure might be deemed useful.

<P>
Amendment No. 49 would limit the overall amount that could be spent on the maintenance or development of approved hostels to a sum approved by the House of Commons. There is no good reason why expenditure on approved hostels should be treated differently from other expenditure of the National Probation Service. The House of Commons, which is a national arena, would be dragged into matters that are purely local. The strength of the boards lies in the fact that they will, for the first time, draw on the knowledge of local lay people, who will be able to make a real impact on the way in which decisions are made and in which the service provides such facilities. Dragging the House of Commons into the matter would not assist in any way.

<P>
Perhaps Conservative Members intend that the House of Commons should cap expenditure on hostels and residential provision. If so, I have got news for them: our concern has to be public protection and rehabilitation. It is not for those of us in the House of Commons to set notional caps on how much may be spent on meeting those priorities. That is a matter for the professional judgment of local boards-subject, of course, to national guidelines and the advice and assistance of the chief inspector and, where appropriate, the Secretary of State.

<P>
In coming to these difficult judgments, boards are always entitled to look to Members of Parliament to ensure that they do so in a way that reflects the priority of public protection and the wider interest of the public. It is all too easy for us to fall prey to ``not in my backyard'' syndrome and say, ``Put it elsewhere. Of course I want something to be done to protect the public, reduce the impact of crime, and address the problems of drugs and mental health-but not in my constituency, please. I just want to benefit from the results of what these dedicated, hard-working front-line workers do in hostels''. Under the previous Government, front-line residential hostel workers were all too often neglected in terms of resources. Conservative Members ask us to accept an amendment that would require the specific approval of the House in relation to expenditure on hostels-no, we are not going to. The amendments contain nothing to commend them, and we shall oppose them tooth and nail. I have no intention of giving Opposition Members any hope that their amendments will be accepted: we reject them completely.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The Minister might come to regret the strength of his words, because we believe that there is every reason to make special arrangements. Perhaps I can use some of the Minister's arguments and turn them round against him. It is precisely because these matters cause such local controversy that an extra layer of parliamentary scrutiny can take them out of the local hotbed. We are not seeking political interference, but accountability. The Minister says ``What we must ensure is this'' and ``What we must ensure is that'', but we are talking about the proper use of taxpayers' money, which is the responsibility of any Government. The Minister was far too quick to dismiss the significance of the amendments.

<P>
I apologise if, in moving the amendment, I inadvertently strayed into territory that we shall come to on the next amendment, and the Minister did so himself, but inevitably these matters are to some extent linked, though not on the amendment paper. I simply want to concentrate on the Minister's arguments that were properly directed to the three amendments.

<P>
The amendments would build in an extra layer of scrutiny and accountability, which is Parliament's legitimate role. We therefore intend to press the amendment to a Division, to make it clear how strongly we feel. The Minister has used strong language in his response, but we feel strongly about these matters and believe that that extra layer of parliamentary accountablity should be built into the provision.

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 76, in page 5, line 11, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) Before giving approval to a hostel or other premises under subsection (1), the Secretary of State shall consult the county, borough and district councils responsible for the area in which the hostel or premises is to be sited, and such other persons as he considers appropriate or as appear to him to have an interest in the operation of the hostel or premises.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I said that both I and the Minister perhaps inadvertently strayed into the territory of the amendment on the previous group, but to some extent that debate might have shortened the issues somewhat.

<P>
For some of the reasons that the Minister himself gave in his answer to the previous debate, a consultation process should perhaps be built into the Bill so that the Secretary of State can consult local councils and take advice from the people named in the amendment. Although the Minister did not accept the arguments on the previous group of amendments, he accepted that these matters can be very controversial. However, he attempted to paint the picture that such arguments are always conducted on a ``not in my backyard'' basis, and that is not so. Often, debates are not about whether there should be a probation or bail hostel, but about the part of the local authority or constituency in which it should be sited. For example, local controversy may arise as to whether violent or abusive ex-prisoners should be housed close to routes that mothers use to take their children to and from school. In many cases, much better sites can be identified than those that were originally proposed.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Before giving approval, the Secretary of State should consult all those with a legitimate interest, such as residents associations, parent-teacher associations and local authorities. I know from my experience of dealing with such controversies that that is vital. If a clear consultation process such as the amendment proposes were to be built into the role of the Secretary of State, the temperature of such debates, and the associated passions and hostilities, would be reduced.

<P>
I will be interested to hear whether the Minister can legitimately claim that there is any harm in stipulating a proper consultation process in the Bill, because that is always helpful. There would have been a more temperate and balanced debate in the course of the controversy in which I was involved if such a system had been on the statute book at the time. Many other hon. Members and councillors from all three main political parties-not always working in opposition to each other, but frequently in cross-party groups-were involved in that debate.

<P>
If the Minister cannot accept the amendment, he should do the Committee the courtesy of saying that he recognises that these are serious issues and that he will reconsider them in consultation with officials. I hope that he will not give a blanket refusal to contemplate it-as he did at the end of his remarks about the previous group of amendments-and that the Government will table a modified version in another place or on Report.

<P>
I and other hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have had experience of this matter; I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire wishes to talk about similar controversies in his area. I hope that the Minister will not be dismissive, because this is a serious issue to which we shall want to return.

<P>

<B>Mr. Luff:</B> I have the luxury of speaking in the Committee, and am delighted to be able to do so on the amendment. I urge the Minister to consider it carefully and not to dismiss it in the way that was suggested by his earlier remarks.
 
<P>
The location of a bail hostel is one of the most difficult judgments that any community is called upon to make. As my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath said, giving a community the chance to express its view will ease the process rather than make it more difficult. He did the Committee a service by listing some of the organisations that may be included in such consultations. Parent-teacher associations are an obvious example, to which I would add local churches. During a controversy over a bail hostel in my previous constituency, the local church was extremely effective in reducing the temperature of the debate through a consultation process that was rather forced on the probation service against its will. Many such bodies could assist in a constructive and informed debate. I respect the Minister's fears about the proposal, but do not share his view that an inflamed debate will inevitably result.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McWalter </B>(Hemel Hempstead): The provisions involve laudable aims, and many Committee members support such an approach in our constituencies. Does the hon. Gentleman acept that, for the reasons that he gave, it would be best not include in the Bill provisions to consult-other agencies need to be part of the consultation process? Some of those matters, including rehabilitation, will be dealt with more effectively by other means.

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> That is not the point. I fear that the Minister has not read the amendment carefully enough. Amendment No.76 states that the right should be held by local politicians, local councils and ``such other persons as'' the Secretary of State ``considers appropriate''. In relation to Brailey house bail hostel, it would have been appropriate to specify the church. The hon. Gentleman does not properly understand the amendment, which is worrying. If the Government and their supporters have not properly understood an amendment, it is important not to dismiss it, especially in this context-amendment No. 76 deals with an important and sensitive subject.

<P>
<B>Ms Bridget Prentice </B>(Lewisham, East): I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying, and I have much sympathy with his attempt to involve in the planning process as many local groups and people as possible. However, I support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter). To leave the power with the Secretary of State-not giving it to the local area or local planning authority-would be to miss the point. Local planning authorities know the local groups and churches, and are aware of who should be involved in the relevant decisions. It is better to leave the power with the local planning authority than to give it to central Government.

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising a point to which I want the Minister to respond. How will such sites be identified under the probation service's new nationalised structure? What planning constraints will there be and how will the process be gone through? It is crucial that such concerns are resolved.

<P>
I had the misfortune of having in my constituency a bail hostel that was, as the probation service admitted, in the wrong place. It was in possibly the worst location that could be found in Worcester, although it got there by accident. The hostel began as what was rather charmingly called in the old days a hostel for fallen women, but a series of changes turned it into a fully fledged bail hostel. It contained very dangerous offenders of the kind who were discussed by my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath. It was situated close to a huge number of schools-I forget exactly how many-and to the bed-and-breakfast zone, where other people resided who were of interest to the police. That led to a huge concentration of problems in one area of the city. There is no doubt about the fact that the hostel was in completely the wrong place.

<P>
I hope that the consultation process with the local community that identifies the best site for such a facility-I rule out not having such a facility at all-involves the hostel's building and management. Many of the practical concerns that were expressed to me by my constituents at the time related to the hostel's management. They identified simple devices that the probation service had not considered that eased the hostel's management. For example, several houses that were on the other side of the road to the hostel were in the direct line of sight from the hostel's bedrooms, but planting fast-growing conifers eased many tensions among local residents. Local consultation can identify better ways in which to locate and manage facilities. Residents are often concerned about small issues. They may be worried about the residents of the hostel who sit on the hostel steps and appear menacing. Such problems can be dealt with if the local community's veiws are properly taken into account.

<P>
I was puzzled by a comment that the Minister made in relation to the previous group of amendments. He said that involving local authorities in the process was to politicise it-

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> No, I did not say that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> The Minister says from a sedentary position that he did not say that. I understood him to have said that. I want an assurance from him not that the amendment would or would not do the job-maybe it would not-but that the local community will be consulted properly and appropriately about the siting of bail hostels. Putting a bail hostel in the wrong place is a disaster for all concerned-for local residents, for the probation service and for the residents of the hostel, who, in the example that I gave, were subject to an unhealthy environment because their hostel was in the wrong location in that city. I am sure that if the local council had been properly involved in the location of that hostel, it would have found a better site for it. It was a bruising experiences. I want the Minister to understand that the problems that I faced were the most difficult that I had to deal with as Member of Parliament for Worcester. If there had been better, more effective consultation about the hostel, there would have been fewer problems, and the hostel would have served its purpose better.

<P>
I shall be encouraged if the Minister can reassure me that consultation will be available at another stage in the system, for example in the planning process. I also urge the Minister to consider that there should be not only consultation on the location of hostels, but proper liaison with the community once the hostels are up and running. That is how we will reduce fear and tension and enable the hostels to fulfil their function. We all want to see that.

<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Dawson: I shall be extremely brief-much briefer than I was going to be, before hearing the earlier positive and useful exchanges. I agree that it is extremely important to consult people. Failure to consult breeds fear and mistrust, because of people's ignorance about what is being proposed. If people are consulted, they will bring their local knowledge and experience to bear on the situation in a helpful way. Fears can often be allayed if it is pointed out that some of them are groundless and that others will be treated responsibly and effectively. Effective consultation is the hallmark of a mature democracy, I am sure that we would all support that concept.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I have finished, but I will give way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I welcome the hon. Gentleman's comments, but I am puzzled as to why, in the light of what he said, he did not add his name to our amendment. He seems to be supporting our view.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That was an intervention on the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> As I said, I do not accept the amendment in its current form.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I listened carefully to the thoughtful and considered comments of the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire. I agreed with almost everything that he said, except for his conclusions.

<P>
All of us, as Members of Parliament, share the experiences that he has had in relation to local campaigns about hostels. We have had agonising moments deciding what position to take on a particular issue. Invariably, we are privy to information that allows us to have regard to the wider picture, while, at the same time, being acutely aware of issues of public protection. As local Members, we are aware of acute concerns at local level, namely the immediate vicinity of the proposed hostel. We have all been there; we have all done that. It is vital that we find a way forward, for the reasons that I have given. The hostel performs a vital role in the probation service, and we must, therefore, get the relevant part of the Bill right.

<P>
I am happy that we have had a detailed debate, but I disagree with the conclusions reached by the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire. He has misunderstood what we propose. The Bill is not designed, in any shape or form, to circumvent the proper processes of local authority planning. That planning-and the related consultation-is the key to success. I am happy to look at ways in which we can reinforce the local authorities' planning role. I will gladly reflect on that matter, but I am adamantly opposed to substituting the Secretary of State for the local authority in that planning role. That would be a disaster, and I shall tell the hon. Gentleman why.

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> As I understand it, in my previous constituency the planning process was not part of the process of approval. The building in question already had planning permission for residential use of a similar kind, so the local authority had no role in its establishment as a bail hostel. In circumstances where there is a significant change of use, the ability to consult the local community would provide a useful belt and braces.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> That is the point-a significant change of use is a matter for the planning authority. Where a change of use is not significant, the matter will be determined, as it is now, on the basis of how best the probation service in question uses the resources at its disposal in order better to protect the public and carry out its task of rehabilitation.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Of course, consultation must form part of that process, but if it is to make any sense, the consultation process must be owned locally. Otherwise, because it is a matter for the Secretary of State, the local MP will be approached at the outset. Instead, the local ground should be prepared, and local people, the local authority and the local board should own the consultation process.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am going to finish, because this is an important point. If we were to include in the Bill provisions that do not belong there, people would be led to believe that matters would be dealt with in London, and that all they need do is contact their local MP. As a result, there would be no incentive to undertake the hard graft that delivers effective rehabilitation and public protection work on the ground. One does the hard graft by consulting local residents, involving local councillors-

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am going to finish my point. Certainly, if necessary, one turns to the good offices of the local MP to act as the honest broker. An MP's role is to broker the involvement of the local authority, the probation service, local people, the voluntary sector and the churches. The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire is absolutely right to refer to the potential healing and mediating role that such people can play in this regard. However, the Secretary of State and the Minister should not descend from on high and give edicts at the instigation of the local MP.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The hon. Gentleman will have his chance to make a speech in a minute. I resist the amendment because, where relevant, it would cut across the local planning process and create a diversion. If it were accepted, people would not own the consultation process at local board level.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Before the Minister finishes, will he give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I have more to say, but I give way to the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I may have inadvertently misunderstood-I thought that the Minister was concluding his speech. I am grateful to him for giving way.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire and I appreciate the seriousness with which the Minister is treating this issue. However, does he accept that, as the clause is currently drafted-its opening words are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State may approve-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the Secretary of State will inevitably be regarded as central to the process? This is not a question of party political controversy, and I agree with the Minister that we need to get matters right. However, he should recognise that, as the clause stands, local people will see the Secretary of State's role as central. Our amendment would introduce an element of local consultation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> In approving a particular hostel, the Secretary of State's role is not to use that approval to second-guess, circumvent or appeal against the proper decision of the local planning authority. The Secretary of State will have to approve the structure and management of a particular resource, in terms of its capacity to carry out its role as a hostel for the purposes of the board. That is different from the Secretary of State seeking to intervene, circumvent or second-guess the local authority's planning role, which is its proper function, as my hon. Friends have said. They are difficult matters for the Secretary of State in relation to approval. It is invariably my practise and that of my predecessors, or at least the ones who are known to me, to ensure that I am always accessible to hon. Members who have concerns in this regard. I assure the members of the Committee that that will continue to be the case. Of course, the Secretary of State and Ministers must take soundings and listen to messages from a cross-section of the community. However, that must be done, as it is under the existing arrangements, not on the basis of a statutory provision, with all the risks that that entails and which I have outlined, but as part of a process of approving a hostel that must be fit to deliver the service. Consultation is owned locally and I do not want the role of the local board and the local authority to be circumvented by the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> The Minister is showing that at least he understands the concerns, which is welcome. I urge him to reflect that the clause appears, or appeared to me, to give the Secretary of State considerable power to impose an inappropriate bail hostel on a local community. I urge the Minister to double check that the planning situation is as he believes it is. If a local probation board wished to turn a YMCA hostel into a bail hostel, even though it was inappropriate, would it be a planning issue or would the Secretary of State decide the appropriateness of the conversion?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I shall certainly look at the crossover between the clause and planning legislation to make sure that nothing in the clause circumvents or undermines the proper functioning of local planning law. I am convinced that that is where the decisions must take place.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> This have been a useful debate. The Minister will understand that both sides of the Committee have genuine concerns. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre for what he said. Both he from a previous incarnation and perhaps the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs Humble), who was chairman of the Lancashire social services committee at the time of the controversy in which I was involved, may have a clear recollection of the concerns that were expressed by all parties. In fairness to the hon. Lady, who has not contributed to the debate, I should say that a number of her party colleagues in my then constituency were helpful to me. It was an all-party campaign, because there was strong feeling among councillors and active members of all the political parties that the site that had been identified as a possible site for a bail and probation hostel was not appropriate, for the reasons that I have set out.

<P>
I welcome the Minister's response to the last intervention by my hon. Friend the Minister for Mid-Worcestershire, who referred to a hostel in his previous constituency that already existed but for which a different use was being proposed. The Minister said that he was prepared to talk to officials and to consider the matter further. As I understand it, in my hon. Friend's case, an appropriate planning consent for a particular use already existed, so there was no need for a fresh planning application. It is precisely because that can happen with any building that, if the Secretary of State is to be given these powers-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State may approve-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the Bill should include either our additional words requiring consultation or something similar.

<P>
I shall not press the amendment to a vote, because of the helpful and serious way in which the Minister responded, for which I thank him. He said that he is prepared to reconsider the matter. I am sure that we shall wish to return to it both in another place and on Report.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire referred to a case where a building was already being used and had appropriate planning consent for something within the probation service's remit. However, a building may have an existing planning use and, even though it has not yet been used as a bail hostel, the local probation services may see no need to make a planning application. If I recall correctly the details of the case in my previous constituency, although the building had never been a bail hostel-the case not not identical to my hon. Friend's-it already had the required planning consents from its earlier history under different ownership. If I recall correctly, everybody accepted that the building was not appropriate and alternative acceptable premises were found in another part of the town. Therefore, there was no need for the local probation service to make a planning application. The interface between planning law and the Bill and its predecessor statutes is crucial, so I am hugely grateful to the Minister for saying that he will consider it carefully.

<P>
I hope that, having been advised by his officials, the Minister is prepared to accept something along the lines of amendment No. 76. If the Government table such an amendment, we shall consider it carefully. If it covers the point, we shall probably be able to accept it.

<P>
I know that the Minister respects the sincerity and passion with which we hold our views. Those of us who have been at the sharp end of these disputes-the Minister said that he has, which is clearly helpful-know that these are matters of huge concern to local people. Therefore, a provision that requires consultation with the county, borough and district councils and any other persons that the Secretary of State considers appropriate should be included in the Bill. That is why my hon. Friend for Mid-Worcestershire was right in his response to the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead.

<P>
This is not an exclusive amendment. We are not trying to write anybody out of the consultation process; we want it to be all-inclusive. However, I urge the Minister to bear in mind that we feel strongly. As the Secretary of State has responsibility for approval in the clause, and therefore the issue will already be before him, that takes it out of the heat of the local battle. We feel strongly that the Government should reconsider the issue. We are grateful to the Minister for saying that he is prepared to do so and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 50, in page 5, line 14, after ``is'', insert ``consistently''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 51, in page 5, line 14, leave out from ``it'' to end of line 16.

<P>
No. 55, in page 5, line 18, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) The Secretary of State may not make a management order unless he has received a report on the local board made under section 7 during the period of three months prior to the making of the order.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 52, in page 5, line 31, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4A) A management order shall be effective for such period (not greater than 12 months) as the Secretary of State shall specify in the order.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 53, in page 5, line 32, after ``time'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`during the specified period mentioned in subsection (4A)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 54, in page 5, line 38, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) Upon the expiry or revocation of a management order, the Secretary of State shall not make another management order in respect of the board until 12 months have elapsed since the expiry or revocation, unless in his opinion and that of the chief inspector a change of circumstances warrants the making of a further order.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The amendments cover a number of important issues. Amendment No. 50 would ensure that a management order would be issued only if there were consistent failure. How do the Minister and his officials intend failure to be judged? Important issues are involved here. We recognise that there could be circumstances in which a management order might be necessary, but we hope that the Minister will be able to give us some examples and criteria for the judgment to be made. We thought that to add the idea of consistent failure would be a helpful change. Because of the rule in Pepper v. Hart, whatever the Minister says in response will be helpful.

<P>
Amendment No. 51 is a probing amendment to invite the Minister to state who will be the judge of good value. We are not suggesting that there is anything wrong with the concept of good value, but we have had misgivings about what the Government have described as best value in the context of other legislation.

<P>
Amendment No. 55 would ensure that the Secretary of State could make an order only in the aftermath of a report from the chief inspector. We anticipate that the Government will argue that that might fetter the Secretary of Stat's discretion to intervene when things appear to be going wrong, but there should be an up-to-date and thorough assessment of what is happening with any board. The Government may say that that is what they have in mind, but it would do no harm to put that in the Bill.

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment No. 52, to which amendment No. 53 is consequential, would limit the management order to a maximum of 12 months. Surely an indefinite power should not be given to the Secretary of State. Committee members referred earlier to the wide powers that he is given in the Bill and we simply want to limit those powers.

<P>
Amendment No. 54 would stop the Secretary of State making a further order until 12 months after the end of one order. It is common sense that the new board should be given adequate time in which to get to grips with its work after one order has expired. I hope that the Minister will take that amendment in the spirit in which it is intended and, at the very least, consider that aspect. It would be helpful to give a new board a period of at least 12 months to get to grips with the issues arising.

<P>
We hope that such orders will not often, if ever, be necessary, but we want to test the boundaries of what the Government have in mind. I hope that the Minister will consider those matters seriously and that, if he cannot accept our amendments, he will consider tabling amendments on Report or in another place.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I support the hon. Member for Surrey Heath's amendments because they would make a bad clause better, but I shall speak on clause stand part as I oppose the clause as a whole.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> One of the difficulties that has arisen under the present legislation is that the remedial action that can be taken if a probation committee is failing to deliver a good quality service is limited and can be exercised only when the standard of performance has reached a critically low level.

<P>
Clause 10 makes more effective intervention possible when local boards may be failing to perform their statutory functions or to secure good value for money in their stewardship of the service's resources. It gives the Secretary of State the power, in those circumstances, to make an order changing the composition of the local board and to replace any of the board members, including the chair and chief officer, or the entire membership of the board.

<P>
It is important to understand that the measure would not be used lightly, but would improve the quality and standard of the service provided, so we shall resist the amendments. Clause 10 refers to the powers to contracting out the entire responsibilities of a local board if it is failing to perform its functions or if its arrangements for so doing are not good value for money.

<P>
Amendment No. 50 seeks to tease out the clause's intentions by proposing the need for a consistent failure to perform. We are unable to accept that. Nor do we accept amendment No. 51, although I understand its probing nature. It would be damaging to accept these amendments, as they would make it impractical to use the power given to the Secretary of State under clause 10. It might not be appropriate to make a management order hastily, within three months of a formal inspection. We cannot accept such a limit, as suggested in amendment No. 55. It might be better to allow the board time to agree an action plan for improvement and to demonstrate whether it could follow such a plan. We do not want to rush into these proceedings. Our aim is to turn the service round, and to take this action only if it is absolutely necessary to do so. When it is necessary, we want to be able to do it effectively.

<P>
Providing good value for money will be an important part of the board's remit. Specific failings should be tackled by contracting out if it is clear that such an alternative arrangement could offer better value to the taxpayer. A management arrangement that could not last for more than 12 months, and that could be renewed only if circumstances changed-as suggested by amendment No. 52-would not be practical. No contractor would want to take on such a short-term contract that had no scope for renewal. No one could be expected to turn round a failing service in such a short time.

<P>
For those reasons, the amendments would unnecessarily fetter the power of the Secretary of State. They are unduly inflexible and would be detrimental to the effective use of the clause and the proper management of the improvement in the service that is being sought. We are, therefore, unable to accept them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I shall be very brief, especially as we are about to have a stand part debate. I have listened to what the Minister has said. I do not accept that he is right to criticise the amendments in the way that he has. However, these issues will be re-examined in another place and on Report. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The clause, as we have heard, gives the Secretary of State default powers to take over the core services of local probation boards and, as the Minister said earlier, to contract out the entire services of those boards. That would fill in the gaps that the Minister was quite happy to leave in clause 8, which gave the Secretary of State similar powers over the support services.

<P>
Clause 10 will give the Secretary of State similar draconian powers to those taken by another Secretary of State in the Local Government Act 1999. The Liberal Democrats opposed those powers, believing that local electors have the power to remove councillors if they are fialing to deliver services effectively. The Minister will not be surprised to discover, therefore, that we shall oppose such powers in this Bill.

<P>
I know that these are not exact parallels, because the Bill does not cover locally elected boards. However, in a sense, these provisions represent an even greater example of belt and braces for the Home Secretary, because in this case he will not have to rely on the vagaries of local elections to put the people he wants on local boards. He will appoint those people to the boards himself. He already has the power, under schedule 1, to remove members of the boards individually or collectively. He should not, therefore, need further powers to ensure that effective delivery of a service by people whom he has put in place to carry out plans that he has proposed.

<P>
The clause states that the test of failure for a board will be whether it appears to the Secretary of State that the board is failing. A much stronger test than the subjective judgment of the Home Secretary should be necessary before such powers are exercised, if they are to be introduced at all. In any case, without adequate resources a board may not be able to deliver all that the Secretary of State wants. The Home Office expects a greater work load from probation officers, with more cases being supervised and more reports written. There will also, as we discussed in a previous Committee, be a complete cultural change for some existing probation officers who will have to fit in with the requirements of a national service.

<P>
However, in the past five years, staffing levels and budgets in the probation service have been cut. Nothing in the Bill will force the Home Secretary to ensure that a certain level of resources is given to the service or to boards each year. I am sure that the Minister will respond by saying that he can foresee few circumstances in which a Home Secretary would exercise those powers. In view of the other powers that the Bill will give to the Home Secretary, this is a power too much-we should deny it to the Home Secretary.

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Clause 10(3) will allow the Secretary of State to set up a management arrangement with a contractor and to reconstitute the local board in accordance with that arrangement. In other words, the contractor will have to fulfil all the functions and responsibilities of a local board, and he will be subject to all the requirements, controls and inspections that apply to any other board. The process will not provide the Home Secertary with excessive powers. The powers are necessary to improve the quality of the service, to safeguard and better protect the public and to ensure that the business of public protection and rehabilitation is effectively delivered. Under those powers, the board's composition will be changed from the standard format that is referred to in schedule 1 so that it reflects the contractors's management structure.

<P>
We regard the use of that power as the final stage in a process that starts with the on-going assessment of a board's performance indicators, that involves inspection to ascertain the reasons for any failings, and that includes giving the board directions to help it to overcome failings. Only if there had been failures in all those respects-if the board was unable or unwilling to put its house in order-would we contemplate the use of the power to set up a management arrangement that would, in effect, contract out the entire board and all its activities.

<P>
The power is undoubtedly necessary and will give the Home Secretary the tool that he needs to ensure that the public are protected and that rehabilitation is delivered. Experience shows that such a power is necessary, and the Bill contains provisions to secure it.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
