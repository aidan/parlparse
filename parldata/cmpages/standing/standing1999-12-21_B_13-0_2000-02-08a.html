<P>

<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 6, in page 27, line 20, leave out `not'.
<P>
No. 7, page 27, line 22, leave out from `information' to end of line 26.
<P>
No. 62, clause 52, page 28, line 23, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
No. 8, in clause 52, page 28, line 30, leave out `not'.

No. 9, in clause 52, page 28, line 32, leave out from `information' to end of line 36.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Maclennan </B>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross): As I was saying, my anxiety about the issue that we are debating would be somewhat relieved if the Minister said whether he believed that it would be intolerable if Governments did not conform to the rulings of the Commissioner. Can the Minister see any way of avoiding the problems that have arisen in relation to the local ombudsman of rulings being largely a matter of the free options of local authorities?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> It would be rare for a Minister to overrule a recommendation by the Information Commissioner. Indeed, it is our intention that that should be the case because, in reaching a decision, a Minister would take proper legal advice as well as advice from officials. The advice that he received would then be subject to the view formed by the Information Commissioner and, in deciding whether to disclose information, any Minister would weigh heavily the commissioner's opinion. For the Minister to go against the view of the Information Commissioner would be an exceptional course of action. It is possible to conceive of such a situation, but it would be rare.
<P>
On the question of how we envisage that the Bill will apply to local authorities, we imagine that local authorities will give the Information Commissioner's views a great deal of importance and credibility. I hope that it will be rare for a public authority, other than a Minister, to overrule the commissioner's view. The right hon. Gentleman has already outlined the Government's approach towards the parliamentary commissioner. He raised his concern, which I know is shared by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher), that the local authority ombudsman is given less deference by some local authorities, although not all. I shall examine that issue, which is a legitimate area of debate. We must be careful not to create a greater democratic deficit. There are already too many such deficits in our constitution, and we are trying to address them. We must consider how to create the right combination of constitutional checks and balances to frame a freedom of information system that works. That is what we seek and intend to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Fisher </B>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central): As always, the Under-Secretary is such a pleasant and nice human being that, listening to him reassuring the Committee with words such as ``I hope'' and ``very rare'', one might suggest that he is the Delia Smith of the Committee Room. It is all calm, bland and organised, and, just as there will never be a crease in Miss Smith's pinafore, the Under-Secretary will always live in a world where every other Minister is as nice as he is and is never under pressure or fighting for the credibility of a Department or of the Government. It is so seductive to listen to the Under-Secretary that one finds oneself nodding sagely at his reasonably balanced and wise words.
<P>
I fear, however, that the world is rougher than that. The problems about which I am concerned will occur only when something extreme has gone wrong. Ministers release information in the normal course of events; the Bill merely requires them to release rather more. The Information Commissioner will be asked to make a judgment on Ministers only in extreme circumstances. When such circumstances arise, Ministers will have to fight toughly to preserve their original judgment, which may be very well based. They will fight hard and will not say ``Ah well'' and give up. It will be a sight tougher than the Under-Secretary is suggesting.
<P>
My hon. Friend referred to the parliamentary commissioner, and the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) made a good point in that context. However, we should bear it in mind that the parliamentary commissioner does not deal with hard-edge issues such as those in question. As hon. Members discover to our cost when we apply to him on behalf of our constituents, the parliamentary commissioner deals with a narrow range of matters relating to maladministration and process. That is often frustrating for an hon. Member who believes that his constituent has a good case. The anger, tension and vested interest is not nearly as acute in the matters considered by the parliamentary commissioner as in the contentious and charged issues that will be considered by the Information Commissioner.
<P>
The Under-Secretary will remember the case of Lady Porter and Westminster city council, in which tempers became frayed on both sides. People's careers and livelihoods were called into question and some people were broken, including senior Conservative councillors. At lot of money was at stake, both for Lady Porter and for Westminster ratepayers. Merely listening to the sane advice and recommendation of the commissioner will not be enough in such cases.
<P>
If I heard the Under-Secretary aright, he told the Committee that he would reconsider the way in which the Bill dealt with local authorities. Perhaps I am merely being charmed by his benign view of the world, but I detected that he might reconsider other proposals. I may just have got under his guard this morning, and the prospect of letting all local authorities have the final say on whether they should release information may not be quite as appealing to him or to the Home Secretary as it was at first. I am rather encouraged by his remarks. He did not say that he would reconsider the other public bodies included in schedule 1, which do not come under his democratic deficit argument, as we have already rehearsed. I am not conceding the point—I remain sceptical—but he has a case. I hope that, when he considers local authorities, he will also consider the role of the non-departmental bodies in schedule 1 because the same argument applies. I am not sure that he wants the Arts Council to have the final say and to be its own judge and jury. Given that, and in the hope that the Under-Secretary is as nice as he seems and that he will reconsider the matters constructively, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(whether or not already recorded)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): The wording of the clause seems, at first sight, satisfactory, as it allows the Information Commissioner to require information. The problem comes when the interpretation clause—clause 82—is applied to the word ``information'' That clause defines ``information'' as recorded information. If the commissioner is to do her job and investigate a case properly, she might have to require information that is not recorded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> It might assist the hon. Gentleman if I say, having looked at amendment No. 170, that he has a point. I accept the principle but would like to consider whether the word change is appropriate. We want to consider tabling an amendment along those lines to clarify the position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am most grateful to the Under-Secretary. This is the second time that I have tabled an amendment that has secured at least the partial approval of the Under-Secretary.
<P>
Obviously, other bodies in the United Kingdom with an investigatory function, such as the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, the Health and Safety Executive and the Comptroller and Auditor General, have such powers of investigation. There is a similar provision in the legislation controlling the Canadian and Irish information commissioners. It seems sensible to ensure that the commissioner has the fullest possible powers to investigate.
<P>
Given what the Under-Secretary has said, and the fact that he will study the matter carefully, I look forward to his further considerations and will not move amendment.

<H5>4.45 pm</H5>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 171, in page 28, line 24, after `I', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or with a practice recommendation under section 47(1)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Buoyed by the success of my previous effort, I shall try again. The intention is to include the practice recommendations that the commissioner may make under an earlier clause, and so make them legally binding. I suspect that we shall rehearse arguments about the commissioner's determination of questions of discretionary disclosure. The arguments are as, or even more, compelling here.
<P>
The commissioner will make practice recommendations if a public body consistently fails to meet the standards required. It seems illogical that the commissioner may note the errors in a body's practice but have no sanction to ensure that practice is changed for the better.
<P>
We had an interesting discussion earlier, during which the Under-Secretary said that putting a non-elected official in the place of the democratic procedures to determine such changes would be a dangerous precedent. There is ample precedent for a public authority being found not to meet requirements laid down in statute—or not to meet them adequately—and it being served notice to improve or to face sanctions.
<P>
Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary might inspect a force and note areas requiring improvement if the force is to do its job effectively. Were improvement not forthcoming, the inspector might refuse to sign a certificate of efficiency and the force would pay a penalty as a result. Similarly, the social services inspectorate examining a social services department, or a set of homes providing public services, may order improvements in running. If the order is not complied with, the sanction exists of the Secretary of State removing the certification. The Office for Standards in Education may require a school to be put under special measures, with a sanction if specified improvements are not made.
<P>
Extraordinarily, the commissioner may identify a public body failing in its duties and recommend an improvement in practice. The circumstances in which the commissioner may do that are set out in an earlier clause as being when a public authority behaves obstructively, fails to advise applicants of the way in which they should exercise their rights, recklessly discloses trade secrets without consulting the owner of the data as envisaged in guidance, agrees to confidentiality clauses in contracts without good reason or refuses information without informing applicants of their rights to complain.
<P>
Clause 44 covers such infringements. However, when the commissioner has made a practice recommendation, the authority can say, ``Well, I'm sorry, but we are going to carry on doing exactly as we have done before. We will wait for each individual instance of malpractice to be complained about by a member of the public or another body.'' That is not sensible. If the practice recommendation is to mean anything, there needs to be a punitive sanction to require an authority to mend its ways. The purpose of the practice recommendation is to ensure best practice. It should not be the permissive duty that we discussed earlier. It is illogical to allow the commissioner to make a practice recommendation under clause 44 without creating a legally binding sanction on an authority that fails to comply. Does the Under-Secretary recognise that?

<P>

<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): There have been times when the Conservative party has not agreed with the Liberal Democrats. I suspect that this is one of them. I am not sure whether the enforcement notice mechanism in clause 52 is an appropriate tool to force public authorities to comply with the code of practice. I am not convinced that we can enforce a code of practice in that way. However, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) has a point. I have searched my memory for how we left matters when we discussed clause 47. This issue, like many others, has been left hanging in the ether.
<P>
We debated part III provisions at some length. I was concerned that the commissioner did not have enough power to ensure compliance with the code of practice. If that is what the amendment seeks to achieve, then I have some sympathy with it, but it would not be right to do that through the enforcement notice. As we said in our debate on clause 48, part III is advisory in its nature. But clause 52 provides the commissioner with a powerful tool, which would be more powerful if it referred to clause 13. However, the Under-Secretary is unmoved on that argument.
<P>
I doubt whether the enforcement notice mechanism is right, but the hon. Gentleman has a point in daring to persuade the Government to ensure that the commissioner should have a power to ensure that public authorities take notice of her recommendations on good practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Amendment No. 171 would allow the Information Commissioner to issue an enforcement notice when public authorities fail to comply with a practice recommendation that has been given by the commissioner under clause 47. Failure to comply with the steps that are specified in the enforcement notice carry sanctions under clause 53. The intention of the amendment is to make practice recommendations legally enforceable. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome had his way on the previous amendment, but he will not do so on this one.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) is right, although he qualified what he said by stating that the enforcement mechanism would probably not be the right mechanism to make something legally enforceable. The Information Commissioner should be able to tackle failure to comply with the code of practice, and clause 47 enables her to do so. It is true that practice recommendations are not legally binding on a public authority; the codes are not intended to be legally enforceable instruments. They are intended to provide guidance on good practice, but the matters that they cover cannot be reduced to detailed, clear, prescriptive requirements that would be suitable for enforcement by all public authorities in the same way as hard law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Clause 47 is specific; it is not the broad sweep of good practice that the Minister claims. It provides for exercising certain functions under the legislation that do not conform with the code of practice, and specifies the steps that should be taken for promoting such conformity. It is a prescription for a given authority, yet the Minister says that it should not be backed by sanctions.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am saying that when a specific issue is raised, the Information Commissioner can deal with it, but the code is not intended to be an all-purpose, detailed prescription as to how every public authority should deal with an appeal system. For example, the systems of decision taking and other matters in respect of freedom of information in the Home Office will be entirely different from those in a general practitioner's surgery. The approach of a Department in dealing with a individual's request will differ in substance and degree from that of a GP, who might be dealing with a drugs company that is seeking information about his drug-prescribing practices. The two situations are entirely different and, having considered the guidance in the codes of practice, public authorities will be best placed to set up the mechanisms which comply with the broad-brush approach set out by the Information Commissioner in the codes of practice.
<P>
Trying to enforce details that would apply to a Department and to a GP's practice would mean encompassing, in words, different rules for different circumstances. That would create a complex and difficult situation. The usual approach to codes of practice—
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me, I shall explain my argument.
<P>
Trying to enforce hard laws on such cases will create more difficulty than is necessary. Assistance needs to be provided by codes and guidance, not by prescriptive requirements. Administrative procedures require flexible interpretation by the commissioner and are thus best dealt with in codes of practice. A public authority will have to take practice recommendation very seriously, as it will set out the steps that it needs to take to conform with the code of practice. If she wished to do so, the commissioner could name in her annual report any authority that failed to comply with the code after a practice recommendation had been issued, and continue to do so for as long as it failed to comply. For a public authority, that would be a serious matter.
<P>
However, in terms of taking a decision on whether a piece of information had been properly processed, it would be open for the information commissioner or a tribunal or court to consider how, if it were relevant, a public authority complied with a guidance note or code of practice in making its decisions. The Information Commissioner could draw any failure to comply with a practice direction to the attention of the public authority, which we would hope would comply. If it failed to do so she could name and shame the authority. We suspect that that would usually get it to comply. Otherwise, whenever there was a decision to be made on an application, it would be in considerable difficulty, as it would be failing to comply with the code of practice and procedures set up by the Information Commissioner. That could be taken into consideration.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked why recommendations under clause 47 should not be made enforceable in each case. Each case will involve a broad situation not reducible to clear prescriptive rules, and we do not believe that the commissioner's interpretation of the code in particular instances should be elevated to the status of a legally binding determination. It will not be that; it will be her recommendation on how to interpret the general rules and the code in one case.
<P>
It is part of the constitutional framework of administrative law in this country that clear prescriptive rules are established, where appropriate, which must be followed, and that authority is given to officials or Ministers to provide regulations. Those may or may not be legally enforceable but, particularly if they are guidance on running an administrative system, they are likely to set out principles rather than the details of procedures that must always be used. We are dealing with a different legal animal; we are concerned with advising on principles, not prescribing procedures in every case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The burden of the Under-Secretary's argument is concerned with a proposal that I have not put to the Committee. Had I wished to insert clause 44 into the clause, I should understand why he is explaining that we are dealing with generalities and that my proposal would be unenforceable, but I am not doing that. I am attempting to back up clause 47, which is much narrower than he suggests. The amendment is not an attempt to apply the same rules to the Minister of State, Home Office and a doctor's surgery. It deals with specifics: cases where the commissioner has identified bad practice, which falls outside the scope of clause 44, which in turn interprets part I. It does not seem unreasonable that persistent infraction should result in some remedy.
<P>
I must not spend too long on an intervention, Dr. Clark, but some sanction beyond the simple naming and shaming that the Under-Secretary prays in aid as the answer to everything is not unreasonable. I do not believe that bad authorities will respond to being named and shamed. I am sorry, I wish I did believe it, but it is a view from the Minister, which is not reflected in reality.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Our view is that clause 47 follows from clause 44. Clause 47 relates only to the practical authorities pursuant to the code set out in clause 44. I am not sure how much further the amendment takes us. As a matter of principle, we do not need to set out a practice recommendation as a legally binding direction. The provisions as drafted would provide authority without necessarily involving the Information Commissioner in the detail of the practice that an organisation would have to comply with to satisfy the principles set out in guidance.
<P>
There is a limit to what the Information Commissioner should be required to do. It will be a tough enough job without the burden of a duty, or even a discretion, to undertake detailed evaluation of the procedures being carried out by a public authority in performing its duties. It is the public authority's responsibility, at the end of the day, to comply. If it fails to do so it will take the consequences in accordance with the way in which decisions are reached in these matters. The commissioner, tribunal or any court taking those decisions would take account of compliance or non-compliance with codes of practice or guidance. That approach is adequate, and I would need much more convincing of the need for greater prescriptiveness about detail. I am not now persuaded that it would be desirable to go further than we have proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I have listened carefully to the Under-Secretary and I understand his broad point that it is not desirable for every element of the code of practice, which deals in generalities, to be enforceable by law, because different ways of doing things may apply in different circumstances and a tight prescription for every authority in the country would be most unhelpful, but his argument continued almost to suggest lack of belief in clause 47, which he commended to us previously and which we have agreed should stand part of the Bill. The work involved under that clause, which he describes as arduous for the commissioner—and no doubt it would be, if it became common practice—would surely be done exceptionally, when the commissioner was convinced that an authority, knowingly or unknowingly, had made it a practice to disregard part I.
<P>
It is not unreasonable that a mechanism should exist, not to enforce the commissioner's view of how a practice should be carried out, but to require an authority's processes and methodology to be brought into conformity with the Bill. At the moment there is no sanction to ensure that that would happen, other than the threat of being named by the commissioner in the annual report.
<P>
There have been many occasions when authorities have, year after year, been named in official reports, and that has made not the blindest bit of difference. Often the authorities have continued to fail to adhere to best, or even adequate, practice. I observed that happening when I worked at the Audit Commission and I am aware of it with respect to the ombudsman and in other contexts. Simply naming an authority as a persistent offender or as not conforming to the Bill in all its practices will not be sufficient to persuade it to mend its ways.
<P>
I am not sure whether I understand the point of introducing clause 47 but not providing any way of ensuring that an authority takes such action as may be required to bring itself into conformity with the Bill. I agree with the Under-Secretary that it would be wrong to for the commissioner to issue to an authority a recommendation stating ``You will now do this in this way'', and for that authority to be brought before the courts if it does not implement the recommendation. It would be appropriate, however, to introduce a requirement for authorities to make their practice conform with the provisions. The procedure is open to challenge, as an authority that feels that the commissioner is not being fair in her interpretation of the Bill or that her recommendations are wrongly based can appeal to a tribunal for her proposals to be struck down.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I do not understand how the hon. Gentleman deals with the issue of principle involved, which is that the codes are guidance and not hard law. He is asking the Government to enable the Information Commissioner to designate a particular authority that has failed to comply with the code and to impose a hard law on it that will not apply to other authorities because, having considered its procedures, she believes that such prescriptions are appropriate. He is asking for the imposition on one authority of a hard law that will not apply to any of the other authorities covered by the legislation. Either he believes that the whole code is legally binding or he does not. We take the view that it should not be legally binding, and I have not heard a strong argument that it should be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> My answer is that the commissioner should be able to take a class action, as it were, against an authority. She should be able to say not only that an authority has adopted procedures that do not comply with the legislation in respect of a particular application, but that any application made to the authority and dealt with according to those procedures will be likely to be the same. I assume that a practice recommendation would deal with such matters and would point out that an authority was dealing inappropriately with applications for information made under the legislation. If the commissioner could give clear and enforceable guidance to the authority under such circumstances, she could prevent every single applicant for information who is treated ``wrongly'' by that authority from having to seek separate action on her part in order to achieve satisfaction.
<P>
The Under-Secretary is saying that he does not believe that that procedure is appropriate and that he does not want to make such a ruling legally binding. That is a difference of opinion; I understand his point of view and his reasons for expressing it. However, his approach seems to devalue recommendations on good practice made under clause 47. At the end of the day, such recommendations are whistling in the wind for the commissioner, who has no sanctions and no means of enforcing anything approaching good practice or of achieving broad conformity with the code or with part I.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman again tries to apply all the rules of precedent, which are very detailed and complex, to a code of practice that was never meant to be enforceable in the first place. It would have to be much more carefully drawn to be applied in the suggested manner and the guidance would have to come regularly before the House. His proposals would effectively give the Information Commissioner the unilateral power to make laws that is usually exercised by Parliament. With respect, I must say that the hon. Gentleman has not grasped how far he expects the Government to go. Furthermore, he has not dealt with the comments made by the hon. Member for Ryedale, who pointed out that the proposed enforcement notice was extremely forceful. Not only is the hon. Gentleman trying to extend into hard law matters that should never be included in legislation and applying precedent to the way in which they are dealt with but he is seeking to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut by introducing a enforcement notice to compel somebody to comply with an administrative system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Enforcement notices are issued in many such circumstances and are applied by a number of different agencies. I can see a clear order trail between clause 52, feeding back to clause 47 and then to clause 44, which feeds back to part I. Those sets of measures are intended to build one on another to ensure conformity with the Bill. The only gap that I can identify in that trail is the lack of sanction to ensure that the commissioner has a means of remedy when she has identified a persistent breach or infraction of part I.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Under-Secretary said that he did not want the recommendations to be enforced in the proposed manner, and we are not getting any further with arguments about that. Having had two minor victories in the previous two sittings, and in the hope of obtaining more, I shall not test his patience any longer. Some thought should be given to the means of dealing with a recalcitrant authority that will not accept practice recommendations or the fact that it keeps losing judgments before the commissioner and carries on in exactly the same way, following purblind practices that it is reluctant to change. The Bill does not provide scope for dealing with such authorities, which is a lacuna in the provisions.
<P>
Even if my proposal is not the best way of dealing with inappropriate procedures, there must be some means of bringing them home to an authority and causing it to change a practice that is held to be outwith the Bill, beyond referring to that authority in a report. We have given this topic a great deal of exercise and probably sufficient consideration I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

He has just told us what a serious matter an enforcement notice is.—[Interruption.] A serious matter, not a sinister one. Presumably, therefore, defiance by a public authority of an enforcement notice is quite a serious offence. As far as I can see, however, the penalty for defiance of an enforcement notice is that the commissioner may certify in writing to the court that such defiance has occurred. That is not a very severe penalty for what is clearly a serious offence.
<P>
Does the Under-Secretary think that public bodies will quail at the thought that the commissioner will send a letter to the High Court? I do not clearly understand what the High Court will do. It will receive the letter, open it and read that there is a deviation. Will the Minister describe the procedure and explain it to hon. Members who are less familiar with High Court rulings and with contempt of court?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend clearly believes in drinking the dregs at the last chance saloon.
<P>
The sanctions are fairly strong. The commissioner certifies in writing to the court that the public body has failed to comply with a notice. The court inquires into the matter and, after hearing evidence from witnesses and taking statements on behalf of the public authority, deals with the public authority as if it had committed contempt of court. If an individual is responsible for the failure to comply, he or she can be brought before the court. The penalty is that the court can punish the authority or individuals for contempt, which could result in two years' imprisonment or an unlimited fine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> For whom—the chief executive of the public authority?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The public authority could receive an unlimited fine. If someone is persistently in contempt of court as a result of failing to respond to a court order to comply with the legislation, he or she could be sent to prison. That person could be locked up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am delighted to hear that. I hope that people who are considering defying the Information Commissioner and her information and enforcement notices will, for reasons that are set out in Pepper v. Hart, read the Under-Secretary's words and realise what appalling prospects they face.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am sure that they will see that my hon. Friend is not as liberal as they may think.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 54 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>POWERS OF ENTRY AND INSPECTION</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Third schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> Having received the Under-Secretary's partial agreement to my earlier amendment on the powers of the commissioner to inquire of persons when in pursuit of an investigation, is there scope under paragraph 2 for power to be given to the commissioner to administer oaths that require people to give evidence? My right hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross tabled an amendment to that effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Thank you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> It is my recollection that schedule 3 mirrors a similar schedule in the Data Protection Act 1998. The powers, although draconian, are sensible.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I think that I have inadvertently misled the Committee by misinterpreting a nod from one of my officials for a yes.
<P>
Schedule 3 covers powers of entry and inspection. It provides the commissioner, with the authority of a warrant, to go into a building to inspect documents. The provisions replicate those on the Data Protection Commissioner in schedule 9 of the Data Protection Act. However, any suggestion that a warrant needs to be issued to authorise the commissioner or his officers or staff to administer and require persons to give evidence under oath is misguided. The commissioner has powers to obtain the information that she needs from a public authority under clause 51, by way of an information notice. She can issue an information notice when she requires information to deal with an application under clause 50, or when she requires information to determine whether an authority is complying with part I of the Bill or the Secretary of State's or the Lord Chancellor's code of practice.
<P>
There are sanctions for failure to comply. The commissioner has the power to certify to a court if a public authority fails to meet such a requirement, or when false information has been provided. If a certificate is made, the court has powers to take action and punish the public authority or individuals in it for contempt. That is in line with new civil procedure rules. A person who makes a statement of truth in relation to a document that contains a false statement is punishable for contempt. The punishment is an unlimited fine or two years' imprisonment. Provisions in clauses 51 and 53 achieve a similar end to that which is advocated by the Campaign for Freedom of Information. I hope that that clarifies the matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> It certainly clarifies that I am not on the roll that I thought I was.
<P>
Whether the Under-Secretary's interpretation holds water will depend on his revised wording to clause 51, which deals with non-recorded information. That should meet the issue. However, if that is not changed, all amendment will need to be tabled elsewhere.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 3 agreed to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Rumour has it that the Committee wishes to make progress, although this morning there was a discrepancy between aspiration and execution. If that is the case, the Chair, as always, will do all that it can to facilitate the wishes of the Committee. Therefore, I propose to put clauses in groups for approval, unless someone wants to speak to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> On a point of order, Dr. Clark. I have considerable sympathy with your proposal, but I want to catch your eye on clause 56 in part VI.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> Further to that point or order, Dr. Clark. I hope to catch your eye on clause 55.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am most grateful for that information.
<H4><center>Clause 55</center></H4>
<H4><center>No action against public authority</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I simply seek clarification I am puzzled by the clause heading,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``No action against public authority'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and the explanatory notes, which contain the same heading. They state that the clause
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``does not create any right to an injunction or to sue for damages for breach of statutory duty'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but that it allows
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the courts' judicial review jurisdiction.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the event of a failure to comply with the statutory duty, how can the aggrieved party find a remedy? I realise that that is probably satisfied by a straightforward point of law.
<P>
Let me give an example of a breach of duty. The issuance of information notices by the commissioner imposes duties on the commissioner. It requires her to give reasons relating to the information of which the public authority and the public might wish to avail themselves. The absence of such reasons would be a breach of statutory duty. It would be unfortunate if that went unremedied, but I am sure that it is a simple matter.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Clause 55 ensures that the Bill does not create a right to damages for breach of any duty under it. It does not affect the commissioner's power to issue enforcement notices, nor the courts' powers to punish failure to comply with the notices, and it does not affect the courts' judicial review jurisdiction. The commissioner will enforce the breach of statutory duty, and if the commissioner's orders are not complied with, the court can punish the authority for contempt. The provision does not mean that an authority will be given any immunity from a right of action that might otherwise arise in relation to any damage that it has caused, for example by its negligence in disclosing or not disclosing information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I understand that point, but I also understand that a statutory duty will be imposed on the commissioner. However, if the commissioner fails to discharge her duty, I am at a loss to understand how that will be dealt with. There is no reference to the public authority that is mentioned in the title to the clause, but the clause does seem to cover the commissioner.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If I understand the right hon. Gentleman correctly, he is asking how we would resolve a situation in which a public authority failed to comply with a request for information, and the matter was referred to the Information Commissioner, who then failed to comply with her statutory duty to enforce a right under the legislation. Such a situation would be resolved by way of judicial review because the commissioner would be subject to judicial review in the same way as any other administrative authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Surely the point at issue is not how that situation would be resolved, but what right to damages an applicant would have if he or she had been damaged by the failure either of the public authority or of the commissioner. Many of the examples that we have discussed in Committee show that much can depend on a piece of information. An applicant can be considerably damaged by a failure that is subsequently brought to light. How should such an applicant proceed? Does he or she have a right of action against a public body or the commissioner? Where should the applicant go to obtain protection?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The High Court would be able to consider the option of judicial review and ensure that the duty was enforced. However, I am reluctant to create a situation in which people feel that they can seek damages by bringing an action on other grounds, such as negligence or other areas of tort, and pursue the Information Commissioner for the sake of retrying the matter. For many good reasons of public policy, there are restraints on the constant retrial of such matters. If there is a failure to comply with a statutory duty, the High Court can intervene by way of judicial review. There is no right to damages as a result of breach of statutory duty under the Bill. If an applicant has a right to damages otherwise than under the Bill, due to negligence, for example, that right would be unaffected. We are not creating a new cause of action, which would enable an individual to pursue a case for negligence. The Information Commissioner will be subject to the usual oversight of the divisional court regarding the proper exercise of her duties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am sorry to labour the point, but as I am not a lawyer, I am confused and seek clarification from the Minister. I am sure we all agree that it is possible for circumstances to arise in which the information that the applicant wishes to have disclosed has enormous significance and value, and that the lack of that information could change a person's life. If such information is refused and the case goes to the commissioner, who finds that the public body should have released the information, by that time the damage will have been done. Will the effect of the clause be that, although the person has been damaged by the wrongful refusal of an authority to disclose information, he or she will have no recourse against the authority?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It is difficult to envisage a case in which the mere disclosure of information would give rise to a new cause of action. The cause of action would presumably arise as a result of other circumstances in which an individual has a claim against a public authority that withholds information of relevance to the individual's case, the matter is referred to the Information Commissioner who fails to discharge her duty, but by that time, the individual has suffered damages. In such a case the cause of action would not be in respect of the information, but in respect of the initial grievance, for example negligence or some dispute. If new evidence presents itself because the High Court subsequently decides that an Information Commissioner has failed to discharge her duty and the information must be disclosed, an individual may then disclose the new information to the court as part of the proceedings that he or she initially undertook in tort.
<P>
We do not want to create an entirely new cause of action and another basis on which an individual may sue a public authority for damages. If information is required for the pursuit of an existing cause of action, the relevant issue is whether the individual can enforce the disclosure of that information. In the case of default by the public authority and the Information Commissioner, the proper course of action will be judicial review. Then the information will become available and the individual may return to the High Court, or whichever court is involved, and pursue the case armed with that new information. The individual may then seek damages on whatever basis is appropriate. We are not in the business of creating a penalty system to make the Information Commission liable, on pain of damages, which may rightly be paid by another organisation. The danger of doing that would be that the Information Commissioner might be asked to provide information in a multi-million pound suit, become bankrupt as a result, and the state would be required to pay massive costs. That could create a serious problem.
<P>
The position is straightforward. Individuals can pursue the same cause of action and refer matters back to the court if new evidence is presented. However, a breach of statutory duty can be dealt with separately by the ordinary administrative law, through a Judicial review. Any information that is disclosed will become part of the original cause of action. We are not creating a new cause of action that will result in the payment of damages.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary for filling in my lack of legal understanding. I agree that it is in no one's interest to create a system in which the Information Commissioner can be sued. I also agree that in most cases the value of the information is its relevance to the original court case, which is where it should be pursued. However, I sense that there is something in between the two.
<P>
We are used to saying that information is valuable. The failure to get information from a public authority could be expensive. It could prevent individuals from applying for a contract or cause them to incur a loss in some other way. I can imagine circumstances in which the inability to obtain information could be damaging. If the commissioner decides that a public body has acted incorrectly and caused an applicant material loss, it would appear reasonable to a layman for the applicant to go back to the public body and say that it was wrong to deny him access to the information. He should be able explain to a court how the public authority's action cost him a great deal of money, or caused him pain or loss. Surely it is fair that he might want to seek damages from the public authority because its failure to subscribe to the law hurt him.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend is right to raise that matter. Let me give the example of a drugs company that wants information from a public authority on another company's research. That information is on the margins of commercial confidentiality and is worth a lot of money. The Information Commissioner may decide that it is a trade secret and not order disclosure, which has been refused by the public authority. As a result, the drugs company loses the patent and is billions of pounds worse off. Should it have the ability, if it is subsequently found that the Information Commissioner's interpretation of the law was wrong—
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> By the public authority?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> By the public authority and the Information Commissioner. My understanding is that my hon. Friend is concerned about the failure of the Information Commissioner to comply with her statutory duty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> No, I am interested in the public authority. When the Information Commissioner substantiates the applicant's request as being valid by subsequently finding in his favour, it is too late to put the genie back in the bottle. The pursuit is solely against the public authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We are not creating a new cause of action although the law of negligence might provide an alternative cause of action. Lawyers would have to determine whether there had been a breach of duty that was damaging. I could quote Hedley, Byrne and Co. v. Heller and Partners Ltd.—it all comes back to me.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
People will be able to resort to the normal proceedings that are contained in law. We do not want to create a new cause of action or produce substantial new liabilities for public authorities. We want them to comply with the Bill, but not because every wrong decision that they make could result in a court case. We do not want them to be beyond the competence of the Information Commissioner. The problem is that, in practice, an applicant would decide not to bother with Information Commissioner and take the action directly to the High Court. We are trying to establish a structure in which public authorities comply with codes of practice, guidance and laws and respect the Information Commissioner's views. It will be possible to appeal to a tribunal, and judicial review will govern the whole procedure. That structure would be rendered not so much redundant, but certainly less important, if commercial companies chose to have a binding decision that was delivered by the High Court.
<P>
I understand my hon. Friend's point. He wants to know whether it is possible for someone to lose out. The answer is yes, but we do not want to create a new action in the law of tort. We want to set up an administrative legal system, not a new civil tort procedure that might be used to circumvent administrative procedures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I accept the Minister's point; it would be undesirable to create a new law of tort. However, by avoiding that, we may inadvertently create an immunity for public authorities. Although they will be liable to the commissioner's sanctions if they ignore the Bill, they will be immune to damages. Given that the Under-Secretary concedes that damages could arise, that is not satisfactory. However, I am somewhat reassured by the idea that a case of negligence could be brought against an authority. Although we are creating duties for public bodies, we are also providing them with an immunity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I am reluctant to pursue this matter, but I am not satisfied with the Under-Secretary's response I accept that it might be undesirable to create an action that gives rise to damages, but other reliefs are open to the courts in the event of a failure to perform a duty. It is remarkable that injunctive relief has been banned because it is simpler than judicial review. It can also be pursued timelessly, which could be important. Judicial review is a considerable hammer to crack what might be a small nut. However, I shall take further advice on that. I remain unconvinced by what the Under-Secretary said about the effects—he seems to seek not only not to confer rights of action but to bar existing ones.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central constantly refers to Pepper v. Hart, and I bear that in mind. The objective is not to bar current causes of action. A current cause of action would be circumscribed only if a new cause of action, apart from those otherwise barred by the clause, was created. We are not creating a new cause of action. Current causes of action are included and will remain.

Clause 55 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 56</center></H4>
<H4><center>Appeal against notices served under Part IV</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I want to pursue briefly with the Under-Secretary the extent of the appeal provision when an applicant's request for information has not been satisfied. Such an applicant might appeal to the tribunal about a decision notice.
<P>
Clause 50(4) makes it clear that the commissioner may issue a decision notice if he considers that a public authority has failed to comply with clause 13, its claim to exemption or discretion being invalid. The applicant might be happy, but public authority could appeal. Alternatively, under clause 50(7), the commissioner might agree that a public authority had a valid discretion under subsections (2) or (3) of clause 13. He could not require release, but an information notice might require a public authority to have regard to the provisions of clause 13. It is important to take on board the Under-Secretary's earlier comments that the Government might be persuaded to strengthen the public interest requirements—a public interest case for the release of information could override the case of another interest for its not being releasing.
<P>
The information notice under clause 50(7) requires authorities to have regard to clause 13 and to comply with the provisions. The public authority might not have decided finally whether to release the information. Neither the applicant nor the authority would be happy. I wish to clarify whether it is intended that, at that juncture, an applicant could refer the matter to the tribunal on the grounds that, in his view, the authority did not have discretion.
<P>
We have two scenarios. First, the public authority might have thought that it had discretion under clause 13. The commissioner, however, might say that that was not so, and offer an information notice. The Home Secretary tried to make that point on Second Reading when we argued that the commissioner had no powers to compel release and that an authority had only to claim a clause 13 exemption to end the matter with no release of information. The Home Secretary's point was that that was not true because clause 50(4) allows the commissioner to say, ``I do not accept that you have a valid discretion and am issuing an information notice requiring you to release the information.'' No applicant would appeal against that.
<P>
The second scenario deals with the other side of the coin. What if the commissioner thought that the public authority had a valid exemption? Initially, it might issue a decision notice requiring the authority to have regard to the powers under clause 13, implying that information ought to be released. It might also specify the matters to which the public authority should have regard. That might seem encouraging for the applicant. However, he might think that the exemption was not valid. The appeal mechanism could be used to ask a tribunal to review the commissioner's decision that there was a valid exemption. If we are on all fours up to that point, the scenario could be said to include everything that is covered by the appeal mechanism in clause 56.
<P>
The commissioner might have ruled that there was a valid exemption but that, in her view, the public authority ought to have released the information. She might, recommend, under clause 48, the release of the information. Clause 50(7) and clause 48 could, conceivably, work simultaneously. But the Bill provides no mechanism by which the applicant may appeal to the tribunal if the public authority chooses to ignore the discretionary disclosure notice following such a conclusion by the commissioner. The commissioner can recommend only release. What would happen if that recommendation was ignored?
<P>
The applicant should have three opportunities.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is speaking partly to new clause 1. That is in order, but I hope that he will bear that in mind when we reach the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Indeed I shall, Dr. Clark, the two matters are related. New clause 1 was tabled as a way of signalling that the complainant should have such an opportunity.
<P>
I am trying to confirm with the Under-Secretary that the opportunity that new clause 1 would provide is not covered by clause 56. I do not believe that it is. Clause 56 allows the applicant to appeal to the tribunal only if he thinks that the exemption— claimed by the public authority and supported by the commissioner—was not valid. He could ask the tribunal to review the commissioner's decision. However, the clause does not give him the opportunity to ask the tribunal to review a failure by a public authority to abide by a discretionary disclosure notice.
<P>
It is important to discuss the matter now because, as I have noted, the production of a discretionary disclosure notice and a decision notice under clause 50(7) that would confirm that the commissioner considered the claim to exemption to have validity, might coincide. The applicant would not receive the discretionary disclosure notice, which goes only to the public authority. He will know from the decision notice made under subsection (7) only that the commissioner believes that a valid exemption may apply, and that is what he might want to appeal against. The real opportunity required by an applicant is that of asking the tribunal to review a failure to disclose information whose disclosure was recommended by the commissioner. I hope that that point is clear.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We go back to the essence of the disagreement. The Government's view is that the public authority decides and the Information Commissioner reviews. The public authority will be responsible for much of the decision making provided for by the Bill. Failure to comply with a recommendation made by the commissioner is not appealable, as a public authority will have to decide whether to comply. That is not an appealable or separate matter but it may be one for judicial review.
<P>
Clause 13 has nothing to do with the claiming of exemptions and deals only with the exercise of discretion. The commissioner's discretion in relation to a decision taken under clause 13 is limited to the matters specified in clause 50(7). Disclosure cannot be ordered pursuant to clause 13. I shall work my way through the overall procedure. An applicant can ask for information from an authority and can complain under clause 50 if that authority refuses to disclose it. The commissioner can then determine whether an exemption applies. If she thinks that an exemption does apply, she can take a decision in relation to the limited matters referred to in clause 50(7). The applicant can appeal against a decision determining that an exemption applies, and the authority can appeal against a decision that an exemption does not apply. There is no right of appeal, however, against failure to comply with a recommendation made under clause 48. That goes to the heart of the concept of who has the final say on disclosures made under clause 13.
<P>
I can see why the hon. Gentleman. wants a right of appeal, in accordance with his general views, but the Government believe that such a right is unnecessary. That is why we must return to the core of this long-standing issue. The applicant may ask the commissioner to review a failure to disclose requested information. That procedure covers disclosures made under clauses 1 and 13, but is limited in relation to decisions made by the commissioner under clause 13. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that no appeal can be made to a tribunal in relation to a failure to comply with any recommendation. Under clause 48(3), the discretionary disclosure notice will go to the applicant as well as to the authority.
<P>
We have come back to where we were earlier. I see the hon. Gentleman's point, but I have set out the Government's view, which is that we do not need such proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The debate has provided an introduction to consideration of new clause 1. I shall keep my remaining remarks for that discussion.

<H4><center>Interpretation of Part VI</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I seek the Under-Secretary's guidance on how the clause should be interpreted. It seems to contain two problems and one uncertainty. The first problem is the wording of subsection (2), which I understand is very similar to that of section 10(2) of the Public Records Act 1958. It is good news that public records legislation is being brought into conjunction with freedom of information legislation, and I wholeheartedly approve of that, but I must ask what the clause means in practice. What is meant by the reference to records that are created on different dates but filed together? Does that mean that the operative date for disclosure is inevitably the date of the last document filed? How would that apply to a file that is kept open for a considerable period, perhaps many years, simply because it contains sequential information? Does the clause mean that an earlier document effectively remains undisposed of until 30 years has elapsed from the date on which the last document was added to the file?
<P>
The second problem is applying the words of the 1958 Act in a new context, after the advent of new technology. What might the words ``other assembly'' mean in the computer age? Many of the files referred to could now be kept not on paper but as computer records. Does the term ``other assembly'' have a meaning in cyberspace, or should it be defined more accurately? For example, does it mean that all files held on a computer could be presented as the single assembly within which information is held? Does it relate to discrete files held within a computer system? What is the exact meaning?
<P>
I now come to the uncertainty. Is the clause primarily intended to deal with the annual release of information by the Public Record Office or does it apply equally to specific requests for information made by members of the public on specific files? Is the former dealt with differently from the latter? The annual release of information is helpful, and bringing it within the Bill's scope is all for the better. The Bill should not, however, thus impede application by a member of the public for specific information that falls into general conformity with the clause but is within a wider file and might therefore be held for a longer period.
<P>
I have outlined two problems in relation to a request for information and expressed my uncertainty about a third point. An explanation from the Under-Secretary would assist the Committee in considering the clause as a whole.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I look forward to the Minister's reply to the hon. Gentleman, who raised many of my own concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The aim is to give citizens, for the first time, a statutory right of access to information held by a wide range of public bodies. That right will extend not only to information in those authorities' current records but to information in any historical records that they may have. Part VI of the Bill would replace the largely discretionary provision for access to public records under the Public Records Act 1958 with a new statutory regime. I share the view of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that the change is desirable and welcome.
<P>
Clause 61 defines the expression ``historical record'' for the purpose of part VI as a record 30 years old, counting from the calendar year following that in which it was created. Where records are kept in a file, the 30 years and the other periods mentioned in clause 62 are reckoned from the calendar year following that in which the most recent was created. I think that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
An example—probably a bad one in many ways—is the Casement diaries, which most people probably know about. They covered a long period, but related primarily to the period of the trial. The issue to be determined is when counting would begin for something of that kind, with entries covered by a series of dates. The answer is that it would begin from the last diary entry date—or the date on which it became a matter of a public document. That would probably be about the time when it came into the hands of a public authority. However, in the example that I gave, the document was considerably older.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Does the Minister really feel that that is satisfactory? Could it not be very unsatisfactory in some circumstances? I see the problem with an apparently cohesive document such as a diary, but if the information on a file about an investigation into a disaster or the question of war criminals was about to be released under the 30-year rule, new information might come to light and be added to the file. Would that then freeze all the information that had been on the brink of release? Would it not be possible to disaggregate files? It seems very unsatisfactory that precisely because a matter was of current interest, a new piece of information could neuter the process of disclosure.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend rightly wonders whether someone could prevent disclosure of a file that contained embarrassing information, which remained somewhat embarrassing after 30 years, by popping in a new bit of information so that the counting began again. The answer is no. It is possible to disaggregate information. Essentially, we are interested in documentation that is clearly of a certain date, 30 years from which it will be disclosable. It is not intended that anyone should be able to interfere with that by adding extra information. That would be to create a new document.
<P>
The Bill is less about access to files or documents than about access to information. Information may well be a line in a document, or just one sentence. If the request is for one piece of information with a specific date, that date would be the relevant one.
<P>
A file is not just a collection of records arranged physically or logically. Good practice is followed by Departments, which ensures that files are not kept open indefinitely, but are closed every five years or so. That good practice will form part of the Lord Chancellor's code of practice under clause 45. Let us not forget that the purpose of the provisions is to remove exemptions at the end of 30 years. At any point, a person could seek information, and the request would have to be dealt with in accordance with the Bill. There is no question of historical records in some way being exempt from a right of access under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am much heartened by what my hon. Friend says, which seems common sense. I am glad to hear what he says about the Lord Chancellor's guidelines or requirements for files. However, clause 61(2) does not state what we have been told. In fact, it states the contrary—that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``all the records in that file . . . are to be treated for the purposes of this Part''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as having been created on the one date. Whereas I am delighted by the Minister's constructive explanation, the Bill, unless I have misread it, seems to state something different.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We are dealing with the publication of historical records. We must be aware that people's specific requests for information might not relate to material that had to be held for 30 years. Where an exemption squarely applied, on grounds, perhaps, of national security, the 30-year rule would become relevant.
<P>
The Public Record Office will be a public authority for the purposes of the Bill and will have to deal with specific requests in accordance with the Bill. Part VI does not impose limitations on that. It is an important point. The date in clause 61(2) is the date on which records become historical, not the date on which the freedom of information legislation begins to apply. In fact, at 30 years, more information, which had been covered by exemptions, might be available under the Bill. The Lord Chancellor's code of practice would deal with the period for which a file would be kept open. If not transferred, information could be obtained from the originating Department rather than the Public Record Office.
<P>
Our aim is to ensure that the Public Record Office will operate in a clear, consistent manner. A question may arise, for example, about the date on which a document detailing events from the past 10 years becomes a historical document. The clock starts ticking at the point when the document becomes available to the public authorities. However, information in it could well be 10 years old, because, like a diary or a report, the document could cover events over a period of years. In those circumstances, the clock will not start ticking at the beginning of the 10 years. That would be illogical. The time will run from the date on which it is clear that a document of that nature comes into the hands of a public authority, and the public authority is able to use it. I cannot take it much further than that, although my hon. Friend may wish to intervene.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I can see that my hon. Friend is trying to be helpful, and I am cheered by what he says, as long as I understand it. However, there is a disparity between what my hon. Friend says and what is in the Bill, and I hope that he will reconsider the measure in that light.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I will ensure that the clause states what we intend it to state. My reading of the proposal is that it is all right, but as my hon. Friend has some doubts about it I will look at the measure. It might be helpful if I write to him to confirm my interpretation of the clause, and perhaps he will pass the information to those whom he has been assisting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> What the Under-Secretary said has helped the Committee a great deal. The lingering doubt is that the way in which the proposal will work is dependent on the Lord Chancellor's guidance. It would dissolve many of the doubts expressed by members of the Committee if that guidance were included in the Bill to make it clear that an historical record will not extend further than the five-year period in which the Lord Chancellor deals with it as an open file. It is not a difficult matter, merely one of definition. The Minister has gone a long way to reassure us on the subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am not sure that I can work the Lord Chancellor's code of practice into the Bill. A code of practice will be available to anyone to see how it relates to the clause. There is no need to include the code of practice in the Bill because Departments will be obliged to comply with it.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the phrase ``or other assembly''. The right of access includes electronic records; the Lord Chancellor's code will set out guidance on how such records are to be treated in respect of historical records. We must ensure that there is sufficient flexibility to ensure that the Bill accommodates the various ways in which information may be held by public authorities. The clause will enable us to do that. ``Or other assembly'' is an interesting turn of phrase and I expect that I will be advised that it covers the points made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. I confirm that, should it fail to tackle the realms of cyberspace, I will write to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> My concern is not that the clause does not cover the points that I made, but that it covers them too well. It is capable of open-ended expansion to cover a large amount of information, but the difficulty is defining it within a set context.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The phrase in the clause is ``file or other assembly'' and our difficulty is that we cannot provide a definition of a file. Considering the breadth of bodies to which the Bill applies, how records are held will vary considerably, whether or not that information is held on a computer. The weight that is placed on the classification is as for a historical record; the Bill applies to all information and information must be disclosed unless it is exempt. The clause applies to the way in which historical records, which may have been exempt, may become disclosable. We need to ensure that the clause has sufficient clarity to ensure that public authorities are aware that they comply with the Lord Chancellor's code and that at the end of 30 years they must reveal that information unless other circumstances apply. Our approach takes account of the fact that there are protections such as the Lord Chancellor's code. As I promised, I shall write to my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central and to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome to confirm that the information technology issues are properly covered.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The clause makes more readily available categories of information that are exempted under part II by providing that they shall not be treated as exempt after the efflux of 30 years. However, although I welcome the clauses that have been listed, consideration should be given to widening the categories so treated. Clause 27, which refers to exemptions related to the economy; clause 32, which deals with matters related to parliamentary privilege; and clause 37, which deals with environmental information, contain three such categories. They are all different, and different arguments apply in each respect.
<P>
The economy is the most important category. It is hard to envisage circumstances in which the release of information that is 30 years old could have an adverse effect on the present economy. I shall be interested in the Government's argument in defence of the clause being drawn so widely.
<P>
Casting my mind back to historical debates about the economy 30 years ago, I can find no current resonance. The political world is so changed that my part in those debates makes me feel slightly freakish, as our concerns then were so divorced from those today. I find the exemptions in clause 27 genuinely puzzling.
<P>
I do not know what the parliamentary privilege exemptions in clause 32 are designed to protect. They may relate to the dates of private discussions, Select Committees and other historical matters. I can recall, for example, participating in a Speaker's conference more than 30 years ago about the age of majority for voting purposes. I cannot think that anything that I, or anyone, said at that conference, need enjoy exemption from disclosure now. The sensitivities of Members of Parliament are not such that their youthful indiscretions—if they are still here to answer for them, they will have been youthful indiscretions—should not be open to the public gaze 30 years after the event.
<P>
A different set of considerations may operate in relation to environmental information because, with the implementation of the Aarhus convention and regulations flowing therefrom, there will be a separate and better right of access, but, as things stand, it appears that environmental records will become historical records under the Bill. That is unnecessary and puzzling. I should be grateful for the Under-Secretary's advice on those points.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I agree to some extent with the right hon. Gentleman. Clearly, there are few historical records relating to clause 27 and the economy, the disclosure of which would harm the economic interests of the United Kingdom or part of it. Nevertheless, there will be no automatic right of access 15 or 20 years after the information was created, if disclosure would cause real prejudice to the economy, and clause 13 will apply. It will be possible to obtain some information, although it is difficult to identify the nature of that information now. It is possible that some economic dealings will cause prejudice or embarrassment—for example, information on dealings in gold, more difficult areas of the economy or information on the relationship between our economy and that of another country. That could have an international dimension if the political leaders of that other country are still in office after a long time, as Castro is. There must be very few historical records the disclosure of which would harm the economic interests of Britain or any part of it, although it is not impossible to imagine that there might be some.
<P>
Parliamentary privilege presents a difficulty. The Bill goes beyond the White Paper to cover Parliament. The provision exempts information the disclosure of which would infringe the privileges of either House. The principle behind the exemption is that it is for Parliament alone to determine how such information is to be released. That remains true, whether it is 15 or 50 years after the information was created, so the exemption will continue to apply to that limited class of information beyond 30 years. Of course, Parliament can waive its privilege at any time and disclose information where appropriate. Again, it is difficult, but possible, to imagine circumstances in which the House may take such a decision. Therefore, the decision rests with Parliament.
<P>
Environmental records do include historical records, but clause 62 has no bearing on the point. Clause 37 exempts information that would be exempt under the regulations made pursuant to clause 73, which will give effect to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe convention on public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters. The UK signed that convention in 1998, in so far as it relates to access to environmental information. It is the Government's intention that access to such information should be given primarily under those regulations, which give effect to our international obligations, however old the information may be. Therefore, to ensure that that is the case, clause 37 will not be disapplied for 30 years. That is the reasoning behind the way in which the clause relates to historical records. I do not venture to say that there will be many examples of restricted information—I suspect that they will be rare—but it is possible that there will be some. However, we do not believe that information should always be disclosed and, therefore, we do not believe that the exemption should cease to be available after 30 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I do not feel disposed to push the arguments about parliamentary privilege or environmental information, but I remain totally unpersuaded by what the Under-Secretary said about the economy. Indeed, his straining to find any example in which it might conceivably cause damage to disclose information about something that happened 30 years ago was eloquent testimony to the force of my argument. He clutched at the handling of gold as if that might be relevant. I am aware that, recently, the handling of gold has caused several fluctuations of opinion and fluttering in some dovecotes. However, that was not for domestic reasons, but because it was thought that it might have an adverse effect on South Africa, and such a matter would be covered by clause 25.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Before the right hon. Gentleman worries too much about that, I should say that the prejudice test would apply. Therefore, there is some protection against a public authority—or the Government, in the case of economic information—that decides not to disclose information, because it will be necessary to show that some prejudice would be caused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> That creates a bureaucratic solution to what could be, for historians at least, a daily problem. Yesterday, I received a visit from an historian, who happened to be interested in the origins of the Highlands and Islands development board, an agency created in the old Labour Government's interventionist days. That historian had access to the papers of the Scottish Office under the 30-year rule. I do not know how he obtained access to the papers, but they disclosed a good deal of information about the economy. There was no public interest issue in not allowing him free access to those papers and to all the shenanigans that went on at the time—and they were considerable shenanigans, in which a couple of board members resigned under a cloud when it was suggested that they had abused their position. That is a worst-case scenario. One of those two chaps is dead and the other is alive and living in Australia, but they might be seen to be embarrassed by those revelations.
<P>
I do not believe that it is in the public interest to draw a veil across such information 30 years after the event without more concrete evidence of potential harm. Perhaps it is a contradiction to suggest that potential harm can be demonstrated concretely. If the Under-Secretary is serious about wanting to change the climate, culture and attitude relating to public information, there is a powerful case for him to reconsider the clause. It is surely starting at shadows to treat information about the economy as if it were highly secret or part of an intelligence document. I dare say that I shall not prevail on the Under-Secretary to reconsider the provisions, but will he at least discuss them with his colleagues? Will he acknowledge the disquiet that exists because the clause is slightly contrary to the general thrust of the Bill and does not preserve a strong public interest?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The issue is whether we believe that priority should be given to an historian who is inconvenienced or to economic information that is shown on balance to have the potential to cause prejudice to the British economy. In deciding whether it is right for information that would prejudice the economy to be disclosed, we must bear in mind that there would have to be good reason to impose restrictions. It is possible, however, that such a reason could exist, and it should be capable of being tested. The prejudice test should be applied and information that is shown to be capable of causing prejudice should not be disclosed.
<P>
I do not imagine that much information that would fall into that category after 30 years, although I can conceive of some that might be. I cannot agree with the right hon. Gentleman's proposal that all information should automatically be made available. It is possible to conceive of information whose release might cause prejudice, and we should leave it at that. I suggested that such information could relate to gold transactions and to the handling of gold, which can be sensitive internationally, to economic support provided to another country or to the Bank of England's handling of specific matters. Information concerning such matters might still cause prejudice to the economy after the specified time has elapsed, although it would be unlikely to do so. Restriction would depend on it being demonstrated that prejudice would be caused by release, which is why a test should be applied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> Cannot the Under-Secretary conceive that it is considerably to the benefit of those who are responsible for the conduct of public policy and in the national interest that lessons of history should be applied? Historians do not do their job just for fun; they have a purpose, which is to amplify our understanding of how things do and do not work. I do not want to overstate my position, but I remind the Committee that to treat the economy as a no-go area and to introduce bureaucratic obstacles that prevent historians from having access to information on spent issues is to do a great disservice to the proper assessment of our past.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I fear that the right hon. Gentleman is overstating his position. The idea that the clause will make the economy a no-go area is absurd. I have repeatedly stated that it will probably be applied in relation to a very small amount of information. The right hon. Gentleman rightly said that it is difficult to think of much information on the economy which would be in any no-go area after 30 years; I agree with that view. The vast majority of such information is likely to be in the open, probably long before 30 years have elapsed, to have little or no sensitivity and to cause no prejudice to the proper academic historian who is seeking to investigate the way in which economic decisions were made. There might, however, be a nugget of information that would still cause prejudice to the economy for a small period, although the authorities would have to show that it would do so. The right to release such information should not be automatic and absolute but should be qualified.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Will the Under-Secretary comment on some later provisions? I share the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross about the economy. I did not feel that the Under-Secretary's heart was in his reply to the right hon. Gentleman, and he staggered when attempting to justify his remarks on the economy. I refer him to subsections (3) and (4), which specify periods after which exemptions can no longer apply. Why do those periods apply? For example, surely the exemption on disclosure that is prejudicial to defence and international relations need not apply indefinitely? Would not 75 years be enough for such information? The clause 29 exemptions on law enforcement are another case in point. Is a 75-year period essential without a test? The 75-year provision means that information on law enforcement collected in 1926 could be considered to be so potent and dangerous that it should not be released. I am not sure whether that approach bears scrutiny.
<P>
Subsection (5) contains the awesome phrase ``at any time''. Is it really necessary to exclude and exempt material about security bodies covered by clause 21 without a harm test, even after, say, 30 years? It seems extraordinary to exempt such information in such a blanket way. Such restrictions do not apply only to information that relates to national security. The Under-Secretary will see that certificates made under clause 21 indicate merely that exempted information should relate to one of the bodies that it specifies. To cover with a blanket exemption information that merely relates to those bodies and which is not necessarily in the core of their work seems rather strange.
<P>
Does the personal data exemption contained in clause 38 apply only to information about living individuals? Will it no longer apply once an individual has died? The current Public Record Office policy on disclosure of personal information, which was set out in the 1993 open government White Paper, provides that records containing personal information will usually be closed to the public for 40 to 100 years. It is not clear whether the White Paper criteria will continue to operate when the Bill is enacted or whether new criteria will be introduced. It is also unclear what such new criteria would be.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall speak first about information relating to law enforcement and about the 100-year exemption. The continuation of the exemption beyond 30 years is based on the recognition that information about law enforcement may be capable of causing harm long after it was first collected. For example, an investigation may not have been concluded for want of further evidence and although not proceeded with at the time, may remain open. In those circumstances, the premature disclosure of information collected about individuals suspected of wrongdoing could harm either innocent individuals or the collection of further information necessary to bring proceedings against those who may be guilty.
<P>
In the current discretionary system, much of that information is released as a matter of course. No more than a handful of such records are held back over time, but there are exceptional cases in which information merits protection for up to 100 years. For example, the descendants of informants and others who may still be known to the families of those on whom they informed may need to be protected. In the Irish context, I know of the long memories of those of my brethren whose families do not wish what their parents did to be disclosed for a prolonged period. The Bill allows for such information to be withheld. Clause 13 will, of course, apply to such information, thus the authority will be required to consider the exercise of any discretion that they may have to disclose the information in the public interest, even when the exemption applies.
<P>
It is appropriate that the security service exemption should continue indefinitely. However, clause 13 applies to such information when it is contained in a historical record referred to the Public Record Office under the Public Records Act 1958. That will ensure that such information is released after 30 years when it is in the public interest. I repeat that clause 76 applies in respect of all information that might be the subject of the Bill or might be held by public authorities.
<P>
Personal information is dealt with under the Bill by reference to the Data Protection Act 1998. The exemption for personal information from the Bill exists only during the lifetime of the subject; it would therefore be inappropriate to disapply the exemption after a specific period of time. That would result either in information being released during the lifetime of an individual, possibly in breach of the Data Protection Act 1998, or in information being withheld for longer than is currently the case. Therefore, it applies for the lifetime of the person. Disclosure of such personal information must be in accordance with the data protection principle. The exemption ends when the person to whom the information relates dies.
<P>
In defence matters, for example, the exemption is contents based. Again, if disclosure would endanger national security, it is right that an exemption should remain. Similarly, information relating to the whole of the security services should always be protected, but once such information is passed to the Public Record Office, which usually happens at 30 years, clause 13 applies.
<P>
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central asked me whether clause 38 applied only to information relating to a living individual. The answer is yes, the exemption falls on the death of an individual.

<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> On a point of order, Dr. Clark. If I may, I should like to catch your eye on clause 69.
<P>
Clauses 67 and 68 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we come to clause 69, it may lead to better-ordered debates on clauses if hon. Members who want to contribute do so before the Minister rises, so that he can take all points into account when he replies to the debate.
<H4><center>Clause 69</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exemptions applicable to certain manual data held by public authorities</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The Bill extends individuals' right of access to their personal data held by public authorities. To the several classes of personal data to which individuals have rights of access under the Data Protection Act 1998 it adds an additional category; personal information held in a manual form that is not part of what the Data Protection Act calls a ``relevant filing system''. That could apply to an unstructured file containing items of information about an individual, or even passing references to an individual appearing on a policy file.
<P>
Generally, the standards that bodies must adopt in handing personal data are set out in the eight data protection principles. However, the Bill provides that the new category of personal data is covered by only by two of those principles, which require that people should be given the right to see data about themselves and that data should be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.
<P>
The clause gives public authorities a free hand to use unstructured personal data in breach of the remaining data protection principles. Clause 69 creates a new section 33A in the Data Protection Act 1998, exempting the new category of personal data from the majority of data protection principles. The clause allows personal data to be used unfairly and unlawfully; to be processed in a manner incompatible with any lawful purpose for which it was obtained; to be kept longer than necessary; and to be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area, even if those countries cannot guarantee adequate protection.
<P>
The clause also permits the new category of personal data to be handled in breach of section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998, which makes it an offence for a person to obtain or disclose personal data without the consent of the data controller, in this case the public authority.
<P>
I am really interested in why a high level of protection should be required for some manually held personal data, while there is to be virtually no protection in other instances.
<P>
Elizabeth France said in her response to the draft Bill:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A practical problem arises from the extension of the 1998 Act to cover the extra personal information held by public authorities and the subsequent removal of many of the 1998 Act's key provisions from these data. An unnecessary level of complexity for both public authority and data subject is introduced by this . . . It would be simpler in practice as well as in the Registrar's view more desirable in principle to apply the 1998 Act in its entirety to the extra information brought within the scope of the 1998 Act.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should be grateful for the Minister's thoughts on those issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The issues raised by clause 69 are reasonably important and the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross is right to ask me to justify them. The clause is a necessary consequence of the way in which part VII of the Bill works. Clause 67 amends the definition of ``data'' m the Data Protection Act 1998 so that the Act applies to all recorded personal data held by a public authority. There is one small exception, in that clause 6 of the Bill limits the information brought within the scope of freedom of information access. An example is the BBC; information held for the purposes of journalism, art or literature is outside that scope.
<P>
The new definition of ``data'' is intended only to facilitate access to information for freedom of information purposes, not generally to broaden the way in which the 1998 Act applies to such information. Clause 69 therefore amends the Data Protection Act 1998 to disapply its substantive effects except for those relating to subject access and accuracy in the case of the relevant extended class of data.
<P>
Clause 69 will exempt specified information from some of the data protection principles and from the provisions in the 1998 Act relating to the unlawful obtaining of personal data. The extension of the definition of ``data'' to non-automated or unstructured records means that the 1998 Act will apply to, for example, incidental personal information on a policy file, or in loose papers.
<P>
Public authorities holding such data, but not in the form of personnel records, will have to obey the fourth data protection principle, which requires information to be accurate and, where necessary, up to date. A restricted version of the sixth data protection principle, which requires data to be processed according to the rights of data subjects under the 1998 Act, will also apply.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Individuals will have the right to subject access and, in certain circumstances, the right to rectify, to block, to erase or to destroy inaccurate data and to obtain compensation for damage and associated distress suffered as a result of inaccurate data or breach of the subject access rights. However, making such unstructured information subject to all the data protection principles would place a tremendous burden on public authorities. Similarly, the provisions in the 1998 Act relating to the unlawful obtaining of personal data are too restrictive in the context. The burden is not required by the EU directive, would be borne by public authorities rather than private bodies, and is not justified.
<P>
Clause 69 also provides that the extension of the rights of subject access and accuracy under part VII does not apply to personnel information held by public authorities. That will not have a significant impact on the rights of public sector employees to their personnel records. Most of the information, if held manually, would be in relevant filing systems and, therefore, subject to access rights under the 1998 Act. It would not be right to provide public sector employees with greater access to personnel records not contained in such files than private sector employees. To do so would be to provide enhanced employment rights by the back door.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross says that the Bill does not give authorities a right to hold manual data while remaining in compliance with the data protection principles. It does not do that because authorities already have such a power. The Bill enhances the individuals' rights relating to the new limited category of information, grants them a right of access and imposes the principle of accuracy. It is, therefore, a step forward in the control of authorities' use of such information. A general extension of all the principles would not be justified.
<P>
The clause is a necessary part of a carefully constructed mechanism that serves to ensure that the public will have a comprehensive and sensible right of access to personal information.
