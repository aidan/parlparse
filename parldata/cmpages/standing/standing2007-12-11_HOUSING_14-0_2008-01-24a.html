						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000683"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Mr. Iain Wright):
						</b> Welcome back,
Mr. Gale, and good afternoon. You are certainly putting in
the hours today. I hope that you are appropriately remunerated for
it.</div>
					<a name="08012543000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us move on. I
was discussing larger homes, and there is an interesting and important
point to be made about them. Before I was interrupted by the end of the
morning sitting, I was about to say that the Housing Corporation is
currently considering bids for its 2008-11 affordable housing
programme. We expect that at least 25 per cent. of the programme will
be for larger family homes, and in London, which is the concern of my
hon. Friend the Member for West Ham, it will higher, at 42 per
cent.</div>
					<a name="08012543000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
discussed having a higher number of larger homes, but it is also
important that we make the best use of existing stock. In the shorter
term, there is considerable scope for making better use of all the
available stock in order to tackle overcrowding. We have supported
pilot  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column509" />Column number: 509</div>projects in London to demonstrate and test out different approaches, and
have produced an action plan for expanding those projects to 38
pathfinder areas to test out the costs and impacts. The areas will be
in all London boroughs, Birmingham, Bradford, Leicester, Liverpool and
Manchester.</div>
					<a name="08012543000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
ensure that good practice and innovative approaches are supported and
advanced. To date, we have invested more than &#163;35 million in
pilot schemes in London. They have started to develop successful and
effective ways of tackling this problem in the capital, where, as my
hon. Friend knows, the pressures are particularly acute. We have used
lessons from the pilots to develop our action plan, which was published
last month. It sets out several ways in which social housing providers,
whether local authorities or registered social landlords, can manage
their existing stock in innovative and proactive ways to address
overcrowding.</div>
					<a name="08012543000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
investing a further &#163;15 million over the next three years,
starting with the 38 pathfinder areas. Each pathfinder has been
allocated &#163;100,000 to develop a strategy based on good practice
and innovation for tackling overcrowding. The pathfinders will operate
from April this year and will be expected to use a standard similar to
that proposed by my hon. Friend and others in new clause 32. We expect
the pathfinders to adopt the bedroom standard as the minimum level of
assessing overcrowding in their areas, and to build on the policies
that have been most successful in the pilots to develop a strategy to
tackle
overcrowding.</div>
					<a name="08012543000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
change will be in place and effective earlier than any legislative
process would allow. I know that my hon. Friend is keen on the
timetabling for legislation. I am happy to give way if she wishes to
intervene, but before I do, I would point out that trying to change
legislation is a fairly lengthy process. We are committed to doing so,
and I have already mentioned the scope for putting the standard in
secondary legislation, but the pilot areas will bring things forward
much more quickly than would otherwise be the
case.</div>
					<a name="08012543000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08012543000684"></a>
							<b class="B">Lyn
Brown</b> (West Ham) (Lab): My hon. Friend has said that the
current definition of overcrowding is archaic and inappropriate, that
we do not need primary legislation and that we can use secondary
legislation to get what we require by way of a bedroom standard on the
books. I also heard him say that he will look at using pathfinders to
roll out the standard. Pathfinders are often wonderful in the areas
that they cover, but they are not so wonderful in the areas that they
do not cover.</div>
					<a name="08012543000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask
the Minister, first, whether there will be a promise of secondary
legislation to change the definition of overcrowding for the whole of
the country, and secondly, what he believes the time scale for that
will
be.</div>
					<a name="08012543000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000685"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> On my hon. Friend&#146;s first question, yes, I
can commit to secondary legislation to change the overcrowding
standard. I have committed to that, as has my right hon. Friend the
Minister for
Housing.</div>
					<a name="08012543000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the second
point, that is a difficult trick. We need to look at the matter
closely. As I said, we must consider the findings from the pathfinder
areas. I am keen to use the pathfinder schemes to develop robust 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column510" />Column number: 510</div>and analytical data on costs and to ensure that what we do is
evidence-based. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham will
not agree with that, but it is important to use the evidence from the
pathfinders on things such as cost and impact to devise a phased
approach to altering the national statutory
standard.</div>
					<a name="08012543000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000686"></a>Lyn
Brown:
						</b> My hon. Friend is, to a certain extent, right. We
need evidence on which to base the cost and to plan, but we are at the
stage where we know what the problem is and it needs to be solved, so I
want to push him on a timetable. A best guess at a timetable would suit
me, if that is all he can provide.</div>
					<a name="08012543000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000687"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> It is tempting to respond to my hon. Friend,
especially when she seems to have a gun to my head. If she will forgive
me, however, I want to examine the information from pathfinders, but I
stress to her and reaffirm our commitment to change the overcrowding
standard, which as I have said, is completely and utterly out of date.
I want to do so as quickly as possible, bearing in mind the importance
of ensuring that we have a good mapping exercise about where
overcrowding and undercrowding occur, and a cost and impact analysis. I
hate to disappoint her, but I am afraid that I shall have to. On the
overall philosophical and policy argument about changing the provision,
however, we are absolutely committed to doing
so.</div>
					<a name="08012543000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000688"></a>Lyn
Brown:
						</b> When will the pathfinder findings be in front of
us? What is the earliest point at which we can assume to see some
action by the Government? I love the Minister&#146;s principles, I
think that they are cool, but I really want some
action.</div>
					<a name="08012543000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000689"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> It is a long, long time since I have been called
cool. The pathfinders exercise will start in April, and on a future
timetable, I certainly see something coming on board&#151;as I say, I
do not want to commit myself too much and box myself in&#151;by
around about 2009. I know that that will be difficult and problematic
for my hon. Friend, but the pilot areas that we are introducing, and
the measures to ensure that they adopt the modernised bedroom standard,
are important. We are moving forward faster than the legislative
process would allow, so I hope that she can take some reassurance from
that point.</div>
					<a name="08012543000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
talked strongly about overcrowding, and all the estimates so far show
that about 228,000 overcrowded households live in social housing, but
the reverse is that we estimate there to be about 445,000
under-occupiers. Under-occupation is measured as two bedrooms or more
above the bedroom standard. We are therefore encouraging local
authorities to build on existing under-occupation schemes, first by
knowing who their under-occupiers are, and then by developing bespoke
support packages to help those tenants&#151;especially the
elderly&#151;who seek a move to a smaller property.</div>
					<a name="08012543000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know from research that
social tenants face psychological and practical barriers to
moving&#151;older people especially so. If tailored support can be
provided, for example, by taking downsizing tenants to visit their
proposed new area, by providing help with the move itself, and by
dealing with the utility 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column511" />Column number: 511</div>companies, people could be persuaded to move. This is not a question of
coercion; it is a question of helping as much as possible with any
barriers to moving from a property that might not be suitable for
somebody&#146;s current needs.</div>
					<a name="08012543000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08012543000690"></a>
							<b class="B">Margaret
Moran</b> (Luton, South) (Lab): I commend my hon. Friend, but
does he understand that several such schemes have been in operation
since the 1980s? Indeed, when I was the chair of housing in Lewisham,
and subsequently leader, we undertook hand-holding and provided
financial incentives to the elderly to move to smaller accommodation.
Their preference was for two-bedroom accommodation, not one, which
therefore caused a further shortage of family accommodation. The
problem is not easily solved.</div>
					<a name="08012543000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000691"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. She will
see the same thing that I see in my surgeries, when somebody would like
to move, but they say, &#147;I do get the grandkids on a weekend, so
I would like a second bedroom in order to accommodate them.&#148; It
facilitates family cohesion, which is an important point that we must
address.</div>
					<a name="08012543000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">On my hon.
Friend&#146;s point about Lewisham, some evidence that we have seen
suggests a successful approach in areas of London that have piloted the
initiative, and I am keen to build on that. To support that approach,
my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing has already announced our
intention to consult on a new reasonable preference category that is
used in housing allocation to ensure that all authorities give more
priority to under-occupiers who may wish to move house. That will
ensure that all local authorities give some priority to those who wish
to downsize. That is a good customer service for tenants who might wish
to move closer to families for support, as we have mentioned, or even
to reduce their fuel or council tax bills.</div>
					<a name="08012543000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important that authorities and registered social landlords make the
most of all lets that become available by adopting a managed, chain
lettings approach. In that way, a three-bedroom property freed up by
moving an under-occupier can accommodate an overcrowded family, while
their two-bedroom property can accommodate a family in temporary
accommodation, thus tackling both overcrowding and reducing temporary
accommodation. That is an important approach in managing and securing
the best use of existing stock.</div>
					<a name="08012543000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">A further
London pilot has been successful in securing accommodation in the
private sector for overcrowded households, with a guaranteed move back
into the social sector after a specified period, which is an important
point to stress. That is an innovative scheme that makes the best use
of stock available while allowing a household to move back into the
social housing sector eventually. From April, the introduction of the
local housing allowance will give private renters on lower incomes
greater choice and flexibility in accessing more suitably sized homes
in the private sector.</div>
					<a name="08012543000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Wider implementation of the
schemes that I have mentioned, particularly those that have been
piloted in London, will have an immediate affect on securing better
accommodation for overcrowded households. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column512" />Column number: 512</div>know that my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham is impatient to
speak&#151;she is a very impatient lady and I do not want to cross
her too much.</div>
					<a name="08012543000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I think that those
innovative points will have an immediate effect and also provide the
crucial evidence that we need on the cost and impact of updating the
overcrowding standard by secondary legislation. Once we have that
evidence, we will be able to devise a phased and manageable move to a
new national standard with authorities well positioned to manage a new
definition positively and proactively. I do not want to box myself in,
but I hope that that will be in
2009.</div>
					<a name="08012543000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have reassured hon. Members that we are committed to ensuring that
families living in overcrowded conditions have the right advice and
support from their local housing providers to enable them to secure
more suitably sized accommodation. I am not complacent and want the
Committee to recognise that. I accept and fully agree with the
sentiment of the amendments tabled by hon. Members, and particularly
the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for West
Ham.</div>
					<a name="08012543000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can confirm
that the Government are committed to changing the statutory
overcrowding standards, but resist the new clause at this time for a
number of reasons. First, we have already had powers to amend the
definition of overcrowding by regulation. Secondly, we have already
given a clear commitment to modernising the standard. Thirdly, we have
published an action plan that will go a long way towards tackling the
problem on the ground. Finally, it would be untimely to introduce a new
standard without the important evidence on the cost or impact of a
change for local
authorities.</div>
					<a name="08012543000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
has been an important debate for a range of hon. Members across the
country, but especially those in London. I hope that my hon. Friend the
Member for West Ham, despite her impatience, has been reassured by what
I have said and, on that basis, I hope that she will not press her new
clause.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Love</b> (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op): I beg to move, That
the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="08012543000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 59 would amend the Protection from Eviction Act 1977 to give the
most basic protection from eviction for some of the most vulnerable
occupiers of certain types of property. To expand on that, the 1977 Act
provides various types of protection to some occupiers by giving them
the right to remain in that accommodation until they receive a 28-day
notice to quit. It also provides some protection in that the landlord
has to obtain a court order for eviction. Of course, not all occupiers
have those rights. There is a group of excluded occupiers who do not
have the benefits of minimal rights who are not entitled to a formal
notice or a court order. The excluded groups include not only occupiers
but people living in hotels and hostels, homeless people living in
temporary accommodation provided by the local authority, and homeless
people living in self-contained
accommodation.</div>
					<a name="08012543000648"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08012543000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
options for those excluded occupiers are rather bleak. Although they
are meant to have some protection in common law, in reality they have
virtually nowhere to turn when evicted. Most of those who want access
to the private rented sector will have to raise a deposit, and they may
have to provide rent in advance. If they have to apply to the social
fund, we all know that there can be real difficulties with its
administration, and even then they may not get a loan once a decision
has been made.</div>
					<a name="08012543000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
will have to turn to the local authority for a rent deposit, and
although we are seeing a significant improvement in the coverage of
rent deposit schemes, it is still the case, in practical terms, that
many people are refused rent deposits. People who have children may
then have to apply to the local social services, under the Children Act
1948, but threats are sometimes made to people in those circumstances
that the children will be taken into care, often scaring the parents
off from approaching the local authority.</div>
					<a name="08012543000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause would first
extend the groups covered, and those groups will therefore be spared
some of the hardship that ensues from being evicted in very short
order. As I say, they often find it difficult to obtain suitable
alternative accommodation. We want to bring self-contained temporary
accommodation within the ambit of the Protection from Eviction Act
1977.</div>
					<a name="08012543000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
think everyone understands that, for people in bed-and-breakfast, hotel
or hostel accommodation, it is not practical to give them entitlement
to a court order before eviction. Currently, the common law suggests
that they should be given a reasonable period of notice. We know that
that is not happening for many people up and down the country. We want
to bring that within the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column514" />Column number: 514</div>ambit of the Bill, so that people in such circumstances will at least
have a strengthened possibility of receiving a reasonable period of
notice before they are evicted.</div>
					<a name="08012543000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
&#147;reasonable&#148; has different definitions in various
circumstances. For example, there may be occasions when someone living
in a hostel is being very difficult, and the reasonable test would be
rather shorter than for someone in real difficulty. I hope the Minister
will respond sympathetically, but the essence is to reach out to some
of the most vulnerable people. They often do not understand the
situation that they are in and find that they may have made wrong
decisions along the way, and as a consequence will eventually be
evicted. The hope is that by extending some legal rights to them, we
will give them the opportunity to find alternative accommodation and to
have a little more balance in their lives.</div>
					<a name="08012543000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08012543000694"></a>
							<b class="B">Lembit
&#214;pik</b> (Montgomeryshire) (LD): I am a little confused
by one element. The proposed new subsection (11)
states:</div>
					<a name="08012543000594"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
the avoidance of doubt, an excluded tenant or excluded licensee shall
not be compelled to leave
accommodation&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="08012543000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
so on. It seems to me that that means that an excluded tenant or an
excluded licensee can simply squat in the premises and never be
compelled to leave. Perhaps I misunderstand the
provision.</div>
					<a name="08012543000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000695"></a>Mr.
Love:
						</b> I do not think that that is the legal implication.
Yes, for excluded tenants or licensees we clearly want to extend the
right to remain until they have received a period of notice. However, I
do not think that we would extend to them the right to squat in the
property for good, as has been
suggested.</div>
					<a name="08012543000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reality
is that the law is very firmly in favour of the landlord&#146;s right
to take their property back into ownership. I do not think that this
proposal would upset that in any way other than in the two marginal
ways that I have suggested: to provide that people who are in local
authority self-contained accommodation have greater rights and, perhaps
just as importantly, that people who do not have the right to hostel
accommodation should at least be given a period of notice. I commend
the new clause to the Minister and ask that he looks on it
sympathetically. It would go a long way towards helping people in very
difficult
circumstances.</div>

Roberta Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab):
						<b class="B"> </b>I
know that the Committee needs to make progress so I will be extremely
brief. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton for tabling the
new clause. It enables us to focus on this very vulnerable group of
people who can find themselves in a situation where they experience a
lot of panic and hardship in being evicted from temporary accommodation
without being able to find suitable alternative accommodation and
without being given time to do so.</div>
					<a name="08012543000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause would bring
self-contained temporary accommodation within the ambit of the
Protection from Eviction Act 1977. It would give the evicted person
more breathing space to explore possibilities of finding alternative
accommodation. It seems like a very reasonable and necessary protection
for this vulnerable group. I look forward to hearing what the Minister
has to say.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000697"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I have a lot of sympathy with what my hon. Friend
the Member for Edmonton has said on this issue. As he has mentioned,
the principal purpose of the new clause is to extend the protection
afforded to people who have been considered under the homelessness
legislation, part 7 of the Housing Act 1996, and have been provided
with temporary accommodation, but in respect of whom the local
authority has no further statutory obligation. That could be because
they do not have a priority need for accommodation or because they have
brought homelessness upon
themselves.</div>
					<a name="08012543000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the current homelessness legislation, if a local housing authority has
reason to believe that an applicant is homeless or is likely to become
homeless within 28 days, it must make inquiries to satisfy itself
whether any duty is owed under part 7 of the 1996 Act. Key factors
would be whether the person is actually homeless, whether their
homelessness is through no fault of their own, and whether they have a
priority need for accommodation. Those inquiries can take time, but in
cases where the authority has reason to believe that the applicant may
be homeless and may have a priority need, it has an immediate duty
under section 188(1) of the 1996 Act to secure accommodation until
their inquiries are completed. At that point, in some cases the
authority might find that it has no further duty to secure
accommodation, for example, because the applicant does not have
priority need. Subject to reasonable notice being given, the authority
can end the provision of
accommodation.</div>
					<a name="08012543000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other cases, the authority might find that it owes the duty under
section 190(2)(a) of the 1996 Act, which is owed to applicants who have
a priority need, but have made themselves homeless intentionally. The
authority must secure accommodation, but for only a limited period, to
provide the applicant with a reasonable opportunity to secure
accommodation for him or herself. At that point, no further obligation
will be owed and the authority needs to be in a position to end the
provision of accommodation, subject to reasonable notice being
given.</div>
					<a name="08012543000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I have
a lot of sympathy with what my hon. Friends have said, the Court of
Appeal has ruled that temporary accommodation made available in these
circumstances does not benefit from the protection provided by section
3(1) of the 1977 Act. In my view, that position is correct in policy
terms, and to reverse it could jeopardise local authorities&#146;
practical operation of their homelessness provisions. Because of that,
I do not consider it necessary or appropriate to extend section 3 of
the 1977 Act to people who have been provided with temporary
accommodation under homelessness legislation, in circumstances in which
the local authority&#146;s obligation&#151;this is the crucial
point&#151;is specifically limited to a short-term
period.</div>
					<a name="08012543000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000698"></a>Mr.
Love:
						</b> I am listening to carefully to my hon. Friend. There
is clearly a balance to be struck: a local authority needs to gain the
accommodation that is being made available and does not want to delay
the process any more than necessary, but the families involved are
often the most vulnerable, moving from pillar to post and perhaps not
receiving the best possible advice. Is there no way in which we can
negotiate at least some additional time to give them the opportunity to
make arrangements for the future, rather than leave them in
limbo?</div>

Wright:
						</b> Again, I sympathise with my hon. Friend, but I
suggest that if families are being moved from pillar to post and there
are concerns about their cases, they will already be captured in the
priority need for accommodation. I hope that the local authority would
see it in that way.</div>
					<a name="08012543000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the basis that I have set out&#151;the local authority&#146;s
obligations, and the short-term periods&#151;I hope that my hon.
Friend will withdraw the
motion.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000700"></a>Mr.
Love:
						</b> I am somewhat disappointed by the Minister&#146;s
comments. Often people find themselves subject to an intentionality
decision, or they have refused the first offer of
accommodation&#151;I have seen many cases of that nature&#151;and
the local authority therefore decides that it has no further
responsibility to them. They may well have taken their decision for
good reasons, but not fully understanding the implications. People
often find themselves being evicted quickly, which comes as a complete
shock and, because of their limited choice, creates great difficulties
for them.</div>
					<a name="08012543000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that,
after reflecting on that, the Minister will consider ways to ease the
real housing difficulties of many vulnerable families without allowing
people to effectively squat in a property, as the hon. Member for
Montgomeryshire mentioned. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

					<a name="08012543000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
probing new clause, and would amend the Housing Act 1996 to include a
new section allowing a person without dependent children who has been
subject to or is at risk of domestic violence, including if he or she
were to return home, to have priority
need.</div>
					<a name="08012543000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Domestic
violence currently accounts for 16 per cent. of all violent crime in
this country and is estimated to cost in the region of &#163;23
billion a year. In the latest year for which figures have been taken,
more than 100 women and 30 men lost their lives as a result of domestic
violence, and it is estimated that it affects one in four women and one
in six men at some time in their lives. It is an enormous
problem.</div>
					<a name="08012543000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
want someone to be forced to choose between staying at home in a
violent relationship and facing the prospect of street homelessness. If
accepted, the new clause would bring England into the  same
situation as already exists under the Welsh homelessness legislation,
and I would commend it on that point
alone.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="08012543000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current law
suggests that people who seek assistance from a local authority have to
be homeless, in priority need and not intentionally homeless. It is the
difficulty of demonstrating that people are in priority need that we
wish to address through the new clause. According to the Homelessness
(Priority Need for Accommodation) (England) Order 2002, a victim of
domestic violence is
a</div>
					<a name="08012543000595"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;person who is
vulnerable as a result of ceasing to occupy accommodation by reason of
violence from another person or threats of violence from another person
which are likely to be carried
out.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012543000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">That sounds as if
it provides protection, but the problem is the accepted definition of
vulnerability, which states that someone who has become homeless in
such circumstances
is</div>
					<a name="08012543000596"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;less able to fend for
themselves than an ordinary homeless person&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012543000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">That definition of vulnerability gives
rise to four problems with the current law. First, the nature of the
vulnerability test leads to a number of problems to do with consistency
and decision making. One authority may take a decision that is quite at
odds with other authorities&#146; measures, so the leeway in the
definition of vulnerability means that consistency is sometimes the
first casualty of such decisions.</div>
					<a name="08012543000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, in many cases
decisions are resource-driven, and that assertion is not just based on
anecdotal evidence from my own local authority area. Indeed, it was
echoed by a Lord Justice, who said in Osmani <i class="I">v</i>. Camden
that</div>
					<a name="08012543000597"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;decisions are often
likely to be highly
judgemental&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012543000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">That has
often been the outcome when such cases come to court, and the new
clause would go some way towards address the problem.</div>
					<a name="08012543000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, victims of domestic
violence often find it extremely difficult to provide sufficient
evidence of their vulnerability. It is not easy for someone to come
forward&#151;victims of domestic violence often do not go to the
police or any other authority for help&#151;and when they have to go
to a housing authority it is difficult for them to prove that they are
victims, which makes it problematic to deal with them under the
existing definition. As a consequence, people are often forced, if the
local authority is not helpful and if they cannot show the necessary
evidence, into a stark choice: do they stay where they are, subject to
further violence, which may have serious implications, or do they turn
to the streets, simply go to central London and end up in a hostel? One
benefit of the new clause is that it would enable us to tackle that
great difficulty.</div>
					<a name="08012543000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fourthly, many of those single
people&#151;mostly women, but also some men&#151;end up on the
street or in a hostel. However, because they cannot prove that they are
vulnerable, they are not picked up under homelessness legislation, so
they spend considerable periods of time in hostel accommodation before
they can move on. That, as we all know, silts up the hostel
accommodation and makes it more difficult for other single, homeless
people to access it. As I mentioned, the new clause would bring us into
line with the situation in Wales, but most importantly it would provide
a way out for one of the most vulnerable groups in our society. I
mentioned earlier the level of domestic 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column518" />Column number: 518</div>violence in this country and the shocking statistics; we know how
violent some of those relationships can be. The new clause would
provide an option&#151;a way out&#151;for someone who in those
circumstances has difficulty showing that that is the situation. It
would allow them to access alternative local authority accommodation,
move on and restart their life without the problems caused by their
violent partner, so I commend it to the
Minister.</div>

						<a name="08012543000702"></a>
							<b class="B">Grant
Shapps</b> (Welwyn Hatfield) (Con): I rise to give general
support to the intention behind the new clause, which I think is a very
good one. There is definitely a problem concerning the difference
between being intentionally and unintentionally homeless, particularly
with regard to domestic violence. I suspect that all hon. Members have
experience of dealing with constituency cases in which someone is
clearly frightened to death by what is going on in their home but is
scared to leave, because they have been told, perhaps by someone in the
housing department, that if they do so and do not have clear evidence
of violence, they will make themselves intentionally homeless, which
means that they will not gain access to the services that they
require.</div>
					<a name="08012543000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
of us are fortunate enough to have excellent women&#146;s refuges and
other facilities in our communities, but inevitably they never have
sufficient capacity to deal with the large number of cases. Domestic
abuse is very much a hidden problem; it takes place behind closed
doors. It is right to consider amending the law to ensure that the
balance of proof is pushed just a little further towards people who are
suffering domestic
abuse.</div>

in which we introduced the wider definition of vulnerability. We had a
very good debate on domestic violence, and we believed that it would be
incorporated by widening that definition. We thought that that would
encourage more local authorities to take domestic violence into account
when making decisions about homelessness. It was the
Government&#146;s intention at that time to incorporate the
seriousness of domestic violence into consideration of whether someone
was homeless and therefore entitled to be considered for accommodation.
It was their intent to recognise domestic violence as a particular
category.</div>
					<a name="08012543000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will reflect on that and reinforce the Government&#146;s
intention. Despite our best intentions, as my hon. Friend the Member
for Edmonton said, it is still a postcode lottery as to whether someone
who is a victim or survivor of domestic violence receives assistance
from the local authority. It is very much down to the discretion and
the definition of each local authority in deciding what vulnerability
means. It is extremely difficult to categorise, so
survivors&#151;women predominantly&#151;who flee domestic violence
are in a predicament based entirely on where they live and whether the
local authority is sufficiently sympathetic to their situation. That is
what determines whether they can flee from repeat
violence.</div>
					<a name="08012543000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us be
under no illusions: these are not individual assaults. Most victims and
survivors of domestic 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column519" />Column number: 519</div>violence have been repeatedly assaulted before they even report the
fact. Consequently, we are forcing survivors to remain in a violent
relationship, because they have no guarantees that they will not find
themselves homeless if they try to secure their safety. We cannot
possibly allow ourselves to remain in a situation in which we
jeopardise the safety of vulnerable women simply because different
local authorities have different definitions of
vulnerability.</div>
					<a name="08012543000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my
previous life, I ran a housing association. We were the only housing
association in London specifically for women, and we were the only
place where single women without children, or women without children
generally, could find accommodation. That provision was tiny and wholly
inadequate to meet the need. I refer the Minister to a recent report by
Crisis. We know that in those circumstances either women become street
homeless or, more likely, they spend years and years in a series of
temporary arrangements, such as sleeping on people&#146;s floors,
that eventually fall to pieces. Very often, their lives fall to pieces,
because without a permanent, settled home, they are unable to sustain
working and other arrangements. At the end of the day, that also costs
us. </div>
					<a name="08012543000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some women are
successful in fleeing their home and go to a Women&#146;s Aid refuge,
but that organisation has repeatedly told me that those refuges are
silting up. There simply is not sufficient accommodation for those
women. Again, we know that the availability of such refuges is a
postcode lottery. We wish that it were not&#151;we should have decent
refuges everywhere in the country, but that is not the case. My hon.
Friend the Minister and his Department need to get a grip on the
problem, because those limited places are being silted up. Places must
be held for those women, because they have nowhere else to go. They do
not have the prospect of a local authority or housing association home
to go to.</div>
					<a name="08012543000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">That costs
the Government a lot, as does the problem of dealing the many other
victims who cannot get a place in a refuge. It would be infinitely more
sensible if we did in the Bill what we intended to do in the Housing
Act 1996, and ensured that domestic violence is recognised as a
priority category of homelessness. My hon. Friend gave compelling
evidence. Given that women in Wales in the same situation are a
priority for accommodation, it is deeply inequitable that women in
England should not have the same rights.</div>
					<a name="08012543000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000704"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I am disappointed that my hon. Friend the Member
for Edmonton was disappointed with the last discussion, so I shall do
my best to make amends. As he mentioned, the principal purpose of the
clause is to bring those persons who have been subject to domestic
violence or at risk of such violence within the category of persons who
are given priority need under the homelessness legislation.</div>
					<a name="08012543000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government take the issue
of domestic abuse and violence extremely seriously. It is a nasty,
pernicious and prevalent crime. It has devastating personal
consequences for victims and their families, and it has a major impact
on the local and national economy, the criminal justice system, and
other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column520" />Column number: 520</div>statutory services. That is why we continue to work on many fronts to
raise awareness and understanding of domestic violence, and try to
improve delivery in all sectors. For example, recent investment in
specialist domestic violence courts has resulted in successful domestic
violence prosecutions rising from 42 per cent. in December 2003 to 67
per cent. in June 2006, exceeding the target that we set. My Department
takes domestic violence extremely seriously, particularly the need to
ensure that victims of domestic violence get the help and support that
they need.</div>
					<a name="08012543000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
current legislation, people who do not have dependent children have
priority need if they are vulnerable as a result of leaving their home
because of violence&#151;not only domestic violence; it could be from
another person&#151;or threats of violence that are likely to be
carried out. The hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield used the phrase,
&#147;intentionally homeless&#148;, but the concept of
intentionality is not the issue. The issue is more about whether the
victim is vulnerable as a result of their circumstances, and therefore
has priority need. I stress that applicants must be in priority need to
be given the main homelessness duty and secure priority. However, there
are other examples, including vulnerability as a result of old age,
mental illness and mental and physical disability. People aged 21 or
over could be vulnerable as a result of having been in care, and people
who have been in custody and former members of the armed forces could
be classed as vulnerable.</div>
					<a name="08012543000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other categories of applicant
have priority need that is not conditional on their vulnerability. For
example, people whose household includes a dependent child or pregnant
woman, and young people aged 16 or 17. It is accepted that people in
those circumstances, or at least a member of their household, could be
vulnerable in such circumstances, if not in all cases. I cannot stress
enough the fact that the Government take extremely seriously the issue
of protection for people at risk of domestic violence. I know that
there is some disquiet that, in practice, not all people who are
classed as vulnerable because they have had to leave their home because
of violence are accepted as being owed the main homelessness duty, and
I fully take on board what my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton said
about the apparent differences between England, Scotland and
Wales.</div>
					<a name="08012543000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am therefore
prepared to consider whether any changes to the legislation are
necessary. I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw his new clause, and I
pledge to come back on Report and inform the House further about what
we plan to do. With that commitment, I hope that my hon. Friend is
reassured. I hope that I have wiped out his disappointment over the
earlier discussion, and that he will withdraw the new
clause.</div>

						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, South
and I remember the discussions that we had and the extra categories
that we created when we discussed the Housing Act 2004. We thought that
we had provided the level of protection necessary for the different
categories that were included in that statutory instrument, but, as we
have said, practical experience has shown that the vulnerability test
is subject to wide  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column521" />Column number: 521</div>variation in its application. It is a bit of a lottery, depending on
which local authority one ends up with, because one local authority may
be much less sympathetic than
another.</div>
					<a name="08012543000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, as
we all know, especially London Members and Members from urban areas
with acute housing difficulties, such decisions often have a component
that relates to the level of housing stress and resource
considerations, if I can put it in the terms used by a judge. I thank
my hon. Friend the Minister for recognising that. I hope that he will
take that into account and recognise what the new clause attempts to
do, which is to provide the additional protection that was intended in
the 2004 Act but has not yet been delivered. The situation should be
the same as in Wales, and I hope that he can achieve that. I look
forward to what he will say on a future date, and on that basis I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the

time.</div>
					<a name="08012543000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I make no
apology for tabling these new clauses. As one of the co-chairmen of the
all-party group on homelessness and housing need, I suspect that it is
my responsibility above all others to ventilate current issues of
concern in respect of the legal situation as it applies to homeless
people, who are some of the most vulnerable people in society, which I
expect everyone in the House to
accept.</div>
					<a name="08012543000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 62
is a probing amendment. It would amend the Housing Act 1996. The
intention is to ensure that the law in respect of applications for
accommodation as homeless is in compliance with the European convention
on human rights. That is why I say that it is a probing amendment. I
wish to ventilate some of the issues around particular court cases that
have been decided
recently.</div>
					<a name="08012543000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me take
the Committee back to the duty to accommodate that is laid on local
authorities. As stated earlier, there are four requirements: people
must be homeless, they have to be in priority need, they have to be
eligible for assistance, and they cannot be intentionally homeless.
Normally, an applicant who has dependent children would be in priority
need. However, section 185 of the 1996 Act
states:</div>
					<a name="08012543000598"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person from abroad who is not eligible for housing assistance shall be
disregarded in determining for the purposes of this Part whether
another person...has a priority need for
accommodation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012543000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
all realise that children are often a gateway to being considered and
accepted as homeless by a local authority. An applicant&#146;s child
can be an important consideration in the decision on homelessness. If
that child is subject to immigration control because he or she is not a
British citizen, that child may be disregarded for the purposes of
determining whether 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column522" />Column number: 522</div>the applicant has priority need&#151;that is, if the person is a
British citizen or has the right to remain in the country but the child
does not, the child will be disregarded as far as the homelessness
legislation is concerned. Therefore, they will not have a priority
need, as decided by the local
authority.</div>
					<a name="08012543000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have
been a number of court cases in relation to that, which have ended up
in the Court of Appeal. In one such case, the judge decided that where
a dependent child is subject to immigration control, albeit the parent
is not, the parent cannot establish a priority need for accommodation.
That is the current situation. It was held to be incompatible with
article 14 of the European convention on human rights by the Court of
Appeal.</div>
					<a name="08012543000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
judge decided that current legislation discriminated against the
British citizen, who was the applicant, with a dependent child subject
to immigration control. The Court of Appeal&#146;s basic principle
was that immigration control has no legitimate bearing at all on a
British citizen. Therefore, if the applicant is a British citizen,
their rights are considered to override the decision to not include
their children, who are subject to immigration control. That is all
very complicated and I am certainly not a
lawyer.</div>
					<a name="08012543000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I bring the
matter before the Committee because the expectation was that, having
made that determination, there was an opportunity to go to the House of
Lords over it, as the Government did not seek to pursue it. Therefore,
the expectation was that the law would be amended to bring it in to
compliance with the convention. That has not happened. I know that the
Government have given some reasons as to why not, particularly to the
parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. However, because it has
not happened, public or local authorities are obliged to continue
applying section 185, although it is deemed incompatible. The law
continues to discriminate against those British citizens with children
who are subject to immigration control. We need to try to resolve
that.</div>
					<a name="08012543000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Have the
Government considered the situation and do they intend to bring the law
on homelessness into compliance with the European convention on human
rights? That is an important consideration. It is deemed that people
are being discriminated against by local authorities, and it is right
and proper that the House should determine that that should
stop.</div>
					<a name="08012543000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000707"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> As my hon. Friend says, far more eloquently than I
can, the new clause would reverse the situation with regard to
homelessness legislation by repealing the provision requiring local
housing authorities to disregard household members who are not eligible
for housing assistance when determining whether an eligible applicant
has a priority need for accommodation. The most likely reason that
household members would be ineligible is that they are subject to
immigration control&#151;they are either here illegally, or have
leave to enter or remain in the UK, conditional on them not having
recourse to public
funds.</div>
					<a name="08012543000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
explained that the new clause would require local authorities to take
into account such ineligible household members. Those members would
therefore be able to confer priority need on the applicant. In those
cases where the applicant was also 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column523" />Column number: 523</div>unintentionally homeless, priority need would confer entitlement to the
main homelessness duty to secure accommodation.</div>
					<a name="08012543000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">About 70 per
cent. of homeless acceptances generally have priority need conferred on
them by a pregnant spouse or partner, or by the presence of a dependent
child. In the first instance, homeless acceptances are likely to be
provided with temporary accommodation. For around 70 per cent. of
acceptances, the homelessness duty is ultimately brought to an end with
an offer of long-term social housing. My hon. Friend mentioned, quite
rightly, that the new clause has been prompted by the fact that the
courts have declared section 185(4) of the Housing Act 1996
incompatible with the European convention on human rights. It requires
a pregnant member of a British citizen&#146;s household, or a
dependent child, to be disregarded for the purposes of determining
whether the British citizen is homeless or has priority need, in cases
where the dependent child or pregnant household member is a person who
is ineligible for assistance.</div>
					<a name="08012543000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not a
lawyer&#151;I share that with my hon. Friend&#151;but everyone can
see that this matter raises some difficult policy issues about
ineligible persons from abroad being able to confer entitlement to
housing on another person, as well as difficult legal issues concerning
human rights. I fully sympathise with him in tabling the new clause,
but in my opinion&#151;and I stress, I am no lawyer&#151;simply
repealing section 185(4)(b) is not the answer. We need to find the
right balance&#151;an appropriate balance&#151;between our strong
policy that persons from abroad who are not eligible for assistance
should not be able to confer entitlement on someone else, and the
requirements and conditions of the European convention on human
rights.</div>
					<a name="08012543000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure my
hon. Friend that we will introduce a remedy as soon as we can, bearing
in mind the difficulties that we have in trying to compete with those
various policy and legal objectives. With that assurance, I hope that
he will not insist on the new clause.</div>
					<a name="08012543000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000708"></a>Mr.
Love:
						</b> Despite the threat of incurring the wrath of the
Conservative party, I will say first and foremost that it is important
for the UK to comply with the European convention on human rights. We
have signed up to it and we should respect decisions that say that we
are not complying fully with it.</div>
					<a name="08012543000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I accept what the
Minister says about the complexity of some of the issues, especially in
a case where a child may be in the country illegally, which raises very
serious issues. I also accept that there is good will on the part of
the Department, and that he has reflected on matters and they are still
being considered. They need to be looked at, and I hope that he will be
able to find a way forward that continues to strike the right policy in
a way that complies with the convention. If we can achieve both those
things, it will undoubtedly satisfy the concern expressed in the new
clause. I hope that he will do that, and I look forward to an early
statement at some point in relation to the matter. On that basis, I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div>

						</b> We are now on the track of part 2, which will
establish the office of tenants in terms of regulating social housing.
I wanted to start with some grand rhetoric about how we are raising
tenants&#146; services for social housing, but I thought better of
it. I shall start with what I am best at, which is technical
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08012543000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
regulator will cover England, not Wales. Clauses 63 to 65 amend the
Housing Act 1996 so that the provisions in part 1 of that Act will
apply only to Wales in future. This means that references to the
Housing Corporation or the Secretary of State will be replaced with a
specific reference to Welsh Ministers.</div>
					<a name="08012543000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments simply ensure that substitutions are made everywhere where
they need to be. Amendment No. 163 amends subsection (7). The 1996 Act
used the term &#147;the relevant authority&#148; for the Housing
Corporation and Welsh Ministers. We are replacing that term with
&#147;Welsh Ministers.&#148; The amendment ensures that where the
1996 Act uses the term &#147;the authority&#148; or &#147;the
relevant authorities&#148; suitable substitutions are made. It also
replaces singular pronouns and verb endings and ensures that the
changes are not made in section 51 and schedule 2 of the 1996 Act,
which cover the housing ombudsman. That is because the ombudsman does
not cover Wales and these sections of the 1996 Act will still be
relevant to England. We want to be sure that any reference to the
relevant authority there is not
substituted.</div>
					<a name="08012543000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 164 amends clause 64, which substitutes &#147;Welsh
Ministers&#148; for &#147;Secretary of State&#148; in a specified
list of provisions of the 1996 Act. The amendment simply ensures that
where that Act says the &#147;Secretary of State makes&#148;, it
should say &#147;Welsh Ministers make&#148;. I hope that I have
explained the technical amendments and that the Committee accepts
them.</div>

ask the Minister the same question that I asked about the
interrelations between the powers of the Secretary of State for
Wales&#151;whoever that may be&#151;and the Welsh Assembly. The
specific question that I hope he can also write to me about is to what
extent could the Secretary of State for Wales overrule decisions made
by the Assembly Ministers in the event of a disagreement. Once again, I
do not necessarily expect him to have the information now&#151;I
would be stunned if he did. If at some point in the next week or two,
he could write to me, that would be helpful, and I will pass on the
information to colleagues in the

matter for the

clarify that and write to the hon. Gentleman and other members of the

regulator, Oftenant, and the Homes and Communities Agency. Amendment
No. 165 will amend subsection (2) to allow the Secretary of State to
make orders either before or after the dissolution of the Housing

allowed for a single
order.</div>

					<a name="08012543000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
new clause 35 will replace subsection (3) and enable the Secretary of
State to require the Housing Corporation to provide staff, premises,
facilities or other assistance&#151;for example, by providing
information to the HCA or the regulator. I suggest that that would ease
the transition to the new regulator, which, depending on the passage of
the Bill, we aim to have operational from April 2009. It is important
that both the regulator and the HCA can pick up where the Housing
Corporation leaves off in terms of regulatory interventions and grant
payments. The amendments and new clauses will assist in that process,
so I hope that the Committee will accept them.

whether I might press the Minister a little on what he said. As I
understand it, he will be able to wind 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column529" />Column number: 529</div>up the two components of the Housing Corporation on different dates. Is
it possible to wind up the bit that deals with the regulator on one
date and the bit that will hand over to the HCA on another date? If so,
can he say that the date on which the relevant part of the Housing
Corporation is wound up will be the same as the date on which the
successor bodies take over, or does he envisage establishing the two
bodies and then, at a later date, winding up and dissolving the
relevant part of the Housing Corporation? In other words, is there a
big bang? Is there one day when the Housing Corporation is dissolved
and the HCA takes over and another day on which the regulator takes
over? Or will the order in clause 66 enable the Secretary of State to
dissolve the Housing Corporation after the two other bodies have been
established?</div>

want to make sure that we have a seamless transition. As the right hon.
Gentleman rightly suggests, the regulatory part of the Housing
Corporation could move at a slightly different pace to that of the
investment function. The clause will provide the flexibility to do
that.</div>

anticipate, although I do not want to box anyone in, that all that will
be done on the same day, but that might not be the case. I also want to
point out to the Committee that we have recently appointed Kate
Barker&#151;a Housing Corporation board member and a member of the
Monetary Policy Committee&#151;to chair the Oftenant transition
programme board. That group comprises staff from my Department, the
corporation, the Audit Commission and elsewhere. It is working to
ensure operational readiness for regulatory system, staff,
accommodation and that sort of thing. As I said, I imagine that the two
bodies will come into play at the same time, but the clause will
provide flexibility in circumstances that might not
happen.</div>

67 defines social housing in broad terms, and clauses 68, 69 and 70
tighten up that definition. My amendment seeks to focus the definition
of social housing more narrowly, and to do so in terms of the receipt
of public funds. My concern is that the definition of social housing in

					<a name="08012543000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, the Housing Corporation finances, regulates and
facilitates the proper performance of housing associations. It also
pays grants to unregistered bodies. So a registered housing association
comes within the embrace of the Housing Corporation, and it is almost
certainly in receipt of some public funds. The receipt of the public
funds gives Parliament the right to supervise how that money is spent.
Bodies that are in receipt of public funds are rightly exposed to
greater scrutiny than the private landlords that we were talking about
this morning.</div>
					<a name="08012543000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern about clause 67 is that it goes wider than housing
associations. For example, if someone decided to set up a charity, the
purpose of which coincided broadly with what we see in clause
68&#151;in other words, they wanted to provide homes at below market
rate for people in housing need&#151;they would be supervised by the
Charity Commission. However, they would not come into contact with the
Housing Corporation, because they might not be a registered housing
association and so would not get any money. Under clause 67 and the
subsequent clauses, that operation would fall under the new social
housing regulator, but it would not have fallen within the embrace of
the Housing Corporation.</div>
					<a name="08012543000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">Likewise, if a philanthropic
company, such as Rowntree, had some land and wanted to make it
available for exactly the purposes laid out in clause 67 and subsequent
clauses, it could give the land for no cost at all to a company, which
could then provide low-cost homes for below-market rent or, as laid out
in clause 69, low-cost home ownership. At the moment, such a company
would not be regulated by the Housing Corporation, but under clause 67,
it would be. That could result in the emergence of our old friend the
perverse consequence.</div>
					<a name="08012543000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Organisations that might want
to do exactly what the Minister and the Committee want&#151;namely,
provide more affordable homes&#151;would be deterred because they
would come within a regulatory framework under which they would not
come at the moment. Places for People has briefed all members of the
Committee. It
states:</div>
					<a name="08012543000606"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
definition currently in the Bill could have the adverse effect of
preventing this sort of product coming to the market.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012543000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The sort of product that it has in mind
is low-cost rental and low-cost home ownership. Therefore, is this a
broader definition than the one that we have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column531" />Column number: 531</div>currently? Will it catch the well-meaning organisations that are not so
regulated at the moment? If so, we have to ask
why.</div>

							<a name="08012543000724"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> I rise to oppose the amendment, because I feel
that it fails to understand the implications of the Cave review, which
is for domain regulation, and would result in a number of very perverse
consequences for the oversight of social housing. Cave&#146;s
proposal for a domain regulator obviously has a wider remit than the
narrow remit that was accorded to the Housing Corporation. We know that
it is intended that the provision of local authority housing and
arm&#146;s length management organisation housing should be brought
within the domain in due course.</div>
					<a name="08012543000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, the examples that the
right hon. Gentleman cited are of philanthropic organisations, such as
Rowntree. Incidentally, Rowntree&#146;s housing association is
registered, and I see no reason why a similar one should not be
registered in future. However, if it were not registered, it would
still be appropriate for it to be regulated, because it is in the
interests of tenants that they should have broadly comparable
protection.</div>
					<a name="08012543000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right
hon. Gentleman will understand, however, that under the regulatory
provision, there can be private providers, profit-making providers and
non-for-profit providers, all of whom can provide housing that would
come within the ambit of the regulator. On the first point&#151;I
will come to the second in a moment&#151;I feel that the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s proposal is not
appropriate.</div>

George Young:
						</b> Will the right hon. Gentleman explain why
the philanthropic body that I described should come under the embrace
of the social housing regulator, when some of the unscrupulous
landlords that we talked about this morning would
not?</div>
					<a name="08012543000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000726"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> Another interesting question is whether the
entire rented sector should be regulated. That is a separate debate,
but I take as my starting point the fact that we are to give effect to
the Cave review recommendations, which propose that the whole social
housing sector should be a domain subject to regulation. That is the
first reason why I oppose the amendment.</div>
					<a name="08012543000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second reason for opposing
the amendment is that it will have some very perverse consequences.
Landlords are increasingly looking to subsidise social housing through
housing for sale. London and Quadrant&#151;one of the more innovative
housing associations, which is based in my constituency and has a large
number of properties all over the south of England&#151;is involved
in an extremely exciting new development at Stratford that overlooks
the Olympic site. The profits from the sale of some of the units will
subsidise other units that will be available for social
renting&#151;something that would otherwise not be
possible.</div>
					<a name="08012543000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would it
really be sensible that tenants in properties that are subsidised by
profits from sales should not have the benefit of the regulatory system
that applies to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column532" />Column number: 532</div>others? Similarly, if as a result of a section 106 agreement, land was
made available at less than best value and therefore houses could be
provided at a rent appropriate for social housing, should that be
excluded from the regulatory purpose? I do not see how we can encourage
a more innovative approach from landlords and housing associations,
cross-subsidising and making the most of the planning system, if we
then say that the people who occupy the housing that is the product of
such developments should not have the benefits received by others whose
homes have been in receipt of public
subsidy.</div>
					<a name="08012543000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000727"></a>Sir
George Young:
						</b> Does the right hon. Gentleman want to bring
within the embrace of regulation organisations that fall outwith it at
the
moment?</div>
					<a name="08012543000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000728"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> No, it is not my wish to do that&#151;other
than for the providers of social housing. However, it is my wish to
prevent those who are within the ambit now going outside it. I suspect
that the amendment would make that possible, and Places for People
could well end up&#151;possibly, this is their ambition&#151;as a
large development company. The language that it uses in its publicity
describes it as a development company, not a housing association, and
it has certain elements that are entirely outwith the regulated
sector.</div>
					<a name="08012543000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
whether that is a sensible way forward. I see real benefit in the
housing association movement being entrepreneurial and providing a
range of products, including housing for sale, while being part of the
same movement and subject to the same regulations. I would be rather
opposed to changes that made it possible for some to opt out of the
framework, simply because they did not receive money for a certain
development.</div>
					<a name="08012543000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
discussed the matter with chief executive of Places for People
yesterday, and I made it clear that I have no sympathy for the
amendment, so it will come as no surprise to him to hear that I oppose
it. I hope that the Minister will take a similar
view.</div>
					<a name="08012543000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000729"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:
						</b> I have more expansive comments to make about
the clause, Mr. Gale, and I hope that you will permit me to
do so in a clause stand part debate. I believe that that will make more
sense. If I do so now, I will be going slightly wide of the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08012543000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern
relates to definitions. I have to thank Shelter for highlighting the
issue, which relates to clauses 67 to 70, although I do not intend to
make the same comments on clauses 68, 69 and 70. Shelter recommends
that the definitions should be amended to put it beyond doubt that the
Government intend social renting to retain its key characteristics of
affordability and security, and even more importantly, that it is kept
separate from low-cost home ownership. In other words, the social
renting sector should not be confused with low-cost home ownership or
any other kind of so-called affordable housing by coming under the same
definition.</div>
					<a name="08012543000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Shelter&#146;s concern is
that, if there is a confusion of those two definitions, it could result
in &#147;social housing&#148; becoming the standard term to
describe both low-cost rental and low-cost home ownership. It would be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column533" />Column number: 533</div>unfortunate if that happened, because the definitions are not merely
notional; they also make a practical difference to how we organise
affordable housing in this land. The characteristics of social rented
housing are clear. First, it is let on an affordable rent. The
definition of that already exists very clearly in other Government
documents. Secondly, it offers security of tenure for life.</div>
					<a name="08012543000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new definition in the Bill
seems to put those characteristics at risk and change the nature of
social housing. The wording leaves the door open for a loss of security
and affordability, not only for new entrants to social rented housing,
but for those people already living in it. That might be an unintended
consequence, or the Government might be consciously seeking to make
that change. The difficulty is that it erodes current protections for
residents in social rented housing. That seems a rather serious
change.</div>
					<a name="08012543000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Low-cost home
ownership is a relatively new concept, and it was introduced on a very
small scale in the 1980s and 1990s. Recently, there has been a more
rapid rise in house prices. Home ownership becoming more desirable and
more difficult has led to an increase in low-cost home ownership. The
obvious problem is that private developers prefer to discharge their
obligations to include affordable housing in their developments under
section 106 by building low-cost houses, rather than rented houses. In
Shelter&#146;s submission to the comprehensive spending review in
2007, it pointed out that the situation is serious. Data on completions
indicate a shift away from rented accommodation towards low-cost home
ownership.</div>
					<a name="08012543000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
present definition of social rented housing is very important. In the
current climate, when social rented housing is desperately needed, it
seems that the situation is militating away from that type of
accommodation and towards low-cost housing. The Government have
acknowledged some of the issues that relate to definitions in their
planning policy statement of 2006, in which definitions that sought to
clarify what social rented housing actually is were published for the
first time. That leads me to the key point.</div>
					<a name="08012543000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">At a time when the Government
are evidently committed to building specific target amounts of social
rented housing, it seems counter-productive to introduce a new
definition of social housing that could encompass low-cost home
ownership, as well as low-cost rental. The easier it is for builders to
construct premises intended for low-cost home ownership, the more
likely they are to do that instead of constructing low-cost rented
houses.</div>
					<a name="08012543000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
a problem with rents. It is not currently clear how future rents in
social rented housing will be set. For some time, a rent restructuring
regime has specified maximum rents and annual rent increases in social
rented housing. The definition of social rented housing under PPS3
refers specifically to controlled rent as a defining characteristic of
social rented housing. The Bill seems to change that and discontinue
the rent regime. I therefore ask the Minister whether that is the
intention and a correct understanding of what the Bill will
do.</div>
					<a name="08012543000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Until that matter
is resolved, there is a risk to the affordability of social rented
housing. In fairness, clause 68 states that rent should be
&#147;below the market 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column534" />Column number: 534</div>rate&#148;, but it does not guarantee that that rent will be
affordable. For example, in London, even fairly basic tenancies are
extremely expensive. There is a lot of latitude beneath the free market
for very high rents. I hope that the Minister can give some clarity on
that issue.</div>
					<a name="08012543000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
definitions of low-cost rental housing under the Bill appear to change
the security of tenure guarantee. Clause 68(c), which we will come
to&#151;I will not make the speech again at that point&#151;states
that low-cost rental housing is to have</div>
					<a name="08012543000607"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;rules for eligibility designed to
ensure that it is occupied by people who cannot afford to buy or rent
at market rate.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012543000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
making reference to those who occupy social housing, rather than to
those to whom social housing is being allocated, the Bill implies that
assessments of eligibility could be ongoing for existing tenants and
take place not just when the property is being allocated to a tenant.
The implications of that are fairly
clear.</div>
					<a name="08012543000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
explicit question to the Minister is whether that is a correct
understanding of what the Bill does. He may want to comment on that
issue when we discuss clause 68, but if he wants to do so now, that is
fine. If that is a correct understanding of the Bill, will he consider
making a modification to tighten up that
definition?</div>
					<a name="08012543000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one
more question on the fundamental issue of definitions. Does the
Minister understand that bringing rental housing and low-cost home
ownership together will lead to the potential problems that have been
described? Will he consider that between now and Report? The Housing
Minister has made a point of saying on a number of occasions that there
is no threat to the security of tenure, but it is curious to put that
together with what will happen under the definition in clauses 67 to
70. To avoid doubt and confusion, I should be grateful if the Minister
clarified what is intended. Does he share any of the concerns that
Shelter and I harbour in regard to these
definitions?</div>
					<a name="08012543000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000730"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> I know from conversations with the Minister before
the Bill came to Committee that he was as concerned as I was that the
definitions might cause confusion for all of the reasons that we have
heard about. Clause 67 is the starting point for a series of clauses
that goes up to clause 70 and deals with these definitions. This is the
right place to tighten up the definitions, so that everybody is clear
about the meaning of the descriptions in these
clauses.</div>
					<a name="08012543000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has written to you, Mr. Gale, and has been kind enough to
copy me in, to point out that amendments have been tabled to address
the issues raised by the definition of social housing. Although we are
discussing clause 67, those amendments have direct relevance in clauses
68 and 69. I raised those issues with the Minister for Housing in the
evidence session to seek reassurances that, by broadening the scope of
the definition of social housing, we will not be playing tricks with
claims about the amount of social housing that is being
provided.</div>
					<a name="08012543000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister and his colleagues are sensitive to the accusation that they
have built less social housing in every year of the past 10 years than
in any of the years under Thatcher and Major. If we are to resolve the
issue in a way that satisfies Shelter and other members 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column535" />Column number: 535</div>of the Committee, we should adopt the amendment tabled by my right hon.
Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire that says simply that
housing</div>
					<a name="08012543000608"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in direct
receipt of Government Capital Grant
Funding&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012543000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">should be
considered as the style of housing that we think of as social
housing.</div>
					<a name="08012543000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to
me that, in recent years, the definitions of social housing and
affordable housing have been made much clearer by things such as PPS3
and the descriptions that we have been hearing about. Now is not the
time to muddy those definitions. I appreciate that the Minister will
almost certainly explain that amendments have been tabled to the
clauses that we are about to debate&#151;clause 68, in
particular&#151;to clarify some unnecessary muddying of the water and
confusion. I ask the Minister to seriously consider, either now or on
Report, accepting a much clearer definition that all hon. Members would
be much happier
with.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Andy Slaughter</b> (Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush)
(Lab): I wish to comment briefly on what was said by the last
two speakers. A little bit of mischief is being made&#151;but not
very well. It was rather like watching incompetent magicians, who I
always find more entertaining than real ones.</div>
					<a name="08012543000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not that there was no
substance in what was said by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, but
it would have had a little more credibility if the Minister had not, as
I understand it, already given assurances on security of tenure.
Concerns about the subject were raised over the past year or two, but
that ghost has now been laid to rest; at least, I hope it has. I would
have a little more sympathy on rental targets if it were not for the
fact that Liberal Democrat councils in London singularly failed to meet
London plan targets in relation to rented housing.</div>
					<a name="08012543000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, London authorities
have good targets, well set out by the Mayor&#151;50 per cent. social
housing, and within that a 35 per cent. and 15 per cent. split between
rented housing and shared ownership or intermediate housing. We should
all support that, and nationally I think that the Liberal Democrat
party does, but it is honoured more in the breach than in the execution
at local level. However, that is not why I want to speak. I want to
make a brief point, probably as much on the amendment as what the hon.
Member for Montgomeryshire said&#151;so I shall pretend that it
is.</div>
					<a name="08012543000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mentioned on
Tuesday, when we were debating clause 272, a concern that I and others
have in relation not to the breadth but to the narrowness of the
definition. I understand that the Minister does not intend the basic
principle set out in clause 67 to apply to local authority and
registered social landlord Gypsy and Traveller sites. I take the point
made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich that
it is the intention, in due course, for the regulator to cover local
authority housing, and if the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the
Member for West Ham and me to clauses 109 to 111 are
successful&#151;I hope they will be&#151;that will happen sooner
rather than later. In any event, it will happen.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column536" />Column number: 536</div>
					<a name="08012543000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my opinion,
it is appropriate that the regulator should be given a remit for Gypsy
and Traveller sites, whether RSL or local authority sites. In our
debate on clause 272, we touched on the fact that often, and
regrettably, the management of Gypsy and Traveller sites is not up to
the standard even of much other social housing. As this part of the
Bill is meant in part to improve the quality of management of social
housing, it is entirely appropriate that the regulator should be given
such a remit. The very fact that we need clause 272 to bring security
of tenure on to an even keel is indicative of the fact that we have
some way to go to ensure that Gypsy and Traveller sites are treated by
local authorities in the same way as they treat other
tenants.</div>
					<a name="08012543000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
why I did not table an amendment is that it is not necessary, as clause
71 gives the Secretary of State the ability to widen that definition by
regulation. Indeed, clause 71(2) specifically states that it may be
done</div>
					<a name="08012543000609"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where the Secretary
of State thinks the accommodation is of a kind, or is provided in
circumstances, that serve the needs of a group whose needs are not
adequately served by the commercial housing
market.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012543000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is almost a
definition of what local authority and RSL Gypsy and Traveller sites
provide. I shall not press the point further now, except to say that I
would like the Minister to indicate in his reply that he will consider
the matter for subsequent regulation and that the Government will look
at it if they believe that regulation should be extended in that way,
as I believe it is a clear
case.</div>

						</b> Members have raised an awful lot of issues about
the definition of social housing and I will respond with regard to the
group of amendments that relate to clause 68. A number of things need
to be mentioned. I will touch upon definition, security of tenure and
other such issues when considering that group of amendments because
they are incredibly important.</div>
					<a name="08012543000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point made by the hon.
Member for Montgomeryshire about rent restructuring, I do not think
that there is anything in the Bill that undermines rent restructuring.
The Bill actually gives the regulator power to set standards, and I am
looking forward to the debate on clause 173, which deals with that. It
gives the regulator power to set standards on rents and gives Ministers
power to direct, so in that respect, I do not think that there is an
issue or that the measure undermines rent
restructuring.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000733"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:
						</b> Shelter&#146;s concern is that the
provision distinctly removes the security of tenure, albeit subtly. I
will come back to that point in relation to clause 68. With regard to
the rental point, I was persuaded, having looked at the Bill and spoken
to Shelter, that the provisions would weaken the confidence tenants
currently enjoy that rents will be reasonable. That might be a
difference of opinion, so I will certainly have another look at the
provisions and hope that the Minister will as
well.</div>
					<a name="08012543000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000734"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I am clear that the Bill maintains a clear
distinction between rented housing and low-cost home ownership. This
and subsequent clauses have a definite 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column537" />Column number: 537</div>purpose&#151;to regulate social housing to raise standards, and that
important distinction
remains.</div>
					<a name="08012543000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and
Shepherd&#146;s Bush about Gypsies and Travellers, I attended a
meeting of the all-party group on Gypsy and Traveller law reform on
Wednesday, at which the issue was raised. I hope that I reassured my
hon. Friend when I was there, but I reiterate for the Committee that
sites and accommodation provided by registered social landlords for
Gypsies and Travellers&#151;there are relatively few of them at the
moment&#151;come under the responsibility of the regulator. We will
shortly have an interesting debate on cross-domain regulation. There is
a little bit of work to be done with regard to local authority sites
and Gypsy and Traveller accommodation, but his interpretation is
exactly the same as mine, which is that that could be regulated under
clause 71, and I hope that reassures him
further.</div>
					<a name="08012543000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a lot
of time and respect for the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire,
who moved the amendment, and my respect and admiration for him have
grown since working with him on the Bill. However, I fundamentally
disagree with the amendment. I do not think that its intention is clear
and do not know what its full effect would be. That is partly because
it would have an impact on the other aspects of the definition that we
have touched on throughout our considerations, yet they have not been
reflected in other amendments. In part, too, getting the definition of
social housing right is not easy. I am a good example of that: I
certainly do not seem to have got it right although I have tried to
reassure hon. Members about that. It is true that any changes that are
made have wide implications and there may be unintended perceptions, as
I have experienced when attempting to define social
housing.</div>
					<a name="08012543000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, one
effect of the amendment is clear&#151;because it says so on the face
of the amendment: it would exclude from regulation new social housing
that has not been in direct receipt of Government grant funding. Under
the Housing Act 1996, the whole stock of a registered social landlord
can be subject to regulation, no matter how it is funded. The amendment
would change that position fundamentally. In particular, tenants of
social rented housing funded by planning gain, by section 106
obligations, and without grant&#151;my right hon. Friend the Member
for Greenwich and Woolwich is right to note that we have been talking
about a diversity of people coming to social housing&#151;would not
be protected by standards set by the regulator. Local authorities, when
negotiating such planning gain agreements, would not be able to rely on
regulations as they do now, and would seek to replicate some of those
terms in what would probably be an unwieldy way.</div>
					<a name="08012543000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Conversely, not all grant used
to provide housing is for social housing. In future&#151;we touched
on this point a lot during our consideration of part 1&#151;the Homes
and Communities Agency will not only fund social housing but in some
places may bring about market housing. I have said before that we would
not want those market homes to be social housing under this definition
and thus subject to regulation, nor would we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column538" />Column number: 538</div>want to require that their owners be registered providers. We had an
interesting stand part debate on clause 35 on that
point.</div>
					<a name="08012543000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">It all comes
down to my fundamental concern, which is that the amendment defines
social housing as the means by which it is achieved rather than by its
characteristics. I stress to the right hon. Member for North-West
Hampshire and the Committee that we want to amend the provision; we are
about to discuss those amendments. We shall amend the wording used to
define the characteristics to make clear what we mean by social
housing. I believe strongly that this philosophical policy
point&#151;that social housing should be defined by means of its
characteristics&#151;is the right approach. I therefore ask the right
hon. Gentleman to consider what I have
said.</div>

						</b> The Minister has, in a sense, answered my
question. I was about to ask him whether it was accidental or
intentional that the distinction between rented and low-cost home
ownership is blurred. He says that he is happy to get rid of that
definition. I cannot remember his exact words, but it is clear that he
wants to blur the distinction. Is my understanding correct? Are the
Government consciously blurring the distinction between rented
accommodation and local-cost home
ownership?</div>

							<a name="08012543000736"></a>Mr.

						</b> No. In response to an earlier question, I told the
hon. Gentleman that the Bill provides a clear distinction. We have
experienced difficulties with the definition. We want to define what
needs to be regulated, but the difficulty is defining what is social
housing. I am very clear that there is a large distinction between
rented housing and low-cost home ownership. I hope that I have answered
the hon. Gentleman.</div>
					<a name="08012543000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire, I hope that
I have made my position clear. I hope that he will withdraw the

							<a name="08012543000737"></a>Sir
George Young:
						</b> Let me begin by saying exactly what the
Minister said about me. As these proceedings go on, I develop my
respect for him&#151;but.</div>
					<a name="08012543000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I draw two conclusions from
what the hon. Gentleman said. He will be pleased with the first, which
is that my amendment has too narrow a definition. The second is that
his definition is too wide.
</div>
					<a name="08012543000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept what was
said by the Minister and the right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich&#151;that because it would exclude section 106 and planning
gain, the amendment defines social housing too narrowly. On that
ground, it ought to be resisted. I also accept that housing
associations that are currently regulated should not fall outwith
regulation because of the definition. However, the definition in the
clause will catch organisations that would not be caught at the
moment.</div>
					<a name="08012543000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">What the
Minister said convinced me that what I said at the beginning was right.
As an example, I take a philanthropic organisation that is seriously
considering entering that market and wants to provide homes at below
market rent and homes to meet the needs set out in the clause. If it
goes down that road without applying to anyone for money&#151;no
section 106 money, no grant&#151;but then discovers that under clause
173 an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column539" />Column number: 539</div>outside body can come along and fix its rents, fix its allocation policy
and fix its method of handling tenants&#146; complaints, it might
draw back and say, &#147;If I do not provide houses for people in
need, and houses at below market rent, but go for full-cost houses and
houses that I can let at market rents, I do not get any of this
regulation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012543000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Faced with that scenario, will
the Minister not concede that as currently defined it might pull
against the thrust of the Bill, which is to provide more low-cost
affordable homes? There is a risk of over-regulation and perverse
consequences if he introduces the very broad definition that we see in
clause 67.</div>
					<a name="08012543000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I beg to

							<a name="08012543000740"></a>Andrew
Gwynne:
						</b> The Bill designates two types of housing as social
housing&#151;low-cost rented accommodation and low-cost home
ownership. My amendments would further clarify what is meant by
&#147;low-cost&#148;, so that such housing is made realistically
affordable to people on low incomes.</div>
					<a name="08012543000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 327 would prevent
providers of social housing, be they private providers, registered
social landlords or local authorities, from letting units as low-cost
rental homes if the rent was only marginally below market level, which
as a result would still be out of reach to those on low incomes.
Amendment No. 328 would give legislative expression to the aspiration
of achieving mixed communities on housing estates in the context of the
limited supply of low-cost homes currently available for
rental.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column540" />Column number: 540</div>
					<a name="08012543000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 329 would ensure
that those aims apply in relation to low-cost home ownership, too. It
would ensure that low-cost home ownership was genuinely affordable and
was, therefore, a genuine option for those on low incomes.</div>
					<a name="08012543000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern is that many homes
are originally planned and designed as low-cost housing, but are
ultimately sold or let only marginally below market value. In addition,
the amendments would give legislative and regulatory expression to the
aspiration of achieving mixed communities in areas of privately owned
accommodation.</div>
					<a name="08012543000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">As right hon.
and hon. Members will know from their surgeries, many homes provided
through the affordable housing programme&#151;both social rented and
low-cost home ownership schemes&#151;are increasingly priced beyond
the limits of realistic affordability. As currently worded, the Bill
will not rectify the problem; it will not guarantee to help those
facing such affordability pressures.</div>
					<a name="08012543000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would result in
social housing having to be priced at a level that was affordable for
people on low incomes. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton
and Shepherd&#146;s Bush pointed out on 11 December, Wandsworth
council once called properties at 99 per cent. of the market rate
affordable. Other authorities are targeting their affordable housing at
people with incomes of between &#163;50,000 and &#163;60,000 a
year, something referred to by my hon. Friend earlier today. Those are
certainly not the levels of income that I come across when attempting
to help my constituents find a home that they can realistically afford.
The average annual income in my constituency is &#163;16,500 a year,
with many people earning a lot less than that. As we increase social
housing to rent and to buy, we need to ensure that it is affordable to
people on that sort of income.</div>
					<a name="08012543000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anecdotal evidence suggests
that the reduction in the level of housing corporation grant per unit
has led to the problem becoming more acute, with some housing
associations increasing the number of homes they rent at intermediate
rates relative to the number of homes let at social rents.</div>
					<a name="08012543000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are further upward
pressures on pricing. The National Housing Federation recently called
for non-profit-making housing associations to have the power to raise
rents by 1 per cent. above the retail prices index rather than the RPI
plus 0.5 per cent. as at present.</div>
					<a name="08012543000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Affordability is an issue for
people looking for a home to rent and those needing help to get on the
housing ladder alike. Last year&#146;s Halifax key worker survey
showed that a nurse living in London would have to spend more than 10
times his or her annual salary to buy a house, an increase of nearly a
quarter since 2002. It is not a problem only in the capital. Although
the problem is acute in parts of London, house prices in my
constituency have risen by almost 500 per cent. over the past 10 years,
making even a modest terraced house unavailable for people on a low
income. According to the Halifax survey, only 1 per cent. of towns
across the country are affordable for nurses, and teachers are priced
out of the market in 78 per cent. of towns. The difficulties are not
restricted to entry-level salaries or to those in one or two
occupational groups; the issue affects working people in all sectors of
the economy and it is the lowest paid 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column541" />Column number: 541</div>who face the greatest difficulties. If teachers are priced out of the
market in 78 per cent. of our towns, there is little chance for
teaching assistants, cleaners, bus drivers or shop workers
either.</div>
					<a name="08012543000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Key
worker schemes have certainly provided some respite and I welcome the
Department for Communities and Local Government&#146;s new campaign
to provide information to key workers, to raise awareness of the scheme
and to make it easier and simpler for employees to apply. Nevertheless,
opportunities to access key worker schemes are clearly limited to
specific occupational groups. Such schemes should not be an alternative
to increasing the supply of affordable housing more
generally.</div>
					<a name="08012543000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
makes it clear that low-cost rental accommodation and low-cost home
ownership should be set below the market rate. My amendments would
ensure that those two varieties of social housing are realistically
available to all those on low incomes. I appreciate that there will be
further work to do to define what we mean by low income in the
regulations, but introducing low income into the equation and referring
to it in the Bill would provide greater clarity than simply defining
social housing as below the market rate.</div>
					<a name="08012543000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
stated, my amendments would give some legislative expression to the aim
of creating mixed and sustainable communities. In the Bill, there is a
sense that social housing&#151;whether low-cost ownership or low-cost
rental&#151;will be housing of last resort and that it will be
exclusively for those who cannot afford the market rate. In the current
context of scarcity of supply, I am sure that hon. Members believe that
the needs of those with abject housing problems should be prioritised.
However, we should not forget our long-term aspiration to create
genuine mixed-community developments and to avoid past problems caused
by building large amounts of social housing separate from areas of
privately owned housing. I realise that the primary way in which that
can be achieved is by solving the current lack of supply of housing and
consequential high prices by building more homes. I fully support the
Government&#146;s ambitious goal of increasing the supply of housing
so that 3 million new homes are provided by 2020. However, a good
supply of housing for rental and purchase will still need to be
realistically available to those on low incomes, including many of my
constituents and those of other hon. Members. That will require a more
substantial definition of affordable and low cost than is in the
Bill.</div>

							<a name="08012543000741"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:
						</b> I praise the hon. Member for Denton and
Reddish for his insightful amendments, particularly amendment No. 328,
which is exactly right. I am keen on it because I fear that our
readiness to consider social housing as a problem solver risks
ghettoising the people who live in social housing. Much of the Bill
makes the underlying assumption that we are helping the poor, and that
recipients of social housing are some how disadvantaged in society so
we must house them in a way they can afford. Although I use that
language for effect, the truth is that we want to ensure that everyone
in the UK, which is after all a first-world country, lives in something
better than second-world accommodation. However, if there is not a
proper balance, there will be ghettoisation. Amendment No. 328 makes a
sincere and fairly informed effort to ensure that there is a decent mix
of housing and a generation of sustainable communities.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column542" />Column number: 542</div>
					<a name="08012543000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the Minister will accept
the sentiments expressed by the amendment. If I were him, I would
happily accept the amendment&#151;that might be a reason for the hon.
Member for Denton and Reddish to cross the Floor, but I will talk about
that later. Will the Minister tell us how we can ensure that the Bill
and the Government&#146;s general strategy on social housing does not
create ghettos, but results in the type of mixed housing that amendment
No. 328 would
introduce?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000742"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> This is an incredibly important group of
amendments and I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Denton
and Reddish for raising the issues they cover. It is incredibly
important that we ensure that all concerns are addressed.</div>
					<a name="08012543000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses 67 to 69 define the
term social housing for the purposes of the Bill and regulation. The
Committee will note that I, too, have tabled amendments in the group
that I hope will make our intention clear and clarify the effects of
the clauses.</div>
					<a name="08012543000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments in my name are partly a response to concerns raised in the
House, during oral evidence sessions, and by stakeholders that the
definition used could be perceived as permitting or appearing to permit
the means-testing of social housing tenants on the basis of whether
they can afford to buy or rent a home at market prices. Let me be
clear: there is absolutely no intention on the part of the Government
for the definition to have that effect. Concerns have been expressed
that a Tommy Cooperesque moving of the hands will take place to ensure
that it looks as though we have provided more social housing. That is
not the intention either.</div>
					<a name="08012543000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are trying to provide 3
million new homes by 2020 and it is important that we provide 45,000 to
50,000 new social homes a year. There is no sleight of hand; we simply
want to ensure that social homes are provided to those who need them
and that they are regulated to the best standards. We are trying to be
very clear about that, but there has been misinterpretation and the
existing clauses 67 to 69 cause confusion. I accept that the definition
is not perfect and could be made clearer, which is why we have proposed
our amendments.</div>
					<a name="08012543000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Linked with the problems and
concerns about means-testing is the issue of security of tenure, which
has been mentioned by stakeholders and by my hon. Friend the Member for
Denton and Reddish. I want to clamp down on concerns about that as fast
as I can because people should not have the impression that we are
saying, &#147;You are allowed a council house or social house, but
once you get to a certain income and have been promoted you will be
kicked out because it is all about means-testing and security of
tenure&#148;. That is not the case. People were concerned that the
Bill would allow eviction if tenants reached a certain level of income
and I want to reassure the Committee and wider stakeholders that that
is not the case. Clauses 67 to 69 have nothing to do with security of
tenure; they are meant to provide for social housing for the purposes
of regulation. The security of tenure attached to a particular tenancy
type is provided for in other legislation, for example the Housing Act
1988, which specifies the grounds on which landlords can seek
possession. Part 2 of the Bill, which deals with regulation, does not
change the 1988 Act; it does not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column543" />Column number: 543</div>alter the grounds for possession for any type of tenancy, so I hope that
we can put to bed concerns about security of
tenure.</div>

							<a name="08012543000743"></a>Mr.
Slaughter:
						</b> I do not think that it needed to be said again,
but as the issue was raised, the Minister is right to be so
categorical. Given that the matter was raised by the Opposition,
perhaps he will join me in condemning these
words:</div>
					<a name="08012543000610"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Living
in social housing should be viewed as a transition during which support
is temporarily required for moving up the ladder to some form of shared
or outright
ownership&#148;.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000744"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> That is a disgraceful phrase. As the hon. Member
for Montgomeryshire said, the idea seems to be that those who have not
succeeded in life are forced to live in social housing. That is exactly
what we are trying to avoid, because we want balanced and mixed
communities. The hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield mentioned
Mrs. Thatcher, who said that people who lived in a council
house or who used a bus before the age of 30 were failures. That is an
absolutely disgraceful attitude, which we need to move away from, and I
am glad that the Government are not pursuing policies based on such
attitudes.</div>

of the rest of Europe that people might choose to rent accommodation,
rather than own it, and that is certainly the case to a great extent in
Germany? Perhaps he can save us a little time by clarifying whether
what he said about security of tenure was intended unequivocally to
reaffirm that nothing in the Bill will weaken security of tenure as it
was before we began debating the Bill. If that is correct, it is useful
to have it on the record.</div>

					<a name="08012543000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman makes an important point about tenure, social housing
and employment. My mother and father came from council houses, and
until she died recently, my grandmother lived in the same house that
she had lived in since 1950. Her whole estate had full employment, and
my ambition during my time in this post is to see social housing again
become synonymous with full employment. We can ensure that that happens
by providing a range of support to deal with worklessness and other
skills training. We have an exciting agenda, which will move us forward
on that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column544" />Column number: 544</div>issue, and we are seeing those things happen again. Social housing is
not seen as a last resort, and that is exactly what I want to
avoid.</div>

							<b class="B">Alistair
Burt</b> (North-East Bedfordshire) (Con): I did not intend to
intervene, because I am conscious of the time, but I will do so briefly
given the way in which the sitting has gone. The Minister will recall
that during the evidence sessions and on Second Reading I discussed
security of tenure, the importance of mixed communities and how we must
address the fact that there is much more renting on the continent.
Despite the good intentions of the Minister and the Government, he must
be disappointed at the lack of social mobility that is becoming
apparent and which has, alas, become a feature of the
Government&#146;s past few years in power. If he intends to realise
his aspirations, he must surely tackle social mobility, because it has
either become paralysed or it is going backwards, which it did not do
during my party&#146;s time in power.</div>

it is what a progressive left-of-centre Government are all about. I do
not want to labour the point, but the Prime Minister has set out his
long-term ambition in terms of skills and this country&#146;s ability
to compete given the challenges facing the global economy. We are
absolutely up for the challenges facing us and we are putting in place
policies to achieve those aims. That is exactly what we should be doing

						</b> I am also conscious of the time, but some of this
cannot slip by unchallenged. My grandma lived in a council house for
most of her adult life, and I used to visit her there before she died.
She was proud of her home, and it is completely untrue that there is a
policy out there to overturn such arrangements and kick people out of
their homes. As the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s
Bush well knows, the policy document to which he referred was a
proposal to the party, not the policy of the party. Such a claim simply
cannot go on the record. Will the Minister accept the point made by my

						</b> No. The Conservative party would have considered
the policy. The fact that it is even up for consideration is
disgraceful, let alone that it was ever thought of as policy. I want to
crack on and address the points that were made by my hon. Friend the
Member for Denton and Reddish about the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08012543000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 327 covers part of the definition that we are not amending. Clause
68(b) states that low-cost rental homes should be let at sub-market
rates. The amendment would go further, requiring that rents not only be
below market rate but</div>
					<a name="08012543000611"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
such an extent that it is affordable to those on low
incomes.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012543000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have already discussed at length, and no doubt will do so again, the
concerns that were raised by our original definitions of low-cost
rental and low-cost 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column545" />Column number: 545</div>home ownership accommodation, which referred to its being allocated in
accordance with rules designed to ensure that it is occupied by people
who cannot afford to rent or buy at the market
rate.</div>
					<a name="08012543000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
amendment No. 328 seeks to omit such reference to affordability from
the part of the definition referring to rules for allocating low-cost
rental accommodation, amendment No. 327 seeks to introduce a stronger
affordability criterion elsewhere. For the reasons outlined earlier, I
do not think that including an affordability criterion as part of the
defining characteristics of low-cost rental accommodation would
essentially address the concerns that have been raised by hon. Members
and stakeholders in respect of means-testing. I shall come on to that
later as well.</div>
					<a name="08012543000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern with the amendment is that, if it is taken to its logical
conclusion, any social home that did not have a sufficiently low rent
level would, in theory, actually be a market home and therefore not
subject to regulation. That would decrease the number of homes
regulated. Alternatively, the effect of the amendment could be that the
definition limits rents to a certain level. I have some sympathy with
that, but I do not think that the definition of social housing is the
right place to set rent policy. We consider that the best way to do
that is through strategic Government direction under clause 177, which
we shall discuss, implemented by the regulator through the standard
setting under clause
173.</div>
					<a name="08012543000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000753"></a>Mr.
Love:
						</b> I agree with my hon. Friend on the need for
flexibility and for deciding policy at the appropriate place, but does
he accept that certainly in Greater London there is real concern about
the rental policy that is being followed and the resulting
affordability of accommodation? I do not think that it is appropriate
to try to set rents through this Bill, but the issue must be kept under
consideration. At the very least, we must accept that, for many people
on lower incomes, paying the rent in socially rented accommodation in
some of our urban centres is
difficult.</div>
					<a name="08012543000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000754"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I disagree with my hon. Friend. He looks a bit
shocked at that, but such discussions are within the scope of the Bill.
When we reach clauses 173 and 177, I look forward to a robust debate on
his point about rent setting, standards and directions. We can have
that debate
then.</div>
					<a name="08012543000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
328 would revise clause 68(c), which covers the rules of allocation for
low-cost rental. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Denton
and Reddish, because his amendment is helpful. However, it is
unnecessary, given the Government amendments that I hope to move
shortly, which seek to resolve Members&#146;
concerns.</div>
					<a name="08012543000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
discussed the matter longer than I imagined we would, but I am
sympathetic to the proposal that rules should also promote mixed and
sustainable communities. I strongly support such communities. However,
there is not a precise legal term for mixed communities&#151;I
believe that my hon. Friend mentioned this&#151;and I am not sure
what the effect would be of including the requirement in the Bill. I
keep referring to discussions that we will have on the clauses on
standards. I suspect that the standards on lettings are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column546" />Column number: 546</div>probably a better place than a statutory definition of social housing to
ensure that lettings contribute to mixed sustainable communities. To
the extent that the amendment suggests that the rules should seek to
ensure that scarce low-cost rental accommodation be made available to
those who are not on low incomes or in housing need, it risks adding to
shortages.</div>
					<a name="08012543000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 329 would revise clause 69(3), which covers the definition of
low-cost home ownership. Again, while I am sympathetic to the spirit in
which the amendment was tabled, I have concerns about its practical
effects. An additional concern is that it would require that homes be
affordable for those on low incomes. We would all like to increase
access to home ownership for those on low incomes, but, unfortunately,
that is not always possible. A fundamental point is that low-cost home
ownership schemes are additionally targeted at many groups that would
be considered to be middle income. We have mentioned nurses, and other
public sector key workers could be involved, as well as first-time
buyers. We would not want low-cost home ownership aimed at those groups
to be excluded from the definition of social
housing.</div>
					<a name="08012543000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments in my name try to do things that are similar to what my hon.
Friend&#146;s amendments would do. The intention of the clauses is to
define social housing in respect of its characteristics, a point that I
made in debating with the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire.
Those characteristics are that the allocation of new lettings is
limited by some mechanism to those who need it most, and lettings are
offered at below market prices, at least for low-cost rental, which
those who need it can afford. That makes sense: if there is a limited
resource&#151;social housing will always be a limited resource
because, obviously, there is a finite amount of public
money&#151;access must be
prioritised.</div>
					<a name="08012543000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that
basis, I propose three changes to address the concerns that have been
raised. First, amendments Nos. 168 and 170 remove the words &#147;of
eligibility&#148; after &#147;rules&#148;. Those words are not
necessary to define social housing, and the amendments make it clear
that the rules referred to are likely to cover allocation rather than
eligibility. The word &#147;eligibility&#148; has a particular
meaning in the context of social housing allocation legislation, and we
did not want to risk further
confusion.</div>
					<a name="08012543000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
amendments Nos. 169 and 171 replace the words &#147;occupied
by&#148; with &#147;made available to&#148;. They clarify that
the rules referred to relate to the initial allocation of a home rather
than the ongoing occupation of it. As I said earlier in response to a
point made by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, I have always been
clear that these clauses have absolutely no effect on tenants&#146;
security of tenure or on the grounds on which landlords can seek
possession of their
homes.</div>
					<a name="08012543000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
in spite of that assurance, I think that replacing &#147;occupied
by&#148; with &#147;made available to&#148; better captures the
point at which the rules would have
effect.</div>
					<a name="08012543000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000755"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:
						</b> That probably resolves the issue that Shelter
and I raised. For the avoidance of doubt, therefore, what the Minister
is saying is that there is no 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column547" />Column number: 547</div>intention of challenging the existing tenure arrangements with that
modification of the legislation. The assessment will be made at the
start but will not be revisited
thereafter.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000756"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s understanding is
absolutely right. That is the clear
intention.</div>
					<a name="08012543000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">My third
proposed change is in amendments Nos. 169 and 171, which refer
to</div>
					<a name="08012543000612"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;people whose needs
are not adequately served by the commercial housing

					<a name="08012543000613"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;people
who cannot afford to buy or rent at market
rates&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012543000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise that
social housing is not just for those who cannot afford market-rate
housing. It may also be for people who are vulnerable and need greater
security of tenure than is offered by the market, or who need a form of
specialised housing. I made that point in the oral evidence sessions
last month.</div>
					<a name="08012543000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
revised wording is consistent with clause 71, which deals with the
Secretary of State making regulations to add to the stock covered by
the social housing definition. The effect of the amendments is only to
clarify what was always our intention in defining social
housing.</div>
					<a name="08012543000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000757"></a>Mr.
Slaughter:
						</b> Before my hon. Friend moves away from the
definition of social housing, I have sympathy with his criticisms of
the amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish, and
I agree that their intent is good. However, I do not think that the
Minister&#146;s definition, although it is better, goes far enough.
As was pointed out, where there are attempts to evade what we would
consider a reasonable definition of social housing&#151;there is the
example of 99 per cent. market rate, or there are the examples that I
gave this morning&#151;they would still come squarely within the
definition of &#147;not adequately served by the commercial housing
market&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012543000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">Conservative
councillors in the area that I represent have expressly said that they
do not wish to see, in relation to housing, people who are in an income
bracket below &#163;50,000. The leader of the council in Hammersmith
said, &#147;We must stop our borough becoming a ghetto for the urban
poor.&#148; Fifty per cent. of households in my constituency have an
income of below &#163;20,000. It is a very divided community in
income terms. How will the Minister ensure that there is not
manipulation of the definition to ensure that not people at the bottom
or in the middle, but only people at the top
benefit?</div>

							<a name="08012543000758"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> In the short term, that is exactly the sort of
thing that the regulator could investigate. We will soon discuss
cross-domain regulation. I know that there are concerns that local
authorities and ALMOs will not be brought into the scope of the
regulator straight away. However, the regulator could consider that
sort issue and ensure that those concerns are addressed. I will go away
and reflect on that, because my hon. Friend raises an important point.
I hope that he is satisfied with that pledge.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column548" />Column number: 548</div>
					<a name="08012543000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government amendment No. 172
simply corrects a reference in clause 70. It currently includes the
phrase</div>
					<a name="08012543000614"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;low cost shared

					<a name="08012543000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">and

clause 241, registered social landlords registered with the Housing
Corporation will automatically become non-profit registered providers
under clause 241 when the existing system is confined to Wales only.
Clause 76 provides that, unless specifically exempted, all property
owned by such landlords will be social housing even if it does not meet
the tests in clause 67. I thought it important to provide protection
for existing housing stock of existing RSLs, as the Housing Corporation
can in theory regulate it
all.</div>
					<a name="08012543000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have already explained that one reason for providing a definition of
social housing is that not all housing owned by existing RSLs is social
housing. In clause 76, we have sought to provide exemptions for certain
stock owned by existing RSLs who will become registered providers under
clause 241, which we do not think requires the same degree of
regulatory protection. Clause 76 includes a power for the Secretary of
State to make regulations to exempt certain existing stock owned by
existing English RSLs from the definition of social housing. We thought
that it would be helpful to add to the list in the statute where we
were clear that a particular category of housing should not be social
housing. The Housing Corporation does not regard, for example, student
accommodation as social housing. Government amendment No. 177 means
that existing accommodation owned by English RSLs made available only
to students in full-time education or training will not be social
housing.</div>

						</b> These are technical amendments to ensure that
clauses 74 and 75 have their intended effects. Those clauses are part
of a group of clauses that sets out circumstances in which homes can
leave the social housing stock. As the Committee
knows,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column550" />Column number: 550</div>clause 67(2) provides that once a dwelling is classified as social
housing, it remains social housing until one of the events specified
under these clauses takes
place.</div>
					<a name="08012543000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
covers homes that leave the social housing stock with consent. The
regulator&#146;s consent is described as being</div>
					<a name="08012543000617"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in accordance with Chapter
5.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012543000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">That chapter sets out
the disposal consents regime. Government amendments Nos. 173 and 174
will add references to other provisions under which registered
providers may require consent for disposals of land, namely section
171D of the Housing Act 1985 and sections 81 and 133 of the Housing Act
1988. Those provisions refer to homes subject to the preserved right to
buy and homes originally owned by housing action trusts or local
authorities, where the Secretary of State&#146;s consent was required
for the original disposal. Currently, those provisions require
registered social landlords to seek the Secretary of State&#146;s
consent for subsequent disposals. However, we propose to amend the Bill
to pass to the regulator responsibility for consenting to onward
disposals by registered
providers.</div>
					<a name="08012543000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 175 clarifies that a dwelling does not cease to be social
housing if a disposal is made with the regulator&#146;s consent as
part of shared ownership or equity percentage arrangements. Under such
arrangements, purchasers can buy their home in several stages. Each
stage could, in theory, constitute a disposal with the
regulator&#146;s consent. However, the home will leave the social
housing stock only when the purchaser buys the final share of his or
her home. That event is covered in clause
72.</div>
					<a name="08012543000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 176 is a very technical amendment to clause 75, the
current wording of which is somewhat ambiguous. It allows the regulator
to direct that a specified dwelling is to cease to be social housing if
it has</div>
					<a name="08012543000618"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;ceased to be low

strictest possible interpretation, it cannot cease to be low cost
rental or low cost home ownership accommodation until it ceases to be
social housing. The amendment will simplify the wording so that the
regulator can direct that a specified dwelling is to cease to be social
housing. I hope that I have clarified those matters and that the
Committee accepts the
amendments.</div>

Burt:
						</b> This is an important section, but I think that we
will all try to be concise, because, having discussed the matter in an
evidence session, we know what we are about. In tabling the amendments
and in the sentiments behind them, I am delighted to be joined by the
hon. Member for West Ham. We will be as succinct as possible in putting
forward our
arguments.</div>
					<a name="08012543000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will be aware that a discussion is taking place in the
housing world about domain regulation and whether all social housing
should fall under the same process of regulation, as recommended in the
Cave review. The amendment probes the Minister about the extent to
which his discussions have proceeded with those involved in the housing
world to ascertain whether the Bill could be used to bring together
under one domain the necessary regulation. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column553" />Column number: 553</div>am speaking principally from a brief presented by the Local Government
Association and the Chartered Institute of Housing, which supplements
the evidence that they gave during the evidence-taking
sessions.</div>
					<a name="08012543000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
memorandum sets out all those who helped to put the note
together:</div>
					<a name="08012543000619"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
policy position in this note has been shaped and agreed by the LGA
Environment Board, a group of expert council officers in housing and
corporate performance roles, and the CIH Policy and Practice Board, a
group made up of senior figures from across housing associations, local
authorities and ALMOs. No one in either of our memberships has
expressed any disagreement with it. It is also supported by the
National Federation of ALMOs, the National Housing Federation, National
Federation of Tenant Management
Organisations&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08012543000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
others from that part of the housing world. All those groups and people
have significant day-to-day experience of what the effect of the
amendment would be, and they believe that it is worth doing, is
practical and can be
done.</div>
					<a name="08012543000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">The memorandum
continues:</div>
					<a name="08012543000620"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
welcome very much the
Minister&#146;s&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="08012543000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
then Minister for Housing, now Chief Secretary to the
Treasury&#151;</div>
					<a name="08012543000621"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;statement
in her oral evidence session that &#145;If there were consensus on
the matter and everyone felt that we could get far enough fast enough,
we would obviously be happy to look at amendments&#146; to enable
regulation to operate domain-wide without the need for further primary
legislation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012543000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
continues:</div>
					<a name="08012543000622"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
also agree with her that the regulation of council landlords could not
operate identically to housing associations&#148;.
</div>
					<a name="08012543000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">That point is covered in new
clause 60 as a consequential
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08012543000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key
point that the LGA and the CIH make is that there exists sufficient
recognition, across the housing sector, of the import of bringing
regulation under one domain for the Government to risk introducing it
into this legislation, if not by accepting the amendment, but by
undertaking seriously to consider the possibility of introducing an
equivalent amendment in the Lords. The LGA and CIH accept that there is
a risk in amending legislation, and that it must be as right as
possible. However, they and we point out that a significant number of
Government amendments&#151;118 in part 2&#151;have been tabled
which we will deal with fairly late in our proceedings. That is a lot
of Government amendments to get through and it will take up time. We
acknowledge that that is part of the process, but as so many Government
amendments are to be considered, why not think seriously about my one,
on which there is such strong
consensus?</div>

					<a name="08012543000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">The LGA and CIH
believe that there
are</div>
					<a name="08012543000623"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;serious risks in not
providing for the establishment of domain regulation in the current
legislation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012543000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">They state
that, first, the achievement of the objective set out in the Cave
review and agreed by the Government will depend on further primary
legislation, for which, as we all know, there is not always time.
Secondly, they
state:</div>
					<a name="08012543000624"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Even if
time for further legislation were available in the 2008-09 session, it
is impossible to see how it could be enacted, necessary secondary
legislation put in place, and the regulator&#146;s operating approach
defined and started simultaneously with the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column554" />Column number: 554</div>start of the new regime for housing associations in April 2009. There
must be a serious risk that the new regulator will be set up and
commence operations with a focus on housing associations...and
that it would struggle to develop the necessary equivalent competence
and focus on local authority
landlords.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012543000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">They believe
that the risk of not including such regulation under the same domain at
the same time outweighs the risk of accepting the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08012543000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the LGA and CIH put forward a joint view as to how the regulation of
local authority landlords should operate. First, they
say:</div>
					<a name="08012543000625"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In line
with the recommendations of the Cave Review, the approach, across the
whole domain, should be customer-driven but deregulatory in
character.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012543000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
they
state:</div>
					<a name="08012543000626"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Regulation
should only apply to the landlord functions of councils and
ALMOs&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012543000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">They believe the
other strategic roles, allocations and private sector regulations
should be included in the comprehensive area assessment, which is the
import of new clause 60, and be taken up under the Local Government and
Public Involvement in Health Act 2007. Thirdly, the
say:</div>
					<a name="08012543000627"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
regulator's approach to information requirements, inspections and
intervention must be consistent with the local performance
framework&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08012543000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
fourthly:</div>
					<a name="08012543000628"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Regulation
can and must respect other characteristics of councils as
institutions.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012543000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that the hon. Member for West Ham wishes to speak, and I have done
my best to pr(c)cis the arguments. The bottom line is to ask the
Minister what his intentions are. When we dealt with the matter in the
evidence session, the general consensus was that if it could be
achieved, it would be a good thing to do. Those closely involved have
considered it further and think that it can be done. Having spoken this
morning to someone representing the Local Government Association, I
think that the Minister can be confident that his officials have not
offered any chink of light that the Department believes it can be done,
so I am not putting his officials on the spot. However, the view of
those with whom the Government have negotiated in the housing sector is
plainly that it can be done, and I hope that the Minister can give us
some hope that an appropriate amendment can be made, if not here then
in the other
place.</div>

					<a name="08012543000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are intended to ensure that meaningful protection is offered
by the regulator of social housing to all tenants and residents living
in social housing, as defined in clause 67. At present, the measures in
the Bill do not give the same level of protection to tenants and
residents living in social housing that is owned and/or managed by
local authorities and ALMOs as they do to those whose landlord is a
housing association or a private sector social housing manager.
Standards should be the same for all providers. As the hon. Member for
North-East Bedfordshire stated, that concept is supported by the
Chartered Institute of Housing, the Local Government Association and
the National Federation of ALMOs, the National Housing Federation, the
National Federation of Tenant Management Organisations, the Tenant
Participation Advisory Service, the Tenants and Residents Organisations
of England and Shelter. All these organisations share the view that
social tenants, whatever the type of landlord, deserve and should be
able to expect the same
protections.</div>
					<a name="08012543000403"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: center;">[<span class="SmallCaps">Sir
George Young</span>
						<i class="I">in the
Chair.</i>]</div>
					<a name="08012543000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
exclusion of local authorities and ALMOs from regulatory oversight by
Oftenant would mean that not all tenants would get the same protection,
and it might well send the message that tenants are not the primary
consideration of the House and that a focus on tenants will not be the
new regulator&#146;s primary characteristic. The case for domain
regulation was clearly made in the Cave review
which&#151;notably&#151;is called &#147;Every Tenant
Matters&#148;. That philosophy is at risk of being lost if half the
social housing tenants have reduced levels of protection.</div>
					<a name="08012543000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot see that the inclusion
of local authorities and ALMOs is problematic for the Government, as
the Bill already enables different treatment for non-profit and
profit-making providers within an overarching framework of standards
and regulatory objectives that apply to all. The Bill could equally
differentiate between the detailed treatment of local authorities and
of ALMOs while realising ambitions for domain-wide objectives and
standards. For example, there are differences between ALMOs, local
authorities, housing associations and for-profit providers that mean
that enforcement mechanisms would need to be different according to
provider type. Domain regulation needs to fit into the local government
performance framework and the proposed comprehensive area of
assessment. Surely, that is no barrier, as it does not need to be dealt
with in this legislation, and can be addressed later through protocols
and terms of reference negotiated between Oftenant, the Audit
Commission and other relevant bodies. If the Bill does not establish
domain regulation, I understand that we would be dependent on further
primary legislation, so I would welcome the Minister&#146;s view on
the matter. There is always intense competition for parliamentary time,
and it is easy to see how future legislation to tidy up housing
regulations could be pushed aside in favour of higher
priorities.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column556" />Column number: 556</div>
					<a name="08012543000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am concerned
that if Oftenant begins its work dealing only with housing associations
of whatever ilk, the organisation&#146;s structure and mechanisms
will be tailored, quite understandably, to working with housing
associations rather than across the social housing sector. Many of my
constituents would benefit from a simple and readily identifiable
regulator that could deal with their problems and complaints in a
uniform manner. The diversity and range of providers, particularly in
areas of London such as my constituency, only makes this issue more
important. Amendment No. 307 would allow housing associations and ALMOs
to be subject to the new housing regulator&#151;the Office for
Tenants and Social Landlords&#151;in a similar manner to other social
landlords.</div>

							<a name="08012543000774"></a>Lyn
Brown:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. Gale. Amendments Nos. 308
and 309 are necessary to ensure that as well as local housing
authorities, ALMOs are considered providers of social housing for the
purposes of part 2, chapter 2. As an ALMO is not legally a landlord of
a property, it is important that the Bill recognises that a person may
operate social housing on behalf of a landlord eligible for regulation.
That is again necessary to enable a single regulatory body to be set up
for all social tenants. The deletion of clause 110 would complement
this package of amendments, as it specifically ensures that local
authority bodies and ALMOs are unable to register with Oftenant, and
therefore prevents it from regulating them.</div>
					<a name="08012543000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
to clause 111 is designed to bring both local authorities and ALMOs
within Oftenant&#146;s remit, but, at the same time, to maintain the
distinction between profit-making and non-profit-making landlords. That
is crucial to ensure that later stages of the Bill do not conflict with
the organisational and constitutional arrangements governing ALMOs and
local authorities. Clause 163 simply ensures that Oftenant would not
regulate the disposal of property and assets by local authorities that
are already overseen by other appropriate bodies. The amendments to
clauses 223 and 225 would ensure that if Oftenant&#146;s remit
extended to local authority properties, the rights of local authority
tenants to make decisions about the management of their homes would be
protected.</div>
					<a name="08012543000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise
that the Government fully intend to extend the remit of the regulator
to cover local authority and ALMO properties. It is important that
allowance is made in the Bill for the different governance and
financial arrangements within social housing provision, but I hope that
the Minister will consider the suggestions outlined in the amendments
as a mechanism to achieve full regulation of the social housing sector
in the Bill. Even if the Bill included both ALMOs and local authority
sectors within the remit of the regulator, it would still neglect a
method of social housing provision that, especially in areas such as
mine, provides considerable levels of
housing.</div>
					<a name="08012543000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">Almost 6,000
families are housed in temporary accommodation in the London borough of
Newham. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column557" />Column number: 557</div>Some &#163;67 million per year of public money is spent paying private
landlords in the form of housing benefit. That, as I am sure all hon.
Members will appreciate, is a significant sum of money, and it affects
a significant number of families. Those people, in the main, are among
the most vulnerable in our communities. People in temporary
accommodation are there because the council&#146;s statutory duty to
house them cannot be met within the current housing structure. It does
not have enough council or housing authority homes to house those
families. The families can remain in temporary accommodation for a
number of years due to the acute shortage of social
housing.</div>
					<a name="08012543000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would argue strongly that those properties should be subject to
regulation by the regulator. A significant amount of public money is
expended on purchasing temporary accommodation, but without the
equivalent regulatory framework within which housing associations and
local authorities operate. I believe that, if private landlords want to
access the often lucrative temporary accommodation market on behalf of
local housing authorities, they should be willing to accept the
responsibilities that being a social landlord should
involve.</div>
					<a name="08012543000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Minister will appreciate, I have received many reports of extremely
sub-standard temporary accommodation supplied by the private rented
sector, and have heard of numerous cases of families desperate to
secure alternative social housing, as their temporary accommodation is
appalling. I appreciate that the use of temporary accommodation
provides local authorities with flexibility, and that additional
regulation may reduce the number of properties available for temporary
accommodation, but I believe that the proposed provisions would help to
cool the housing market in my area, and possibly enable more
owner-occupiers to purchase property. I am surely not alone in
believing that the vast sums of money spent on accommodation should
ensure that the services provided are effectively scrutinised and of a
certain quality.</div>
					<a name="08012543000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
return to my previous point, standards should be the same for all
providers of allocated housing from the public purse. Public money
should mean public accountability, which is why I tabled amendment No.
344 to clause 109. It would add to the list of organisations eligible
for registration with the regulator any provider of secure
accommodation under section 7 of the Housing Act 1996. I accept that
the amendments, particularly amendment No. 344, may be difficult to
accede to on the hoof, but I urge the Minister, at the very least, to
take those matters away and to consider them
further.</div>

							<a name="08012543000775"></a>The
Chairman:

through it extremely well. I will have a chat with her

							<a name="08012543000776"></a>Dr.
Blackman-Woods:
						</b> I have one question for the Minister. The
Local Government Association and the Chartered Institute of
Housing&#151;I might need to register an interest in the institute
because I have some sort of membership with it, although I cannot
remember which category it falls into&#151;have made a convincing
argument. In particular, they say that whether someone who is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column558" />Column number: 558</div>allocated social housing ends up in a housing association or in council
property will often come down to chance and where a suitable home is
available. They therefore ask, perfectly reasonably, what justification
there can be for fundamentally different approaches to regulations. As
all hon. Members will recognise, there are significant differences in
governance and financial arrangements between local authorities in the
different parts of the domain, but it is not impossible to overcome
those to ensure that we have a similar system of regulation. Does the
Minister intend to table an enabling amendment to allow Professor Ian
Cole&#146;s work to be considered in detail in secondary
legislation?</div>
					<a name="08012543000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000777"></a>Mr.
Slaughter:
						</b> There appears to be some consensus on the issue
of cross-domain regulation, which I will endeavour to breach, although
I might not succeed. I have subscribed to amendments Nos. 336 and 337,
which were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham and would
have much the same effect as those tabled by the hon. Member for
North-East Bedfordshire. I very much support the earliest possible
extension of regulation to ALMOs and local authorities.</div>
					<a name="08012543000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second Reading, I was highly
critical of the performance of some RSLs in my constituency and
elsewhere in west London and I may well be again later in our
proceedings. However, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the
gander, and I am pleased that the LGA and the National Federation of
ALMOs, which has been in contact with me on these and similar
amendments, are keen to suffer, or be rewarded with, an equivalent
degree of regulation.</div>
					<a name="08012543000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather that detaining the
Committee with general arguments, I want to give a telling example from
this week. As we have heard, the ALMO for the London borough of
Hammersmith and Fulham has just been awarded one star and has poor
prospects for improvement. That means that it has failed its inspection
and that there is the prospect of the bulk of the decent homes
money&#151;&#163;114 million&#151;not being made available to
improve 17,000 council homes in the borough.
<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> Well, I will pursue the issue a
little more because it shows that whatever our opinion of some
RSLs&#151;as I have said, they, like some ALMOs, are generally less
democratically accountable than local authorities&#151;the management
of council housing is highly variable in its quality, and there is no
less reason for it to be regulated in the generally excellent way
proposed in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08012543000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">I speak with some experience on
this issue and I know, because I ran it, that Hammersmith and
Fulham&#146;s council housing department used to have an excellent
record. The tenants went in deputation to the then Secretary of State
to ask not to become an ALMO, because they wished to remain under local
authority control. They did not take the nuclear option that people in
Camden did, and they were right not to do so, because they saw the
problems they would have accessing funding. Nevertheless, it was clear
that tenants were happy with the subsequent arrangements. Funding was
granted to the tune of &#163;192 million, and the first tranche of
&#163;178 million has been paid on the basis that it was better to go
ahead and have the necessary works done.</div>
					<a name="08012543000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">What has happened since has
been a tragedy. The department has gone from a three-star ALMO to one 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column559" />Column number: 559</div>that is in the worst possible position. Almost all of that has happened
in the last 18 months. During that time the administration of the local
authority and the managing board of the ALMO changed and fell into the
hands of Conservative councillors, which has had the effect of
marginalising the role of the tenant representatives. A combination of
neglect and detrimental policies has meant that the quality of service
provided to tenants has gone from excellent to appalling over a very
short period.</div>
					<a name="08012543000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
decent homes programme is more than a year behind schedule. The quality
of work is, in many cases, appalling. There are 5 per cent.
year-on-year cuts in the Budget, so matters that are not covered by the
decent homes programme, such as the renovation of marginal areas, are
not dealt with. Yet a surplus of more than &#163;20 million has been
accumulated. The purpose of that surplus is for non-state schemes,
which are directed at providing housing for those on incomes that are
two or three times the average. In other words, people who are on very
low or no income are being asked to subsidise people who are on two or
three times the average income.</div>
					<a name="08012543000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also the case that any
plot of land on estates, whether it be tenants&#146; halls or ball
courts, is being sold off for commercial gain. Generally speaking, the
only way in which council tenants and their assets are being regarded
by the Conservative council is for the purposes of asset
stripping.</div>

							<a name="08012543000781"></a>Mr.
Slaughter:
						</b> I take your point, Mr. Gale, and I
am bringing my remarks to a close. I often feel that concrete examples
are better than theory when it comes to explaining why protection is
needed for tenants in social housing. Frankly, the division between
those in RSL housing and those in ALMO or council housing is not an
official one and should be removed as quickly as
possible.</div>
					<a name="08012543000430"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000782"></a>Mr.
Love:
						</b> I will be brief, Mr. Gale.</div>
					<a name="08012543000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">When Sir Simon Milton appeared
before us on behalf of the Local Government Association, he was glowing
in his wish to have the regulator regulate local authorities as well as
all the other sectors that are included in the Bill. He also accepted
that there were some onerous provisions. However, as my hon. Friend 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column560" />Column number: 560</div>the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham has already said, provisions are
needed in many local authority areas to ensure that tenants are
properly protected. Sir Simon Milton accepted those onerous provisions
and said that they were something that local government could accept
straight away. Therefore, if the Minister gets up to say that it will
be two years before the regulations take effect, we will be in the
unusual position of having the organisation, which the Government does
not want to regulate, asking to be regulated. While I accept that there
may be issues that the Government will want to consider very carefully
before they bring local government into the Oftenant regulations, it
would be sensible to try to reduce the time scale for the
measure.</div>
					<a name="08012543000432"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
important issue that must be raised is that Sir Simon Milton made it
clear that the motivation for the Local Government Association&#146;s
decision was that it did not want to be excluded at the beginning of
the set-up of Oftenant. It is important, for all the reasons we know,
that the local authority voice and the ALMO voice should be heard
within Oftenant from the word go, or as early as possible. If the LGA
is not to be part of the regulatory coverage from the beginning, I hope
that the Minister will suggest ways in which it may be consulted on how
Oftenant should develop until it is part of the
process.</div>

					<a name="08012543000436"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire himself said that we would be
taking a risk in accepting the amendments&#151;or something along
those lines. That is at the heart of my opposition to them and to the
general movement on cross-domain regulation. Accepting the amendments
would mean taking a somewhat premature decision on defining the
framework under which the future regulation of local authority housing
management functions would operate. The amendments would also run the
risk of introducing a flawed framework that fails to provide what we
all want: a sensible and effective regulatory regime.</div>
					<a name="08012543000437"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me repeat our firm
intention. Our long and medium-term aims are for a single regulatory
framework for existing registered social landlords and local authority
landlords of social housing. I cannot be much clearer than that.
However, I think that hon. Members appreciate that bringing local
authority landlords within the regulatory framework is a complex
job.</div>

that we need a line-by-line repudiation of the amendment, although the
hon. Member for West Ham 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column561" />Column number: 561</div>may speak for herself. Time scale is at the nub of this issue; I use
that wonderful political phrase, &#147;If not now, when?&#148;
People want to know precisely what the Minister means by the long and
medium-term. We tabled the amendment on behalf of the housing sector,
and there is strong consensus in the sector and in this Committee that
the relevant conditions already exist. What is the Minister&#146;s
time scale? If it is too long-term and too much in the distance, that
will cause concern. People wonder whether the medium term might include
the other place.</div>

is within two years. People talk about two years, but I do not expect
it to take that long, because there is no policy difference or
philosophical aspect on which we disagree. We are simply trying to
overcome practical, governance-related obstacles. That is why we have
created an advisory group to advise on this matter. I may have to
disappoint the hon. Gentleman on his question, &#147;If not now,
when?&#148; It will be when the advisory group considers that the
barriers have been overcome. Before I talk more about the group, I give
way to my hon.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000788"></a>Lyn
Brown:
						</b> Has the Minister considered my point about setting
up an organisation and establishing it with the housing associations?
Slotting local authorities and the private sector into that system
might cause problems, given that organisations tend to mould themselves
to their tasks. Bringing in others at that later point might cause
difficulties.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000789"></a>Mr.

						</b> In order to have the seamless transition from the
Housing Corporation to the new regulatory body, the regulator will work
very closely with organisations such as the LGA. I do not want to box
the regulator in, but given that our policy intention is to have
cross-domain regulation, it makes sense to ensure that, when the time
comes, and when the barriers that the advisory group have been set up
to look at are overcome, we move to that cross-domain regulation as
quickly as possible.</div>

to give a flavour, I do not want to go over it amendment by amendment,

Member for North-East Bedfordshire, my hon. Friend the Member for West

still need to determine practical solutions to a range of complex and
difficult issues, would be foolhardy and benefit no one. It would be
detrimental to tenants of local authorities. I want to reassure
colleagues that we are not dragging our heels or seeking to
over-complicate matters. I would like to see the measure brought in as
quickly as possible, as soon as the advisory group is satisfied that
the barriers have been overcome. I hope that that reassures hon.

got to the paragraph dealing with &#147;a degree of risk&#148;,
officials&#146; eyes would light up. I knew how the brief would then
be constructed&#151;talk about giving something away. Those who have
put the case to us have been honest in their approach, wanting to take
things forward and recognising the risk, but also recognising the risks
of not moving at the same speed. Of course I accept what the Minister

am slightly puzzled as to why, between colleagues who know the area
well, there appears to be a gulf between those who believe that the
conditions are right now and think that it can be done, and those
responsible for making the change who think that it may be as far as
two years away. I am genuinely puzzled by that. I have no wish to press
the amendments to the vote, although I may return to the matter on
Report from the Back Benches. I would like those who have been dealing
with us to look at what the Minister has said and perhaps press a
further case to try to move him on the issue.</div>

and to help the future progress of the Committee, I say to the hon.

point. He does not like Hammersmith and Fulham council, and he is
engaged in a very long campaign against it, despite its local
electorate voting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column563" />Column number: 563</div>Conservative. Amusing though his local pamphlets are to the Committee,
and although we know about the rhetoric and understand his points, it
may get a bit tedious if he takes every opportunity to beat those
concerned over the head with the same stuff. For the sake of progress,
may I say that my hon. Friends and I take his point, although we do not
agree with him. We understand where he is coming from. No one in the
area would say that he was not a doughty opponent of the council,
wrong-headed though he may be. Nevertheless, perhaps if we could from

							<a name="08012543000793"></a>Sir
George Young:
						</b> I should like to press the Minister about
clause 81(1)(a), in the light of yesterday&#146;s statement about
which key regulators are to be subject to pre-appointment hearings by
Select Committees. I see from the list, to which I shall refer in a
moment, that the regulator in question&#151;one of the most important
we have&#151;will not be subject to such a hearing.</div>
					<a name="08012543000458"></a><div class="hs_Para">By way of background, the
Committee may know that in the Green Paper &#147;The Governance of
Britain&#148;, which was published in July, the Government proposed
to increase parliamentary scrutiny of appointments to certain posts, by
way of pre-appointment hearings with the relevant Select Committee.
Yesterday the Government published the list of which regulators would
be subject to the process. I have here the letter that the Minister for
the Cabinet Office sent to the Chairman of the Liaison Committee, which
says:</div>
					<a name="08012543000629"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Since
publication of the Green Paper, we have consulted widely across
Government to identify posts that would be suitable for pre-appointment
hearings. In keeping with the principles in the Green Paper, we have
focussed on posts which exercise statutory or other powers in relation
to protecting the public&#146;s rights and
interests.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012543000459"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
continues:</div>
					<a name="08012543000630"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
a result the final list comprises senior ombudsmen, HM Chief Inspectors
and key regulators.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012543000460"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill as it stands states
that</div>
					<a name="08012543000631"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
regulator shall consist
of&#151;</div>
					<a name="08012543000632"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) a person
appointed by the Secretary of State as chair&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column564" />Column number: 564</div>
					<a name="08012543000461"></a><div class="hs_Para">but not that they will be subjected to the
process in question. My anxiety at the exclusion of the social housing
regulator was heightened when I checked which regulators would be
subject to the process. They are the Commission for Local
Administration in England, the chair of the Statistics Board, the
chairman of the Office of Rail Regulation and the chair of the Office
for Legal Complaints, as well, of course, as the chair of the Gas and
Electricity Markets Authority. It is difficult to argue that the social
housing regulator will not have more of an impact on people&#146;s
lives than the regulators whose names I have just read
out.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000794"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> The right hon. Gentleman makes a persuasive
case, but of course all the regulators that he has mentioned already
exist. Has he inquired whether the absence of the housing regulator
from the list simply reflects the fact that the Bill has not yet been
enacted, so that the post does not yet
exist?</div>
					<a name="08012543000463"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000795"></a>Sir
George Young:
						</b> That is an ingenious and heroic defence of
the Minister, were he minded to accept it, but the Department was asked
in July which posts would be suitable for pre-appointment hearings and
the decision was announced yesterday. Yesterday, the existence of the
regulator in question was a matter in the public domain; a Bill is
under consideration. The fact that the regulator had not yet been
appointed was not a reason to exclude it from the list of posts to be
subject to scrutiny in future.</div>
					<a name="08012543000464"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Minister uses, if I may
put it in such  terms, the Raynsford
defence<i class="I">&#151;[Interruption.]</i>&#151;or the Greenwich defence,
that if the Bill had already been passed the regulator would have been
included in the list, I shall accept that. However, I suspect that the
Government do not propose to subject the post to pre-appointment
scrutiny. If that is the situation, perhaps between now and Report, the
Minister could go back, get the necessary clearance, and then tell the
House that the social housing regulator, whenever he is appointed, will
be subjected to the process to which other key regulators are exposed,
and that he would have to go to the Communities and Local Government
Committee for a pre-appointment
hearing.</div>

							<a name="08012543000796"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for that line of
questioning&#151;he made a persuasive case. I can update the
Committee on the appointment of the chair. The job description has been
approved internally by the Minister for Housing. A job advert will be
published in all appropriate press, including specialist press, in
February, with a view to a closing date for applications around March
and an appointment in May. The process is ongoing.</div>
					<a name="08012543000466"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not going to hide behind
the Raynsford, or Greenwich, defence. The right hon. Gentleman made an
important point and, with his permission, I shall go away and look at
the issue and clarify it, because it would be completely applicable for
the chair of Oftenant to be subject to the kind of scrutiny he talked
about. I shall certainly do that if he allows me.</div>

							<a name="08012543000797"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 40, in
clause 86, page 38, line 11, leave
out subsection
(7).</div>
					<a name="08012543000471"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now we come to
the meaty part of the Bill. It sets out the fundamental objectives for
the regulator and defines precisely the matters that will be the main
focus of regulation. It is an important part of the Bill. The amendment
would remove subsection (7), which is objective 6. It
says:</div>
					<a name="08012543000633"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Objective
6 is to encourage registered providers of social housing to contribute
to the environmental, social and economic well-being of the areas in
which the housing is
situated&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012543000472"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no
problem with that objective. We all recognise that the concept of place
shaping, which was a focus of the Lyons review, is an important part of
the agenda for local authorities and others who have a role to play. We
want providers of social housing to engage in discussions with local
authorities and others, and to make a
contribution.</div>
					<a name="08012543000473"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason why I tabled the amendment is that I do not understand how the
objective can be regulated. If one looks at the recommendations of the
Cave review, one will see that Cave had reservations about the
feasibility of regulating that level of activity. In fact, there are a
number of passages in the Cave review that indicate clearly a lack of
sympathy for giving the regulator powers to regulate such activity.
Paragraph 2.59, on the issue of policy passporting,
states:</div>
					<a name="08012543000634"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
practice of securing the implementation of a range of government
policies through the regulatory system is an endemic feature of the
present arrangements &#151; these are the policy costs of regulation.
It is the main cause of &#145;regulation creep&#146; and strongly
discouraged by the Better Regulation Commission...imposing a
stream of policy burdens on providers without regard to the costs is
poor
regulation&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012543000474"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
2.81
states:</div>
					<a name="08012543000635"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
review also concludes that there is considerable scope for reducing the
burden of regulation, both the policy costs and the administrative
costs which it imposes. Regulation and inspection should be more
closely aligned to tenants&#146; wishes for good quality services.
This should be done in a way which recognises the role of social
housing providers in assisting the delivery of local
government&#146;s strategic
goals&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012543000475"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clincher is
the third section that I shall quote. Paragraph 4.34
states:</div>
					<a name="08012543000636"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
not, in the review&#146;s view, the role of the regulator to regulate
the place shaping activities in which local authorities engage with
both housing providers and many other
organisations&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012543000476"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
seems clear, so I am troubled that subsection (7) expresses a clear
commitment to regulate the activities of social housing providers in
respect of their contribution</div>
					<a name="08012543000637"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to the environmental, social and
economic well-being of the areas in which the housing is
situated.&#148;</div>
				
					<a name="08012543000660"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08012543000477"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we think
about how that regulatory task could be performed, what on earth would
be the measures of performance? At the level at which Cave was
sympathetic, I can clearly see that it is right to expect the provider
of housing to engage in a discussion with the local authority, but in
terms of actual contribution 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column566" />Column number: 566</div>and outputs, let alone outcomes, I cannot conceive of a sensible
framework that would allow a regulatory system to operate that would
assess the contribution that those providers had made, other than
simply asking the question, &#147;Have they discussed this matter
with the local authority?&#148; That would be purely a matter of
consultation and it would hardly be appropriate for a complex,
regulatory procedure.</div>
					<a name="08012543000478"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, I can see a real
problem of a very heavy regulatory burden if the regulator tried to put
in place procedures for measuring the extent to which individual
providers of social housing were engaged in the process, what their
performance had been and what the outcomes and outputs of that
performance were.</div>
					<a name="08012543000479"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a serious risk of
regulation creep, which is precisely what Cave warned against, and also
of an overly heavy regulatory burden being imposed. The reason for
tabling the amendment is to suggest that it might be appropriate to
find ways of reflecting the clear recommendation of the Cave review
that registered social landlords and providers of social housing should
be engaged in constructive discussion on this issue, but that they
should not be subject to a burdensome regulatory regime. That is my
objective and I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment,
which is in line with the Cave recommendations that prompted the
establishment of the regulator.</div>

the amendment because it forms part of a list, which no doubt has not
escaped the attention of the right hon. Member for North-West
Hampshire. Also, the wording of clause 86(7) contradicts one of the
arguments that the Minister has used to ask us to withdraw various
amendments. He said that some of our amendments have been too vague or
not well defined. Surely subsection (7) falls right into that category.
It says that the aim is</div>
					<a name="08012543000638"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to contribute to the
environmental, social and economic well-being of the
areas&#148;.</div>

					<a name="08012543000483"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps it is to do with
investing in social networks. Indeed, anything could come under that

this subsection, will he please desist from criticising us for tabling

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000799"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich is correct. This is an important clause, because it clearly
sets out the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column567" />Column number: 567</div>regulator&#146;s objectives. Amendment No. 40 would remove the
regulator&#146;s sixth objective, outlined in subsection (7), which
is</div>
					<a name="08012543000639"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to encourage
registered providers of social housing to contribute to the
environmental, social and economic well-being of the areas in which the
housing is
situated.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012543000485"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that that is perhaps the regulator&#146;s most controversial
objective, but from speaking to tenants organisations about it, I have
found that they are keen on it, so I shall stress why it is necessary.
All hon. Members will appreciate that good housing is vital to an
area&#146;s well-being, and landlords, especially those with large
concentrations of stock in a particular area, have an important role to
play. Landlords of social housing need to be good neighbours, so as
well as improving homes, RSLs and others need to improve
neighbourhoods. Giving the regulator an objective on the
landlords&#146; wider role in the community means that when the
regulator performs its functions, such as setting standards, it will be
able to recognise and take into account landlords&#146; wider
activities in their area. Without such an objective, the regulator
might decide that landlords would and should operate more economically
or efficiently if they limited their activities to the core landlord
role, without any regard for the well-being of the area in which their
housing is situated. Indeed, the regulator might even set standards
that sought to discourage such activity or ignored the benefits, and we
all know, because we heard it in the oral evidence sessions from the
National Housing Federation, that RSLs currently provide an enormous
amount of wider, voluntary well-being activity. I cannot believe that
the perverse consequences of removing that provision are what my right
hon. Friend and the sector would want, so I shall offer some
reassurance.</div>
					<a name="08012543000486"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
objective to &#147;encourage&#148; contribution to local well-being
does not necessarily mean that the regulator will regulate RSLs&#146;
voluntary activities. In considering how to encourage a contribution to
the well-being of an area, the regulator will need to consider how best
to achieve its objective, already bearing in mind its 10th objective,
which is</div>
					<a name="08012543000640"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to regulate in
a manner which&#151;(a) minimises interference, and (b) is
proportionate, consistent, transparent and
accountable.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012543000487"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the regulator will also be able to set standards requiring providers to
co-operate in certain ways with local authorities in local
place-shaping, but clearly that contribution must be proportionate to
landlords&#146; holdings in the area.</div>
					<a name="08012543000488"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000800"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> I accept the principal thrust of my hon.
Friend&#146;s argument; the issue is important and, rightly, it
should not be totally excluded. The thrust of my argument, he will
recall, was not that I do not regard the issue as important, but that
it is inappropriate to regulate. How does he envisage a regulatory
regime ascertaining whether a registered social landlord has met the
objective? I cannot for the life of me see how a regulatory regime can
do anything other than either simply tick a box, which is not the
regulation that we want, and I wonder whether it will consult the local
authority, or introduce a huge series of separate measures that would
be completely disproportionate and
burdensome.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000801"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Far be it from me to set what the regulator will
want to do, but I imagine that involvement with the local community, by
ensuring a contribution to the local strategic partnership and the
sustainable communities strategy, and by having a real role, perhaps by
participating in an appropriate local authority scrutiny role, will be
important. The regulator will want reassurance that registered
providers are going to engage in general well-being, such as the LSP
and the sustainable communities strategy.</div>
					<a name="08012543000490"></a><div class="hs_Para">To some extent, I shall now
argue against myself, because I have mentioned the importance of the
measure and of standards, but conversely just because a regulator has a
particular objective&#151;on this occasion to encourage a
contribution to local well-being&#151;it does not necessarily follow
that he has to set standards. I look forward with some relish to
considering clause 173 on standards. At this point, however, standards
are the regulator&#146;s most powerful tool, but not the only one. I
genuinely imagine that, like the Housing Corporation, the regulator
will have other ways to encourage voluntary activity, such as helping
to spread good practice, commissioning research and so on. I go back to
my earlier point, which is that it will ensure that objective 6 is
considered in the roundest possible sense. It will ensure that it is
not just focused on the core housing function, that it does not
consider efficiency and economy at the expense of other things, and
that having a wider contribution to that place-shaping is important.
That is why objective 6 is a crucial part of the regulator&#146;s
activity. On that basis, I hope that my right hon. Friend withdraws his
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08012543000802"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:
						</b> The Minister has more or less covered all the
points, but there remains the question of the non-specific nature of
the edict. To be quite serious, he has criticised other amendments that
have been tabled as being not very specific. How does he square that
with the fact that the clause is open to the widest interpretation? I
do not have an issue with that in a sense, but I have an issue with the
Government on the one hand saying that they do not want certain
amendments because they are not specific enough, and on the other hand
defending such a clause.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000803"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns,
but those issues will be interpreted by the regulator. I keep coming
back to objective 10, which is important. I cannot imagine a
circumstance in which the regulator will spend 90 per cent. of his time
on objective 6. He needs to minimise interference, and I think that I
have set out in a relatively clear manner what I would imagine the
regulator doing with regard to this in terms of participation in local
strategy partnerships and ensuring participation in the sustainable
community strategy. I hope that that reassures
him.</div>
					<a name="08012543000493"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000804"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> I shall withdraw the amendment, because I want
to make progress and there will be further opportunities to discuss
this. However, I must make it clear that I am not convinced by my hon.
Friend&#146;s case. In the first place, he has not provided a basis
for an understanding of how this regulatory 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column569" />Column number: 569</div>function can be performed, and I have very considerable worries that it
will either be the worst form of tokenistic tick-box
exercise&#151;has the landlord talked to the local authority?; tick,
satisfied&#151;or, if it tries to do more, it will end up imposing a
completely unreasonable and disproportionate burden by trying to assess
the degree and effectiveness of the engagement, the output and the
outcomes. Frankly, many registered social landlords have stockholdings
of perhaps only a handful of properties in any individual area, and the
idea that the regulator should measure the degree in each area to which
those bodies have engaged and produced the outcomes required will
become a nightmare of bureaucracy.</div>
					<a name="08012543000494"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
serious issue to consider and I take comfort from my hon.
Friend&#146;s statement that he desires simply to promote engagement.
That is exactly what Cave said, but I remind him that the Cave review
very emphatically
said:</div>
					<a name="08012543000641"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
not, in the review&#146;s view, the role of the regulator to regulate
the place-shaping activities in which local authorities engage with
both housing proprietors and many other
organisations.&#148;</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000805"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I am conscious of my right hon. Friend&#146;s
concerns. I will say two things, one of which I have mentioned already;
the other is in response to his point about Cave. First, I reiterate
that the regulator would, I imagine, look at any sort of contribution
towards economic, social and environmental well-being that would be
proportionate to the registered provider&#146;s holdings in a
particular area, and would have to take a view on it. He rightly says
that a handful of properties could be involved.</div>
					<a name="08012543000496"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
Cave proposed a statutory duty to co-operate with local authorities in
terms of a place-shaping role. I suggest that that is the best possible
route to go down without imposing too many onerous duties on the
registered providers. Does he agree?</div>
					<a name="08012543000497"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000806"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> I take comfort in that, because it seems to
strike the right balance between seeking to encourage the range of
housing providers to engage with local authorities in the place-shaping
function and ensuring that they do so. However, as I said, the Bill
currently puts that priority on an equal basis with other objectives.
It does not say that it is simply encouraging engagement, but, rather,
that it is one of the objectives, particularly as it is listed in
clause 173 as one of the standards that the regulator may set out.
Therefore, we are in serious danger of producing something either
tokenistic or excessively burdensome. We must be careful about that,
but I take comfort in the fact that my hon. Friend is keen to avoid
excessively burdensome regulation. I hope that between now and the
completion of our discussions, we can find a way to achieve that
objective. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

					<a name="08012543000500"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of the amendment is
to enable the regulator to pursue the objectives in clause 86 in
relation to landlords and their tenants in all cases in which the
tenants receive public
funds.</div>
					<a name="08012543000501"></a><div class="hs_Para">In essence, we
are trying to test the principle that if public funds are involved in
paying a landlord, the landlord carries with that money a
responsibility to honour the tenets of the clause. They buy into a
responsibility that connects them with the standards we would expect in
the public sector. It seems reasonable to us that tenants should expect
the same benefits of protection and regulation from a private landlord
as they would from social housing in public hands. If landlords do not
like that, they do not have to take tenants who are in receipt of
benefits, but I expect that most landlords would be fair enough and
would go along with
it.</div>
					<a name="08012543000502"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is the
Minister&#146;s perspective on the intention in the amendment to
ensure that when public funds are being paid to private landlords they
have a duty to fulfil the same regulations as if they were in the
public

Wright:
						</b> I am keen to criticise the hon. Gentleman on the
grounds of vague and ambiguous. I am not entirely certain what he means
by &#147;in receipt of public funds&#148;. I assume that it is
meant to cover all tenants in respect of housing benefits, though, as
drafted, I think that it could also include things such as child
benefit, unemployment benefit and child tax credits, which could be
massive.</div>
					<a name="08012543000504"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tenants
receiving public funds will have different landlords: registered social
landlords, local authorities, private rented sector landlords, even
some unregistered housing associations such as the Church
Commissioners. However, the Bill only provides for the regulator to
have powers over us and over any providers who register
voluntarily.</div>

							<a name="08012543000809"></a>Sir

						</b> Is that true? In light of the debate we had
earlier, I understood the Minister to have said that organisations that
did not register would none the less come under the umbrella of the
social housing regulator because of the objectives in clause
86.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000815"></a>Sir
George Young:
						</b> The Minister was clear. He said that the
characteristics of the operation defined whether it came within the
embrace of the social housing regulator. He has now said that it is not
the characteristics, but whether the organisation voluntarily registers
that is important. If so, that would have allayed some of the concerns
that I expressed in our earlier debate.</div>
					<a name="08012543000512"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012543000816"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I understand the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point about characteristics, but a strategic decision by an
organisation to provide social housing would tend to require a degree
of subsidy. It would be entirely for that philanthropic organisation to
make the strategic decision as to whether it wished to be
regulated&#151;I hope that I am clarifying the point, although I
suspect from the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s face that I am not. I
can check what I have said and confirm it, but that is certainly my
clear intention as regards what the regulator will do.</div>
					<a name="08012543000513"></a><div class="hs_Para">Extending the
regulator&#146;s powers to cover various things, where that was
dependent on whether the tenant received public funds, would require a
significant set of amendments to the regulator&#146;s other powers.
It would not be enough merely to give the regulator objectives in
relation to the relevant landlords, because it could exercise its
powers only in relation to registered providers.</div>
					<a name="08012543000514"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, without amending the
regulator&#146;s other powers to allow them to be exercised in
relation to unregistered providers, there is a danger that the
amendment could backfire and further limit the regulator&#146;s
ability to regulate registered providers, with the result that the
regulator could act in relation to such providers only where they
accommodated tenants in receipt of public funds.</div>
					<a name="08012543000515"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if a way were found for
the regulator to regulate the landlords of all tenants in receipt of
benefits, the result is likely to be a very unlevel playing field.
Private and local authority landlords would have to operate under two
systems: one for tenants who were on benefits and another for those who
were not. I understand the point that would naturally be raised that we
do not have cross-domain regulation at the moment, but it would be a
permanent feature of the system.</div>
					<a name="08012543000516"></a><div class="hs_Para">The degree of regulation would
change over time&#151;for example, if a tenant started or ceased to
claim benefits. We have spent a lot of time discussing security of
tenure, and the amendment could open up a can of worms in that respect.
If the intention is to extend the regulator&#146;s powers to all
landlords with tenants who are in receipt of housing benefit, that
could act as a major deterrent to private sector landlords to let to
tenants on benefits&#151;we discussed something similar in relation
to an earlier provision. That would further increase the pressure on
social landlords&#146; limited stock, and I do not believe that is
what the right hon. Gentleman wants.</div>

						</b> This relates to the bit of the amendment that I
tabled earlier, which was not addressed, and which might have got moved
later, but which is not going to get moved later. What I am really
saying is will the Minister seriously consider how we will provide 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column572" />Column number: 572</div>tenants in the private sector who are paid for from the public purse
with the safeguards that will be afforded to tenants in the social
rented sector in one way or the other? I obviously have huge sympathy
with what the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire is attempting to do,
because that is what I attempted to do in amendment No. 2. I am looking
for some comfort and some reassurance that consideration will be given

detail the review&#146;s terms of reference and what we hoped to
achieve through it. I hope that that provides some comfort, because my
hon. Friend raises an important point, which is that tenants from all
sectors should have the best possible service.</div>

drafting of the amendment; it probably would have unintended
consequences. I understand his concern about the problem of squeezing
the private sector, providing a disincentive for it to take in people
on benefits, and his concern that there could be a negative effect on
housing stock. On this occasion, therefore, I am willing to accept his
proposal and to consider the matter further. Nevertheless, I hope that
hon. Members recognise that the last thing that we want is a two-tier
system, with unregulated and low-quality housing stock in the private

clause enables the regulator to direct the Homes and Communities Agency
not to give financial assistance under clause 22 to a registered
provider. The amendment will qualify that for financial assistance in
respect of a repayment to registered providers of the discount that
they are obliged to provide when they sell a property to a tenant who
is exercising the right to acquire, or which they choose to sell to a
tenant who had the right to acquire in respect of a different property.
The right to acquire applies to almost all social housing owned by
registered providers for which grant has been paid after
1997.</div>

amendment, the registered provider would be obliged to sell at a
discount without being reimbursed where one of the specified events in
clause 22 has occurred. Reimbursement has been a principle of the right
to acquire since it was introduced in the Housing Act 1996 and that has
been the clear understanding of grant recipients when applying for and
receiving social housing and other grants. At present clause 22 gives
the agency simply the power to make such grants. We will be tabling an
amendment to part 1 to impose a duty on the agency to repay the
discounts on such disposals, just as there is a duty on the Housing
Corporation to pay such grants under sections 20 and 21 of the 1996
Act. This is an important, yet technical, amendment, which clarifies
matters regarding financial assistance and I hope that hon. Members

							<a name="08012543000824"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Amendments Nos. 180 and 181 limit the
regulator&#146;s data collection power. Clause 104 permits the
regulator to collect information relating to registered providers or
other persons. The hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire will be
pleased to hear that that power is modelled on an existing one that is
available to the Housing Corporation under section 30 of the Housing
Act 1996.</div>
					<a name="08012543000550"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 180 limits the regulator&#146;s ability to require a person to
provide information or documents which it reasonably believes is in the
person&#146;s possession. Amendment No. 181 limits the
regulator&#146;s ability to require information or documents from
persons other than the registered provider to which the information or
documents relates. The regulator will only be able to ask for
information from such other persons if the relevant registered provider
has not provided the documents or information, or if the regulator
believes that the document or information cannot be provided by the
registered
provider.</div>
					<a name="08012543000551"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
consequences of failing to comply with the regulator&#146;s
requirement to provide information under the clause include criminal
prosecution and the exercise of one of the regulator&#146;s
enforcement powers, such as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column575" />Column number: 575</div>an enforcement notice or monetary penalty, it is important that those
powers should be no wider than is strictly necessary. As currently
drafted, the regulator&#146;s powers would be wider than those of the
Housing Corporation, which we do not believe is necessary. The effect
of amendments Nos. 180 and 181 is to prevent so-called fishing
expeditions among registered providers for information or documents
relating to that provider, and protect persons other than that provider
from having requests made of them, unless the provider does not have
the document or information, or has been required to provide it and has
failed to do so. The amendments impose on the regulator statutory
limitations that were imposed on the Housing Corporation&#146;s
information collection
powers.</div>
					<a name="08012543000552"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 182 will omit subsection (2), so that the regulator will be able to
ask for the same type of information from profit-making registered
providers as from non-profit providers. It will not be limited to
information relating only to the social housing affairs or activities
of a profit-making provider. That extension to the regulator&#146;s
powers is needed because we now propose that the regulator should be
able to set standards for governance and financial viability for
profit-making registered providers, and to exercise the moratorium
powers in the case of insolvency. The regulator will, therefore, need
the power to require the provision of a wider range of information from
profit-making providers than was previously contemplated in order to
exercise, and as a consequence of exercising, these
powers.</div>
					<a name="08012543000553"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
105 is supplemental to clause 104. It has two main effects: to specify
how clause 104 is limited in regard to legal professional privilege and
bankers&#146; duty of confidentiality, and to specify penalties for
those guilty of an offence under clause 104. As presently drafted,
clause 105 could not require a banker to breach a duty of
confidentiality owed to a person who is not a registered provider, or a
subsidiary or associate of a registered provider. However, it could
require the banker to breach its duty of confidentiality owed to
registered provider A, for example, if the regulator were seeking
information about registered provider B, even though registered
provider A was not an associate or subsidiary of registered provider B.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders expressed concerns about that
possibility. Amendments Nos. 183 to 186 respond to their
concerns.</div>
					<a name="08012543000554"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments qualify clause 105 and ensure that, if the regulator
requires a banker to provide a document or information of a banker
under clause 104, the banker can only be required to breach a duty of
confidentiality owed to the registered provider to whom the requested
document or information relates, or to a subsidiary or an associate of
that provider, but to no other person. The effect of the amendments is
to protect the confidentiality of other registered providers, their
subsidiaries and associates&#151;apart from the registered provider
to which the requested document or information relates, and the
provider&#146;s subsidiaries and
associates.</div>
					<a name="08012543000555"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments thus protect registered providers and other persons from
unnecessary requests, and require the regulator to request documents
and information from the relevant registered provider
first&#151;unless the regulator thinks that the provider does not
have it&#151;before asking anyone else. They also 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column576" />Column number: 576</div>protect duties of confidentiality owed to people other than those to
whom the request for information
relates.</div>

187 relates to the offences that carry over from the Housing Act 1996
of failing to comply with the requirement for information or documents,
under clause 104, or of altering, suppressing or destroying a document
to which a requirement relates. The amendments will ensure that such
proceedings may be brought only with the consent of the regulator or
the Director of Public Prosecutions. Those provisions are necessary to
prevent fraud or other misconduct from thwarting the regulator&#146;s
reasonable requirements for
information.</div>
					<a name="08012543000557"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment ensures that, if an exceptional prosecution must be brought
under clause 104, it is brought with the consent of those with an
interest in the case and not anyone else with powers to prosecute. It
will ensure proper consideration of the matter by someone with specific
sector knowledge, such as the regulator, or with the authority and duty
to consider the public interest, such as the DPP, before a prosecution
can take place. It provides a further limitation on a power to
prosecute, which it is hoped will not need to be used, but which is an
important backstop to ensure that the regulator can obtain the
information that it needs to do its job. I hope that hon. Members will
except the
amendments.</div>

					<a name="08012543000646"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person having functions of a
public nature (whether or not in the United
Kingdom).&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012543000572"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2) allows the regulator to disclose information to a public authority
for a purpose connected with its own functions or those of the public
authority. That is not a new power. The Housing Corporation has the
power to disclose information under section 33 of the 1996 Act. For
example, the regulator might need to share information with the Homes
and Communities Agency, if the regulator discovers that the provider
has not been using the HCA grant in the way intended, or has concerns
about its long-term financial viability such that HCA investment could
be jeopardised.</div>
					<a name="08012543000573"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulator might need to pass on information to the police, if it
becomes aware of, for example, fraud committed against the provider by
an employee. Furthermore, it might need to disclose information to
other regulators, such as the Charity Commission, where the registered
provider is also a registered charity. Sharing such information with
other regulators might help to reduce the administrative burden imposed
on providers that are regulated by more than one body, and to avoid the
need for both regulators to ask the body for the same, or very similar
information.</div>
					<a name="08012543000574"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
clause 106(2) gives the regulator the power to share information with
other public bodies, it might also need to disclose information to
people other than public bodies. The regulator might want to appoint
consultants and other agents in connection with its functions, such as
specialist accountants&#151;I like the sound of that one&#151;or
auditors to carry out an extraordinary order under clause 186, or
housing consultants to assist in an inspection under clause 181. Such
persons acting on behalf of the regulator would need to be able to see
information that the regulator has in order to carry out the tasks
entrusted to them by the regulator. Amendment No. 188 will allow that
to happen.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column578" />Column number: 578</div>
					<a name="08012543000575"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise that information
sharing by public bodies, such as the regulator, is a sensitive issue.
Clause 106(3) allows either the regulator or another public authority
when disclosing information to impose requirements preventing further
disclosure. The subsequent disclosure of information in contravention
of such a restriction is an offence. At present, clause 106(5) provides
that the maximum penalty on conviction is a fine not exceeding level 3
on the standard scale, which is &#163;1,000. That is the same as the
penalty provided for in section 33(5) of the Housing Act
1996.</div>
					<a name="08012543000576"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
189 means that the regulator will not be able to disclose information
if doing so would breach a statutory prohibition on disclosure imposed
in other legislation. Similarly, it would prevent other public
authorities from disclosing information to the regulator if doing so
would breach a statutory prohibition.</div>
					<a name="08012543000577"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other legislation may state
that disclosure of such information is prohibited except where allowed
by other enactments. The words in brackets in amendment No. 189 mean
that the regulator or public authorities could disclose information
under clause 106 if other legislation states that disclosure is
possible if allowed or required by another enactment. Clause 106 would
be such another enactment, permitting disclosure in such a case. The
intention is to clarify the powers of the regulator and public
authorities while maintaining appropriate
limits.</div>
					<a name="08012543000578"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
will allow a sensible onward disclosure when it is necessary for the
regulator to carry out his functions, but enable the regulator to put
further restrictions on subsequent disclosure. They will enable
flexibility of arrangements while preserving the confidentiality of
information that has been provided. I hope that that clarifies the
matter.</div>
