[Continuation from col. 860]
<P>
<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> It is a pleasure to be back here on this sunny morning; everyone is reinvigorated after their morning ablutions and some breakfast. I particularly welcome the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart), who is no doubt well refreshed and rested. I am only sorry that she has not brought her Minister with her; we missed him earlier, particularly in the debate on the code of practice. Perhaps he has been sent to fulfil a speaking engagement in Liverpool to keep him out of trouble in the Committee.
<P>
Before the break, we were discussing how duress is applied in the Bill&#151;as opposed to its more usual form in criminal law. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere took us, at some length, through the issue of duress and the difference between its interpretation in criminal law and in the Bill. I was particularly interested in my hon. Friend's views on the fact that, while in criminal law the burden of proof naturally rests with the prosecution, under the clause, it rests with the carrier. My hon. Friend asked me how I thought the Road Haulage Association and hauliers in general would react to that aspect of the Bill. As a layman who probably does not understand the complexities of the law as he does, I can only say that were I in their shoes I would consider it contrary to my understanding of natural justice.
<P>
My hon. Friend mentioned, as I had intended to do, the views of the Immigration Law Practitioners Association, which has given us helpful advice throughout the passage of the Bill. In its notes on the Bill, it described the fact that the onus is on the carrier to prove innocence as objectionable and stated, as my hon. Friend has said, its belief that the Crown should have to prove the negative as well as the positive aspects of any alleged crime committed by the haulier.
<P>
On duress, my hon. Friend mentioned some of the types of pressure&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I wish to correct an earlier omission: I did not do full justice to the Immigration Law Practitioners Association, because the concern that my hon. Friend has just detailed was only one of a list of concerns that it had about the fairness and compatibility of the system in terms of the European convention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> That is right. Throughout the night we have referred to the human rights aspects of the Bill as well as discussing how the various amendments would affect hauliers. I will not drift too far into the area of human rights now, other than to say that the onus placed on the carrier to prove innocence is contrary to natural justice and may be in breach of human rights. In regard to the code of practice, I highlighted some of the physical threats and duress to which drivers may be subjected. The RHA is concerned about the physical dangers to drivers who may, unwittingly, find clandestine entrants in the back of their lorries. Drivers may only be picking up a trailer that has been left for them overnight and open it to find a number of clandestine entrants inside. They will be frightened, worried and, possibly, armed and ready to do violence. Similarly, someone at the final destination of the load could innocently open up a truck to find illegal immigrants inside.
<P>
The Road Haulage Association helpfully highlighted the regrettable increase in organised crime and the Under-Secretary dwelt at some length on that issue last night. We all deprecated the illegal trafficking and the violence that many professional drivers are now being subjected to. To be targeted by a gang or an illegal trader in this vile trade is the ultimate form of duress for a driver. We are all concerned that, even in those instances, it is incumbent of the haulier to prove his or her innocence. It is not incumbent on the official from the immigration service, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, to prove guilt, as happens in a court of law.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere rightly flagged up the contributions of the ILPA. The defence that one was acting under duress might encourage some carriers to make unfounded allegations against passengers. That is looking at the problem from the opposite point of view. Asylum seekers might be accused falsely of putting an unscrupulous haulier under duress. An unscrupulous haulier who is caught with illegal immigrants might resourt to that defence. It would be his word against that of the clandestine immigrant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend touches on an important point, which needs to be considered a little further. Will he put himself in the position of a would-be refugee or clandestine entrant and imagine how he would feel having to defend himself against such charges, with the police and all the prosecuting authorities arraigned against him in a strange country?
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> That is germane to our debate and takes us back almost to where we began many hours ago when the hon. Member for Hallam expressed concern about the problems facing children and extended families who make their way across Europe in the back of a trailer or container. They will be extremely frightened and worried when the trailer is opened up at the other end. What if the haulier suddenly realises that he will be subject to a &#163;2,000 fine&#151;or more than that, because as the Minister said, each child will cost the haulier &#163;2,000?
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere invites me to put myself in the position of an asylum seeker. I agree that asylum seekers would be very frightened and could be faced with being bundled immediately into a police station and accused or putting the lorry driver under duress. That would be the only way for him to make a proper defence against the accusation that he brought in illegal immigrants. I unashamedly go back to the human rights aspects of the Bill that we discussed many hours ago, and the points raised by me and the hon. Member for Hallam about the problems that children might face. That is very worrying.
<P>
You advised my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere earlier, Mr. Maxton, that to stray into subsection (2)(b) and (c) would be out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I apologise to the Committee for using too many legal terms. I invite my hon. Friend to think of what he, as a layman, would regard as being a serious threat to a lorry driver in those circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I assume that there is a threat of duress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Perhaps I did not explain what I meant sufficiently. Does my hon. Friend think that the provision should include only threats of serious injury or death, as under criminal law; or should other matters&#151;such as damage to property, which we heard about earlier&#151;be included as they have a strong influence on most lorry drivers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I was interested in my hon. Friend's earlier contribution on that point. Until then I did not know the definition of duress as it exists in criminal law, nor that it was so tightly defined. Clearly, an unscrupulous person could put a haulier under duress in many other ways.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> The people who organise such vile trafficking are sophisticated operators and give detailed instructions to the refugees whom they hope to bring into the country. Presumably, they can read the Bill as well as anyone else, so it will be only natural for them to realise that the duress loophole will exist. They will advise refugees that the use of duress is the only way that they are likely to escape if they are discovered. They will encourage refugees to threaten drivers and put them under duress. They might tell refugees to carry a bottle of methylated spirit with a rag in the top, threaten to light it and throw it into the cab. By creating this loophole, the Government are encouraging refugees to threaten drivers.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman has a remarkable capacity to sit down just before I stand up to speak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Thank you, Mr. Maxton. I had noticed that you were about to call my hon. Friend to order. However, he puts his finger on the point.
<P>
It is disturbing that, while we sit here in comparative comfort after the Committee's hour-long break, and although it might seem far-fetched, the truth is that asylum seekers and unscrupulous hauliers might resort to some of the activities that my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East rightly mentions. As we have heard throughout the night, those people simply do not live in the same world as we do; they do not play by the same rules. They are unscrupulous, positively evil people who take advantage to make money, but they are undoubtedly sophisticated.
<P>
The Minister has told us that the National Criminal Intelligence Service and the Secret Intelligence Service may be used to combat such threats, as they do with drug traffickers and mafia bosses. It is entirely appropriate to consider such matters carefully. We should consider the type of threat that unscrupulous traffickers might pose.
<P>
However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere rightly reminded me, we must look at the other side of the coin: we must look at such matters from the point of view of the haulier who might be threatened by refugees. As my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East rightly said, unscrupulous traffickers might have coached those refugees and perhaps told them to threaten to burn the trucks. There are many ways in which unscrupulous traffickers might suggest that refugees should threaten drivers.
<P>
In its evidence, the Road Haulage Association has told us that unwitting, innocent, wholly law-abiding and respectable hauliers might open the backs of their trucks to find, unknown to them, illegal immigrants waiting to climb out. Those illegal immigrants might be armed. They might have been told by an unscrupulous trafficker that to make such a threat is the best way to solve the whole problem, to assure that they will be accepted in the country and to ensure that no great legal damage will come to the haulier.
<P>
I want to make some progress. I know that you are keen that we should steer clear of paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (3) in discussion of the amendments, Mr. Maxton.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> It is actually subsection (3)(c) that should be steered clear of as it is covered by amendment No. 190.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Of course, amendment No. 472 refers tangentially to subsection (3)(c) in that it links paragraphs (b) and (c) by inserting ``or'' for ``and''. As you rightly say, Mr. Maxton, I shall keep my remarks on paragraph (c) for when we debate amendment No. 190.
<P>
The amendments have flagged up some important issues. As the debate has gone on, it has been noticeable that those of us who, perhaps wrongly, were not as well informed on the amendment and the clause as we should have been&#151;perhaps due to a lack of legal background in such cases&#151;have been shocked, as was my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border, by the type of power that the Home Secretary has taken on himself, and by the way in which the clause seems to offend natural justice.
<P>
We have highlighted that there is a problem for innocent, wholly respectable hauliers. As we heard much earlier from the hon. Member for Harwich, there is a potential problem for asylum seekers who may genuinely have arrived in a trailer the whole way from eastern Europe, unable to get out because the seals were not broken, or unable to get out of the type of truck that has been referred to several times, the name of which I now cannot remember.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall finish my remarks with some evidence from Mr. Norris of the Road Haulage Association on the issue during an oral evidence sitting of the Committee. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The problem with that provision is, as my colleague suggested, that once an illegal immigrant is detected, it would appear axiomatic that the driver has failed to observe one of those three principles. It offers, therefore, no reasonable defence.''&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 18 March 1999; c. 413.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, that is a considerable worry to the hauliers, but also a worry from the point of view of possible human rights infringements of genuine asylum-seeking refugees.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> I rise to reinforce what my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury said about the prospects of violence, assault and duress. The provisions are a recipe for violence, and I am glad to make my remarks now that the hon. Member for Edgbaston has returned, as she informed me during an earlier break that she would be disappointed if I did not refer again to the Vietnamese boat people. The analogy is a good one and illustrates the desperation mixed with ruthlessness with which some carriers will react if they realise that by taking a humanitarian step, they will expose themselves, their companies and perhaps their employers to unbearable financial constraints and sanctions.
<P>
I feel sure that the imposition of the proposals, if they are put through undiluted, will result in the interests of the carriers being served by saying that they were threatened with violence, and the interests of those carried being served by threatening violence. Some unscrupulous people may be tempted to violence, and the result will be that people will be hurt and may be killed. At the end of it all, people will not be deterred. On the contrary, the highly efficient, lucrative, skilful and rehearsed organisation behind this deplorable traffic will try to factor the Bill's loopholes into its programme for people whom it tries to introduce illegally into the country. The result will be repression and violence and, possibly, fatalities. It will not be a future cause of pride to the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> It is unfair of the Opposition to deploy their ultimate deterrent at this advanced stage of our proceedings because although you and I, Mr. Maxton, will have listened to a great number of very tedious speeches in this place, I doubt whether anyone has ever plumbed so deeply the depths of dullness achieved by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. The devastation that he caused in the Committee was palpable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Yes, if I can stand the excitement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I give the Minister a warning of what I shall say if he continues in that vein. I will tell the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, who has just returned, exactly how many amendments the Minister accepted in his absence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> During the break I had difficulty recalling anything that the hon. Member for Hertsmere had said during his oration. I remember that he distinctly asked for examples of duress. I am minded to invite Home Office officials to record that if a carrier complained that he had been forced to listen to the hon. Gentleman for 50 minutes, that would be prima facie evidence of duress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I avoided the temptation of raising a point of order to say that while some of the Minister's hon. Friends had a few winks during the night, between about 26 minutes and 28 minutes past seven, the Minister himself was, shall we say, refreshing his eyes by letting them glaze over, and letting his chin fall on to his chest. It was obvious that he was contemplating my hon. Friend's speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I was clearly considering the philosophical implications of the hon. Gentleman's contribution.
<P>
I will deal in general terms with the arguments advanced about duress. The Government have produced a defence tailored to the circumstances of the particular civil penalty. We do not disageee with the hon. Member for Hertsmere that the concept of duress in the clause concerns the types of duress that count as duress for the purposes of criminal law. Everything depends on the circumstances, and it would not be particularly helpful for us to redefine the concept, which is well explained in advanced criminal law textbooks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> No. Even if we had not incorporated the specific reference to duress, as one of the general defences available, it would have been available to those who sought to contest a civil penalty, simply by the operation of the common law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> No textbook in any area of law that I ever read was particularly advanced.
<P>
The Minister of State made an important remark when he said that the defence was tailored to the civil law. Can he, with his superior knowledge of the civil law, give us examples of duress operating as a defence in that law?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> That would probably be to risk straying out of order. I could, but I think that what I actually said was that the defence here was tailored to the circumstances of the civil penalty. But I should not be drawn further along that road.
<P>
I turn now to the amendments. In drawing up the provisions for the civil penalty, the Government consulted the transport industry. We took note of its concerns that lorry drivers and others might be subject to duress by traffickers and would-be illegal entrants. Subsection (2) provides a defence against a civil penalty where the carrier shows that he or a relevant employee was acting under duress.
<P>
Amendment No. 189 would reverse the burden of proof so that it would have to be shown beyond reasonable doubt that a carrier or employee was not acting under duress. Its effect would therefore be greatly to weaken the civil penalty. The Government believe that the onus should be on the carrier to show that duress occurred according to the civil standard of proof. Without this requirement, anyone who may be liable for the civil penalty would be likely to claim duress and, given the difficulties for the immigration service in proving beyond reasonable doubt that the carrier or employee had not been acting under duress, the effectiveness of the civil penalty would be largely undermined. We appreciate that lorry drivers, especially, operate in isolated and difficult circumstances, and that when incidents of duress occur they may be difficult to prove. But commonsense measures such as providing evidence of an incident having been reported to local police may well be acceptable. It is right that the burden of proof be on the carrier, because only a driver or a captain will know the circumstances and be able to outline them for the court if necessary. The effect of the amendment would be greatly to undermine the civil penalty. I urge the Committee to reject it.
<P>
The effect of deleting the word ``and'' at the end of subsection (3)(b) and replacing it with the word ``or'', as amendment No. 472 would do, would be to make nonsense of the defence there. In subsection (3)(c), the requirement for a system of prevention to have been operated properly on the occasion in question makes no sense except in relation to subsection (3)(b)&#151;the requirement for an effective system to be in operation. Making them alternatives makes no sense whatever and it would destroy the effectiveness of the fixed penalty. I therefore urge the Committee to reject that amendment, too.
<P>
As for amendment No. 473, clause 20 provides two defences against the imposition of a civil penalty, the first on absolute defence which applies where it can be shown that those involved acted under duress and would cover any situation in which there was, for example, a threat of violence. The alternative defence, under subsection (3), is based on a lack of knowledge or suspicion of a clandestine entrant, coupled with the maintenance of an effective system for preventing carriage of clandestines on the occasion in question. The amendments would add to the defence under subsection (3) a further layer of defence where it could be shown that the health or safety of those involved would have been put at risk if they had taken an alternative course of action.
<P>
I appreciate that it may be felt that certain circumstances other than duress that could jeopardise the health or safety of, say, a lorry driver&#151;for example, it may be thought that checking a vehicle's load on the edge of a busy road at night would be too dangerous&#151;should be taken into account in the code of practice and in the operation of the civil penalty and the defence under subsection (3). I certainly wish to ensure that as far as possible the defence under subsection (3) can take account of those factors. Equally, however, I would not wish to see that defence become so open as to invalidate the deterrent effect of the civil penalty.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> There go those words again. They have been writ large over our proceedings the whole morning. The Minister has taken a leaf from the book of the Under-Secretary, and begun to talk about deterrent value. I have almost&#151;but not quite&#151;given up on the Under-Secretary, but I am far from giving up on the Minister of State. I shall try to persuade him, because I know that he is a fair man who understands the importance of having fair provisions as well as deterrents, and that if we go too far down the road of deterrence we shall find that the provisions are counter-productive.
<P>
The debate on the defences has been valuable and interesting. It will greatly interest people in the road haulage industry, who will want to know that satisfactory defences are available for them. I listened carefully to the Minister, and I know that he tried to respond on each issue. But I still believe that he has not taken sufficient account of the feelings of those in the road traffic industry, and of how they will judge what has been said in Committee.
<P>
As a starting point in determining the burden of proof, and whether the penalty is a civil or a criminal one, I remind those who listened to an earlier debate of my reference to the submission by Justice. That organisation said that although the provision was dressed up and labelled a civil penalty, it was effectively a criminal penalty so the criminal law burden of proof should be required. I will come back to that later, because I want to talk about the defence of duress now.
<P>
The Minister of State earlier made an important point&#151;as I said at the time&#151;which was that the defence of duress was especially tailored to the circumstances of the alleged penalty, and was not being taken straight from the criminal law. If we are to assess where the burden of proof lies, we should be told a little about the nature of the defence. Earlier, I confined my remarks to the meaning of duress in the criminal law. As the Committee knows, that involves serious threats of death or bodily injury. If the penalty imposed is to be a civil one, we must consider the circumstances that might arise and what would be a fair way of assessing where the burden of proof should lie.
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to the weight of evidence that we have had about the desperate circumstances that some clandestine entrants face and to the nature of the criminal activity that takes place in the background. Such activity leads some people to seek entry to the United Kingdom. Ministers are aware of the problem and of the need to take tough measures. However, we want to ensure that British and overseas lorry drivers are not caught in the middle.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is clear evidence that desperate things are taking place and have been for some months. We have received reports of gang fights at Calais and of thousands of pounds changing hands. I have seen press reports that suggest that some overseas police forces&#151;I shall not name them&#151;are not doing their bit to stop trafficking. I hope that that is not true; it probably is not. It has become clear that British lorry drivers often take the initiative and bring such activities to light. Therefore, we need to think of their welfare given that they often find themselves in the middle of the problem.
<P>
Should the word ``duress'' extend to just death or serious injury? We have heard one or two excellent suggestions from my hon. Friends about including physical damage to the lorry within the meaning of the term. The Secretary of State should consider that because he is responsible for making the law. He is the judge, jury and prosecutor and he can decide the law. Through the Minister who is to reply to the debate, I ask the Secretary of State to consider a broader interpretation of the word ``duress''. If a lorry driver is threatened with having his load or lorry destroyed or having his livelihood or business brought to an end, that would be a serious consideration for him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> My hon. Friend has dealt at some length with the difference between civil and criminal law. As I only began to understand the nuances as a result of his earlier excellent speech, is it not likely that members of the public or hauliers will find it hard to understand the fine distinctions that will be drawn between civil and criminal law? They may feel that they have been at the wrong end of unnatural justice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I am afraid that lawyers are in danger of running away with the problem and expressing it in a legalese that people do not understand. We need a provision that is readily understood by lorry drivers, by members of the public and by everyone involved in the industry. They will understand what we mean when we say that threats of damage to property, as well as threats of serious injury and death, constitute duress.
<P>
I shall risk upsetting the legal purists among us. However, the hon. Member for Wyre Forest is no longer here, so I am no longer at risk of a devastating intervention from him. Even so, I may be treading on dangerous ground. I did not mention the matter before because I was not aware that the Minister would take this welcome and flexible view of the nature of duress. What about considering the defence of necessity, which differs from duress in that it is generally conceived of not as a concession to human frailty, which is how I describe duress, or as an excuse, but as a justified choice between two evils? The evil represented by committing the offence is outweighed by the greater evil that would ensue if the offence were not to be committed. We often lose sight of that difference because cases in which necessity is raised also tend to be cases in which there is an arguable case for excusing the accused.
<P>
I have taken the Committee through necessity; I hope, Mr. Maxton, that you will permit me the small indulgence of quoting a case that goes to heart of the burden of proof in the amendment. The case, which involved cannibalism, was heard in Dudley in 1884. The two accused had been adrift in a small boat on the high seas with another man and a cabin boy. They had virtually no food or water for 20 days and were reduced to drinking their own urine. Finally, they killed and ate the cabin boy who was anyway likely to have been the first to die. Without committing that deed they would probably not have survived the further four days that elapsed before they were rescued. The case was the result of extreme circumstances.
<P>
I remind the Minister that we are talking about extreme circumstances and we therefore want an enlarged version of duress. Would not it be possible to change the burden of proof? I have heard no good reason why the burden of proof should rest on the accused. It is an elementary principle of fairness that it should rest with the Secretary of State. I do not understand what the Government have to lose. It would not affect the deterrent value one whit; the technical details of the defence of duress may have riveted the Committee but they will not be uppermost in the mind of someone who is alleged to have committed such an offence.
<P>
The industry is anxious that the Minister should take note of its concerns about health and safety, which are paramount. It would earn the Minister recognition of his flexibility and wide acclaim if the Bill were to state that health and safety should be paramount, as, I think, amendment No. 473 provides. I shall give the Minister an opportunity to respond if he wishes to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman and other Members of the Committee that the Government will carefully consider all observations and if necessary table further amendments on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is trying hard to accommodate my views and I shall go half-way. In order to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 190, in page 14, line 38, leave out from `transporter;' to end of line 40.
<P>
The amendment is straightforward but important. It would delete subsection (3)(c), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that on the occasion in question the person or persons responsible for operating that system did so properly.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>This is another attempt to bring a little more natural justice to a ghastly clause. I was disappointed at the Minister's reply to the last debate, considering that he made so many concessions during the night and accepted so many amendments. I thought that in the same spirit he would accept the amendment on health and safety which, in his bland and non-committal way, he apparently dismissed. The Minister was generous enough during the night to accept that I would be raising the code of practice later; I was therefore disappointed at his reply. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State, refreshed and invigorated by getting some sleep, will be more willing to accept the amendment and to share the enlightened approach of his hon. Friend the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department.
<P>
We are concerned about every aspect of the clause; the previous amendments sought to impose more balance and fairness upon it. The amendment would give the carrier a better chance to prove a defence, not in a court of law but to the immigration official who will charge him with the offence. In the Bill as drafted, the carrier has little opportunity to defend himself. The amendment was suggested by the Road Haulage Association or the Freight Transport Association; it will be impossible for the drivers to benefit from the defences in subsection (3)(c) because, as those organisations point out, most drivers are sole occupants of the cab. There are no witnesses; they do not travel with a driver's mate so there is no evidence from a third party to back up their claim that they properly operated an effective system on the occasion in question. Unless there is an independent witness, the fact that illegal immigrants have been found on the vehicle will automatically be taken as conclusive proof that the driver has not operated the system properly.
<P>
Without going into the procedures in clause 21, the Minister must say how he expects the defences to work in practice. His hon. Friend did not respond to my assertion that, although we discussed the Secretary of State and talked as if the process was to be a court-type procedure, the prosecutor, judge and jury in these cases will be officials from the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. I do not criticise those officials, who do a tremendous job in difficult circumstances and deal with difficult and dangerous people. It will add to their burden if the amendment is not accepted.
<P>
In opposition, the Minister would not have agreed to the criminal justice legislation introduced by the previous Conservative Government giving police officers the sort of powers that he will be giving to immigration officers. They will be prosecutor, judge and jury and impose civil penalties on the people they stop, saying, ``Aha, you must be committing a crime because we have found someone on your lorry and you cannot prove that you did not operate the system correctly.'' If the police had such powers, every civil libertarian in the country would be outraged and so would Labour Members. Yet that is what the clause proposes because of the inadequacy of subsection (3)(c). How can the driver make use of that defence? The defence is worthless and I want the Minister to explain why it is in the Bill.
<P>
I shall finish what I have to say now to allow my hon. Friends to contribute to the debate. If I may, I shall respond to the Minister's reply later.

<P>

<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> I want to revert to my original argument in our debate on clause 18(5)(b), in which the liability was interchangeable between owner, hirer and driver. As I said earlier, there is the possibility of the owner hiring a vehicle out to a driver who might, for example, be a foreign national. If there was an incident and refugees were found to be illegally in the vehicle, the driver would be unlikely to be placed under arrest. The driver, who might be the person who hired the vehicle from the owner, or that person's employee, might then return to his home country. That would make it uneconomic for the state or the vehicle's owner to pursue him in the court for reimbursement of any penalty imposed.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If that defence can be applied by anyone, it will have to be applied by the owner of the vehicle, but how can the owner of the vehicle give the evidence necessary under paragraph (c)? He may well be able to argue that he did not know, and had no reasonable grounds for suspecting, that a clandestine entrant was concealed in the transporter; he may also be able to establish, under paragraph (b), that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an effective system for preventing the carriage of clandestine entrants was in operation in relation to the transporter''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the one thing that the owner will not be able to do in the absence of the driver, who might have gone back to a foreign country, is to establish, under paragraph (c), that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``on the occasion in question the person or persons responsible for operating that system did so properly.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, an entirely innocent owner might effectively be blackmailed. He would have to pay the money, because, even though the conditions of paragraph (c) applied, he would not be able to persuade the driver to come back from abroad and give evidence to establish that the defence was sound.
<P>
Therefore, a theoretical defence does not in reality offer an innocent owner any prospect of being able to escape the severe penalty that he will have to pay if he does not wish his vehicle to be impounded. That negates the principle of natural justice. The paragraph seems to offer a viable defence, but it does not work in the circumstances that I have described.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The importance of this part of the clause has grown as a result of Ministers' responses on other clauses.
<P>
To illustrate why it is unreasonable to include subsection (3)(c) in the Bill, I shall take the Committee through some of the problems that I foresee arising if a person wishes to avail himself of this defence. My illustration will incorporate one or two points that have already been made, but in a new context.
<P>
I shall take the Minister briefly through the position of the owner who is alleged to be a responsible person, or who may have heard that clandestine entrants have arrived in circumstances such that he may be made a responsible person. A number of permutations are possible&#151;unless the owner is the driver of the vehicle, which will be true in some cases, but not in most.
<P>
The owner may have hired the vehicle to someone else, or one of his employees may be driving it. If he has hired the vehicle out, either the hirer or the hirer's employee&#151;a driver&#151;will have been driving the vehicle when the clandestine entrants gained access. It is highly likely that that driver will be the only person who can give evidence about what took place. He may have a mate with him. although I noted from the industry's evidence that usually there is only one person in the cab. Even if there was a driver's mate, he would be an employee of the hirer as well.
<P>
Both the driver and the mate are employees of the hirer rather than the owner. They owe the owner no obligation to help him absolve himself from liability.
<P>
The same would be true if the hirer were the driver. He is clearly not an employee of the owner either, so he owes the owner no obligation to help him out of his liability, other than, I suppose, the natural instinct of good will and possibly any business relationship that may exist between them.
<P>
I return to the question that I asked earlier. Where a number of people could be the responsible person&#151;the owner, the hirer or the driver&#151;who would the Secretary of State proceed against? As I recollect the answer that I received&#151;it was given in the early hours of the morning, so we do not have the Hansard report yet, but I am sure that I shall be corrected from certain quarters if I am wrong&#151;was that the person who seemed to be the most responsible and blameworthy would be proceeded against. Therefore, the Secretary of State would not proceed automatically against all three people but against the person whom he thought was most blameworthy.
<P>
That would it create a huge disincentive for anyone else to give evidence about what took place and to accept any responsibility. If the employee driver of a hirer, or a hirer driver himself, stepped forward and said ``I know what took place and I can say that I took all the necessary precautions'', he would surely put himself in the frame, if he had not already been fixed on as a responsible person. He would then be in danger of having to pay the &#163;2,000 fine multiplied by however many additional clandestine entrants there were. A person would have to have a substantial business relationship to want to step forward and take the blame for the owner in those circumstances. I suspect that in most cases the owner will end up trying to absolve himself from responsibility, because in practice it will be easiest to make him responsible.
<P>
Where the driver is the employee of the owner, the owner has a relationship with the driver and could expect him to step forward and try to help him out. Many owners are very honourable towards their employees, but the owner may not want to expose his employee to the risk of a &#163;2,000 fine and would want to do his best to help out.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> My hon. Friend is producing different combinations of circumstances that show that, if a person comes forward to get another off the hook in this dangerous relationship, he simply puts himself in the frame. Surely it is more likely in such circumstances that people will agree to concoct a story about duress. With the duress provision, if one gets off, they all get off. Therefore, the alternatives are likely to be a dead letter and a waste of time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes a fair point. That risk is always there, but, as we established earlier, there has to be a defence of duress. I have made the argument about the balance that exists and do not want to go back over that ground, but he makes an important point.
<P>
The key point is subsection (3)(c): everything depends on establishing that the person responsible for operating the system did so properly. I have already identified the difficulty of a hirer-driver or a hirer's driver coming forward and putting himself in the frame. Will the Minister deal with that when he winds up the debate? I cannot ask him quite so specifically about the case of the employee of the owner himself, but I ask him to put himself in the shoes of either the owner or the employee and to consider their feelings.
<P>
Suppose the owner has someone who will step forward to try to give evidence to get him off the hook and take advantage of subsection (3)(c). If it is an owner-driver, he will know what took place himself. How will that work in practice? We need to know before we can give our assent to this part of the Bill and not support the amendment to delete it. The person has received a notice from the Secretary of State and has the opportunity to respond to it and contest liability. How does he do that? Will he have an opportunity to give oral evidence, will it be decided entirely on the written evidence of statements? If so, what allowances will the Minister make? Some people's English will not be so good. The commonest problem at my constituency surgery is that of parents who have not put every ground in a school appeal or filled in every detail because they simply did not think of it. The events took place but it did not occur to them to give an account.
<P>
One of the complaints about the offence of duress is that it is too technical and lawyerly. How is the ordinary driver employee to know the details of the defence of duress that is available to him under subsection (2)? How will he know all the details of subsection (3)? Can we rely on him to give an account of all that in a written statement? Is there not a risk as there is in every case where one depends on a written statement that it will descend to the level of who has had the best education, who can write the best essay and express themselves best in English?
<P>
There will be no other way of testing the evidence as far as we know. Perhaps the Minister will tell us that there will be a procedure fair to both sides. The driver should be given the opportunity to make his case fully, to ask questions about it and to be helped to make it out by being asked the right questions. Conversely, the clever driver who may have given a glossed account that is not correct in the material circumstances should be interrogated to find out whether he is telling the truth.
<P>
Will it simply boil down to who says what in written statements? Will the Minister give us some idea of how the Secretary of State will approach the task of assessing them? Would this not have been difficult enough in any event if we had followed normal legal procedures, which means leaving it to the Secretary of State to prove the elements of the offence and to disprove anything that the accused said? The Minister nods knowingly. We have gleaned some valuable information so I shall continue a little longer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I am afraid that I was nodding not at the hon. Gentleman but to my official, who has just handed me a note on a slightly different matter. As I am on my feet, I remind the hon. Gentleman that it is a civil penalty. If someone disputes whether he is liable, he can refuse to pay and wait to be sued, when the usual procedures will apply.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That problem has been considered. It is an unsatisfactory way for someone to have his case heard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister's intervention was quite remarkable? How many times in our surgeries have we heard such problems about whether or not to pay? My right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border mentioned the Child Support Agency last night. The Minister has just suggested that anyone who does not wish to abide by the civil ruling&#151;we have already dealt at length with the difference between civil and legal proceedings&#151;should not pay the fine and wait to be sued. That is an astonishing suggestion.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I may be misremembering the submissions, but I read them carefully and seem to recall that if a driver took such action, his vehicle could be detained in the meantime. The Minister is nodding. He should think again about his intervention because one of the problems to consider is how this issue looks to other people both in this country and overseas. Do people think that they are getting a fair deal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am not sure of the procedure. Let us say that a clandestine immigrant is taken into custody and interviewed&#151;perhaps in a foreign language. What facility does the lorry driver have to interview the person who was on his vehicle? If one is going through the events of where one parked or stayed on a particular night, it might be helpful if the lorry driver knew when the immigrant had got into the vehicle and in what circumstances. A picture could be pieced together when making a case or an appeal to the Secretary of State. Will the lorry driver give his side of the story in isolation, without having any knowledge of the other side of the picture that the immigration officers have?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point that should have, occurred to me. Will evidence be taken from clandestine entrants? What will be the value of such statements?
<P>
I invite the Minister to consider the road haulage industry's point of view. All the way along, the industry has had the scales tilted against it. The Minister, in his intervention, is virtually saying, ``Do what you want. You always have the chance to sue&#151;or be sued&#151;at the end of the day.'' He might want to think about that a little more to see whether he can row back from that proposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I welcome the opportunity to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned the detention of vehicles. I refer him to clause 23(3)(b).
<P>
[Mr. George Stevenson in the Chair]
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister has referred me to clause 23(3)(b), but my knowledge of the Bill is not so good that I can instantly tell what that provision states. It is a very inadequate clause, if that is what he is trying to rely on.
<P>
I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Stevenson, and we are honoured to serve under you this morning. I do not want to stray into a new group of amendments, but clause 23(3)(b) is one of the most inadequate provisions, which is saying something. The hurdles are even higher and the hoops even more difficult, but I shall not be tempted down that route, Although the Minister is trying hard to make me.
<P>
What is the significance of reversing the usual burden of proof? The burden of proof will be on the responsible person rather than the person who is bringing the charge. What signal will that send? Will it be interpreted as a sign that these defences are bound to fail? The Minister knows what it is like in court. If the burden of proof is on the accused person, it is tempting for tribunals that are unhappy with that person's evidence to hide behind it and say, ``Well, the burden of proof is on him, so tough.''
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> Does my hon. Friend think that if the Government had any confidence that these tests could reasonably be passed, they would be content to accept the burden of proof on their side? They are not content to do that, which shows that they know that the peculiar circumstances in which these matters will have to be examined&#151;it will be one person's word against another's, and there will be few impartial witnesses, if any&#151;mean that they would be unable to sustain the burden of proof. The burden of proof is being put on the owners, hirers and drivers because the Government know that they will find it equally impossible to defend themselves in practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is a perfectly reasonable conclusion in the circumstances, and one that I suspect many people will draw when they consider the provisions, although I am not sure that it is the conclusion that we would wish. We want people in this country&#151;and from overseas, in particular&#151;to get a decent impression of our administrative and legal system and to believe that they will get a fair deal from British justice. Whichever way the Government dress up the penalty, it will look like a fine to those who are subject to it. The Minister will have the devil of a job trying to explain to somebody from overseas that it is not a criminal charge and a fine, but a civil penalty being administered by a benign Secretary of State. The Minister should think about it the other way round and consider the point of view of a British lorry driver who may be subject to such a regime overseas.
<P>
I have a final brief point, which the Minister has tempted me into. What about overseas lorry drivers? How will they avail themselves of these provisions? How will they know the details of the English law of duress? It will be difficult enough for British lorry drivers. How will foreign lorry drivers know what they must establish under clause 20(2) and (3)? Who will tell them? Will they have any idea what is going on? They will be at an incredible disadvantage if written statements are required. What if their English is not good?
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for giving way yet again. Surely the answer to his question is that one group of overseas operators will know all about the English law of duress&#151;those who deliberately bring in illegal immigrants. They are the only people who will have been briefed by the traffickers as to the one loophole that can get them out of difficulty if they are caught. The people who will benefit from the loophole are the guilty, and those who will suffer are the innocent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes an absolutely valid point. Such matters never fall within honest people's range of contemplation. The Minister keeps telling us about the sort of person whom he wants to get. That is the sort of person who thinks that such a contingency may arise and who will prepare for it and get his or her stories ready in advance. Honest people could therefore be put at a disadvantage when dishonest people may be prepared.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Any lorry driver found to have carried a clandestine immigrant would no doubt be interviewed by immigration officials, as would the immigrant. Would such a driver be able to have legal representation? His remarks to the officials may have implications for his business. I know that the process is a civil procedure, but is has consequences. In this day and age, companies tend to say to their employees, ``Don't say a thing unless you get the lawyers''. It seems to me that such matters should be dealt with by a code of practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> You have not had the experience that Opposition Members have had, Mr. Stevenson, in debating codes of practice in recent hours. My hon. Friend the Member for Poole made his comment with the best of intentions, and I am sure that it is worthy. Even with the best will in the world, however, I could not read a code of practice with anything other than a jaundiced eye. I am tempted to say that I could not look at a code of practice at all, and that I would not be bothered if I never saw a code of practice again in my life.
<P>
I have a simple question for the Minister. How on earth will an overseas lorry driver cope with the procedure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Stevenson. You are the Committee's third Chairman in the course of the sitting. [Hon. Members: ``Fourth.''] I also warmly welcome back to the Committee the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Office. We missed him in the middle of the night, and it is good to see him back, looking refreshed and well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that I was not missing him in my sleep.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> The two Labour Members who were sitting behind the Minister, neither of whom is currently in the Room, also enjoyed a good night's rest, albeit in their places.
<P>
When I spoke about the amendment, which would delete subsection (3)(c), during consideration of the previous group of amendments, Mr. Maxton quite rightly told me that it would be better dealt with now. This is indeed the right moment, and I was intending to speak to the amendment now anyway.
<P>
The Under-Secretary's first intervention after his good night's sleep would on its own have provoked me into joining the debate. We have spent the past few hours and the whole night advancing what we believe to be a just case for hauliers and for people who own, manage and run trucks. Shortly before the Minister left the Committee, I sensed that he was getting a little impatient, as he became a little shorter than he had been earlier in the evening. We understood that. He then suggested, however, that we were seeking to support the rights of illegal hauliers who knowingly brought clandestines into the country. That was not, of course, the case.
<P>
We have sought to make the case for hauliers, and the need to do so is nowhere more obvious than in the clause. The Bill subjects hauliers to a type of unnatural justice&#151;or natural injustice&#151;to which other people in society are not subject under criminal law. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) dwelt on that point at length. Now the Minister is telling the Committee that if people do not like it they can sue. That is extraordinary advice.
<P>
Earlier, I mentioned to my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere in a brief intervention that as a Member of Parliament I am frequently visited by constituents who are being pursued for arrears by the Child Support Agency or by their local council or who have similar problems. I for one would never suggest to a constituent that he or she should simply not pay, and I trust that no other hon. Member would do so. Of course, hon. Members seek to help such constituents, to give them good advice and to do what we can, but we would never suggest that they should not pay.
<P>
I do not know whether the Minister was being flippant or serious, but he said in response to an intervention made by my hon. Friend said that people should consider not paying and wait to be sued. The clause throws up the issue of who would sue them&#151;who would undertake the proceedings against them? I presume that it would be the immigration service on behalf of the Secretary of State.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Certainly, the Secretary of State could take proceedings should someone fail to pay the penalty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Presumably, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere mentioned, there could be drastic consequences in that case, so that would be a high-risk strategy.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I think that the drastic consequences alluded to involved detention. We will come to discuss in due course how such drastic consequences may well be mitigated in genuine cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I am grateful to the Minister; we shall of course come to that in due course.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I listened carefully to what the Minister said. If a penalty notice is served and someone does not pay it within a prescribed time&#151;we do not know what that time will be&#151;&#163;70,000-worth of lorry can be detained. The Minister may say, ``If it is not paid, they can sue.'' But that is not what the Bill says. As the Minister suggests, the Bill allows for the draconian penalty that a vehicle could be held for days or weeks until a fine is paid. If a person is given three weeks to pay, and then fails to pay, how on earth will the lorry be detained? Will there be power to grab a lorry that has already passed through the docks?
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I will not follow up my right hon. Friend's argument, but he makes the point for me. This is yet another attack on hauliers. We heard earlier that our snazzy new Home Office disseminates its information via a website and via the Road Haulage Association and others. I wonder whether the RHA and others have alerted their members to exactly what is proposed in the Bill. Hauliers and lorry drivers have been campaigning in London and cities throughout the country against their treatment by the Government. I wonder whether their trade associations have yet been able to alert them to what is proposed in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Hall:</B> What about the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I am sure, Mr. Stevenson, that you would alert me if I were out of order. We have heard many sedentary interventions from the Government Whip during the night. I remind him once more that I spent many hours on the Government Benches listening to him waxing lyrical on education matters.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Having reread the amendment and the clause, I suspect that we are straying a little wide of the mark. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would oblige us all by returning to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Stevenson. I shall concentrate on the specific issue of deleting clause 20(3)(c).
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere and my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border again cited the evidence that we have received on the specific issue from the Road Haulage Association and others. We have been told consistently that the clause&#151;and paragraph (3)(c) in particular&#151;will effectively make it impossible for drivers to benefit from the defence.
<P>
Given the way in which business is structured and how the industry is managed, the vast majority of hauliers operate on their own. Some have a mate with them, but the vast majority do not. How will the defence in paragraph (c) be verifiable by the driver in question? Drivers will have carried out any checks required under the clause on their own. Now that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere has left the Room, this may be the moment to refer again to the code of practice. It might allow us to know what sort of checks will be involved under paragraph (c).
<P>
Paragraph (c) states
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that on the occasion in question the person or persons responsible for operating that system did so properly.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
At no stage have we been told what ``properly'' means; we will find that out only when we have the code of practice and a better idea of what the Minister and the Home Office intend in it.
<P>
A lorry driver who is on his own and believes that he has carried out all the checks and proper procedures that the Government require of him may open the back of his lorry when he arrives at his destination, and some illegal immigrants may come out. His immediate thought is what should he do and how can he verify that he has carried out the proper checks that the Bill and the code of practice require. My right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border put his finger on the simple truth that the driver cannot verify his claim that he has operated properly&#151;he has no evidence or third-party endorsement of it.
<P>
There is clearly a danger in subsection (3)(c) that, without an independent witness, the driver will automatically be presumed guilty. That is how the Road Haulage Association and we interpret subsection (3)(c). Everything that we have heard in our deliberations on the Bill goes to show that the driver will be presumed guilty until he can prove that he is innocent. The discovery of illegal immigrants in his cab will be taken as evidence that the system was not operated properly.
<P>
I refer again to the evidence that we received from Mr. Norris of the Road Haulage Association on this very point. He listed the two provisions in paragraphs (a) and (b) and then quoted paragraph (c), saying,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and thirdly,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	`on the occasion in question the person or persons responsible for operating that system did so properly.'''
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman say whether he is putting Mr. Norris forward as a completely unbiased and independent authority on the policies that a Labour Government may follow?
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I am not saying that Mr. Norris is unbiased or independent; he clearly has a duty&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I realise that the Committee has been ploughing through its labours for some hours, but I do not want to stray onto the attributes of any particular person. Perhaps we can bear that in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I am happy to accept that ruling, Mr. Stevenson, but I will continue with the quote, which refers specifically to subsection (3)(c), about which Mr. Norris spoke. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The problem with that provision is, as my colleague suggested, that once an illegal immigrant is detected, it would appear axiomatic that the driver has failed to observe one of those three principles. It offers, therefore, no reasonable defence.''&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 18 March 1999; c. 412-3.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Whatever the Minister's view about the quality of that evidence, it is evidence that we received. I will not go into detail again, as I have done under other Chairmen, about the comments by the Home Secretary in oral evidence to us in which he belittled much of the evidence with which we had been provided.
<P>
The Road Haulage Association has suggested an alternative to paragraph (c); it is a possible third automatic defence, which Conservative Members think is entirely justified. The association has suggested that voluntary action that is taken by a driver and which leads to the apprehension of illegal immigrants in the back of his lorry should count as a defence. We heartily endorse that. Throughout our proceedings, we have said that it is only fair that there should be some reward for an innocent, law-abiding lorry driver who unwittingly brings illegal immigrants into this country if he goes straight to the authorities and those illegal immigrants are immediately apprehended. Not being prosecuted may seem like scant reward, but it is a reward in the context of the Bill and the clause.
<P>
Although the amendment that the Road Haulage Association proposed is not before us, I strongly support amendment No. 190, which would delete clause 20(3)(c) from the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I do not want to take too long, otherwise I will go over ground that my colleagues have covered already. I support amendment No. 190, which would delete clause 20(3)(c). I implore the Government to produce a code of practice as quickly as possible, because how ``properly'' is defined will be very germane to this part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that he wants the Government to bring forward such a code as quickly as possible. But surely he recognises the importance of consulting fully with the RHA, the FTA and other organisations to ensure that we get the code right rather than simply producing it quickly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I believe in the most inclusive approach. It is important to get the code of practice right. It is also very good that the Bill contains a procedure to amend it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Surely, in the spirit of what the Minister has said, my hon. Friend could take him up on his offer. The Minister wants to get it right and consult the RHA, the FTA, other organisations, Parliament and Her Majesty's Opposition. May I say on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere that we would be delighted to be consulted at this stage with a very rough draft, embryo framework of the code of practice, and that we will assist with the FTA and the RHA?
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Let us return to the amendment, which is very important.
<P>
The code of practice is a key point, as is disclosure of information, which was mentioned earlier. The Secretary of State is, in effect, the judge and jury. Someone may be caught and interviewed by the immigration officials. What information the employer receives will be quite important, because he may have only part of the picture. As the Bill contains a provision to appeal, it is important that anyone who does so knows the full story. At what point would the employer, or the person accused with a penalty notice, know the background to the case? Not having all the pieces of the jigsaw would be a disadvantage.
<P>
Although this comes under clause 21, which we have not come to yet, there is a link. What additional information will be given with the penalty notice so that someone objecting to it can write a sensible reply to the Secretary of State, taking into account all the factors that the immigration authorities know about? It will not be very satisfactory if the Government have one set of information and the appellant is trying to piece together information by interviewing people. The immigration and, possibly, the law authorities must have information and the person against whom the penalty notice&#151;

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I realise the point that the hon. Gentleman is trying to make, and I am happy for the code of practice to be referred to, because it ties in with the amendment and is referred to in the clause. However, penalty notices come under another clause. I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank you for your guidance, Mr. Stevenson, and I am sure that we will have a full debate on penalty notices. I think that I have made the point to the Minister that when we come on to that topic, Opposition Members will require a rather fuller explanation than that contained in the Bill. It may be germane that more information is given to ensure a proper degree of natural justice.
<P>
That is all I have to say, Mr. Stevenson, and I hope that my contribution has been helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> May I join in welcoming you to the Chair for the next few minutes, Mr. Stevenson, and in due course, no doubt, through the morning?
<P>
Clause 20 provides two routes for a defence against the civil penalty. One is that of acting under duress. The other, under subsection (3), is a three-part defence based on not knowing, or having reasonable grounds for suspecting a clandestine entrant was or might be concealed; having an effective system preventing carriage of clandestines, while subsection (3)(c) provides
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that on the occasion in question the person or persons responsible for operating that system did so properly.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would omit the third part of the defence&#151;the requirement that, on the occasion in question, the system of preventing the carriage of clandestines be operated properly. Conservative Members are again trying to wreck our proposals for effective controls against clandestines. The amendment would make a nonsense of the operation of the civil penalty and the defence in subsection (3). If the amendment were accepted, it would be sufficient for carriers to show that they had an effective system for preventing carriage of clandestines even if that system had not been in operation, or had not been operated properly on the occasion in question.
<P>
That is nonsensical. It would be like a householder telling his insurance company that because he had a very nice lock fitted to his door, it should ignore the fact that he left his front door open on the day that his house was burgled.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Perhaps I may finish some of my points first.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Having been in the Chair for about half an hour, I think that it is time I had a break. [Laughter.] I shall suspend the Committee for 20 minutes. We shall resume at 10.50 am
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>10.50 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. Is the Committee inquorate?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is not inquorate, so I intend to start on our business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I have been waiting with anticipation for the Committee to start again, revitalised and renewed as I am by a good night's sleep.
<P>
The civil penalty addresses a major and growing problem of clandestine entry into the United Kingdom. We have decided that it is necessary to tackle it. However, we have mitigated the effect of that penalty to the extent of the defence of subsection (3). Responsible transport operators should have no objection to meeting those requirements, including the condition that once they have in place systems for preventing the carriage of clandestine entrants, they should ensure that those systems are used on every journey.
<P>
In drawing up the code of practice, we shall establish guidelines for an effective system and the methodologies to show that systems have been properly operated.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> The Minister's case would be reasonably logical, were it not for the fact that earlier provisions in the Bill enable him to impose a fine on an owner even when that owner had nothing to do with, and no knowledge of, the trip concerned. Does not the Minister recognise that it is oppressive for an owner to be caught by paragraph (c) of these requirements if he cannot say that, on the occasion in question, the system was operated properly&#151;even if it was&#151;because there is no driver there to give testimony?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me, I intend to address that point in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> The Minister said that the Government would develop methodologies to prove that systems have been operated properly. Will he elaborate on that? What sort of documentary, video or electronic evidence and record keeping would lorry drivers have to show in order to prove that the system had been operated properly?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The purpose of our proposal to consult with the transport and haulier associations is to develop methodologies to enable us to answer the very question that the right hon. Gentleman asks. An agreement arising from that consultation might take several forms; the right hon. Gentleman identified some of the methods that might be felt appropriate. For example, those with whom we consult may well feel that closed-circuit television or some kind of video evidence is appropriate. Then again, they may feel&#151;I suspect that this is the likely outcome&#151;that there should be some form of certification to ensure that there are certain checks monitored by the RHA or the FTA or somebody employed by them. When the appropriate checks have been undertaken, a certificate of some sort can be provided to the driver. That could be taken by the Secretary of State to be strong evidence leading him to be disposed to accept that the proper checks have been operated and that the penalty is therefore not payable.
<P>
I make no commitments at this stage because we obviously want to discuss with the relevant bodies how the process should develop in practice. The purpose of consulting the transport industry on these and other aspects of the code of practice is to put these issues in perspective and, in due course, to establish them in the code. Amendment No. 190 would be damaging in terms of the entire structure for dealing with the issue, and I cannot ask the Committee to support it.
<P>
I shall deal with some of the points that have been raised in the debate. The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border referred to the Secretary of State acting as judge and jury. I have dealt with that point to some extent, but I shall repeat the argument. If a responsible person disputes the Secretary of State's view as to liability he can, after the Secretary of State has considered any representations, refused to pay and wait to be sued in the civil court. In any such proceedings, the person concerned may raise defences under clause 20 and establish them on the civil standard of proof.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole asked what representations might be considered. In all likelihood&#151;the final operational details will have to be discussed with the RHA&#151;a penalty notice will be issued, much as it is under the current carriers' liability legislation. The immigration service would then listen to any representations that the person who had received the penalty notice might wish to make. The person may wish to make those representations in writing, and no doubt any representations would be properly considered. The aim is to base the criteria for deciding whether the penalty is payable on the Bill: that is the right thing to do.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border says that the Secretary of State is judge and jury. I do not accept that. The Secretary of State is regulated by law, as he is under the carriers' liability legislation that currently applies, and the right hon. Gentleman need have no fear in that regard. As Lord Denning once said, ``Be you ever so high, the law is above you''. That will be the case for any Secretary of State, who will, in his application of these procedures, be subject to the normal procedures and requirements of the law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I do not think that the Secretary of State will be subject to the normal procedures. The Minister seems to be saying that the agents of the Secretary of State&#151;the immigration officers&#151;will decide in the first instance whether they think that someone has committed an offence. They hear the lorry driver's defence, they make their judgment, the lorry driver is overruled and a penalty is imposed. If the lorry driver does not like it and refuses to pay, the Home Office has to sue to get the money, he defends his case and it goes to a civil court. At that stage he can mount his defence again and the court, as I understand it, gives it a rehearing to ascertain whether the Secretary of State was right to impose the penalty in the first place.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The procedure is not far removed from the sort of procedure that the right hon. Gentleman supported in terms of carriers' liability, and he doth protest too much about its operation. In practice, however, we do not get involved in substantial litigation with airlines, because certain processes enable us to negotiate the issues.
<P>
We have had amicable and constructive discussions with RHA and FTA, and there are ways in which we might be able to develop procedures to deal with any issues that affect British lorry drivers. I hope that problems can be resolved without the need for members of those bodies to resort to litigation. Let us see how the discussions develop. However, I accept that hauliers must have the option of taking a case to court, at which point they could cite any of the defences contained in the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for New Forest, East asked about the owner of a vehicle or a container who had hired it out to a foreign person who carried clandestine entrants because he had not performed the necessary checks. He asked whether the owner would be liable under the Bill. Such a case brings us back to the issue of creating an effective system and the way in which that should operate. Our aim is to create a system in whose effectiveness in preventing clandestines from entering this country all parties have a vested interest.
<P>
In the case described, we would initially proceed against the person most likely to be blameworthy, but liability could be joint and several, and others may become liable if the initial person did not pay the penalty. Our aim is to protect taxpayers against the enormous cost imposed on them by clandestines who enter this country. Everyone in the industry should recognise his responsibility for not landing taxpayers with an enormous burden. We want to create a framework in which everyone has a vested interest in achieving that.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am coming to the hon. Gentleman's point about how we deal with the owner. Any person who is involved in the industry should be aware of the system that we shall set up. We want to ensure that, when owners hire out vehicles or containers, they are conscious of the need to emphasise to anyone, British or foreign, that a penalty system is in place. They must make it clear that the driver of the vehicle, the hirer of the vehicle who employs his own driver and the owner of the vehicle may all be liable.
<P>
The owner of the vehicle can protect himself by offsetting any liability that might be incurred by the person with whom he has entered into a contract to hire the vehicle. The hon. Member for New Forest, East might argue that it is sometimes difficult to pursue a foreign person who has disappeared in another country where the legal system may not be as easy to access as the British system. However, I am sure that some people will question whether it is that easy to access the English and Welsh system.
<P>
The person who has entered into a contract to hire a vehicle will obviously wish to enforce it in any event. This provision merely means that he would have to insert another clause into the overall contract to emphasise to the hirer of the vehicle and to any driver that he employs that liability will be enforced against them, should any be placed on the owner.
<P>
The position is clear, and the objective of the exercise must be borne in mind throughout. That objective is to create a vested interest on the part of owners and potential hirers and drivers that they may all become liable, so they had better make sure that their vehicles are not carrying clandestines.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> The Minister is generous in giving way.
<P>
Does the Minister accept that the situation involves a fundamental inequality? In what was almost an aside, he said that it was not that easy to access the English and Welsh legal system. However, if the driver is to be primarily responsible, the owner will not need to pursue the driver through the English and Welsh legal system&#151;however inaccessible&#151;because the Government will immediately impose the penalty on the guilty driver. By contrast, they will not impose the penalty on a foreign driver going back to France or another country, but on the owner. For all the Minister's theory, there is no way that the owner can afford to access the French or Belgian legal system to get the penalty back, as the costs will outweigh the penalty. Therefore, the Government are trying to have it both ways.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman's example misses the point. The owner will have entered into a contract with the hirer. What business does the owner have in entering into a contract with a hirer who is a foreign company or business person, if he believes that there is no way of enforcing that contract or any clauses that it contains?
<P>
The hon. Gentleman cannot argue that the Government are seeking to have it both ways. We are saying to owners: ``If you are entering into a contract with someone who will drive your vehicle, you must be aware that that person had better have in place&#151;and will use&#151;an effective system to prevent clandestines coming in. Otherwise, that person may be liable, and if he or she does not pay, you might end up being liable''. That can be dealt with in the contract in exactly the same way as obtaining the payment of fees for hire of the vehicle.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> Addressing that point directly, I ask the Minister to put himself in the position of an owner hiring out a vehicle. For the most part, that owner would regard as small the risk of a seemingly respectable foreign contractor defaulting on the arrangements and obligations. Now, however, as a result of the Bill, such an owner will face a peculiarly vicious risk, as he will know that there is a danger that a foreign contractor can calculatedly set him up, so that he takes the rap and the contractor faces no responsibility whatsoever.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> As has happened throughout our debate, the hon. Gentleman is in danger of making excuses for the carrying of clandestines. We do not accept that. The cost of hiring a vehicle such as a large articulated lorry or a container is quite substantial. Owners engage in a serious contract, and want to be sure that they are likely to be paid the fee and other liabilities that may be incurred. Such liabilities may include damage to vehicles, and should be offset in the proper way.
<P>
There is no reason why a potential liability in relation to carrying clandestines cannot be offset in that way. That would be a straightforward exercise and need not involve the owner in any action other than putting a clause into a contract that he would already have to sign.
<P>
That would ensure that the owner, hirer and others involved in haulage have a vested interest in not carrying clandestines. The Government do not want to have to fine anyone because we hope that no one will carry clandestines in the back of lorries. We know of around 8,000 who were carried in last year. The problem must be dealt with by a tough but fair regime such as this.
<P>
I was asked how foreign lorry drivers would cope with the regime. They already have to deal with many legal issues, including driving on a different side of the road. Lorry drivers can cope with many problems but the Government's message for them is clear and simple&#151;``Check your load and do not carry clandestines''. We will put up notices and produce leaflets that will make it clear to them that if they do not check their loads and do not have an effective system in place for doing so, they run the risk of carrying clandestines on their vehicles. If they are then found to be carrying clandestines, they will be likely to be subject to the penalty.
<P>
We will give lorry drivers all the explanation and guidance that they need. We anticipate that leaflets will be available in several languages in due course, and the immigration service will make every effort to ensure that interpretation facilities are available if people want to make representations or find out information.
<P>
Above all&#151;and this applies to foreign lorry drivers, British lorry drivers, hauliers, owners or anyone else in the industry&#151;we are determined to crack down on the carrying of clandestines. We would have hoped for the support of Opposition Members and I regret the fact that they will not support the tough but fair regime that we want to put in place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I give way to the right hon. Gentleman in the hope that he has now been convinced of the rightness of supporting our regime.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> The Minister tried to be reasonable in the last few minutes of his winding-up speech, which always makes me suspicious that he is skating on thin ice. The Minister says that ``Check your load, don't carry clandestines'' is a simple message, but it is not so simple. It is ``Check your load according to a very detailed code of practice'', which we have not yet seen. Compliance will be judged by the Minister's immigration officials, who will also decide whether clandestines have been carried under duress. That is far from a simple, ``Check your load''.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The message that clandestines should not be carried is simple. I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman does not believe that we need an effective regime to ensure that that message is put across. I believe that the Government are right to implement a tough and fair policy, which is what we are going to do. I have dealt with the points that were raised in the debate and I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I apologise for my absence during part of the Minister's speech, but he is now dealing with the point that I made earlier. I accept what he says about the objective of encouraging checks. However, the problem for foreign drivers is not just that they have to carry out a check but that clause 20 contains a code of practice governing the system of operation. How can a foreign lorry driver know what is in the code of practice?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The foreign lorry driver will get the message about checking his load and ensuring that he carries no clandestines. That is not a complex message for him. If he is sure that he is not carrying clandestines, he need not worry. However, if he has any doubts and does not check his loads, he needs to ensure that he has an effective system in place to do so. The hon. Member for Hertsmere can make excuses, as he and his colleagues have sought to do all night, for the way in which lorry drivers have carried clandestines into the country. We hope that only a small minority are doing so knowingly in an entirely culpable manner. It is difficult to prove that, but we know that it happens. The other people are doing it negligently and none of us can continue to accept that. The Government are anxious to put in place a system that deals with both the culpability and negligence issues and ensures that we do not have this burden on the taxpayer.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I have listened carefully to what the Minister has said. Clause 20(3)(c) is not a negligence clause. It does not deal with negligent lorry drivers. The penalties imposed under the clause can catch the careful lorry drivers who, while they are not negligent, have not satisfied a code of practice that the Minister's office will draw up and cannot prove that they were operating the system properly&#151;but in whose judgment? Clearly the judgment of the Minister's officials, but that may be tested in court. If the Minister's officials are not satisfied, what will be the standard of proof? Does not the civil standard of proof apply, a lesser burden again?
<P>
The Minister has given an unfair impression. I bow to no one in saying that if people are deliberately involved in this trade they should be hung out to dry. I would like to see the toughest possible penalties against them such as confiscation of vehicles and long terms of imprisonment. Let us try to bust them. I would happily see NCIS and intelligence-led policing used to get at that.
<P>
I am happy to see measures taken against sloppy, careless lorry drivers. I am happy to see criminal penalties imposed once it is proved that they have broken the law. The civil penalty system that the Minister proposes here is acceptable, but not with clause 20, in which the burden of proof is reversed in one part. Three hurdles are imposed in subsection (3) and we are seeking to delete one that we maintain is worthless to the driver because he will not have the evidence to justify it.
<P>
The Minister has not dealt with the point that subsection 3(c) still stands and the balance of proof required is the civil rather than the criminal standard. The word ``properly'' is not defined, but I presume that his civil servants, and I mean no criticism of them, will decide whether the system was operated properly. The Minister can invent all the methodology that he likes to try to prove whether it was done properly, but inevitably an immigration official will have to say, ``I'm sorry. In my opinion, you have not done it properly and therefore the penalty applies.'' Defences under subsection (3)(c) are therefore worthless.
<P>
I do not mean to criticise my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, but in the last few hours we have talked about the standard of proof and the judge and jury. His hon. Friends would not confirm this, but I should like the Minister to confirm that the clause will be administered in the first instance by his officials. At some point, it may be relevant to ask what grade the officials who make the judgment and impose the penalty will be.
<P>
The Minister says that if drivers do not like the penalty they can refuse to pay. When drivers refuse to pay, the officials in the Home Office will sue to get the &#163;2,000, if they have not managed to impound their lorries first. That is what the Minister said. He added that when they sued him, the person would be able to go to court and mount the same defences that he tried with the immigration official, who said, ``Sorry, pal, I'm not having that''. Will the Minister confirm that I have got that right?

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is simply repeating what he said earlier, for whatever reason. He is describing, and could have described once again, the CLA system that he voted for and supported. He now seems to be objecting to that system. I repeat what I said earlier. The hon. Gentleman seems to be rehearsing the same argument and mistaking the whole issue of carrier's liability and the penalty system.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hestitate to describe any hon. Member's contribution as tedious or repetitious, but members of the Committee will appreciate that, in the Chair, I must be mindful of the ruling on that. I also remind the hon. Members that the procedures involved here are contained in clause 21.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mclean:</B> After 24 hours, one's voice tends to become tedious and the arguments that one thought were germane and to the point tend to stick in the mind. When I fail to obtain a clear and simple answer from the Minister, and his answer seems to be, ``It must have been what the previous Government did'', I tend to repeat the question. I apologise for that. I shall not do so again.
<P>
My final point relates to legal representation, an issue raised by one of my hon. Friends. If a clandestine is caught in the back of someone's lorry and makes a statement to the immigration official, can that statement be used against the lorry driver or as evidence to impose a penalty? The clandestine may say, ``You've caught me, but the lorry was wide open. I didn't break into it. I just climbed in. It was easy to get in and the driver didn't do any checks.'' Can that information be used against the driver? Must it be tested? Can the driver have legal representation before a penalty is imposed on him?
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I shall be brief, Mr. Stevenson, bearing in mind your recent remarks. I am genuinely grateful to the Minister, who has answered very fully many of the points that have been raised. I am disappointed that he is not impressed by the quality of the amendment. It has been an interesting feature of the night that the Minister of State, who has a different style of answering amendments, has been a little more generous, whereas the Under-Secretary, who has been fuller in his replies, has perhaps been less generous.
<P>
With regard to the core of my contribution on subsection (3)(c), can the Minister tell the Committee one thing that the haulier can pray in aid to an official to show that he has acted responsibly and operated the system properly? I do not ask the Minister to go through the whole list or what may or may not be in the code of conduct, but can he give one example of a way in which a single driver, on his own in the cab, can prove to the authorities that he has acted properly?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> A lawyer can be used in any way that a person believes wants and in whatever circumstances he might properly be able to obtain advice. I do not propose to provide state-funded legal advice; it is a matter for the private sector and the haulier.
<P>
The normal rules would apply to whether representations by a driver were admissible evidence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way with characteristic courtesy. Can he give us an example or his idea of the way in which a lawyer might be used?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> That would be entirely a matter for the driver or the haulier. I shall not give examples of how he may choose to use his lawyer. People have all sorts of views about whether lawyers are necessary, as the hon. Gentleman is no doubt aware.
<P>
The hon. Member was Westbury wanted an example of how we would ensure that a haulier could show that a proper check had been carried out. That is the objective of the code of practice, which will form part of the negotiations with the associations. We hope that we can reach an agreement, or if not an agreement, a code for the operation of the procedures that will be accepted by Parliament. I have already explained that there may be checks and a certificate. I have now dealt with all the points, and I hope that we can make progress.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 474, in page 14, line 42, leave out `is to' and insert `may'.
<P>
One of the last comments that I made before leaving the Room was that I never wanted to see a code of practice again. However, the amendment deals with the regard that should be paid to a code of practice. I shall speak about it as briefly as possible.
<P>
Subsection (4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In determining for the purposes of this section, whether a particular system is effective, regard is to be had to any code of practice issued by the Secretary of State under section 19.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (3)(b) also refers to an effective system. The amendment would replace the words ``is to'' with ``may''. It would therefore introduce some flexibility into the code. The Minister may claim that we try to water everything down, but I ask him to consider the matter from our point of view. We have not yet had an opportunity to see the code of practice, so it is not unreasonable for us to exercise a little caution.
<P>
We must be careful about the use of the code of practice. We are pessimistic about the provisions, but we want them to be as fair as possible. The provision would be fairer and more flexible if courts could use their discretion, rather than having to take account of the code.
<P>
Codes of practice are often used to convey the finer details of the parent Act. The legal effect of codes varies between, for example, the highway code, town and country planning legislation and immigration rules. Some codes are more binding than others. Some codes have no legal effect. I believe that that is true to the consultative codes under town and country planning legislation. However, some codes have legal effect, and are often used to ascertain whether people have discharged a duty properly. People's performance can be evaluated against the code.&#151;[Interruption.] The Room seems to be emptying.
<P>
The carrier's performance will be evaluated against the code. Therefore, it is important to include some flexibility in the provision. The carrier's behaviour may fall short of the code in one or two respects or may not be covered by the code, but a reasonable person might say that the carrier had done everything properly in so far as he could reasonably have been expected to do so, despite the fact that there was not 100 per cent. compliance with the code. It would be harsh if the code of practice was then used as a reason for saying that the carrier had failed to have an effective system in place or had not operated the system properly.
<P>
I hope that the Minister understands my point&#151;that some flexibility should be introduced, so that if a carrier does not comply with every item in the code, that will not constitute an automatic failure. We accept that general good sense in having a code of practice and we know that the industry is interested in it. The Minister will no doubt tell us that he has had consultations with the industry and that it welcomes the code; but it welcomes it against the background of draconian provisions under which it will be difficult for carriers to establish a defence. The industry sees it as a long-stop&#151;the only way of escaping liability under a draconian regime.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I invite the Minister to consider the argument for flexibility. We shall discuss a wide variety of circumstances and different types of vehicle&#151;we have discovered during our sitting just how wide the ambit of responsibility is and how wide the net is cast. There are many types of trucks and trailers alone, and the code cannot cover every type of manufactured trailer, truck and vehicle. Flexibility is needed on account of the character of vehicles. Carriers also vary. They may be British or overseas, owner-drivers or employee-drivers and so on. The code should cater for all contingencies.
<P>
I ask the Miniaster to respond to those matters by spelling out how the code of practice will work and whether it will be flexible. We do not want it to be watered down, but we want it to be flexible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> With the best will in the world, when the Home Office and the Road Haulage Association on behalf of the haulage industry come to devise a code of practice, they will probably deal with 98 per cent. of the standard operating procedures covering HGV1s, 2s and 3s, demountables, refrigerated lorries and every sort of vehicle that they can think of. In the second batch of Home Office guns legislation&#151;for which, fortunately, I was not responsible&#151;the new Government thought that they could cover every&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> The analogy will take about 10 seconds, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
The new Government thought that they could cover every sort of firearm, but then discovered that there were hundreds more that they and the trade had never heard of. The Government will have the same problem when drawing up the code of practice. It will cover most lorries, trailers, caravans, caravanettes and so on and their operating systems. But, inevitably, some vehicles will not be covered, despite the officials, the Road Haulage Association, the Freight Transport Association and all the lorry experts in the country believing that they know every vehicle backwards. Some poor sucker will be caught and a decision will have to be taken by compulsory reference to a code that may not be relevant or apposite to the specific problem.
<P>
It would be sensible if the code were used in the same way as under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974&#151;that is, it may be cited and used in evidence. It should then be left to the good sense of officials in the first instance and then the courts to decide whether the code is relevant and can be used. If they must have regard to the code, even when it is inappropriate to the transporter, the job and the person caught, that will make a mockery of the law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I reiterate that the provision will cover a wide variety of vehicles. The explanatory notes refer to seals on lorry trailers. Of course, most lorries have soft-skinned curtain siders that enable people to enter not only through the top of the vehicle but, by using a Stanley knife, through the sides. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border said, a wide variety of vehicles, such as small boats, aircraft and&#151;presumably&#151;hot air balloons, will be covered by the provision. Therefore, any code of practice must be interpreted with flexibility and common sense. I support the amendment, which would add such flexibility.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The amendment is one of several attempts to weaken the new controls that we have put in place to tackle clandestine entry.
<P>
Subsection (4) will provide that, in relation to the defence outlined in subsection (3),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``regard is to be had to any code of practice issued by the Secretary of State under clause 19.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would replace the phrase, ``is to be had'' with the phrase, ``may be had''. That would weaken the status of the code of practice and make its operation, and the provision of a defence against the imposition of a civil penalty, more difficult.
<P>
We intend to have a broad-based discussion, in which we shall deal with most of the issues arising, with the Road Haulage Association on the development of a code of practice. The Road Haulage Association will doubtless advise us about the types of vehicle about which the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border expressed concern. His worry about whether the code of practice would include every type of vehicle might best be dealt with in a debate on the draft code, which will be laid before Parliament in due course. He obviously has less faith than me in the ability of the Road Haulage Association and the Freight Transport Association to give proper guidance.
<P>
The amendment would lead to the undesirable conclusion of a code of practice with little real relevance. We intend the code of practice to be an important document that will reflect the requirements of security and the often difficult circumstances in which those requirements may be fulfilled. We anticipate that it will play a positive role in the operation of the civil penalty, which will benefit transport operators considerably. We believe it right to require any defence against the civil penalty to take account of the code of practice. Therefore, I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I did not intend to speak in this debate, but the Under-Secretary has provoked me. He is smiling but, as he knows, he has been mischievous. It is not a matter of lacking faith in the ability of the RHA and FTA to assist the Under-Secretary: of course they can assist him. I intend no disrespect to Home Office officials when I say that, if the RHA and FTA cannot help the Home Office on transport matters, no one can. Although the Home Office boasts expertise on a wide variety of subjects, I know of no great well of expertise on lorries that would enable it to draw up a code of practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Things have changed since the right hon. Gentleman's day&#151;we now have joined-up government, which enables the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions to help the Home Office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> In that case, I am glad that some of the blame for the shambles in the Bill can be placed on the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions instead of the Home Office, which never drafted Bills as bad as this in my day.
<P>
Of course the RHA and FTA can help, but they do not have a crystal ball to see every vehicle that can be designed and operated. We must bear it in mind that they do not represent the whole industry. Tens of thousands of people do not join those organisations for their own weird and wonderful reasons. Although the Home Office consulted the forensic science laboratory and top firearms experts, it missed out hundreds of guns in the latest so-called comprehensive legislation.
<P>
My main argument is that it is mischievous of the Under-Secretary to say that if we give his officials a discretionary power that they may&#151;rather than have to&#151;have regard to the code of practice, we shall weaken the Bill. That is preposterous, and he knows it. He is trying to make a political point by accusing us of weakening the Bill. Our proposal would give his officials a discretionary power. It is not giving a lorry driver, carrier or transporter the right to insist that an immigration official will not have regard to the code of practice. They will have no say in the matter. The Under-Secretary's officials would have the discretionary power, whether they use it or not. By no stretch of the imagination can he describe that as weakening the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> As I moved the amendment, I shall respond briefly to the Under-Secretary's remarks. I do not want to spend time debating such issues as joined-up government, but once again he drew attention to the fact that we would have a future opportunity to debate the code of practice. I do not want to cover old ground, but the solution is for the Under-Secretary to undertake to reconsider the matter in light of what was said last night by his hon. Friend the Minister of State about the affirmative resolution procedure for the code of practice.
<P>
I will be straight with the Under-Secretary. We did not score a victory on that occasion because our amendment was not accepted. But as the Under-Secretary has been dealing with the code of practice, which is dear to his heart, will be reconsider the matter and allow it to be subject to affirmative resolution procedure? That would give us the opportunity to debate it after he has consulted the industry. We hope that those consultations run smoothly, but we do not think it unreasonable to expect Parliament to debate this subject, given the importance that the Government are attributing to it. The Under-Secretary has the chance to respond, and if he agrees to reconsider the matter, we shall have made progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> In that case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendment proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 68 (Debate on Clause or Schedule standing part), and Standing Order No. 89 (Procedure in Standing Committees), That the Clause stand part of the Bill:</B>&#151;

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments:
<P>
No. 192, in page 15, line 16, at end insert

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`; and&#151;(e) include an explanation of the steps P may take if he wishes to dispute his liability for the penalty'.<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now come to issues that, although tucked away under the heading ``Procedure'', are important. In many cases, they will govern whether a person has the opportunity to mount a defence. The clause sets out the procedure that is to be followed when it is alleged that a responsible person is liable for a penalty. Once again, the odds seem to be stacked against the person who is alleged to be liable. That fact emerges time and again in the provisions relating to carriers' liability. That legislation, down to its last dot and comma, is stacked against the responsible person, who will be put in a difficult position.
<P>
The amendments would make the position a little fairer. We are considering procedural matters. Although the Minister disagrees with us about the burden of proof and the codes of practice, he should agree with us that it is important to have a procedure that is fair and that is perceived to be fair by those who are subject to it.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 192 deals with the notice that the Secretary of State may serve, under the clause's provisions, on a person. We want that notice to include an explanation of the steps that a person may take if he wants to dispute the penalty. Subsection (2) gives four conditions that the penalty notice must meet, and subsection (1) states that the Secretary of State must notify the person, ``P'', of his decision. The penalty notice is the means whereby he will do so.
<P>
The penalty notice must meet four conditions. It must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``state the Secretary of State's reasons for deciding that P is liable to the penalty (or penalties)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Secondly, it must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``state the amount of the penalty . . . to which P is liable''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Thirdly, it must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``specify the date before which, and the manner in which, the penalty (or penalties) must be paid''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Finally, it must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``include an explanation of the steps that the Secretary of State may take under this Part to recover any unpaid penalty.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We should consider the effect that receipt of a notice containing such statements would have on the person who received it. He would inevitably be driven to conclude that he had no alternative but to pay the penalty. The clause does not state that the notice will contain anything that will bring to the attention of the person concerned the fact that he has every right to contest liability.

<P>
<B>Mr Clappison:</B> I shall give way first to my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East and then to the Under-Secretary.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> I have pointed out several times that the likelihood of a misunderstanding will be increased by the fact that many of the drivers concerned may not have English as their first language and that others may not speak it at all. Does my hon. Friend agree?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I shall discuss that point briefly in a moment, but first I give way to the Under-Secretary.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall save the hon. Gentleman's voice a little by saying that I have some sympathy with amendments Nos. 191 and 192. Their wording is not satisfactory and their drafting needs further consideration, but there is strength in his argument that the steps that a person may take to dispute a penalty should be explained. We could table an appropriate amendment on Report. I shall deal with the language issue in greater depth later.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his assistance, and I shall not press the matter further. I should be grateful if he would write to me when he has deliberated on the matter. In light of his comments I may have to return to the matter later, although I hope that it will not be necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall certainly write to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall move on to the question of language. It is important that the explanation is given in a language that the person understands, although I understand that that may present difficulties. The content of subsection (2)(a), (b), (c) and (d) is a lot to take on board for anybody&#151;I certainly found it to be so&#151;and it would be difficult for somebody whose first language was not English or who was not familiar with English to understand all of it. Such a person might overlook the finer details and, for instance, not realise that an appeal against a penalty notice was possible. The meaning must be spelt out to the person so that he can understand the relevant issues.
<P>
It would be important for somebody from abroad to understand subsection (2)(a) because of the possibility of the Secretary of State making an error. The person who receives such a notice will understand that he is being made subject to such a penalty, but not necessarily the reasons for that penalty. It is important to make those reasons clear to the person in a language that he understands, as he may disagree with those reasons. It is also important that the person understands subsection (2)(b)&#151;which states the amount that the person is liable to pay&#151;in order to avoid underpayment or overpayment.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It may assist the hon. Gentleman if I explain how that issue would be dealt with. I cannot do so in an intervention, as the explanation would be too long, but it may prevent the hon. Gentleman from making certain arguments that he would otherwise make.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall happily put the issue of foreign language to one side, and return to it later, in the light of the Under-Secretary's comment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Every Committee member has the opportunity to respond, so it is up the the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I prefer to understand the issue that I am addressing, so I shall wait for the Under-Secretary's reply. I shall proceed with my speech, as I have improved significantly in the past few minutes. I shall continue in that vein, and try to tempt the Under-Secretary to respond.
<P>
Subsections (4) and (5) are a recipe for trouble. Subsection (5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State must . . . take reasonable steps to secure''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I suspect that there is an old adage about people pushing their luck. I advise the hon. Gentleman to quit while he is ahead. I suspect that he is moving on to the next group of amendments. He should restrict himself to the current group.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg your pardon, Mr. Stevenson. The Committee has that pleasure in store. I will allow the Under-Secretary to make his intervention, which I was eagerly awaiting.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I sympathise with the point that the person who will be subject to a civil penalty should understand the nature of that penalty and how it might operate. We intend to ensure that, where possible, leaflets are printed in all the main languages. That is the normal way in which we would deal with the issue. A foreign lorry driver, haulier or owner would therefore be able to understand the notice in his own language. That might not be possible in the case of a rare language in Britain, but we would otherwise aim to provide translations of the penalty notice and how it would operate. I should therefore like to take away the amendments and consider them; I have some sympathy with amendments Nos. 191 and 192.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, because it may save his having to say more and my having to intervene later. Is he saying that in every case, the person to whom a penalty notice is sent will receive a leaflet in his or her language explaining the effect of the penalty notice and that steps that he or she may take?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I do not want to go that far, because that might tie us to producing leaflets in every conceivable language. That would be neither sensible nor deliverable, because people from some parts of the world speak in dialects that may not be easily accessible to translators of a penalty notice. However, we shall attempt to ensure that there is a notice or leaflet that covers the issues in most of the languages that people entering the UK in lorries are likely to use. As that is a fairly straightforward and usual practice, we shall be able to deal with it. I am not disposed to accept the amendment, but I am prepared to say that we intend to have leaflets available in all the main languages and as far as possible to try to ensure that the driver of a vehicle has access to a leaflet in a language that he can understand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that, and appreciate that he is giving me something. However, I must probe a little more to ascertain how much I have been given.
<P>
The point of amendment No. 475 is to ensure that the notice received is in a language that each person who is made subject to the penalty can understand. To remind the Minister, the amendment states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and if P is not a UK national the notice must be in a language which is understood by P.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister will notice the use of the word ``must'' in the amendment, which was designed to require that in every case the notice would be written in a language that the person involved understood, so that they could read in their language the meaning of subsection (2) as it will, I hope, be amended. I am not sure, so I will give way to the Minister again to clarify, whether he is saying that a leaflet will be sent out with every notice, or that leaflets in different languages will generally be available in the sorts of places to which lorry drivers go so that they can understand the procedure.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Under amendment No. 475, the penalty notice would be invalid and the penalty would not be payable if it were not written in a language that the person involved accepted that he understood. The amendment would make it a requirement that the notice
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must be in a language which is understood by P.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
P may claim not to understand all sorts of languages, and it would place an unfair and undue burden on the state to prove that a particular foreign lorry driver understood a particular foreign language. I do not want to go down the route of invalidating the penalty notice. The hon. Gentleman got a lot out of the amendments. I have gone quite a long way, which, I hope he will accept, is as far as I am prepared to go.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It would be churlish of me not to accept that the Minister has been generous, especially on amendments Nos. 191 and 192. The matter is one of procedure rather than substance, but it is nevertheless important to operate a fair procedure. I understand that the Minister is trying to move towards me on amendment No. 192, but I have not yet ascertained exactly how far. I need to identify that point before I can respond to it, and I have not yet done so.
<P>
I am looking for a universal requirement that the person involved should receive explanatory information. Is the Minister saying that in every case the person who is sent a penalty notice will receive a leaflet with it, or will leaflets be made generally available to lorry drivers?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Our main aim is to serve a penalty notice. If we know that a haulier is of a different nationality and speaks a different language, we shall, in so far as we are able to, provide him with a leaflet that explains the penalty notice to him in his language. That is our objective. However, I shall not run the risk of invalidating the penalty notice on the grounds that a person could claim that the leaflet was in a language that he did not understand. We will ensure, in so far as we can, that people understand the notices, but I shall not tie myself down to the universal provision that the hon. Member for Hertsmere wants. I have responded positively to the amendments, and I hope that we can make progress.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should point out that the Under-Secretary was making an intervention, not winding up our debate on the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do no want to take up much more time on this matter because we are moving in the right direction. However, we have not entirely reached the point at which I am happy to leave the matter.
<P>
The Under-Secretary mentioned universal provision, and I understand his problem about dealing with every conceivable case. It would be hard to explain the situation to a person who spoke Romansch or an obsure dialect. However, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate of the Home Office is already responsible for providing leaflets&#151;and explanations&#151;in many different languages for many different purposes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend could try out another idea on the Under-Secretary. I, too, appreciate his position. He does not want a driver or the owner of a vehicle to be able to cop out by saying, ``I am sorry, I do not understand that language''. Could the notice be served in the language that is used to register the vehicle? That would not permit such a general cop-out. Admittedly, the driver might not speak the language that is used to register the vehicle, but my suggestion would be more effective than the Minister's proposals and my hon. Friend's initial proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My right hon. Friend makes a fair point. We are moving in the right direction.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> That is the sort of proposal that I want to take away and consider. I shall write to Committee members about whether we can take such an approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall leave the matter there. I had originally aimed higher, but we have made much progress. The Under-Secretary will take away all three amendments for consideration. I cannot do better than that, and I should quit while I am ahead. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Reinvigorated by those concessions from the Under-Secretary, I have hope of ever greater things. We shall presently come to a very important amendment, but amendment No. 193 is also important.
<P>
The amendment&#151;I think that I am discussing the right amendment on this occasion, Mr. Stevenson&#151;concerns subsections (4) and (5), which deal with the situation in which it is alleged that more than one person is liable for the penalty. We discussed that matter early this morning, and we established that the Government have&#151;perhaps I should put it this way&#151;wide discretion in their decision about who is the responsible person when more than one person could be alleged to be the responsible person. We were told that in general the Government would proceed against the person whom it regarded as the most blameworthy. However, as I understand it&#151;I look to the Minister for confirmation&#151;that does not rule out proceeding against three people at the same time. This morning, we debated what would happen if that occurred and how liability might be apportioned. That was a helpful debate.
<P>
We must consider the procedure, which confirms what the Government said. There will be cases in which more than one person is alleged to be liable. If that happens, subsections (4) and (5), taken together, require the Secretary of State to take reasonable steps to ensure that the penalty notice is served on each person, but if he serves the notice on only one of them, he will be deemed to have served it on all of them.
<P>
Subsection (5) is a bit of a cop-out following the scenario set out in subsection (4). It is a normal principle of law that someone who is liable to a penalty is given notice of it. That is standard procedure. I cannot think of any examples of people being liable to a penalty or charge without being given notice of it and if such examples exist, perhaps the Minister will tell us. It is a fundamental requirement in cases involving parking tickets to television licences that people are given notice if a demand is made of them.
<P>
The Minister accepted the principle that people should receive notices in a language that they understand. I was emboldened by that because I took it to be acceptance of the principle that everyone should be given notice of the penalty. Otherwise, there would be no point in insisting on its being in a language that they understood.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> It is conceivable that a driver may receive a penalty notice and the owner of the vehicle may not. The driver may not pay, the vehicle may be impounded and the owner may not be aware for some time that the vehicle has been impounded. Later provisions in the Bill allow someone with an interest in the vehicle to go to court to reclaim it and there is a time limit of 56 days within which the Secretary of State must respond. If the first notice is not served, the process may be prolonged and may cause increased aggravation for the owner of a vehicle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is a fair and important point. My hon. Friend has drawn attention to what is at stake. The &#163;2,000 fine is large enough when compared with fines in respect of other matters in which notice is required to be given, but we shall see in later clauses that all sorts of other unfortunate consequences may arise for an owner whose vehicle is impounded. One would expect the Secretary of State to be required to give notice.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Poole also said, rightly, that all sorts of problems might arise if someone did not pass on the information that notice had been served.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> It is also conceivable that the owner may be hiring two vehicles to one firm. The knowledge that one of the drivers had been caught trying to smuggle illegal immigrants into the country might affect his view on whether to continue hiring the other vehicle to the firm. The Minister referred earlier to responsiblity of ownership and to why that was included in the Bill. It is material that an owner should know as soon as possible when something has gone wrong because he may have other vehicles that could be exposed and become a responsiblity under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Poole makes an ingenious point. In the scenario that he set out, there could be a positive incentive for the driver of the second vehicle and the driver of the first vehicle who has been caught not to inform the owner for fear of being deprived of the use of the second vehicle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was about to say, in my earlier mistaken intervention, that we had a recipe for trouble, but having heard my hon. Friends, I realise that it is a veritable Pandora's box. I shall not go into the different scenarios that are opening up, because I have made my point. I shall not repeat my arguments about the different relationships between owners, hirers and drivers, but it is conceivable that the person who receives the notice may not tip off one of the other people involved. That person will suffer adverse consequences as a result. If the Secretary of State said that he had taken reasonable steps to ensure that the penalty notice was secured on each person, but that he had served it on only one person, he would be within the framework of subsections (4) and (5). The Under-Secretary will have to put the matter right. I am not saying that the amendment is perfect, but it would remove some of the ingredients of the recipe for trouble.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Clause 21 sets out the procedure for service of a penalty notice. Subsection (4) provides that service of a penalty notice on one of the responsible persons is taken to be service on them all. That is, however, qualified by subsection (5), which provides that the Secretary of State must take reasonable steps to ensure that the notice is served on all the responsible persons.
<P>
Amendment No. 193 would insert a requirement for the Secretary of State to serve the penalty notice on each of the responsible persons. Amendment No. 194 would alter subsection (5) so that failure to take reasonable steps to serve a penalty on a responsible person would mean that he would not be subject to the penalty.
<P>
In drafting subsections (4) and (5), we have tried to strike a reasonable balance between the obvious need for persons on whom a penalty is imposed to be aware of that fact and the practical difficulties which may arise in relation to complicated chains of ownership and control of transport, particularly when that is foreign owned or managed.
<P>
In most cases, the immediate service of the penalty notice will be on a driver of a vehicle or a captain of a ship. If that person is different from the owner or operator, he will normally be able to communicate the facts to the right people. Wherever possible, the immigration service will try to use those means to notify all responsible persons, but complicated chains of responsibility may mean that the driver is only partially aware of the facts.
<P>
If there were a failure to serve the penalty notice on any one of the responsible persons, amendments Nos. 193 and 194 would mean that the civil penalty would not apply to them. That would be an inducement to irresponsible organisations to take steps to obscure details of ownership, operators and agents so that if a civil penalty were imposed, it would in practice fall only on the driver of a vehicle or the captain of a ship. That would make one party more vulnerable than the others, and would clearly be undesirable. It would greatly reduce the deterrent effect of the civil penalty and enable people to evade their proper share of the responsibility for securing against carriage of clandestines. I urge the Committee to reject those two amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 198 proposes the deletion of clause 21(9). Subsection (9) concerns detached trailers, sometimes known as drop trailers. Detached trailers are used in very large numbers to transport goods to the United Kingdom. They are usually driven to a port as part of a normal lorry. The trailer is detached from the lorry and a special tug vehicle tows it on to a ferry. A similar tug removes the trailer from the ferry when it arrives in the UK. A UK-based lorry is then sent to pick up the trailer.
<P>
We recognise that the lorry driver who picks up a detached trailer in the UK can have no effective responsibility for any clandestines carried in it. Clause 18(5) and (6) acknowledge that point by providing for the responsible persons to be only the owner, the hirer or&#151;in the light of Government amendments Nos. 38 and 39&#151;the operator of a detached trailer.
<P>
Clause 21(9) makes provision for the service of the penalty notice in respect of detached trailers. Because of the special circumstances surrounding the transport of such trailers, the arrangement for service of a penalty notice cannot be the same as for other forms of transport to which the penalty notice will apply. The immigration service will make every effort to trace the owners, hirers and operators of such trailers, but the starting point will be the trailer left on the dockside, which may or may not bear identification markings. In such circumstances, a penalty notice should be served in the most effective way possible, without diminishing the force of the penalty's application and the incentive for those with an active responsibility for the trailer's security to take steps to ensure that it is not used for the carriage of clandestines.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 21(9) is intended to achieve that aim. It should enable the effect of the service of a penalty notice for a detached trailer to be the same as if the penalty notice had been served on the person concerned. That provision will trigger the power to detain the trailer. The amendment would delete clause 21(9), which would complicate considerably the service of the penalty notice and reduce the effectiveness of the regime with regard to drop trailers. Therefore I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 43 would require persons who object to civil penalty notices to give supporting reasons in writing.
<P>
Under clause 21(4), where there is more than one ``responsible'' person&#151;for example, an owner and a driver&#151;the service of the civil penalty notice on one such person will be regarded as service of the penalty notice on all such persons. However, the provision is qualified by subsection (5), which stipulates that the Secretary of State must ``take reasonable steps'' to ensure that the penalty notice is served on all responsible persons.
<P>
The principle behind subsection (5) is fair and reasonable, but amendment No. 42, which makes a necessary correction to it, would ensure that the duty of the Secretary of State to try to serve the penalty notice on all responsible persons applies only
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``while the penalty remains unpaid''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a sensible improvement to the civil penalty regime, and would avoid nugatory work, so I invite the Committee to accept the amendment.
<P>
The question arose whether a person who is unaware that a penalty notice has been issued can be liable for it, and the example of a parking ticket was cited. Let us consider a circumstance where the registered owner of a vehicle is issued with a parking ticket and a third party removes that ticket. As a result, the owner may not be aware that the ticket has been issued. If he were required to pay the penalty, he would doubtless be so informed. Although the registered owner may be unaware of the penalty, the offence would nevertheless have been committed, and he would remain liable.
<P>
If the Government were to seek to recover the penalty from a person who was initially unaware of the service of a penalty notice, they would have to give notice of their intention, and it would therefore be possible to inform the person concerned of the problem at that point. Indeed, he or she would need to be informed, otherwise the Government would not be able to recover the penalty. Standard court procedure would come into play, which incorporates safeguards such as the issuing of D notices, with which hon. Members who are lawyers will be familiar.
<P>
The issues are more straightforward than hon. Members suggest. Our amendment would clarify matters, but I regret to say that I cannot offer the same welcome to the Opposition's amendments as I offered to those in the previous group.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I shall pick up on what the Under-Secretary was saying. The issue of jurisdiction was discussed by the Committee last night. If a vehicle comes into the UK, it is within UK jurisdiction, and the driver will be penalised if he breaks the law. It takes some time to process a penalty notice&#151;all the facts need to be known&#151;and in the meantime the driver might return, for example, to Copenhagen. Presumably, notice would be served in Copenhagen, which is outside our immediate jurisdiction. Many of the drivers will not be resident in the United Kingdom&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am a little confused. Where it is possible, the driver will be issued a notice immediately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> That is helpful. A decision could therefore be taken virtually on the dockside, or in the vicinity of a port. Would the individual not be allowed out of the country until he had discharged that liability? Theoretically, he would still have his passport.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The person would not be detained in the United Kingdom. He would be issued with a civil penalty, which would be enforceable in the courts. We will discuss later whether the vehicle would be detained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I realise that I am straying, Mr. Stevenson, and I am grateful to you for allowing me some latitude. An individual who is caught in the UK can leave the country. I was therefore trying to establish whether we have any sanction against such an individual, without following him through foreign courts. If a vehicle is detained, that is helpful.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> Does my hon. Friend think it strange that the Under-Secretary has said that as soon as a driver is caught, the penalty notice will be slapped on? When we debated clause 18(5), it was made clear that the responsible person might be the owner, the hirer or the driver. Does not the Under-Secretary's remark mean that the driver will be the responsible person in nearly every case? The hirer or the owner will be served only when the driver cannot be served immediately with a penalty.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are discussing responsible persons, whatever the interpretation of that phrase might be. I am a little concerned by the length of interventions, which are becoming more like speeches. I would be grateful if hon. Members recognised that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East for his intervention.
<P>
Amendment No. 475, which we discussed with the previous group, deals with the language of a penalty notice. If somebody is caught in this country, that notice should be in English. If he had difficulty with the language or did not fully understand the implications, however, it would be helpful to provide additional information when the notice was served, in line with amendment No. 193. As for legal representation, people from abroad may not know their rights or rights of appeal. I am sure that further points will be made on that subject when we reach the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> When I consider the powers in this and other clauses, and the draconian powers that the Home Secretary is taking, I wonder whether there is an assumption that all lorry drivers are crooks. I can only conclude that the Home Secretary wrote the clause himself, on the assumption that all the drivers were Liverpudlians.
<P>
Subsections (4) and (5) are the subject of our amendments. Can the Minister explain the effect of subsection (5)? It is motherhood and apple pie; it is meaningless. Subsection (4) allows the Secretary of State to serve a notice on one person, and with joint and several liability that suffices as if the notice had been served on all responsible persons, any of whom can be prosecuted whether they have received the notice or not.
<P>
I can imagine how subsection (5) was built in. The draftsmen may have thought, ``Oh my God, subsection (4) is a bit draconian and powerful. We'd better put in something saying that the Home Secretary must behave reasonably''.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> Does my right hon. Friend realise that new Labour always has difficulty with clause IV unless it is weakened by other provisions?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will not respond to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Of course not. However, I am sure that my hon. Friend meant to refer to subsection (4) of the clause and not to any other document.
<P>
All Home Secretaries believe that they behave reasonably and that they are reasonable men, but they receive about 1,000 judicial review hearings a year, involving people who do not think that the Home Secretary has behaved reasonably. Admittedly, many of those hearings involve technical matters.
<P>
The Under-Secretary may point out that the clause states that the Home Secretary must take
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``reasonable steps to secure that the penalty notice is actually served''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
on those who are responsible. But what if he does not take reasonable steps? The Minister might reply, ``That is unheard of. Of course the Home Secretary will take reasonable steps. He is a decent gent and a reasonable man, and that is what he will do.'' However, the relevant decisions may be taken not by the Home Secretary but by his officials, and pressure of work may lead them to make mistakes. The number of maladministration cases that are heard each year suggests that that happens. Who will judge whether reasonable steps have been taken?
<P>
If the driver or the responsible person thinks that the Home Secretary has not taken the reasonable steps that subsection (5) requires him to take, what can the responsible person do? What is the point of subsection (5)? If the Home Secretary decides not to take reasonable steps, or fails to do so, what sanctions are available? None is, as far as I can see. The prosecution of people who may not have had a notice served on them will still go ahead.
<P>
Perhaps judicial review will function as a sanction, but that would require the driver or responsible person to say, ``I am sorry, Home Secretary, but I do not think that you bothered to take reasonable steps to serve the notice on the other responsible persons, and I am going to instigate a judicial review.'' If he succeeded in that process, what sanction would be applicable? The penalty notice would not be cancelled. The Home Secretary would simply have to think again, revisit the case and try to take reasonable steps to serve the notice. In many ways, the saction is meaningless. Subsection (5) is simply a piece of declaratory legislation that is meant to show how even-handed the Government are. They wil round up the responsible people, serve a notice on one of them&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Although the Home Secretary's reasonableness may seem obvious to us, a lorry driver may not take the same view. We shall presently discuss a clause that deals with the detention of lorry drivers' vehicles. In that regard, the Home Secretary may be deemed to have acted reasonably, even if the vehicle had been confiscated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> That is the point. I shall not discuss clause 22; the clause that we are considering relates to the procedure for serving penalty notices. However, we should bear in mind the fact that people on whom notices have not been served may lose their lorries under the provisions of clause 22. That is a draconian penalty.
<P>
The Government's justification for their approach seems to be that joint and several liability is involved. I understand that concept; it involves finding one of the people involved, serving a notice on him and washing one's hands of the matter. One would say, ``Well, it is up to you, now, pal. You must find and tell the owner or the responsible person that a penalty notice has been served on him.'' The Government would cease to have any further obligations, other than those contained in subsection (5)&#151;but that, as I have explained, is a meaningless and worthless piece of declaratory legislation.
<P>
We should deal responsibly with the hapless people involved on whom a notice has not been served under the terms of subsection (4). The amendment states that if a penalty notice has not been served on a person, he should not be liable. That would not let everyone off the hook, as the Under-Secretary suggested. The notice should be served on one person, and it is that person who should be liable. The others should not also be liable unless the notice has been served on them. Surely that is natural justice. I do not think that my hon. Friend's amendment would cancel the notice for the person on whom it had been served if he failed to notify the other parties. A notice that is served legitimately on one of the responsible persons, if proved, would stick. We are suggesting that the other people who have not had a notice served on them by the Secretary of State's officials should not be made liable unless the notice has been served. The liability is not just the &#163;2,000 fine, but the detention provisions in clause 22.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> A British haulier who has assets within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom may not have his lorry detained if he is caught and a penalty notice is slapped on him. However, a foreign haulier who has penalties against him will find that his lorry is stopped because he has no assets in the UK. Will not that cause problems with our EU partners, and with free trade?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that the point has been made. We do not want to stray into other clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I agree entirely. I was concluding my remarks, although I accept my hon. Friend's point.
<P>
We have not tabled amendments on all aspects of clause 21. I cannot touch on penalty notices until we reach clause stand part. Other crucial points, such as the Home Secretary's powers, will also need to be discussed to show that the Government's powers under subsection (4) are unfair and that subsection (5) is legally worthless.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been a good debate. My hon. Friends have made valuable contributions, and I do not want to weary the Under-Secretary by covering the same ground. I appreciate that his response was given in a helpful spirit. However, I should like him to clarify one or two points. He took us through what will happen when the Secretary of State gives notice to one party that he will be liable for a penalty. I listened carefully to what he said, but he did not clearly state what steps the Secretary of State will take to encourage one party to inform the other parties. Will the Secretary of State rely on one party to tell the others, or will he take reasonable steps in addition, as contemplated in subsection (5),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to secure that the penalty notice is actually served on each of those responsible persons''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be helpful to know what the period will be for the notice of objection under subsection (7). That should depend on how long the person has been aware of the penalty notice. I was a little concerned about the Under-Secretary's comments on subsection (9). He did not say that reasonable steps would be taken to ensure that every person was made aware. It should be a fundamental principle of procedure that if someone is being made liable for a penalty, he should be served notice.
<P>
I have one point to make about drop trailers. What will happen if the hirer of a drop trailer is one of the parties that the Secretary of State wishes to classify as a liable person, and his period of hire comes to an end before the penalty notice is affixed to the trailer? The Secretary of State will have to rely on the person who is the next hirer of the trailer, who has nothing to do with the clandestine entrance, to inform the original hirer. Is not that different from the case that the Under-Secretary made concerning someone taking a parking ticket from a car? I was bemused by that example. In any system, notice could go astray through the malicious intervention of a new third party. That could happen as easily with someone stealing the mail or removing a notice from a lamp post.
<P>
We are discussing what the Secretary of State will do to bring the penalty notice to someone's attention. Relying on one party to tell another may not be sufficient in every case. We want it to be a fundamental procedure that if someone faces a penalty as severe as those proposed in the Bill, he should be given notice of it. The proposition is simple and I want the Minister to clarify those points.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The trailer issue is easy to deal with. If the next hirer finds the penalty notice and the initial hirer, who may be liable, is not aware of it, nothing will happen until an attempt is made to enforce the penalty. At that point, the normal rules covering enforcement of civil claims will apply. The Secretary of State will need to inform someone against whom he seeks to enforce a penalty that he is doing so and, if the circumstances in which the notice is given are acceptable to the court, the enforcement may be applied for.
<P>
The matter is straightforward. The hon. Gentleman seems to assume that the Secretary of State could enforce a penalty when someone did not know about it. That would be difficult. The owner of the trailer would want to know where his trailer was, although he might take some time to notice that it was missing, given the way in which the industry sometimes operates. When enforcement takes place, the person against whom the claim is being enforced will, obviously, need to be aware of it. If he is not aware of it, the Secretary of State will be unable to enforce it.

 (8D) If a notice of grounds for mitigating the penalty is given before the end of the prescribed period, the Secretary of State must consider such grounds and determine whether or not to mitigate all or part of the penalty.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The effect of amendment No. 43 is that a person who objects to a civil penalty notice must give reasons in writing for objecting. Clause 21(6) provides that anyone who has had a civil penalty notice served on him, or is treated as having had the same, and alleges that he is not liable, may give written notice to the Secretary of State of the allegation. Subsection (7) stipulates that such notice must be given before the end of the prescribed period, which will be determined by regulations in due course. Amendment No. 43 alters subsection (7) so that it also requires the notice to give reasons for the allegation that the person is not liable for the penalty, rather than simply submitting a pro forma objection. The amendment inserts a reasonable requirement into the arrangement for disputing a civil penalty notice.
<P>
Amendment No. 44 is consequential on amendment No. 43 and makes it clear that the Secretary of State must consider all the contents of a notice of objection. That includes not only the objections, but the reasons for them. Clause 21(8) currently states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If a notice of objection''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
under subsection (6)
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is given before the end of the prescribed period, the Secretary of State must consider the objections and determine whether or not any penalty to which it relates is payable.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 44 alters that to replace the words ``the objections'' with ``it''&#151;that is, a reference to the notice of objection. That places on the Secretary of State a duty to consider the whole of the contents of the notice of objection, not just the objections, and that includes the reasons for the objections. That is fair.
<P>
Turning to amendment No. 195, the clause sets out the procedure for notifying people of liability to a civil penalty. Subsection (7) provides that when someone wishes to object to the imposition of the civil penalty, the notice of objection must be given.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``before the end of such period as may be prescribed.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 195 would insert a requirement that the prescribed period should not be less than one month from the time of service of the penalty notice.
<P>
I recognise that there may be advantages in setting a minimum timescale, but we may need greater flexibility than the amendment provides. If the Committee agrees, I shall consider further the possibility of an amendment after examining the technical drafting issues.
<P>
I turn to the final amendment in this group. Clause 21(8) provides for the Secretary of State to consider any objection as to liability given by a person on whom the civil penalty is imposed. The Secretary of State must then determine whether the penalty is payable. Amendment No. 197 would introduce a layer of considerable complexity into that process by introducing the concept of mitigation of the civil penalty for people who have admitted liability. The hon. Member for Hertsmere indicates assent and no doubt accepts that the amendment would insert complexity.
<P>
Under new subsection (8B), which amendment No. 197 proposes, someone who has admitted
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that he is liable for one or more, or all, of the penalties specified in the penalty notice but considers that there are grounds for mitigating all or part of the penalty''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
can give notice of that to the Secretary of State. Under the new subsection (8D), the Secretary of State must consider such grounds and decide whether to mitigate all or part of the penalty.
<P>
We have gone to some lengths to provide a proper system of defence against the civil penalty set out in clause 20. Clause 21 provides for people who object to the application of the civil penalty to give notice of that objection. In practice, that means people who believe that they have a defence under clause 20. Under clause 21(8) the Secretary of State is required to consider such objections and to determine whether the penalty is payable. It is therefore unclear what further benefit the concept of mitigation in amendment No. 197 provides. I presume that some kind of sliding scale of liability, whereby the level of the penalty is reduced proportionately, is envisaged.
<P>
The amendment is a recipe for confusion, delay, uncertainty and complex argument. It would generate considerable bureaucratic requirements, involving judgments about responsibility and the reduction in penalty appropriate to each. It would cause so many complications that the system would be unworkable. I see no sense in that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> In a moment. If a person's circumstances were such that one or other of the defences under clause 20 did not apply, no further issue of mitigation would be considered. Once liability is established and accepted, no mitigating circumstances will be taken into account. The amendment would give those who wished to reduce the impact of the civil penalty considerable scope for procrastination and delay. It would increase the cost of operating the civil penalty, and I therefore urge the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> How can the Minister reject the amendment on the grounds that it would create an unprecedented situation in which officials would have to make judgments about the culpability of the responsible persons? Other clauses that we have discussed allow officials to make judgments&#151;for example, on whether the system is run properly or whether there has been duress. Qualitative and subjective judgments will be made continuously. Surely it is possible to make a judgment on the penalty, according to the blameworthiness of the individual concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is being disingenuous. He knows that that is a recipe for long drawn out arguments about precise degrees of culpability and liability, which would make the system unworkable. It is not a matter of clear and straightforward decisions made by officials and courts. It involves setting up a complex system of judgment, liability, and mitigation, which would make it very unlikely that any two people would reach exactly the same conclusion. The system would become unworkable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was a little disappointed by the Under-Secretary's response. He knows that his response was disappointing; it was nonsense.
<P>
I think that the Minister was moving towards saying that the Bill should stipulate a period. He said that he wanted to consider technical drafting details. I took that as a move in the right direction, which I welcome. My suggested time scale of one month was intended to give people a reasonable amount of time to receive a notice. As I have heard more about how notices will be served on responsible persons, however, I have become more worried.
<P>
The system is more haphazard than I thought that it would be&#151;it relies on one party giving the notice to another party. I believe that the Minister said a few moments ago that the new hirer&#151;who would have nothing to do with the alleged clandestine entry&#151;would be relied on to hand the notice to the original hirer, who might be made liable for such a clandestine entry. The original hirer might not receive the notice at all, in which case the last amendment would be relevant. In relation to this amendment, the original hirer might receive the notice but only after time had elapsed, especially if a drop trailer had been left in a certain place for some time. If the notice comes into the hands of a new hirer, further time may elapse before it is sent on to the old hirer. That is the reason for the longer period that I originally had in mind. I shall give way to the Minister so that he can clarify the Government's intentions.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's purpose with regard to amendment No. 195. Unlike some other amendments, this one is not unreasonable. I shall consider its practical and drafting implications and write to the hon. Gentleman with my conclusions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary and I shall take the matter further, except to take issue with the second limb of his argument, which seemed to confuse defence and mitigation. He said that mitigation should not be made available because it would create confusion and inconsistency, and because defence will be available under clause 20. The Under-Secretary cannot have visited a magistrates court or a Crown court for some considerable time, because mitigation is made available in such courts every day of the week.
<P>
The Under-Secretary looks surprised, but he must be familiar with the concept of mitigation. Once a person has admitted to an offence and been found guilty, the question of mitigation is considered. In considering mitigation, a wide range of circumstances is taken into account, pertaining to the offence or to the character of the offender. In cases such as this, it may be reasonable to consider only the former, but exceptional cases may arise where the latter should be considered.
<P>
Whether the Government choose to describe the penalty as civil or criminal, some latitude is needed, because without a system of mitigation the penalty cannot take account of people who behaved in a public-spirited way by assisting those who were suffering or by co-operating with the authorities. Such people may prove liable because they are unable to fulfil every jot and tittle of clause 20(3).
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We debated earlier the issue of those who, in behaving in a humanitarian way, commit a worse offence than if they have behaved in a less humanitarian way by, for example, abandoning stowaways. Would the hon. Gentleman's amendment cover a circumstance in which an offender behaved in a humanitarian way and therefore deserved to receive a reduced penalty?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is a not unreasonable point, towards which I was moving. Someone who is deemed responsible for a clandestine entry may be unable to make a defence under subsection (3). Indeed, we believe that it will be difficult for someone so to make a defence, and the Under-Secretary must surely concede that not everyone will be able to do that. Some people who cannot avail themselves of such a defence will be liable. I was going to say that they would be technically guilty, but the guilty are guilty. However, the conduct of such people may be partially excused by certain circumstances, which should be considered, at least, by the tribunal that determines the penalty. Such penalties could be very large.
<P>
You missed the earlier part of our proceedings. Mr. Stevenson, when we debated the case of 103 illegal migrants who hid in a 40ft lorry. Under the provision, the person who brought those migrants into the country would face a fine&#151;not even a maximum fine&#151;of &#163;200,000, regardless of whether he behaved in a humanitariun way. In my book and yours, Mr. Stevenson, that is a punishment. It could lead to one's business going down the drain, one's house being put for sale and everything going to pot. There will be no way in which to relieve such a punishment, because the penalty for each additional clandestine entrant will be fixed.
<P>
I do not know the circumstances of the case in question, but tremendous humanitarian circumstances might have applied. 
<P>
Perhaps the lorry driver was placed in an invidious position and had to avert suffering or even loss of life. That is not far-fetched.
<P>
I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his response to amendment No. 195, but his response to amendment No. 197 will not do. He cannot get away with fudging the difference between defence and litigation. If that distinction is not clearly stated, lorry drivers will be treated even more unjustly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am getting increasingly worried about the provisions. When I first read the Government amendment No. 43, I assumed that although an administrative process was involved, evidence would be weighed in some way before a notice was slapped on a driver. However, the Under-Secretary said that the process would begin almost immediately. A driver will be interviewed, an immigration officer will come to a decision and the notice will be served.
<P>
The issue of notices will be pretty widespread&#151;perhaps it will be automatic, much like the issue of parking tickets. If they are slapped on, people will inevitably appeal. Government amendment No. 43 will allow people to appeal, but it states that they must give their reasons for doing so. However, the Government will not have to give their reasons for slapping on a notice.
<P>
We have considered the code of practice, what good practice means to lorry drivers, and what will happen if people admit to this, that or the other in an accident. Although a notice will be issued to a person, it will not be explained to him why it was issued. Self-evidently, people will have been found in his vehicle, but the Bill makes no attempt to weigh the lorry driver's case. When drivers or the relevant businesses appeal, they will have to give reasons.
<P>
I am concerned that Government amendment No. 43 tips the balance, once again, against the person who is caught in an invidious situation. When a notice is served on a person, what information will he receive from the immigration service? He will need such information to make a reasoned appeal. People who will have to give reasons for appeal should have access to some or all of the immigration service's information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman waxes eloquent on this subject, he should read clause 21(2)(a), which states that a penalty notice must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``state the Secretary of State's reasons for deciding that P is liable to the penalty''.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for drawing my attention to that paragraph, but what detail will that provision involve? If one fails one's driving test, one is usually given three or four reasons. No doubt a driver who is interviewed will give an explanation, which may or may not be given weight by the immigration officers. For the system to contain justice and fairness the lorry driver, the operator and any others who are caught in the net must have access to the relevant information, which will allow them to present a reasoned appeal and to have a proper discussion. The Bill simply contains a blanket draconian provision.
<P>
Government amendment No. 43 will tip the balance against natural justice. When a notice is issued, the firm concerned will not have the full picture. It may not get a straight story from the lorry driver, and it will not know what the clandestine immigrants told the immigration officers. The Government's approach is immediate and draconian. We should consider the principles of fairness and give the relevant information to firms against which notices are served.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> The more that the Under-Secretary explained his response to amendment No. 197, the more horrified I became. The draconian and intemperate views that he expressed must have come from him rather than from Home Office officials, who could not possibly have come up with such arguments.
<P>
The Under-Secretary's confusion of the defences in clause 20 with the litigation that clause 21 involves was extraordinary. In effect, he was saying to the accused, ``You had your chance to make your defence. We found you guilty, and the maximum penalty will apply.'' No court in the land operates on that basis&#151;courts give people the chance to make their defence, and if they do so successfully a penalty is not imposed. If they fail in their defence and are found guilty, a penalty is imposed&#151;
