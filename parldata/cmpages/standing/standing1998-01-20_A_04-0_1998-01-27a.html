<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Estelle Morris):</B> Before we broke for lunch, I was assuring Opposition Members, particularly the hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May), about our desire to accede to parental preference. I was also assuring the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) that we, too, were concerned about standards and did not consider smaller class sizes and raising the standards of teachers to be incompatible. I wanted to reassure the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) that we sympathised with his argument and that our unwillingness to accept the amendment did not demonstrate an unwillingness to see parental preference reflected in the plans.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) used a technical argument against the amendment. I assure members of the Committee that such a suggestion was not in the official briefing. My hon. Friend was right in that the word "recent" could mean several years; it could mean the previous year or the previous decade. Although such cases may be exceptional, I am sure that the right hon. Member for Charnwood can imagine instances when circumstances in an area have changed recently and current parental preference may not reflect recent parental preference.
<P>
Current parental views must influence the plans and I assure the right hon. Gentleman that we are making efforts to ensure that local parents are consulted on the plans. Our guidance will ensure that that happens. When the Secretary of State examines the plans, he will want to see that that exercise has been carried out.
<P>
Had we merely wanted to fulfil the pledge without any regard to the quality of education or parental preference, we need not have spent another penny on the provisions other than on transport costs. We could have merely instructed local authorities to move children from over-subscribed schools to those with classes of fewer than 30. I cannot give an exact statement that that would have been exercised at no extra cost, because such a proposal never entered the Government's mind. I ask the right hon. Gentleman to accept that the fact that we have put extra resources into the class-size pledge is an acknowledgement that we do not see the pledge being met merely by a transfer of children from popular schools to under-populated schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): I hope that the Under-Secretary of State will explain why the important point of parental preference cannot be written into the Bill. However, accepting for a second that it cannot, I wish to refer to clause 2(2) under which the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"statement shall ... take such form, as may be prescribed"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and to ask the hon. Under-Secretary if she is assuring the Committee that the Government will prescribe that local education authorities, in submitting the plans, must set out current parental preference as expressed, not as a general principle for the area, but for specific children in the context of clause 77 preference provisions?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I undertake that we shall require there to be consultation with parents. There may be a difference in that phrase and the wording used by the right hon. Gentleman, but I do not believe that there are millions of miles between us. We wish to ensure that parents are consulted about current plans. He might accept that we are offering parents more because it is a comment on current plans that will affect their children, not simply a reflection of decisions which parents took in the past, but which might not have been taken in new circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> There is a difference of principle between consulting local parents on the generality of a plan and requiring a local education authority to take account of the specific preferences expressed by parents under the provisions of clause 77. The sum of a series of individual decisions seems more important than inviting parents to express an opinion about a collective decision.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> As we said this morning, parental preference would be more properly debated under clause 77. I do not want to go that far; but I assure the right hon. Gentleman that it is our intention to consult parents and we do not intend to fulfil that key pledge by having local authorities fill empty places in unpopular schools.
<P>
I do not wish to fall back on the technical inadequacy of the amendment, but the familiar phrase "having regard to" will probably ensure a process, but not an outcome. The Government are ensuring the process of consultation, and one expects that parents will talk to local authorities about what they want for their children. The right hon. Gentleman will know that the phrase "having regard to" would ensure the process of considering parental preference, but would not ensure that those parental preferences were made part of the plan.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I shall have one more try. I seek to draw a distinction between a local education authority consulting the generality of parents about a draft plan[Mr. Dorrell]
and requiring the LEA, in drawing up that draft plan, to take account of or have regard to the preferences of individual parents expressed under the provisions of clause 77.
<P>
I am not asking the Under-Secretary to look forward to clause 77. Under the terms of that clause, a list will be produced of which schools individual parents would like their children to attend. I ask only that, in drawing up plans under clause 2, and under the prescription that the Government will set out on the form of the plan, LEAs should be required to take account of the specific preferences that will be expressed by parents about which school they want their children to attend. Will the Under-Secretary give an assurance that LEAs must take that into account in drawing up their plans?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is switching tense, which may be the cause of the problem. He used the future tense when he asked whether the local authority's list would reflect the preferences that parents "will" state on behalf of their children. The amendment talks about past preferences; but the assurance that I give the right hon. Gentleman and the Committee is that consultation with parents will take place.
<P>
There will be an opportunity later in our consideration of the Bill fully to discuss parental preference, but I ask the right hon. Gentleman to accept my assurance that we do not intend to ignore parents' wishes, nor merely to fulfil our pledge by filling empty places in underpopulated schools. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept those assurances and withdraw the amendment. If he does not, I shall ask the Committee to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> No, I am afraid that I shall not withdraw the amendment. It is important and I regret that the Under-Secretary has not responded to it. I accept that it may be defective, but the principle is important.
<P>
I have not muddled my tenses. I seek a relatively simple proposition. Under clause 77, parents will they do not now, because the clause is not yet law express preferences about which school they want their children to attend. The purpose of the amendment is to require LEAs, in drawing up the plans required under clause 2, to take account of recent or current expressions of parental preference under the terms of clause 77. That is the specific choice that individual parents have made about their children.
<P>
The Under-Secretary of State said that LEAs will have to consult parents about their plans. That is a completely different proposition, under which the LEA will draw up a plan and publish it as a process for local consultation. I do not belittle that as far as it goes, it is to be welcomed but it is a collective process. The LEA is not required to take account of specific preferences that are expressed by parents about where they want their individual child to go to school.
<P>
I am happy to withdraw the amendment if the Government give an assurance that, in preparing theplan for the Secretary of State, the LEA will have to take into account those expressions of individual preference. As I said during an intervention, clause 2(2) requires the statement to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"take such form, as may be prescribed".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government are taking the power to prescribe the form of the statements. I would prefer that the plans were specifically required under clause 2(2) to take account of individual parental preference, but I am prepared to withdraw the amendment if the Government assure us that the principle of parental choice will apply under the clause.
<P>
The Under-Secretary of State is consulting her colleague, so I am happy to go on talking until a collective decision can be reached and, if necessary, cleared through the appropriate channels. It is important that LEAs should take account of individual parental preference and, if the Under-Secretary assures us that they will have to do that under the prescription set out in clause 2(2), I will be happy to withdraw the amendment. If not, we shall press it to a Division.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I am keen to be helpful, as I honestly do not believe that there are millions of miles between us on the issue; there is a danger that we end up accusing each other of not being in favour of parental preference, when that is one issue that joins both sides of the Committee.
<P>
Will the right hon. Gentleman accept the assurance that, of course we expect local authorities to look at past patterns of admissions when dealing with future provision, as they do at the moment? LEAs are currently obliged in law to plan places within their area. Places cannot be planned unless one starts from where one is and, almost by definition, that means that one looks at where parents have wanted to go. Will the right hon. Gentleman accept the assurance that we expect LEAs, in drawing up their plans, to look at what happened to children at key stages 1 and 2 in years past, and that that need not be specified in the Bill? Other than that, I rest on the promise that parents will be consulted. We expect that, as in the past, admission patterns will inform local authority decisions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister and I do not want to press the amendment to a needless vote, but I do not understand why she cannot accept the principle that I am espousing. She says that LEAs must take account of the pattern of admissions. As we all know, that pattern is influenced by a variety of factors other than parental preference; as the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) said, and as we all accept, we cannot always accommodate first preference.
<P>
I want the LEA to take account in its plan of the basic preference expressed by a parent or a child, without reference to all the other factors. That is not to say that every parental preference can be respected of course it cannot. Nevertheless, LEAs should be required not only to consult parents, but to take into account the up-to-date expressions of parental preference for individual children. Why cannot the Government give that assurance?

</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Angela Browning </B>(Tiverton and Honiton): I beg to move amendment No. 65, in page 2, line 46, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(9) The Secretary of State shall not approve any statement prepared by a local education authority under this section which assumes that any child will travel to a school which is more than twice the distance from that child's home than the school which is nearest to the child's home.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 66, in page 2, line 46, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(10) The Secretary of State shall not approve any statement prepared by a local education authority under this section which provides that the average size of classes in junior schools or secondary schools in that authority's area is greater than it was in 1997.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 67, in page 2, line 46, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(11) The Secretary of State shall not approve any statement prepared by a local education authority under this section which provides that any infant school within its area would increase its occupation of temporary accommodation for a period greater than five years.".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Had we had a more satisfactory outcome to previous debates, we would have withdrawn this group of amendments by now, but sadly we still have concerns. I want to put our arguments for amendments Nos. 65, 66 and 67. Plans for reducing infant class sizes will ultimately be approved, amended or rejected by the Secretary of State. Therefore, given the previous debate in which we discussed how LEAs would submit their plans, we know that the Secretary of State is in an extremely powerful position he can change those plans, where necessary.
<P>
We already know that LEAs and this morning I referred to a submission from the leader of Somerset county council fear that they will not be able to deliver the Government's promise for them. Therefore, it is likely that when submitting their plans to the Secretary of State, LEAs will seek other devices by which they can deliver the promise of having 30 pupils to a class. They will try to find methods that will enable them to make good the shortfall in the resources that they have already said will arise.
<P>
Three issues especially concern us. First, children will be forced to travel long distances to take up existing free places, or they will be moved into classes of over seven-year-old children, which we debated this morning. Under amendment No. 67, we seek reassurance on the use of temporary accommodation to deliver the pledge. This morning, the Minister said that we shall hear more in later debates about how classes of, for example, 31 pupils will be split in two. Clearly, that involves not only teaching costs, but the capital costs of physically providing other classrooms.
<P>
I do not know about the experiences of other members of the Committee, but schools in my rural constituency are often offered surplus temporary classrooms, which other schools no longer require, when they need extra accommodation. I always advise head teachers to be rather cautious about snapping up those offers because, in my experience, they will have to use an already 20-year-old temporary classroom for another 20 years, and the school goes to the back of the queue for new, properly built classrooms.
<P>
The Government have promised to provide resources, so we expect them to honour their pledge to meet both the teaching and capital costs of new classrooms. We expect them to do so in such a way that schools do not suddenly find that they have to use rather unsatisfactory, temporary classrooms for a long period to meet the Government's pledge. I fear that that will inevitably happen.
<P>
Amendment No. 67 would put a time limit of five years on the use of temporary accommodation. If there are peaks and troughs in school applications, some schools might need such accommodation for a short time only. To prevent schools from finding themselves using inadequate accommodation for a long period just to honour the pledge, we have specifically asked the Government, through the Secretary of State's approval of LEA plans, to limit that time.
<P>
Despite the assurances that both Ministers have asked us to accept, nothing that we have heard so far gives us confidence that, in practice, LEAs will have the finances required to deliver the pledge. We seek through this group of amendments to protect children and their parents from long and unnecessary journeys we believe that that should be defined as twice the distance of the nearest school from the child's house to ensure that class sizes for those aged over seven are not increased to accommodate the pledge for five to seven-year-olds. We also want to restrict the length of time for which a school may have to accept what is deemed to be a temporary classroom, with all the attendant costs. I am sorry that we have to press the amendments to a Division; we had hoped to have more reassurance by now from the Government about what resources will follow their pledge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I am very glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) has tabled the amendments, especially amendment No. 66. When it was proposed to abolish assisted places which we will have an opportunity later to debate more fully we warned that, in some areas, phasing out assisted places would result in larger class sizes, especially in secondary schools.
<P>
For example, in this, the last year of assisted places, there are more than 400 assisted places in the Guildford[Mr. Nick St. Aubyn]
area. Clearly, phasing them out will put tremendous pressure on class sizes, especially those in our secondary schools in Guildford, Cranleigh and the surrounding area. Although they will receive additional money under the standard spending assessment, they will not receive any additional money to enable them to build the extra classrooms that will be neded to accommodate the extra children.
<P>
That is a serious worry not only for the LEA, which covers my constituency and others in Surrey, but for LEAs in other parts of the country. The Under-Secretary must be aware of that, because Members of Parliament from all round the country made that point during the passage of the iniquitous Bill to abolish assisted places.
<P>
It is most important that we debate the amendments, because they effectively draw out the weaknesses in the Government's whole thinking on how to reduce class sizes, and also in their assumption which I would like to say is naive, but self-serving is closer to the mark that by releasing funds from the assisted places scheme they will be able to reduce class sizes in the early years without a knock-on effect on secondary schools and on primary schools, to the extent that primary school assisted places have already commenced. They are robbing Peter to pay Paul.
<P>
I would be interested to hear the Under-Secretary's response. Does she believe that class sizes do not matter at secondary school? There are those in the education world who hold that small class sizes are very important in the early years, but less significant later on. The Under-Secretary should clarify her thinking on that. When LEAs try to live within the limits that her new regime will impose, they will need guidance. She can be sure that parents in my constituency and others like it will be interested in her answer to that point. They will not welcome it if they find that only a notional improvement in primary school provision which is all that it may be in our area, for example, where we already have small primary classes is offset by a change in the quality of secondary school provision.
<P>
In an area such as my constituency like many, it is concentrated in one town, but I represent more than 35 outlying villages it will also be of great concern if children have to travel a long distance to school in order to satisfy the Secretary of State's rigorous requirements. Again, a more flexible approach would accommodate a child's needs and would recognise that any benefits of being in a class of 30, rather than 32 or 33, could be offset by a far longer travelling time, which would reduce the child's quality time at home with the family, who may provide a great deal more personal supervision and support for his or her education.
<P>
I think that it is the single-mindedness of the Government's plan that raises the most hackles, as well as their seemingly blind indifference to the factors brought out by the three amendments: distance from home, the effect of the means by which the improvement is to be paid for on other schools in the area, and temporary accommodation. My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton was right to point out the problems with temporary accommodation. Such accommodation is not a cheap option and has not been budgeted for in the revenue from the assisted places scheme. We know that because their press release at the end of last year made it clear that the primary school class number changes would be paid for from the new deal for schools, as well as from the abolition of the assisted places scheme.
<P>
The Government have therefore revealed the weakness of their own argument; they said that the project would be paid for by the abolition of assisted places, but already they are saying that they have had to take money from their new deal scheme to make it stack up and that is just in the first year to support a change in funding of £22 million. How much more will have to come forward when the numbers increase?

<P>

<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): We intend to support amendments Nos. 66 and 67, but not amendment No. 65, which, as I believe most members of the Committee will agree, is fraught with danger. It would be very difficult to interpret it on the ground no pun intended and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.
<P>
Throughout our proceedings, we have been trying to make it clear that we are afraid that the costs of implementing the pledge at key stage 1 will be passed elsewhere. I do not want to repeat the arguments, but that is a danger and it is important that we continue to get concessions from the Minister in that regard. We are also extremely concerned I hope that the Minister can respond to the point that there is a growing feeling that the money from the assisted places scheme will not be sufficient to meet the costs of the proposals. If one takes the Minister's important statement this morning that some schools might, in order to overcome the problem of a 31st child, put in an extra teacher and provide an extra classroom, it follows that the cost of doing that in any significant measure would be great. Will the Minister say whether that has been fully costed, in the context of the Government's pledge to meet all the revenue costs from the abolition of the assisted places scheme?
<P>
We support amendment No. 67, as we believe that there is a great deal more to educating children at key stage 1 than having class sizes of 30. Simply to put children into any classroom that can accommodate 30 is not the answer. One of our concerns has been to reintroduce building regulations that ensured quality provision for children, especially at key stage 1 and in nursery places. That is why we support amendments Nos. 66 and 67.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</b> With respect, I think that some of the comments of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough might more properly be made when we discuss the next group of amendments amendments Nos. 68, 69 and 96 which deal specifically with the funding of the scheme in relation to assisted places. I do not want to prejudge that discussion.<P>
<P>
We do not intend to accept the amendments. As the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton said, our discussion has in some ways been a repeat of the arguments that we heard in Committee this morning and last week. I assure her that, when the Secretary of State considers the statements, he will want to see how each local authority deals with the issues that she mentions. However, it is not necessary to specify in the Bill those items rather than the others to which local authorities will also have to pay regard. That is not a proper way in which to proceed, but I assure the hon. Lady that the issues that she mentions are exactly the ones that the Secretary of State will want to consider when he is deciding whether to approve statements.
<P>
Our proceedings have been a good example of U-turn one week and U-turn the next week. Last week, we were very pleased to hear about the Tory conversion to an understanding that class size at primary level was an important factor. Today, we hear that class size at second level is also a factor. Better than that, we also hear that poor accommodation is not a good thing.
<P>
Many children in our constituencies are being educated in buildings of an unacceptable quality, as a direct result of decisions made by the previous Conservative Government. Already, within the first few months of coming to power, the Labour Government have committed more than £2 billion as new capital for schools over the Parliament. We have much to catch up with. The Tories left a terrible legacy of repairs that would cost £3 billion to £4 billion, and that does not include the cost of updating buildings, which will be necessary as we move to a new curriculum and new opportunities for children in the approach to the millennium.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I seemed to have stirred a flurry of activity on Opposition Benches.
<P>
<B>Mr. St Aubyn:</B> I just wondered whether the Under Secretary of State was prepared to admit that many of the problems that schools face arose from the gross extravagance and incompetence of Labour-run LEAs. Resources that could have been spent on improving school buildings have been squandered. Will she focus on the main question? Is it acceptable that one of the costs of delivering the Labour party election pledge will be an increase in class sizes in areas where children who would have benefited from assisted places will now have to be absorbed by the state system?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> We believe that the children who would have been on assisted places can be accommodated within the existing maintained sector at a marginal cost. We made that clear before the summer recess last year, during consideration of the Bill to abolish assisted places, and it remains our position.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford knows that we have always expressed our concern about class size, at every stage of education. The Conservative Government presided over increases in class size not only at the primary phase but at the secondary phase. They offered no protection for class size at secondary phase. I take objection to being lectured by the hon. Gentleman, who belongs to a party that, year after year, ignored the steady increase in class size and took no action to prevent it.
<P>
As to blaming Labour local authorities for the current state of some school buildings, the hon. Gentleman ought to learn the difference between revenue and capital. Local authorities require permission to borrow. It is more a consequence of the previous Government's complacency than of any local authority's extravagance, whether Tory, Liberal Democrat or Labour.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel </B>(South-West Bedfordshire): I take the Under-Secretary back to the £2 million capital expenditure. Is there a condition attached to it? Will local authorities be able to take that money only if they do something about surplus school places in another part of the county? In other words, are the Government expecting action on surplus school places in one area so that the money can be released for modernisation and expansion in another area?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> My hon. Friend the Minister made it clear that some of the capital available under the new deal could be bid for to accommodate the class-size pledge for five, six and seven-year-olds. However, a great deal of the new deal money is to be spent on the repairs that have built up in the past 18 years. It is clear that some of the money needed for capital repairs and to improve the condition of schools will be bid for by local authorities to help them with the capital expenses of meeting the class-size pledge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> In a throw-away remark, the Under-Secretary referred to an assessment of the backlog of maintenance work on school buildings of £3 billion to £4 billion. Would she put on record whether that is the Government's assessment of the capital backlog that exists in schools? I know that she will blame the previous Government, but I am not interested in the party politics; I am interested in the Minister's assessment of the capital backlog.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the Minister wishes to respond, I am sure that she will do so in the context of amendment No. 67, which deals with accommodation.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I am happy to return to the amendment. I have sat through many Standing Committees on the Opposition Benches, and a backlog of £3 billion to £4 billion was never denied by Tory Ministers. I assume that the Conservative party knows that there is such a backlog. As for an on-the-record answer, we have not done an audit, but the figure was not denied by the previous Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> My comments are directly relevant to amendment No. 67, because it is about reliance on temporary classrooms as a result of the class-size policy. The Under-Secretary referred to a capital backlog. I am familiar with figures being thrown around about the amount of maintenance backlog in various parts of the public sector, but the hon. Lady said that she did not want to restate that it was the Labour Government's assessment that that amount of money needed to be spent. Is a review being undertaken? If so, I do not see how the delivery of the pledge without placing undue reliance on temporary classrooms can be reconciled with statements about money of the sort that Ministers, including the Chancellor of the Exchequer, are prone to make. Is an assessment being undertaken to[Mr. Dorrell]
allow the Government to make the decisions that need to be made?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Local authorities are bound to make an assessment as they work out how to deliver the Government's pledge on class sizes in the primary sector. Local authorities will have to make an assessment in order to put their plans to us, and we shall fund the plans if we agree to them. By definition, that must take place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Under-Secretary knows that that is a matter of accumulating local budgets into a national budget, which the Chancellor of the Exchequer will have to take into account. Will the hon. Lady assure the Committee that the results of those local assessments will be brought together by the Department for Education and Employment, and the results published?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> My hon. Friend the Minister has already given an assurance that he will make clear in later debates how the capital side of the class-size pledge will be delivered. We have already made it clear that the revenue side will be delivered; the right hon. Gentleman should be satisfied with that. Frankly, interventions from someone who served in government and who left the school maintenance problem in its worst imaginable state 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Now we come to the party politics.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> No, it is not a party-political problem. We are talking about people's children being educated in schools that fall below the expected standard. The right hon. Gentleman may think that he is scoring party-political points, but the fact that he thinks that it is all about party politics is one of the reasons why the Conservative party secured so few votes and lost the general election.

<P>

<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I shall give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North (Ms Ryan), but I am keen to return the amendments as quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>Ms Joan Ryan </B>(Enfield, North): May I inform my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State and the hon. Members for Guildford and for Tiverton and Honiton that the Enfield local education authority area, of which my constituency is a part, has 30 temporary classrooms in its primary and secondary schools. About 23 of them predate the Labour local authority, which inherited the situation and which has now reduced the figure. That temporary accommodation has been in place for more than five years.
<P>
About 4,300 children would benefit now if class sizes were reduced to 30 or fewer and my constituents would consider it the utmost hypocrisy to hear the arguments of Opposition Members, who neither cared about the problem nor did anything about it, but who in fact worsened the situation when there were large class sizes of 38 and more and children were educated in temporary classrooms.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Enthusiasm for the Government's pledge is shared throughout all our constituencies by parents whose children are in classes that are too large.
<P>
I have made it clear that we do not want the detail, as outlined in the amendments, written into the Bill. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough rightly pointed out the shortcomings of amendment No. 65. I accept that the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton has a rural constituency, but children in urban constituencies, such as mine, live within 200 yards of one school and 350 yards of another school.
<P>
If we are talking about double the distance from the nearest school, we might end up with the position in which 200 metres or 200 yards is considered too far to travel. I am sure that the hon. Lady did not intend such a provision to be in the Bill, but I reassure her that the issue of travel from home to school will be a matter that we shall want in the plans.


<P>
We have debated class size and the effect on key stage 2 class sizes, and key stages 3 and 4 secondary class sizes. As part of the statement, we shall wish to monitor the pattern of class sizes outside key stage 1. All I can do is to repeat assurances that my hon. Friend the Minister and I have given already to the Committee: information from local authorities on such issues will be expected to be part of the statements and we do not anticipate the class size for key stage 1 to be met by an increase in numbers in other key stage class sizes.
<P>
Amendment No. 67 covers temporary accommodation. We should like to see the end of some temporary accommodation that is not adequate to meet needs. It has been a feature of schools for a long time and, again, it is one of the issues that the Secretary of State will want to examine in a statement. He will want to know what accommodation is being used and he will want to be given assurances that it is suitable. [Interruption.] I shall give way to the hon. Member for Guildford, and then I shall ask the Committee to resist the amendment if the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton does not withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way and for her assurance that she regards the effect on secondary school class sizes in constituencies such as mine as important and that she does not want the abolition of the assisted places scheme to cause an increase in class sizes.
<P>
Can she give an assurance that, if potential increases in class sizes in rural constituencies can be avoided only by building new classrooms in secondary schools, capital money will be made available over and above the standard spending assessment for each pupil so that those class sizes do not have to increase?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I am not prepared to give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. A situation could arise in which a class size increased by one. He has not said what size the class is or what size he would find unacceptable.
<P>
When we discussed the abolition of the assisted places scheme, we said that the needs of those children who might have gone into the independent sector funded by an assisted place could be met within the maintained sector at marginal cost. On those grounds, I am not willing to give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks, but I hope that the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton will withdraw the amendments. If not, I invite the Committee to reject them.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I should like to focus especially on two of the amendments. Amendment No. 66 concerns a point which the Under-Secretary has just been discussing: the question of the ratcheting up of classes above key stage 1 in order for LEAs to present the Secretary of State with plans that deliver his election pledge. Without adequate resources, LEAs will have to push children into older age groups or introduce the vertical groupings which were referred to this morning.
<P>
If the pledge is delivered, that will be a problem only for the first five years. If every primary school will eventually have 30 or fewer children in classes of five, six and seven-year-olds, after the first five years, when that first group of children reach key stage 2, presumably the numbers will automatically fall, with only a small degree of variation. The financial consequences to primary schools of the reduction in funding that will follow that is of course a matter of grave concern to them. Last week, a primary school in Dorset identified that the result of that process throughout a primary school would be funding for one fewer teacher.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
LEAs and schools are worried about how to meet the pledge in the initial years. That is why we have tabled the amendment; it will be a matter for the Secretary of State's discretion when he decides whether to approve a plan.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): The hon. Lady said a few moments ago that carrying over from key stage 1 to key stage 2 might mean that class sizes would then be below 30 with some exceptions. That is important; there could be exceptions. As she is proposing the amendment so eloquently, can she explain why she was not prepared to accept an almost identical amendment amendment No. 4, which I tabled, and which she argued against.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Because the resource implications are bad enough when only five to seven-year-olds are involved. When the hon. Gentleman moved his amendment to double that resource requirement by including seven to 11-year-olds, he gave no indication as to where the resources would come from it certainly would not be from 1p on income tax. It would be the parable of the loaves and the fishes gone mad if 1p on income tax were to accommodate class sizes of 30 for seven to 11-year-olds as well as everything else.
<P>
Primary heads are already concerned about that, because they envisage having to apply dogma that will reduce their resources and reduce the number of teachers in their schools. Perhaps it is the 800,000 spare places which the Minister constantly mentions [Interruptions.] Did I hear £2 billion on my left?
<P>
We cannot take the Liberal Democrats seriously they never cost things. Our amendment in no way supports their recommendation that the limit of 30 should be a statutory requirement for seven to 11-year-olds. The purpose of the amendment is to prevent the Government from fudging their pledge by accepting plans from LEAs, which will have a statutory obligation to serve their master, the Secretary of State, but will not have the capital investment or resources needed to provide extra teachers to achieve the pledge.
<P>
Amendment No. 67 concerns temporary accommodation. The Under-Secretary was pretty scathing about the previous Government's track record. The Under-Secretary and the Minister talk about new deal money from which the capital to provide all the extra classrooms will come, but can she confirm whether LEAs will have to provide an element of matched funding when they bid for that money?
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> No, they will not.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> LEAs are already saying that they do not think that they will be able to provide the capital resources in the form of new classrooms per se, so how equitable is the Government's proposal? For example, if it involves a bidding process, who will decide presumably, the Secretary of State who will and who will not have a new classroom? How fair will such decisions be for those who bid and are unsuccessful?
<P>
Presumably, as has been mentioned, some schools will have to empty all the books from their library to make an extra classroom; or, unlike other schools in the area that have new classrooms, will they have to accept old, temporary classrooms the huts, as they are known in the trade? We all know the problems and costs of maintaining huts they are poorly insulated and the water comes in. I have taught in them in adult education, and it rains on adults as well as children.
<P>
The point is how equitable will the policy be? It seems to me that every LEA will be required to deliver the pledge, yet some will have bright, spanking new classrooms, which will be very popular, but others will have to use huts. Under amendment No. 67, we want the Secretary of State, in looking at LEA plans, to say that where temporary classrooms are justified they should be allowed only for a certain period so that schools are not left with them for a long time.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): There is a limit to one's patience. How can a representative of a party that has kept children in temporary accommodation for decades in Norfolk stand here righteously talking about five-year limits? Why have we not heard talk of five-year limits for the past 18 years?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> We are talking about the Government's ability to deliver a pledge. It was not our pledge. The hon. Gentleman's party chose to make the pledge and, under the parliamentary process, it is right that we have an opportunity to question Ministers on how they will deliver it. What we seek to do under the amendments, including that on temporary accommodation, is nothing to do with what has happened before, but to do with ensuring that the Secretary of the State does not fudge the delivery of the promise. As each day passes, it becomes clearer that the pledge will be very difficult to deliver because the resources simply are not there. Therefore, it is right and proper that Conservative Members question Ministers and receive substantive answers from them.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Turner:</B> With respect, the hon. Lady does not listen to what the Ministers are saying. She has had reassurance after reassurance that the Government intend to keep their promise. I know that the Conservative party became used to Governments who never kept promises. However, will she not accept that, without having to pin it down in the Bill, my hon. Friend the Minister has on several occasions committed us to ensuring that we fund the promise? Attention must be given to the funding, not to what is written into the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is sincere when he suggests that, like him and his colleagues, I should listen to the Government's assurances and somehow think, "Oh well, that's all right then" but I do not have that confidence in them. I do not have that confidence not just because I represent the Conservative party, but because within a few months of the Government coming to office the things that they say and the things that they do are poles apart. I remember that in the heart of the election campaign, the Prime Minister denied that his party would ever apply tuition fees to students.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Search as I may, I cannot find anything to do with tuition fees for students in the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I take your point, Mr. Gale. I was just trying to explain to Labour Members that the Government's promises do not fall on the ears of Conservative Members with quite the acclamation that hon. Members would wish. I know that it is terribly disappointing that we cannot be all-inclusive, but I am sceptical about many of the Government's promises. It is my duty to flush out in Committee the detail of the Bill and, wherever possible, get commitments from Ministers. I am just doing my job.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am sorry now that I said that we would support amendment No. 67 because like the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk, I am getting increasingly frustrated. Accommodation for key stage 1 children is an extremely serious issue because we should not, wherever possible, accommodate children in temporary classrooms, particularly those that have been in place for 20 years or more. The hon. Lady is now trivialising the issue. I hoped that she would get from the Minister a commitment not only on the revenue consequences of providing more teachers in order to get classes down to 30, but on accommodation and the phasing out of temporary classrooms. I hope that the Minister will still respond to that, which is why we will continue to support the amendment, despite the hon. Lady's protestations.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The hon. Gentleman will have heard me being baited, for want of a better word, to join in 
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Do not rise to the bait.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I shall try not to.
<P>
We are concerned about the distances that children have to travel, but we have not had the reassurance from Ministers on amendments Nos. 66 and 67 for which we were hoping. I would therefore like to press them to a Division at the appropriate time. I beg to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have been asked to call a Division on amendments Nos. 66 and 67 on the basis that amendment No. 65 has been withdrawn; that amendments Nos. 66 and 67 deal with different subjects; and that both opposition parties have stated that they would like to vote on them. I shall therefore permit that. However, I want to make it clear that the Chair deprecates the cherry-picking of votes on groups of amendments. It will not become a custom in the Committee.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I said in the debate on amendment No. 5 that I had considerable reservations about clause 2, because it seemed to represent the first example of a trend that will repeat itself through the Bill. that over-centralising trend will mean power being taken from local decision makers and vested in the Secretary of State, who will thus have the power to consider local education authority plans, seek amendments to those plans and take to himself the responsibility for ensuring that, once agreed, plans are implemented. I explained why that system is not consistent with this country's tradition of school management. That remains my major reservation about clause 2.
<P>
During our debates on clause 2 we discussed several amendments, all moved on the basis that if we were to have an over-centralised model, the founding clause should set out some of the principles that we seek to see applied by the Secretary of State.
<P>
Amendment No. 64 secured the support of the Liberal Democrats. It proposed that if we were to have an over-centralised system, the Bill should provide that local education authorities must take account of individual parental preferences. In return for an undertaking to withdraw the amendment, I pressed the Minister to give a commitment that if it was not included in the Bill it would be included in the guidance issued by the Department to local education authorities about how the plans should be drawn up. The Minister was not prepared to give that commitment. That was one example of how we sought to confine the over-centralised discretion that the clause vests in the Secretary of State.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton pressed two other amendments to a Division; again, both secured the support of the Liberal Democrats. In the first amendment, we wanted to ensure that the implementation of the plans would not cause a rise in class sizes about the infant age range. In the second, we wanted to ensure that there was no increased reliance on temporary accommodation. Both amendments sought to include in the Bill important principles that the Secretary of State should be required to consider if he is to be vested with those over-centralised powers.
<P>
Several Labour Members leapt to their feet to discuss the state of the classroom stock inherited from the previous Government. While my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton was replying to Labour Back Benchers, I was wondering why, if they are really concerned about over-reliance on temporary classrooms, they do not want to include in the Bill at least the requirement that there should be no increased reliance on temporary accommodation.
<P>
We did not seek an assurance or a commitment from the Government that large steps should be taken to reduce reliance on temporary accommodation. The amendment reflected the concern expressed by Labour Members, which is felt in the teaching profession and throughout the education system, about over-reliance on temporary classrooms. In the context of that threat, the amendment merely sought that the Bill should include a requirement stating that the increased use of temporary classrooms was not an acceptable way to deliver the class size pledge contained in clause 1.
<P>
Each of those three amendments sought to confine the way in which the Secretary of State could use his over-centralised powers, so that he could deliver something that we believe is desirable the protection of parental preference, protection against an increased reliance on temporary accommodation, and protection against the risk that delivering smaller class size for five, six and seven-year-olds would create large class sizes for older children.
<P>
The Under-Secretary's response to each of the three amendments was the same. She assured us of her good intentions. She said that she did not want increased reliance on temporary accommodation, that she wanted local authorities to take account of parents' views and that she did not want larger classes for older children. However, she is not prepared to write any of that on the face of the Bill, to confine the way in which the Secretary of State will use the discretion granted to him under the clause. She argued that we must trust her good intentions and that the Secretary of State would use his discretion in such a way as to reflect those good intentions and the Committee's desires.
<P>
Government Back Benchers should not find the response of my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton to that proposition controversial. It is part of the function of Back Benchers, not just from the Opposition, but from all parties to ensure that the Government are held to account in the House of Commons. That will not happen if we give Ministers large, untrammelled discretionary powers and leave them to do their best that is not parliamentary accountability.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk challenged my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton to dispute the proposition that the current Government will be better at delivering their pledges than other Governments, whether Labour or Conservative. I do not want to enter into short-term, head-to-head arguments with individual Ministers; I simply invite the hon. Gentleman to reflect on the record of Governments of all political complexions over a long period. It is never against the interests of Back Benchers or Front-Bench spokesmen to write into a Bill the detailed policy prescriptions that they want the Government to deliver.
<P>
The Under-Secretary of State and the Minister even the Secretary of State for Education and Employment may have the best of intentions, but the Government have to make a series of choices. The preferences and priorities of the ministerial team at the Department for Education and Employment do not always carry the day when Her Majesty's Treasury have to make crunch decisions. I speak as a former Tory Minister; dirty business is, on occasions, done at the crossroads. The Ministers in the DFEE, as is a matter of public record, have already been and no doubt will be again before the Government leave office the victims of such dirty business.
<P>
The Minister for School Standards looks quizzical, but he should remember what his colleague, Baroness[Mr. Dorrell]
Blackstone, said in another place. She made it clear that she wanted the money

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Is this relevant?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> It is relevant, Mr. Gale. It concerns ministerial discretion, which is the subject of the clause. Baroness Blackstone made it clear that she wanted the money from student fees to be invested in higher education, but the Treasury told her that she could not have it.
<P>
<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> We did not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister may not have said that, but his noble Friend made it clear that she wanted the money and the Treasury would not have anything to do with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> With good reason.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> With good reason, the Minister may think; no doubt we shall debate that another day.
<P>
The clause stand part debate gives the House of Commons, through one of its Committees, the opportunity to write on to the face of the Bill three important principles. Both the Conservative party and the Liberal Democrats believe that the Committee should take that opportunity. As I said, the Conservative party does not approve of an over-centralised planning system that vests discretionary powers in the Secretary of State. If such discretionary powers are to be vested in the Secretary of State in an over-centralised planning system, however, let us set out in the Bill the important principles that we think he should bear in mind when he exercises those powers.
<P>
The Government want the discretionary power to intervene in the affairs of a local education authority. They are resisting every suggestion made by Opposition Members that would confine the discretion of the Secretary of State. That is wrong in principle; it is bad law making and it is why we shall oppose the proposition that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I applaud the points made by my right hon. Friend. I wish to point out the inadequacy of clause 2. It is based on a purely mechanical quantitative approach, as if a reduction in class sizes will act as a deus ex machina, raising school standards and the performance of the pupils. The clause ignores evidence which is supportive of smaller class sizes in the younger age groups and which shows how important it is that advantage is taken of the smaller class sizes to adapt education methods and techniques.
<P>
Some research material that has been referred to makes it clear that if class sizes are reduced, but advantage is not taken of the opportunity to change and improve techniques if the quality of teaching does not do so very little will be achieved. In fact, research has shown the benefits of whole-class teaching. There are many enigmas in the process that the Government want for the education system. I hope that the Minister will answer my questions. What do you see as the role of whole-class teaching? Do you regard the measure as a move away form whole-class teaching, because there will be smaller groups? Unless you can answer that point 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Once is bad enough. To use the word "you" three times is too much. I do not propose to respond.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am sorry, Mr Gale. It is not clear how the Government's simplistic plan will deliver a result. If the point of smaller classes is to increase the variety, the breadth and richness of the curriculum, is it not a contradiction that at the same time as a movement towards smaller class sizes comes the announcement that the national curriculum for that age group will be simplified?
<P>
I refer to a letter written by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority of 13 January 1998 to all education authorities and other consultees in England. It states:
"Primary schools will be required to maintain a `balanced and broadly based' curriculum, but no longer required to follow the programmes of study in the six national curriculum subjects".<P>

<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton intervenes, I must inform the Committee that the debate is going wide of the mark.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I apologise, Mr. Gale, but my point is that a clause that prescribes that LEAs should reduce class sizes, but does not have a corresponding understanding of the implications of that reduction for teaching is inadequate. Why do not the Government take account of alternative methods of delivering small class sizes? Will they consider schemes such as we have in north Guildford, where a new literacy programme has been piloted for children in the age group who have particular reading difficulties. It involves people who do not have teaching qualifications, but who have expertise and understanding and can help the children with their reading. Such an exercise is proving helpful; it is outside the ambit of a reduction in class sizes, but it is an important part of raising standards in schools. Will the Government take account of such initiatives?
<P>
If all the emphasis and focus of a local education authority is based on reducing class sizes, is not there a danger that that will be at the expense of other important initiatives? I am sure that the Under-Secretary is better versed than I am in such matters, but she must know that other techniques such as peer tutoring may be effective in improving reading standards.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> No, I will not take an intervention at this point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is in danger of turning his remarks into a Second Reading speech. He must stick to clause 2 stand part.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I will try to finish my remarks quickly, Mr. Gale.
<P>
How can the Government justify imposing the burdens contained in clause 2 not only on LEAs, but on governors, many of whom are already finding the burdens of the education system hard to bear? The Government are taking an entirely mechanical, quantitative approach to the problem of raising class standards and ignoring the wider issues of the quality of teaching and of teaching methods and techniques.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> The hon. Member for Guildford has demonstrated clearly the danger of expanding what is included in the Bill, and why we have resisted that for much of the debate on clause 2. He suggests writing into clause 2 something about teaching techniques, about whole class teaching and about peer counselling and mediation. I am interested in all of that and I am in favour of most of it but clause 2 is about preparation of statements by local authorities to be submitted to the Secretary of State outlining how they intend to meet the Government's key pledge of ensuring that five, six and seven-year-olds are in a class of fewer than 30.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I will give way, but I shall probably resist answering questions about peer counselling or the other matters that the hon. Gentleman has already raised.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall resist them being asked.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for giving way. I am sure that she did not mean to misunderstand me. My point is that to make clause 2 the key to elevate the one issue of class size and ignore other important issues is to get education policy out of proportion. The Government must consider the many competing needs that an LEA must take into account in deciding what is the best way to raise standards for children.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I can assure the hon. Gentleman that this is but one clause in a Bill of more than 100 clauses, and the Bill itself is only one part of the Government's strategy for raising standards for children in schools. The suggestion that we should write all that into the Bill would horrify the Whips, because we would end up in Committee not just until Easter, but way into the summer.
<P>
Clause 2 is an important part of chapter 1, which is about delivering the class size pledge. The clause is about local authorities preparing statements for approval by the Secretary of State, so that funding can be provided. I assure the Committee that many of the issues raised are of concern to us as well. We do not want them to appear in the Bill, but they must be addressed in statements; they are issues that the Secretary of State will want to consider. We will shortly be consulting on the contents of statements. We look forward to statements being proposed by local authorities so that we can take the next step in ensuring that the Government deliver the pledge we made to the electorate on 1 May.
<P>
We have had a lengthy consideration of the amendments tabled to the clause. It is an important part of the Bill a crucial part of the first chapter, which deals with class sizes.

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I wonder whether you could explain that ruling. I am well aware that you have expressed concern about cherry picking, but looking at the selection list I note that many different issues will be dealt with under the group of amendments that begins with Government amendment No. 76. Indeed, I would argue that amendment No. 96 is of a different order from amendments Nos. 68 and 69.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The selection of amendments is a matter for the Chair. The honourable Gentleman has been a Member long enough to know full well I make this point very firmly to all members of the Committee that it is possible to make representations about selection before a sitting. I am not prepared and neither is my co-Chairman to have amendments cherry picked.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The purpose of the amendments is slightly different, although, if the Committee divides, I should be perfectly happy to take a decision on both principles together. Perhaps the Government can respond on the first principle in a way that would make even a debate, much less a Division, on it unnecessary.
[Mr. Dorrell]
<P>
I was struck on reading clause 3 by the fact that it does not require any extra money to be provided to local education authorities to deliver the Government's pledge. The purpose of amendment No. 68 is, therefore, extremely simple the word "may" would be replaced by the word "shall". I simply do not understand why the Government are seeking not only discretion, such as that debated under clause 2, but to leave open the question of whether there should be any regulation to provide extra money to LEAs to cover the costs of redeeming the class size pledge under clause 1. I would have thought that intrinsic to the Government's election pledge.
<P>
During the general election, we were told that the Government planned to abolish the assisted places scheme and redirect the money saved to LEAs to secure the delivery of the class size pledge. I shall deal in a moment with the assisted places scheme and the fact that the Government's sums do not add up. Leaving those matters to one side for the purposes of this debate, the proposition in amendment No. 68 is not that those two matters should be balanced as an entity, but that provision should be made by regulation for the Secretary of State to pay grants to LEAs. The Bill should oblige the Secretary of State to make such payments, rather than simply empowering him to do so.
<P>
The Bill does not require the Secretary of State to deliver his election pledge. It comes back to the point that I was making on the previous clause stand part debate whether the Committee should be satisfied by the assurances, which the Government will undoubtedly offer, that they intend to keep their promise, or whether we should impose on the Government an obligation to deliver the money necessary to meet the class size pledge and the obligations under clauses 1 and 2.
<P>
I simply ask Ministers why the Government need to preserve unto themselves the option of not making regulations to provide for those payments? Under what circumstances do the Government consider it apppropriate not to use their power under clause 3? Why should it be left as a discretionary power and why did not the Government bring forward a Bill that specifies that regulations will make provision for payment by the Secretary of State? If the Government seek a discretionary power rather than a duty, they must tell the Committee under what circumstances they do not intend to use the power granted to them under clause 3. That is the first question raised by the group of amendments: why do the Government seek a power rather than a duty when it is the universal expectation in the local education world and, I am sure, among the Minister's Back Benchers that the Government are taking the power in order to use it? In what circumstances do the Government envisage not using the power? If there are none, why do not the Government impose a duty on themselves rather than simply taking a power? I hope that those questions are uncontroversial, at least for Opposition Members.
<P>
The purpose of the second amendment is to bring the Government back to the nature of their election pledge. They committed themselves to a programme of reducing class sizes which they repeatedly asserted, under fire, could be financed through the abolition of the assisted places scheme. With some shifting of position, that remains the essence of their position, at least in regard to the revenue costs. All the detailed analysis carried out by outside research bodies calls the Government's arithmetic into question. I have not read an independent piece of research that suggests that the Government will be able to meet the full cost of delivering clauses 1 and 2 from the net revenue derived from the abolition of the assisted places scheme. As I understand it, the Government's published estimates of that gross revenue assume that almost none of it will be diverted back into the maintained sector for pupils who would otherwise have benefited from assisted places, and that almost all of it will be available to cover the cost of delivering the class size pledge. At the very best, that seems a highly questionable assumption. However, even if we accepted it, the research suggests that there is still an unmet cost particularly for the provision of extra classrooms to meet the class size pledge. The Government appear to have conceded that point, although I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say, because the Government's initial position was that the whole cost of the class size pledge could be met by the abolition of the assisted places scheme.
<P>
The class size pledge has been slightly adjusted; it is a bit like the famous mug trick with the national health service waiting list. The Committee will remember the famous five mug trick in regard to the evolution of the pledges, one version of which found its way on to the pocket card. Mugs with different versions of the waiting list pledge were sold at different Labour party conferences. As far as I know, mug collectors have a smaller collection of mugs with the class size pledge than of those with the waiting list pledge, but the principle is the same. The Government began by saying that the money saved from the assisted places scheme would be sufficient to pay for the delivery of the class size pledge, but we are now told that the money saved from the assisted places scheme will meet only the revenue costs associated with the class size pledge. That is a different position from the one that the Government adopted when they sought election last year. The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk, who believes every word that issues from the mouths of Ministers, might ask himself on which version of the pledge he wants to build his castle of belief. Whichever is it, he will find, I suspect, that it is built on sand.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> When I was chairman of the education committee in Norfolk, I had the foresight to write to the Secretary of State. I received copies of research that he had carried out into what he would fund, and was given the reassurance that there would be separate provision for capital in a county such as Norfolk. During the election, I fully anticipated what Ministers are now telling me, so I am happier with the reassurances than the right hon. Gentleman is perhaps he was not listening to what the Government were saying.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I can understand that the hon. Gentleman may feel reassured to have had advance knowledge of the Government's shift in position, but I am not sure that that should inspire the rest of us with great confidence. The fact that he knew that the Labour Government would adopt a different position from that of the Labour Opposition does not seem to be a good enough reason for Opposition Members to attach credence to the words of Ministers.
<P>
<B>Dr. Turner:</B> The difference of which I was made aware was that between revenue and capital. When one is in government, be it local or national, one must be concerned about both.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Of course, the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Let there be no doubt that, before the general election, Labour spokesmen were repeatedly asked whether the abolition of the assisted places scheme would meet the full cost capital and revenue of delivering the pledge on class sizes; repeatedly, they said that it would. They may have said something different to the hon. Gentleman, which is all very fine, but they told the rest of us that abolition would meet the full cost. That is why I draw attention to the fact that the Labour party has shifted its position.
<P>
Today, the Minister's position seems to be that the savings from the assisted places scheme will be sufficient to pay for the revenue cost of meeting the pledge on class sizes. Will he confirm whether that is true? If it is, he should accept amendment No. 69, which would underwrite the principle on which the Government are now building that the money disbursed to deliver the pledge on class sizes under the duty in clause 3 should not exceed the amount specified by the Chancellor of the Exchequer as that saved through the abolition of the assisted places scheme.
<P>
I want to tie the Minister to that because when people first heard the pledge and the arithmetic that lay behind it, they were repeatedly told not to worry because money would be diverted from other elements of the education budget to deliver the pledge. They were told that the pledge on class sizes could be dealt with as an issue divorced from the rest of schools funding, with the exception of the assisted places scheme. They were offered a straight trade-off: "If you don't like the assisted places scheme and you think that the money would be better spent on class sizes, that is the policy that Labour will pursue."
<P>
The Labour party did not say that the policy on class size at infant schools should pre-empt money that money that might be used for other education priorities quite consciously, the Government did not make that proposition. We were repeatedly told that no choices would have to be made as the pledge would be paid for by the abolition of the assisted places scheme. That principle should be written into the Bill because it was an intrinsic part of the Labour party's election. The Government should reassure people in other parts of the education system that the money that they are expecting to pay for junior, secondary, further and higher education is not at risk that money will not be removed from the delivery of their desirable objectives to implement the pledge on class sizes.

<P>

<B>Ms Beverley Hughes (Stretford and Urmston):</B> Is the right hon. Gentleman prepared to tell those schools that need capital to fulfil the pledge on reduced class sizes that they should not receive that money, despite the fact that the Government have identified where it will come from?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> On the contrary, I have said repeatedly during the past few months that I recognise that the Government have added roughly £200 million to the 1998-99 resources available for schools education which the previous Government did not leave in the education budget. As for the famous £835 million, that trick has been performed by Chancellors of the Exchequer since the dawn of history the previous year's contingency reserve is reallocated to the things that it was always likely to be spent on anyway. I do not accept that that is extra money over and above what the previous Government would have provided.
<P>
Earlier, I noticed on the annunciator screen that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, was contributing to the debate on the countryside no doubt in his usual spirited style. On a previous occasion, he made it crystal clear that the Government's £835 million for education was exactly what he would have provided if he was still Chancellor of the Exchequer. There is no dispute between the parties the Government have done exactly what my right hon. and learned Friend did when he reduced the contingency reserve and spent the money on health and education. The sum of £835 million is not a matter for political debate.
<P>
The Government raised £200 million through putting extra tax on the utilities and imposing a windfall profits tax. The Minister should not look quizzical the Chancellor of the Exchequer has made it clear that the extra billion pounds over five years for education is financed out of the tax on pensioners fuel bills. The £200 million for education is extra, but the rest of the money is what was coming anyway.
<P>
In answer to the question of the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston (Ms Hughes), I freely concede that the money to which she referred is extra money. It is money that will be needed, and I suspect that next year the bulk of it will be used to deliver the pledge. Sadly, schools elsewhere in the system that think that the extra money will allow them to deal with some of the temporary classroom issues will be disappointed. Once we examine the capital cost of delivering the programme under the Bill, we shall see that it will deal with the lion's share of the pensioners fuel bill money that will come into education.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will demonstrate the good faith of the Government, as the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk clearly expects him to do, by slightly limiting his discretion and accepting that the measure should be a duty on the Government. If the Minister does not accept that, I hope that he will accept the constraint of delivering the Government's election pledge and not put the rest of the education budget at risk, but instead insist that the cost of meeting the policy under clauses 1 and 2 is met by the savings from the assisted places scheme because that is the policy that the Government put to the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> We have some difficulty with the group of amendments. We support amendment No. 68, tabled[Mr. Willis]
by the right hon. Member for Charnwood, because his analysis of the situation was right. If the work "may" is left in the Bill, there will be no need for regulation. That clearly would be unacceptable and we hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.
<P>
Our difficulty is with amendment No. 69, on which the right hon. Gentleman made an almost flawless presentation. We listened with tremendous admiration to the logic of his argument and the way in which he presented it. However, we cannot support the amendment because it would limit the Government's power to make more money available for the execution of their promise if insufficient funds were raised from the assisted places scheme. We agree with the right hon. Gentleman that there is not enough money. It has already been conceded that the capital will go somewhere else and will, for example, be funded from the new deal.
<P>
The Minister has not yet spoken about training the extra teachers. I should be grateful he would respond to that question. We estimate that about 16,000 additional teachers will be required to meet that pledge. We are delighted at the expansion in the number of teachers at that level. However, the costs not only of employing those teachers, but of seeing them through teacher training colleges and universities is significant, even if each student has to pay £1,000 towards their tuition fees in each of the first three years.
<P>
We believe that the assisted places money will be insufficient. We therefore expect that the Government will have to find additional resources to fund their pledge. We believe that the pledge is crucial to a long-term improvement in standards in our education system. We do not want to fetter the Secretary of State or the Minister in their delivery of that pledge, but amendment No. 68 says that they will have to live within that sum, which is why we shall not support it.
<P>
We shall not press amendment No. 96. Our difficulty with this group of amendments, Mr. Gale, is that we are for one, against another and do not want to press the third. It is a probing amendment. We want to ensure that the money coming into our schools through the regulations the assisted places money or through the LEAs will not be subjected to a constant year-on-year bidding system. Schools and many local authorities are fed up to the back teeth with having to bid for resources every year.
<P>
There should be some certainty in forward planning. For instance, schools that want to employ quality staff on permanent contracts must have more than one year's leeway; they must be able to plan well into the future and should not be subject to the vagaries of the LEA having to win resources in an annual bidding system. We tabled amendment No. 96 because we wish to discover whether the Minister envisages a time when the bidding will stop, when the resources whether from the assisted places scheme or elsewhere will meet the pledge; or is it intended that that money will go into the revenue support grant?
<P>
Mr. St. Aubyn: I will not detain the Committee, but I feel strongly that we need some answers from the Minister about amendment No. 69. When the Bill to abolish assisted places was going through the House, a statutory requirement was proposed that we should be told every year what the savings were. That was rejected by the Government.
<P>
I am pleased, however, that in a press release on 17 November 1987, the Minister for School Standards announced that £22 million would be available in the first year after abolition. Is it his intention every year to announce how much is to be saved in that year from the abolition of the assisted places scheme? In that press release, the Minister referred to the ability of local authorities to apply for capital funding from the new deal for schools to carry out related building alterations. Is it his intention to extend such an invitation every year? Will he tell the House how much of the new deal for schools budget will have to be allocated each year to meet that additional capital funding requirement?
<P>
Will the Minister also remedy an omission from that press release? What additional capital spending will be allocated year in and year out to pay for the absorption of pupils who would otherwise have been on the assisted places scheme in secondary schools, in particular but who will now enter the maintained sector? As we have already said, there will be a knock-on cost in the form of additional capital spending if class sizes in secondary schools are not to rise significantly in certain areas as a result of the abolition of the assisted places scheme.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Hon. Members may remember that when we discussed the sittings motion, we made it clear that when amendments were moved that we felt had merit and would improve the Bill, we would have no objection to accepting at least the principle underpinning them. When the right hon. Member for Charnwood moved amendment No. 68, he made a good point which we are prepared to accept. We are concerned about the detail of the wording, as is always the case with these matters [Hon. Members: "Why?"] Because the wording needs to be consistent with clause 1.
<P>
I think that it would complement the changes outlined by the right Hon. Gentleman if we were to place a duty under clause 1 as well, instead of the discretion that is presently provided. On Report, we will table amendment to both clause 1 and clause 3 that will remove the discretion from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State I am sure that he will not mind that on this occasion and place a duty on him instead. Having accepted the point made by the right hon. Gentleman when speaking to amendment No. 68, we will table amendments to reflect that.
<P>
Amendment No. 69 is very important and I want to deal with the points raised in the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Before the Minister leaves the change from "may" to "shall", why will he not simply accept the amendment this evening on the basis that on Report he will change the wording of clause 1?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> With respect to the right hon. Gentleman, we will need to consider the precise wording. I am sure that given his experience, he will understand why I am being cautious about agreeing to his wording. I have not received advice from officials. Politically, I want to support the principle of the amendment, but I want to talk to officials about how we can word an amendment that meets the right hon. Gentleman's requirements and ours. That is why I am cautious about endorsing this wording if we can use it, we will do so and I will compliment him on his draftsmanship. It makes sense to consider clause 1 and clause 3 together and we will have a better Bill as a result, which is want we want.
<P>
On to amendment No. 69, for the information of the hon. Member for Guildford the class size pledge did not suddenly emerge from a dark corner of Millbank tower I spent most of the general election campaign in Millbank tower it had already been made. When I took up this ministerial post, not having had responsibility for education before the general election, I asked; "Does this stack up; have we got the money to deliver the pledge?"
<P>
Bearing in mind that the pledge is to be implemented by the end of this Parliament, it is clear that the money to do so will be there. What we are now saying is that the pledge is so important, both to show the electorate that we honour our pledges and to improve standards in our schools, that we do not want to wait until easter 2002 the likely end of this Parliament we want to achieve something sooner. That is why, from this September, we will begin to deliver the pledge in local education authorities throughout the country chosen without fear or favour, but selected on the basis of the applications that they have made.
<P>
In some of those authorities, the changes will be phased in; in others, we hope to be more ambitious. Because we shall implement the pledge sooner than we originally stated it will happen three or four years earlier we must find capital to back it up. Because we shall not have accrued the amount that we would have done by the year 2002 from the savings on the assisted places scheme, we need to find some money.
<P>
Some of phase two of the new deal capital money for schools will be used to implement the class size reduction. It was made very clear in the press notice of 17 November that, in inviting submissions for new deal capital, we specifically referred to building projects that might be necessary to reduce class sizes. I am delighted that the hon. Member for Guildford reads our press notices with such attention; I wish members of the press did so. We drew attention to our policy in the press notice and in the application guidance that was issued, so we are being open and honest.
<P>
We need to do all that because we are bringing forward the implementation date. We are doing better that the pledge originally stated; we shall implement it from the end of this Parliament. Indeed, we do not even want to wait until Easter 2002; we intend to honour the pledge with effect from the school year beginning September 2001. That is our timescale for delivering the pledge.
<P>
The finances will be there; the financial memorandum to the Bill makes it clear that the accumulated costs of implementing the class size reduction to 30 or fewer for five, six and seven-year-olds come to £193 million for England and Wales. By the end of this Parliament, the accumulated savings from the assisted places scheme will be £263 million for England alone.
<P>
Given the estimates that we have been able to make, there is no doubt that there will be more than enough money to deliver the class size reduction pledge. There is no doubt in our minds that we have the teachers necessary to deliver the pledge. In fact, the targets for initial training have been devised to ensure that we can recruit the extra teachers necessary to do so. We calculate that, by 2001 to 2002, 5,000 extra teachers will probably be required. The initial teacher training targets have been increased by 6,000 to ensure the flexibility needed to meet the targets for recruiting teachers to the primary sector.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Has the Minister taken into account the extra teachers that might be needed in secondary schools because of pupils returning to the maintained sector? Has he any estimate of how many teachers are needed to prevent secondary school class sizes from increasing under the Government's initiative?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> As I have said, given the cost of implementing the pledge and the savings that will accrue from phasing out the assisted places scheme, there is scope £70 million of flexibility to meet extra demands, such as increased costs in the secondary sector, that might result from the phasing out of the assisted places scheme.
<P>
As we said in debates on the Bill that became the Education (Schools) Act 1997, under which the assisted places scheme will be phased out, we disagree with Conservative Members about the costs that will arise from phasing out that scheme. We believe that they will be marginal; I know that Conservative Members take a different view. Nevertheless, if there are such costs, they can be accommodated within the financial envelope that is the result of savings accrued from the assisted places scheme.
<P>
I hope to have demonstrated that the costings show that we have enough revenue to deliver our pledge. I also hope that I have explained why additional capital will be required this September because the class size reduction commitment is to be delivered earlier than was originally envisaged in the pledge.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> In view of the Minister's confidence, will he publish year by year the figures for savings made on assisted places, for the amount required for capital funding of the new deal for schools and related building operations and for the amount necessary to ensure that secondary school class sizes do not increase as a result of the abolition of the assisted places scheme?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> There is a genuine problem with that last point because it will be difficult to specify the costs of individual children who may move out of the independent sector into the maintained sector as a result of assisted places no longer being available. We should also bear in mind that the assisted places scheme is not being abolished but phased out, so youngsters in the secondary sector who currently have an assisted place can carry it through. Youngsters in the primary sector will be able to continue with their assisted places at[Mr. Byers]
least until the end of their primary sector education. In some cases, we are exercising our discretion to enable them to continue longer, in line with certain assurances that were given when the Bill passed through the House.
<P>
To deal with the hon. Gentleman's two other points, first, I am happy to publish annually the figures relating to the phasing out of the assisted places scheme; I have no problem with that. Secondly, if further submissions are to be made against the new deal money it is our intention to use new deal arrangements specifically for reductions in class size once again, I have no problem with publishing the information. We want to be as open as we can: hon. Members have a right to know and we will disclose the figures as and when decisions are made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I thank the Minister for giving way and for reconfirming the commitment that he gave me during the passage of the Education (Schools) Bill that he would make information available annually. However, would he also be prepared to make available to the Committee his calculations of the number of additional teachers that will be necessary to meet the pledge? The Minister will be aware that there are currently nearly 500,000 children at key stage 1 who are in classes of more than 30. Some of them can be moved to smaller classes, but the Minister said earlier today that some classes will have as few as 15 or 16 children. I have difficulty coming to terms with the calculation of just 5,000 additional teachers. Will the Minister make the relevant information available to the Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I have no problem with that. When we publish the grounds on which we shall consider admission arrangements, I will be able to provide more detailed information. Estimates can be provided of the number of additional teachers that may be required but they will be very much estimates. There will be local variations; much depends on how the pledge can be met locally. That is one of the reasons that made us keen to deliver the pledge by this September. We shall learn a good deal from the way in which class sizes are reduced up and down the county and that experience will enable us to make better estimates.
<P>
As I said, we estimate that 4,000 to 5,000 additional teachers will be required to deliver the pledge. Clearly the Liberal Democrats have a different figure well in excess of that. I am unsure how they produced their figure of 16,000; no doubt they will share their calculations with us and we can all look forward to that with interest. Their Treasury spokesman may have come up with that figure. Given that he made eight times seven to be 72, they are likely to be inflated figures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> But the Minister got his tables wrong!
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am in the Chancellor's good books because I am a Minister who say 54, not 56 that puts me in credit as far as the Treasury is concerned.
<P>
I hope that, in discussing amendment No. 69, I have been able to address the concerns of the right hon. Member for Charnwood about how the finances are to be made available. It is not appropriate to put a constraint on the resources that might be provided for the purposes of class size reduction. If, on 17 March, the Chancellor suddenly decides that he wants to reduce classes to 25, we should not stand in his way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> If only!
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Yes, if only. The amendment would deny him the opportunity of doing that and I do not think that members of the Committee would want to stand in this way.
<P>
On amendment No. 96, there will come a time when the funds that have been realised will be allocated to LEAs through the normal grant mechanism, although I do not think that that will happen this side of the next general election. Until the end of the Parliament, we will want to see a process of local authorities, not bidding against each other, but applying for the available money. The reason I make a distinction between bidding and applying is that by the end of the Parliament, all LEAs will be covered and will deliver the reduced class size of 30 or fewer for five, six and seven-year-olds. So the question concerns the timing of when they will be able to implement the reduction of class sizes.
<P>
We have approached the matter by looking for a good mix of LEAs to take part in the initial scheme so that we can gain experience from the way in which they deliver pledge; so the pledge will not be delivered through the normal grant mechanism this side of the next general election. We intend to continue to make it available through specific grant for the time being, but once the pledge is fully implemented we might be in a position to re-examine the financial regime that will apply. There is a real benefit for LEAs currently receiving the money for class size reduction by way of specific grant. Because it is 100 per cent. funded, the grant does not count against the councils' capped level. There are therefore benefits under the existing financial regimes in making the money available to LEAs by way of specific grant. I hope that, as I have responded positively to the amendments, right honourable and learned Members will not press them. If not, I will ask the Committee to resist them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for accepting the force of the argument to amendment No. 68 and for undertaking to table an amendment on Report. On that basis, I am happy to withdraw the amendment. I am also grateful to him for responding seriously and fully on the Government's figures, balancing the delivery of the class size pledge against the savings from the assisted places scheme. We shall not seek to press that amendment to a Division. Listening to the Minister balancing the figures of the assisted places scheme savings with the costs of the class size pledge took me back in life. As you know, Mr. Gale, I am a businessman by background and in that capacity several business plans were presented to me, several of which resembled those that the Minister has just offered to the Committee they offered a deficit in the short term, glorious sunlit uplands and all the sums balancing in the long term. In such visions, the long term has a nasty habit of receding into the future; I shall be interested to see, as the years go by, whether the Minister's predicted surplus emerges. We are promised a short-term deficit. The Committee should be clear that that is an important point. The Minister has effectively announced that, at least in the second and third years of the Parliament, the cost of delivering the class size pledge will not be met, in terms of either revenue or capital, by the savings from the abolition of the assisted places scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The fact that the pledge is to reduce class sizes by the end of the Parliament is important. We are now reducing class sizes, almost irrespective of the pledge, because we are doing it sooner. It is incorrect to say that we are not funding the pledge by the end of this Parliament, the pledge will be fully funded from the savings that are made. We are moving more quickly because we want to reduce class sizes sooner rather than later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I accept the Minister's point, but the central argument remains that the Government's political priority to deliver smaller class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds will not be met, at least in the early and middle years of this Parliament, by the savings from the assisted places scheme. We are promised that, in the glorious land that awaits us at the end of this Parliament, the sums will balance. In the short term, however, money is being used to deliver smaller class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds that might otherwise have been available elsewhere in the education system outside the assisted places scheme.
<P>
That is an important point, as it shows that the Government are choosing rigidly to deliver smaller class sizes for that age group whatever the circumstances and with all the shortcomings and difficulties that we have been discussing. They are attaching a priority to that pledge rather than to the concerns that have been expressed by Labour Members on, for example, temporary accommodation in existing secondary schools, which the Government regard as a second priority. According to the Minister's response, money that might have been available for that will not be made available. That is an important point and I am glad that it has been revealed during this debate. Nevertheless, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The primary effect of the amendment and the new clause would be to ensure that local education authority inspections are carried out jointly by Ofsted and the Audit Commission. Amendment No. 80 is different from the new clause, in that it would ensure a direct link between the general framework for inspection of LEAs under the 1997 Act and the proposed new duty under clause 5 requiring LEAs to exercise their functions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"with a view to promoting high standards".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We very much support that proposed statutory duty on LEAs to exercise their functions with a view to promoting high standards for all pupils in maintained primary and secondary schools. When the LEA inspections under section 38 of the Education Act 1997 were proposed, there was agreement on both sides of the House of Commons that LEAs should be subject to external review.
<P>
The Government have made it clear that like Liberal Democrats and the LEAs themselves they believe that the prime task of LEAs is to monitor the performance of schools and to support them in raising standards. Given that, it seems sensible to establish, as amendment No. 80 would, a direct link between the general framework for the inspection of LEAs under the 1997 Act and the new duty on LEAs under clause 5 of the Bill.
<P>
As to new clause 1, there was considerable debate during consideration of the 1997 Act about the way in which external inspections of LEAs should be carried out. As was noticed then and on several occasions since, I have been highly critical of Ofsted and, at times, Her Majesty's chief inspector. However, I have not gone as far in my criticisms as one teacher, who said a couple of days ago that Mr. Woodhead was as much use in the battle for higher standards as a chocolate teapot. Although I am critical of him, I want to make it clear that I am not critical of the principle of external inspections of schools and of local education authorities. It is vital that they take place and that Ofsted is the lead body in such inspections.
<P>
I ask the Committee to bear in mind that local education authorities are democratically elected, conterminous with multi-purpose local councils and legally indistinguishable from them. Although LEAs usually have an education department and a statutory chief education officer, the power and duties that are vested in the elected members may be exercised partly[Mr. Foster]
outside the education department. As a council also has its powers, responsibilities and functions in relation to other matters, we must recognise that its other activities in, for example, social services can have a direct impact on the ability of that authority to promote high standards in primary and secondary schools.
<P>
It seems logical to argue that alongside Ofsted should be a body that has significant expertise and experience in examining the wider functions of a local authority functions that will directly impinge on its ability to raise standards in its schools. As I am sure members of the Committee are aware, the Audit Commission is experienced in examining the performance of local authorities as total institutions. It has developed approaches to the measurement of performance across all their functions.
<P>
The Committee will be aware of the wide range of work carried out by the Audit Commission in relation to the work of local education authorities. Its reports have been debated in various Committees that have examined other Bills. For example, it has studied the education of children aged under five years, the supply and allocation of school places, schools' management of their finances, provision for pupils with special educational needs and full-time education for 16 to19-year-olds. The commission published a booklet as recently as Friday on the possible future role of local education authorities.
<P>
I am sure that most members of the Committee would agree that the Audit Commission is knowledgeable about the work not only of council authorities, but of local education authorities. The new clause would ensure that the Audit Commission would be involved each time there was an inspection of an LEA. Under the measure, it would not take over the lead responsibility, but would provide its independent view on issues that it is especially interested in, such as assessing value for money, using comparative data and benchmarking to check what is going on, and making comparisons with other local education authorities.
<P>
The new clause would introduce a measure that was supported in principle by all members of the Committee during the passage of the 1997 Act. Furthermore, Ofsted has invited the Audit Commission to be involved in every inspection of LEAs that has already taken place. The problem was that, on one occasion, the Audit Commission chose not to become involved because of the lack of resources to meet that inspection, which I think was in north Somerset. Clearly, if we want to support the suggestion that the Audit Commission will always be involved, the need for funding such an activity must be recognised. As the Committee will have noted, that is also covered by the wording of my new clause.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will recognise that amendment No. 80 would make a sensible connection between the planned inspection of LEAs by Ofsted and, we hope, by the Audit Commission, and the new responsibility that clause 5 places on LEAs. The new clause would ensure that the Audit Commission was always involved in the inspections of LEAs that Ofsted will undertake as the lead body inspections which we all fully support.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I shall invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw amendment No. 80, but obviously I shall first need to give him good reasons to do so. I hope that I can.
<P>
The framework for inspection of local education authorities the guidance used by Ofsted and the Audit Commission has been agreed by both of those organisations. If there were teething problems in the early days of their relationship, especially in relation to their new responsibilities for inspecting local education authorities, they have now been overcome. I had a meeting last week or the week before with the controller of the Audit Commission, who seemed positive about the new working relationship that has developed between it and Ofsted.
<P>
Inspections carried out to date were all voluntary and non-statutory. From the beginning of January, we have been in a new phase in which local education authorities are subject to statutory inspections. We have identified 12 LEAs for inspection this year. This evening, I can tell the Committee that we hope to increase that number to at least 16, and we want to move to 24 inspections next year and to 30 in the year 2000 and each thereafter.
<P>
The reason we need to move to a cycle of inspecting 30 local education authorities each year is that that will mean that we will have a five-yearly cycle of inspections of local education authorities in England, which we feel is probably about the right period. If we retained the present cycle of 12, they would be on a 12 and a half year inspection cycle, which would be wholly inappropriate and cause most of us concern, especially given the new duty under clause 5 to raise standards.
<P>
We are confident that many authorities will pass inspection if not with flying colours, at least with approval, but there will be some authorities that could improve the support and assistance that they give to schools in their areas. It is important that we have an inspection regime that will identify good practice and what works well in local education authorities, as well as identifying those authorities that are not delivering the sort of assistance that we would want.
<P>
Moving to a five-yearly cycle changes the whole debate about Ofsted and the Audit Commission. We will need to ensure that both organisations but especially Ofsted have the personnel to carry out the role of inspecting local education authorities. I know that it was a matter of concern to Her Majesty's chief inspector that he did not have within Ofsted the expertise to carry out an effective inspection of local education authorities. There is no surprise about that. Ofsted was set up primarily to inspect schools, so its expertise is schools based. It is now recruiting people with a local education authority background but, I am pleased to say, not exclusively so. It is also bringing in people from the business world who will be able to scrutinise local education authorities for value for money and effectiveness. That is an important part of the job that we want Ofsted to do looking at quality and value for money coupled with the work that the Audit Commission will do.
<P>
I am unhappy about accepting amendment No. 80 and new clause 1 because they are inflexible. The Secretary of State might want Ofsted to inspect just one part of a local education authority's function. For example, there might be concern that there is a disproportionate number of failing schools schools under special measures and, therefore, Ofsted might be asked to discover why the LEA had not intervened to stop that happening. Perhaps an LEA has a problem with boys' under-achievement, so a specific inspection might address that issue. In such cases, it would be inappropriate for the Audit Commission to be involved. We are concerned that new clause 1 would always require the Audit Commission to be involved.
<P>
Amendment No. 80 makes a series point about how to involve the Audit Commission. I share the concern of the hon. Member for Bath about the inspection in north Somerset. Although Ofsted invited the Audit Commission to be part of that inspection, it was unable to take up the offer because of the costs that would be incurred. Clearly, that is not acceptable. Although the findings of the Ofsted inspection were glowing and Bath and North East Somerset district council a new unitary authority is to be congratulated on the very good early start that it has made as an LEA, it was disappointing that the Audit Commission was not involved.
<P>
The Government are seeking to streamline the procedures that Ofsted and the Audit Commission will follow and to achieve cost-effectiveness to drive down the costs incurred. We recognise that costs will be incurred in expanding the number of inspections to 30 a year and moving to a five-yearly cycle, but we are prepared to finance those costs from within government to ensure that there is a robust inspection regime for LEAs.
<P>
Difficulties, such as those to do with the Audit Commission and Bath and North East Somerset district council, to which the hon. Member for Bath referred, should not arise in future because the finances will be provided and procedures will be more cost-effective and streamlined. By doing that, we shall ensure that Ofsted and the Audit Commission can play a full part in inspecting LEAs.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I welcome what the Minister has said about the cycle of Ofsted inspections of LEAs. I am sure that the Government are right to make LEAs subject to Ofsted inspection. If that is to be meaningful, a 12 and a half year cycle is plainly absurd. We must face the resource implications of a regular cycle. I agree with the Minister that a five-year cycle is reasonable. It is funny how five years seems a reasonable cycle to politicians, but I am sure that there is a basis for it. I agree with everything that the Minister had to say about that.
<P>
I also agree with the Minister and, indeed, the hon. Member for Bath, about the value of Audit Commission participation in inspections of LEA structures and the desirability of the two working in parallel at least, in the context of normal inspections. I associate the official Opposition with the Minister's remarks and agree with the approach that he has just taken in his response.
<P>
Given the fact that I do not propose to speak to a clause stand part debate, I want to make the point that important issues are often disposed of with almost no debate in Committee because they are not controversial. I am pleased about the new LEA duty to raise standards as part of a framework of statutory responsibility. I welcome the fact that that is being written into LEAs' statutory obligations. The Opposition will support the inclusion of clause 5 in the Bill with some enthusiasm.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> You will have been delighted, Mr. Gale, by the brevity of this debate and by the fact that, on this occasion, there appears to be unanimity in the Committee. I, too, am delighted by the Minister's announcement about the cycle of inspections. If one believes that the inspection of LEAs is a good thing, ensuring that they occur regularly is obviously sensible. We fully support that.
<P>
The Minister gave a clear assurance of his intentions about the generality of full inspections of LEAs. It is his clear expectation that the Audit Commission will work alongside Ofsted. I fully accept the Minister\AIs point about the occasional one-off inspections of a specific function of a local education authority. I think that all members of the Committee will be delighted at the Minister's assurance that the funds will be found to ensure that the Audit Commission can play a full part in those inspections.
<P>
I understand that the bedding-down process took place and that the Audit Commission and Ofsted wish to learn from their experiences. I know that my colleagues in Cornwall, where an education authority was inspected, found the experience very helpful. I am sure that my colleagues in north Somerset were delighted with the results of their inspection. They might have enjoyed it even more if the Audit Commission had been involved.
<P>
We have received several assurances from the Minister, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
