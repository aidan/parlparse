<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000478"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendments Nos. 150 to 153 and
171.</div><a name="06071456000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071456000479"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Maria Miller</b> (Basingstoke) (Con): I want to take this
opportunity to raise a couple of points with the Minister. Although
these are technical amendments, they raise some issues that are worthy
of a little more substantive debate. Regulated activity providers are
sanctioned if they do not check that an individual is monitored when
taking him into employment. Obviously, the penalty is onerous. The
clause also permits employers to employ individuals without checks on
an occasional basis; we have had that debate and we may have it again
so I will not delay the Committee by raising the issue now.</div>
<a name="06071456000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there is another
provision whereby an employer can take an individual on, and that is if
he obtains written confirmation from another regulatory provider who
employs the individual in a regulated activity. Basically, the first
employer provides an underwriting of the fact that that individual is
monitored and is eligible for employment. I am not at all clear why
amendment No. 149 has been tabled. It seems to produce an additional
complication in terms of the employment structure of an individual who
may be taken into a monitored environment where a particular employer
has not made a check against his barred status. Could the Minister take
the opportunity to look at that?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 120</div><a name="06071456000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second point relates to
another complex issue in the clause. Obviously we are looking to create
a workable system, but the clause is very complex. As I said, an
existing employer can endorse an employee&#146;s suitability for
another employer. Could any further detail be added in this part of the
Bill about when the initial employer&#146;s liability ends in terms
of the reference that he has given that employee to go into another
working situation where he has not been checked for monitoring or
barred status?</div> <a name="06071456000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
not entirely clear from the Bill what happens when, for instance, an
individual is barred after an initial reference has been given. Would
the original employer have a duty to inform the second employer of the
change in barred status? I can entirely understand why it would be
necessary to give employers the ability to give these types of
reference, but given that people&#146;s barred status can change, can
the Minister clarify whether there will be an obligation on employers
who have given such undertakings to ensure that other individuals are
kept up to date with any changes that
occur?</div><a name="06071456000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000480"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Mr.
Parmjit Dhanda):</b> May I take that last point first? It will
not be incumbent on the employer to do so. The Independent Barring
Board and the Criminal Records Bureau will inform future employers. As
we discussed on Tuesday, it is the role of the employer to refer
information to the IBB if that person has been sacked for inappropriate
behaviour, for example involving a child.</div>
<a name="06071456000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady requested a
little more information on amendments Nos. 149 and 150, which ensure
that the intended policy on the requirement to check is correctly
drafted in the Bill when a person can be regarded as engaging in a
regulated activity for two different regulated activity providers: for
example, a builder on a school site who may be there with the
permission of both the school and the construction company. The hon.
Lady was alluding to the overlap between the two.</div>
<a name="06071456000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the regulated activity
providers must be able to rely on a written confirmation from the other
that a check has been made on the person instead of having to make his
or her own check. Amendment No. 149 is a drafting change to remove a
perceived ambiguity from the previous provision. Amendment No. 150
makes it an offence for the other regulated activity provider to give a
false written confirmation, thus closing a loophole in the Bill, which
is common sense. Amendment No. 151 removes an unnecessary reference to
a clause, which happens to be clause 11(6)(a), in clause
11(9).</div> <a name="06071456000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendments
Nos. 152, 153 and 171, it may help if I explain some of the
Bill&#146;s provisions. Clause 11 requires an employer to obtain
relevant information within the meaning of schedule 4 either through an
enhanced disclosure or by making a check under schedule 4. Clause 39
currently allows the Secretary of State to prescribe sectors where the
ability to make a schedule 4 check is removed and the regulated
activity provider is required to have obtained an enhanced disclosure
before employment can
begin.</div><a name="06071456000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
will allow the Government to prescribe sectors where an enhanced
disclosure must be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 121</div>applied for but where a preliminary check showing that the individual
was monitored and therefore not barred would allow employment to start
in the first instance while the regulated activity provider was waiting
for the enhanced disclosure, which I am sure the Committee will see as
common sense. The mechanism for making the preliminary check will be
prescribed in regulations and we will consult on the circumstances in
which the checks will be used.</div>
<a name="06071456000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000481"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I know that this issue is terribly complex and I
do not want to detain the Committee, but why is amendment No. 149
necessary? I do not understand why it has been
proposed.</div>
<a name="06071456000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000482"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I thought I had explained. It is to ensure that
the intended policy on the requirement to check is correctly set out in
the Bill, because it was not in the first instance. That is obviously
not clear enough for the hon. Lady, but I am happy to go back and have
another look at amendment No. 149 if she feels that it need not be
there at all. I believe that it should, but I will happily take another
look at it before Report.</div>
<a name="06071456000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments will allow the
vetting and barring scheme to continue existing provisions such as the
&#147;POVA First&#148; check, which are used to minimise
recruitment difficulties in sectors where enhanced disclosures are
currently mandatory. I therefore ask hon. Members to accept the
Government amendments.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000485"></a>Mr.
Lewis:</b> If only it were Mr. Dhanda&#151;but I am here
instead. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham (Tim Loughton) says that that is not the right attitude; I
hope that, by the time I have finished, he will still hold that view. I
am delighted to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Martlew. I shall speak
first to the Government amendments. The Opposition can then speak to
their amendments, and I shall respond.</div>
<a name="06071456000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 14 lists the regulated
activity providers exempted from the obligation of making a vetting and
barring check under clause 11 and from ensuring that those engaged in
regulated activity are subject to monitoring. Committee members will
appreciate it if I outline the clause&#146;s importance. It is
crucial that the new scheme should offer flexibility, especially in
sectors for which the concept of central vetting will be new, as is the
case with many of the sectors exempted under clause 14. Our original
intention was to give those sectors the opportunity to phase in checks,
as appropriate to their individual services, and give them the freedom
to decide internally which members of staff should be vetted. That is
why we made provisions under clause 14 to remove exemptions, via
delegated legislation, in relation to those groups listed in clause
14(4). That would allow time for the scheme to bed down and enable us
to extend mandatory vetting in response to service requirements.
However, following debate in another place, we are seeking to make our
intentions in that regard clearer in the Bill. I expect that will be
welcomed by Committee
members.</div><a name="06071456000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
155 introduces a sunset clause in respect of paragraphs (d) to (g) of
clause 14(1). The paragraphs cover organisations providing
recreational, social, sporting or education activities, educational
courses, the management of housing and housing-related support
services. The effect of the clause will be that those paragraphs will
no longer have effect once a period of three years, from the date on
which the provisions are brought into force, has elapsed. Once that
happens, clauses 10 and 11 will apply to the regulated activity
providers with the result that they will commit an offence if they do
not carry out a scheme status check and ensure that those whom they
employ to carry out regulated activity are subject
to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 123</div>monitoring. Individuals who carry out this work will be committing an
offence if they are not subject to monitoring as set out in clause
8.</div> <a name="06071456000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a safeguard, an
order-making power has been included in amendment No. 175. It is there
in case there was a problem that resulted in the requirement to check
having serious operational consequences for service delivery, and if
the exemption needed to be extended for an extra period.</div>
<a name="06071456000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are all aware that the Bill
is a big step forward for the protection of vulnerable adults, bringing
about a significantly larger and more diverse work force than ever
before. However, as the order-making power is subject to affirmative
resolution, the Government and Parliament would need to consider the
impact on those receiving such services and make a carefully balanced
decision that reflected the risks associated with not imposing a
mandatory requirement, and the risks of loneliness and isolation that
may be experienced by those whose services were withdrawn. Again, I
hope that that will reassure Committee members. I stress, however, that
such a power would not be exercised lightly, given the important
context in which we are
working.</div><a name="06071456000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
58 further refines clause 14 by removing the exemption for
complementary and alternative therapists, whom we recognise have the
opportunity for intimate and personal contact with vulnerable adults.
That should be welcomed by hon. Members of both Opposition parties,
because they have tabled the same amendment. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.
Members</span>: &#147;First!&#148;] They say they did it
first, and I am happy to give them that credit. However, I think they
knewour intention, given that we had reflected on
representations from the other place and organisations outside the
House. With that, I urge the Committee to accept the
Government&#146;s amendments as being common sense and which offer a
sensible way forward and reflect appropriately the debate that was held
in another
place.</div><a name="06071456000448"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="06071456000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071456000486"></a><b class="B">Tim
Loughton</b> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con): Welcome back
to the Chair, Mr. Martlew. We certainly welcome the amendment, not
least because the Minister admitted that it was ours. As is always
frustrating, the way parliamentary procedure works is that the
Government hijack good ideas from the Opposition&#151;in this case
blatantly&#151;by inserting their name, which automatically goes
ahead of the Opposition Members who have done all the work in
the first place. However, we are happy that the Government have done
so.</div> <a name="06071456000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The subject came
up in another place, where there was widespread agreement that the
complementary or alternative therapy get-out could cause a problem for
a lot of vulnerable people. The Minister has mentioned massages, but
there is also aromatherapy, for example, which is increasingly
available for mental health patients. Many types of vulnerable people
will have increasing access to complementary or alternative therapy
providers. It therefore seemed appropriate that they should be covered
by the checks and balances in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 124</div>the legislation and not made exempt, as subsection (1)(a) would have
done, so we certainly support the amendment.</div>
<a name="06071456000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 59, 60 and 138
are probing amendments. The issue that they address was extensively
debated in another place, where the Opposition queried the need for the
clause at all. Subsection (1) contains a lengthy list of exemptions, of
which only one will now be knocked out. Many noble Lords took the view
that we should include as many people as possible, subject to the
vetting and barring procedures, and if there was then a problem with
trying to include too many people in one go, the system could be phased
in, so that we could see at a later stage who should be exempted,
rather than the other way round. Why should so many different classes
of people, many of whom will be dealing with vulnerable people, be
exempted?</div> <a name="06071456000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
concerned about the judicial processes, and about the prison and
probation services in particular. We do not understand why subsections
(1)(b) and (1)(c) should deal with them in a special way. Paragraph (b)
seeks to exempt those involved in the control or management of persons
detained in lawful custody and paragraph (c) seeks to exempt people in
the probation service. However, as my noble Friend Baroness Buscombe
said when similar amendments were debated in another
place:</div><a name="06071456000427"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Why,
for example, are young offenders&#146; institutions so different from
other residential institutions such as boarding schools or care homes?
Of course the rules will be different, but the proximity between those
in authority and their residents is quite similar, in which case I find
it difficult to accept that we are talking about unique
services.&#148;</div><a name="06071456000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to those amendments in another place and the point about
including the Prison Service and the probation service, Baroness Royall
spoke in rather general
terms:</div><a name="06071456000428"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
blanket approach to vetting arrangements would not sit comfortably
within either service&#146;s operating
arrangements.&#148;</div><a name="06071456000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why not?
It would be interesting if the Minister could elaborate on that,
because his noble colleague failed to in another place.</div>
<a name="06071456000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Baroness Royall went on to
say:</div><a name="06071456000429"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The vast
majority of staff working in close contact with vulnerable adults in
both the prison and probation services will be
checked&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06071456000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">but
again, not everybody. How vast is the vast majority? She went on to say
that</div><a name="06071456000430"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;staff providing
support to prisoners in a group setting may not be
checked.&#148;</div><a name="06071456000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">When is a group
big enough that they should be exempt from being checked because,
presumably, enough people are watching out? What about when those
groups become smaller groups, which become pairs under the control of
that person? Again, the provision is fraught with potential problems.
Despite all the reassuring words of the Minister in the other place, we
have not really had the assurances on paper.</div>
<a name="06071456000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the conclusion to the debate
on the amendments, Baroness Royall said that she
acknowledged:</div><a name="06071456000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
is a matter of discussion among government
departments&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 24
May 2006; Vol. 682, c. 879-884.]</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 125</div><a name="06071456000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that she very much hoped that the
Government would be able to find an acceptable solution on Report. From
what I can see, that did not happen. We still have an elaborate list of
exemptions in clause 14.</div>
<a name="06071456000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need some more convincing
from the Minister on, first, why all the exemptions in the clause are
absolutely essential and, secondly, why paragraphs (b) and (c), which
deal with vulnerable people in the prison and probation service, should
be specifically included. That is why we have tabled amendments Nos. 59
and 60 to strike out those two paragraphs. Given that they have shown
willing with paragraph (a) on complementary therapy, perhaps the
Government could apply the same logic to the prison and probation
services.</div> <a name="06071456000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">One also
must bear in mind the high incidence of mental illness among prisoners.
It has been estimated in various studies that some three quarters of
prisoners in our prisons suffer from some form of mental illness. Those
are more vulnerable people than the rest of the population, in the
unusual surroundings of prison, which in many cases is unfamiliar. We
need the checks and safeguards to apply to them, too. The Minister must
justify why the exemptions should be included.</div>
<a name="06071456000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 138 deals with
paragraph (f). At the moment, somebody who
is</div><a name="06071456000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;responsible for the
control or management of the provision of housing (including sheltered
housing)&#148;</div><a name="06071456000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">will be
exempted. There is a distinction to be made within that qualification.
Clearly, it would not be appropriate to include people on the board of
a social housing trust, or councillors on a housing committee
responsible for council housing stock, who make decisions about the
provision of housing and what sort of people can go into that housing,
but who do not come into contact with those people at all, or certainly
not regularly. One would not want to include such people, quite
rightly. That is why we would retain the reference to those who are
responsible for the general provision of housing.</div>
<a name="06071456000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot see why there should
be an exemption for those who would be covered by the phrase
&#147;the control or management&#148; of housing. We could be
talking about a warden of a sheltered housing project&#151;the
paragraph specifically uses the phrase &#147;including sheltered
housing&#148;. Again, we are considering vulnerable, in this case
predominantly elderly, people in sheltered housing accommodation, for
whom a resident warden is in a responsible position. That warden has a
great deal of control and influence over the vulnerable people living
in that sheltered accommodation, will have access to their flats, and a
master key to get into those flats. In many cases, the warden will be
the person responsible for responding to any alarm buzzers that are
installed.</div> <a name="06071456000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unless my
reading of the paragraph is wrong&#151;I would be delighted to be
corrected; it is a probing amendment&#151;we are talking about
exempting people in positions of responsibility who have day-to-day
contact with vulnerable, elderly, frail people, who are able to gain
access to their private accommodation and who are privy to much private
information about them.
</div><a name="06071456000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not see why a
housing manager of a sheltered accommodation block&#151;a warden or
whatever other description one might apply to someone in that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 126</div>position&#151;should be exempted, because they, more than people in
many of the other categories that we have discussed, are able to gain
access to vulnerable people. We are all aware of cases in which elderly
people have been abused in some way or taken advantage of by people in
a position of trust, who have access to their property and to their
accommodation.</div> <a name="06071456000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
still need to be convinced that the clause is necessary, and
specifically why the three categories of people in paragraphs (b), (c)
and (f) should be included. It strikes me that those people will have
more access than many others to the sort of vulnerable people, both
children and the elderly, whom the Bill seeks to
protect.</div><a name="06071456000108"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071456000487"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): We strongly
support Government amendment No. 58. We, too, took account of much of
the debate in the other place. I understand that extra meetings were
arranged to discuss the issue, and that it truly wasa
cross-party discussion. I am pleased at the Government&#146;s
responsiveness, as a number of organisations were most concerned,
particularly given the range of therapies that can be involved. I share
the concerns raised by the Conservative party. Indeed, I question the
requirement for the clause, or at least subsection (1). I should be
grateful if the Minister said again why it is so important.</div>
<a name="06071456000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have questions about some of
the categories. Paragraph (b) refers to people who are &#147;detained
in lawful custody&#148;. I imagine that, one way or another, checks
would be made on the full-time staff. Some time ago, I visited Feltham
prison, and I was impressed with the number of volunteers who, for
example, were helping inmates with their reading skills. Close contact
was obviously important.</div>
<a name="06071456000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recall that one inmate could
write only in capital letters, and the support that he was given by one
volunteer was certainly frequent&#151;it was at least once a week.
Although I was impressed with what I saw, I am worried about those who
could get that sort of position. Should there not be some monitoring or
checking up on volunteers who go to such institutions so frequently? I
shall not repeat what the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham
said about that.</div><a name="06071456000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
paragraph (c), I was thinking about the management of community
sentences. Again, it may not be full-time probation staff who are
involved in the projects. What is the Minister&#146;s response to
that example? The more one looks at it, the more one can pick examples
that cause concern.</div> <a name="06071456000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be grateful if the Minister explained exactly what is meant by
paragraph (e). What is a &#147;prescribed description&#148;? It
sounds as if it should be a monitored activity, where it applies wholly
or mainly to vulnerable adults, but there may be an explanation. I
concur with the concerns about sheltered housing. The provision may
need narrowing, particularly in respect of sheltered housing. I share
the concerns about that. Again, the Bill is quite stringent, with all
those criminal penalties at one end of the scale. However, if there are
loopholes, we have to wonder what we are doing here. Therefore, I hope
that the Minister can reassure us on those
points.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000488"></a>Mr.
Lewis:</b> The debate has demonstrated that, to some extent,
these issues will always be a matter for judgment and timing. They need
to be looked at sector by sector, organisation by organisation, groups
of paid and unpaid staff by groups of staff. It is not a
one-size-fits-all approach.</div>
<a name="06071456000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be nice to believe
that we could make this neat and tidy. Having considered this Bill,
along with other colleagues, I think that it is incredibly hard to make
it neat and tidy. An element of judgment has to be made that is linked
to proportionality, particular sectors and activities.</div>
<a name="06071456000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also need to take account of
existing checks that are made in certain sectors in which there are
well established processes and procedures. In other sectors, we are
starting from a very low base, if any base at all. It is right to say
that it is not a one-size-fits-all Bill. Judgments are having to be
made all the time about the nature of the protection that is being
offered and the responsibilities that are placed both on employers and
individuals.</div>
<a name="06071456000449"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="06071456000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the
Opposition&#146;s amendments. Amendment No.138 would remove the
reference to</div> <a name="06071456000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
control or management of&#148;</div>
<a name="06071456000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">housing. That appears to remove the
exemption in relation to those organisations that manage housing
services but that are not the provider of such services. In many cases,
the provider or the owner of housing stock subcontracts out the
management of that housing stock to another organisation. Many
registered social landlords let and manage property of which they are
not the legal owner.</div>
<a name="06071456000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, we
believe&#151;this may be an unintended consequence of the wording and
not necessarily related to the principle that the Conservative party is
trying to support&#151;that the amendment would make checks mandatory
for those individuals working with organisations with day-to-day
responsibility for the management of housing services, where those
services are contracted out. However, as drafted, the amendment would
also have the effect of retaining optional checks for individuals
working in local authority housing services, for example, which manage
their own housing stock. That would create an inconsistency that we
want to avoid.</div><a name="06071456000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">At this
stage, we wish the exemption to apply across the sector. It is crucial
that the scheme offers flexibility and allows those services in which
the concept of central vetting will be new the time to phase in checks
as appropriate to their individual services. That is the case for all
providers of housing services. I must say to the hon. Gentleman that
this Bill has established that it is legitimate to reflect on the need
for a phasing-in period in some sectors&#151;hence the sunset clause.
Having considered the matter carefully, we believe that housing is one
example of that.</div> <a name="06071456000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
agree with the hon. Gentleman that a warden in sheltered accommodation
is one example of the type of worker who might have access to
vulnerable people on an ongoing basis. However, having looked at the
sector as a whole, the judgment that we have made is that it is more
desirable and realistic to phase this in over time. That is the
difference between us. There is no difference 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 128</div>of principle. It is that the hon. Gentleman seeks through the
amendment&#151;even though there is the unintended consequence that I
have referred to&#151;to make this happen from day one. We believe
that a phasing-in period is
needed.</div><a name="06071456000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000489"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am not so concerned about a phasing-in period
and the timing. Despite what the Minister read out, I still do not know
which part of the Bill covers a housing warden of a sheltered
accommodation block. This part of clause 14 appears to exempt them, now
or at some stage in the
future.</div><a name="06071456000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000490"></a>Mr.
Lewis:</b> Clause 14(1)(d) to (g) covers organisations
providing the management of housing and housing-related support
services, where the sunset clause would apply. Unless I have missed
something, the phasing in would apply to someone working as a warden in
social housing. The only difference between us is at what stage in the
process such a worker should be covered by the
rules.</div>
<a name="06071456000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000491"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> The Minister is rather uncertain and I am even
more uncertain now. I want to know where in the Bill it states that the
warden of sheltered housing accommodation is subject to vetting and
barring procedures, because I cannot find it. Will it be in
regulations, and if so,
when?</div><a name="06071456000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000492"></a>Mr.
Lewis:</b> I refer the hon. Gentleman to clause 14(1)(d) to
(g). Included in that list are recreational, social, sporting or
educational activities or courses, and the management of housing and
housing-related support services. Unless I am missing something, the
warden of a sheltered scheme would, in due course, fall under the
jurisdiction of the Bill in that
context.</div><a name="06071456000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000493"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Is it not the case that the list can be changed
at any time, so the exemptions on the list may, or may not, actually
come into effect, in however many years&#146; time? Strictly
speaking, that is the case, is it
not?</div><a name="06071456000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000494"></a>Mr.
Lewis:</b> I assure the hon. Gentleman that there is
absolutely no intention to change the list. The difference between us
is that the hon. Gentleman is implying, despite the unintended
consequence to which I referred, that he would like the measure to be
applied from day one. We are saying that, in the context of the housing
sector generally, it needs to be phased in over time, which is why the
sunset clause applies. He should accept that, as that is what the
measure to which I referred states. He suggested that I or any other
Minister may have an agenda to remove that item from that list but that
is untrue. Elsewhere we have the power to revisit these issues under an
affirmative resolution and Parliament could have another look at them,
but sheltered housing and the role of wardens are specifically covered.
Clause 14(1)(f) states, in brackets, &#147;including sheltered
housing&#148;.</div> <a name="06071456000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
genuinely do not understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns on
this occasion. He normally makes salient points, although they are
sometimes at variance with the Government&#146;s position. I do not
understand the point he is making, so I will move on. If he wishes to
come back, or to press the amendment to a Division, he will have the
opportunity to do so.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 129</div><a name="06071456000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 59 and 60 would
remove from clause 14 paragraphs (b) and (c) which relate to the Prison
Service and the national probation service, which remain exempted from
the Bill. Those services provide a wide range of services to adult
offenders and require the flexibility to specify and undertake the
vetting requirements that are relevant and proportionate to their
unique businesses. I reassure hon. Members, especially the hon. Members
for Basingstoke and for East Worthing and Shoreham, who tabled
amendments Nos. 59 and 60 calling for the removal of the services in
question from the clause, that from the outset all prison and probation
officers, and workers who currently receive a Criminal Records Bureau
check and will be working with young offenders in any capacity, will be
covered by a CRB check. That covers the point that the hon. Member for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) reasonably made. Anybody in
those categories will be
checked.</div><a name="06071456000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
exception, on which we need to focus, will provide discretion for
employers to check other categories of workers, such as volunteers and
certain psychological staff, based on a risk assessment. I shall give a
specific example. Volunteers involved in counselling such as
bereavement counselling may be checked, but others such as those who
give regular legal advice to a group of prisoners with prison officers
always present might not require checks. That is a good, tangible
example and I hope that it reassures the hon. Lady on why we feel there
needs to be discretion based on a risk
assessment.</div><a name="06071456000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000495"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I thank the Minister, because he is addressing my
concerns. I appreciate that and understand the matter better. Will
there be published regulations? How will the details and precision that
he is giving us be conveyed to the relevant
bodies?</div><a name="06071456000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000496"></a>Mr.
Lewis:</b> We have received reassurances from the Prison
Service and the probation service on what will happen as a consequence
of the passing of the Bill. I am sure that we can provide the hon. Lady
with written assurances that will make her feel that she has something
beyond my verbal assurances in Committee. I am willing to provide
that.</div><a name="06071456000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000497"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I am not entirely sure whether what the Minister
has outlined will make the situation in the settings in question any
different from that in other settings. Presumably a legal adviser
coming into a prison under the supervision of a prison professional
would fall into the Government&#146;s &#147;occasional&#148;
category. I am not sure whether he is giving us a strong argument for
making an exception in the case of incredibly vulnerable
groups.</div><a name="06071456000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000498"></a>Mr.
Lewis:</b> The hon. Lady may not be entirely sure, but
following serious discussions with the probation service and the Prison
Service, and having weighed up their description of the range of
probation support activities that take place in prison, we have made a
judgment. We have been given tangible examples of situations in which
we should enable those in the system to make a risk assessment and
judgment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 130</div><a name="06071456000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000499"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Why not apply it in other
circumstances?</div><a name="06071456000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000500"></a>Mr.
Lewis:</b> That is a matter of judgment. That is what
Government and Opposition spokespersons do all the time&#151;they
make judgments on difficult matters. One of the arguments that we
always hear from the Opposition parties is that we need to allow people
working on the front line of public services, at the sharp end, to make
more judgments and use more discretion, with fewer centrally imposed
diktats and instructions. Now we have had serious discussions with the
Prison Service and the probation service, and they have provided us
with examples of why we should adopt an approach that allows risk
assessments. They have persuaded us, and we ought to accept that their
assessment of the situation is
correct.</div><a name="06071456000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have reassured hon. Members as to why we have reached our judgments on
the different circumstances in question. On the question of housing, it
is a matter of phasing in over a period of time. There is no difference
of substance between us.</div>
<a name="06071456000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the question of probation
service and Prison Service workers, some of the concerns expressed by
the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole have been allayed as a
consequence of my contribution.</div>
<a name="06071456000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000501"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I thank the Minister for his response, because it
has been helpful. I asked one further question, which was about the
meaning of paragraph (e). Before we leave the issue, I should like to
hear about any further discussions that might have taken place behind
the scenes.</div>
<a name="06071456000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000502"></a>Mr.
Lewis:</b> I shall do my best to describe paragraph (e) for
the hon. Lady. &#147;Prescribed description&#148; means that the
Secretary of State will prescribe the types of course in regulation.
The regulations might prescribe particular skills courses, for example.
That is what it means, if that is any clearer for her. I am more than
happy to write to her with an even clearer and more vivid explanation
than the one that I have just given&#151;if that is at all possible.
However, on that basis, I ask the Opposition to consider not pressing
their
amendments.</div><a name="06071456000450"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000503"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> It has been an interesting debate, made no
easier by the Minister&#146;s uncertainty about the territory on
which he was treading at one stage. It confused various hon. Members,
not least myself.</div> <a name="06071456000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s sunset clauses are welcome, and unusual. The
Opposition usually propose sunset regulation, so those clauses are
welcome, but we have doubts about the Government&#146;s ability to
stick to the suggested timetable, given the arbitrary, hotchpotch
nature of the areas covered, which we believe should not have been
included, nor should they have been subject to exceptions or to
deferment of the incoming criteria.</div>
<a name="06071456000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take the Minister&#146;s
point about sheltered housing wardens, because they play an important
role. He has made it clear in our discussions that they will be
included in the criteria, albeit at a later date. We hope that the
timetable will be adhered to and that the terminology will not change
during that time.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 131</div><a name="06071456000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am less convinced by the
Minister&#146;s refusal to consider amendments Nos. 59 and 60
concerning the Prison Service and the probation service. Opposition
Members have not been swayed by the reasons why those services should
be treated differently, given the nature of the vulnerable people with
whom they deal. To try to reassure us, the Minister cited various
discussions and agreements with the work force in those services, but
we do not know the nature of those discussions, the undertakings given
or whether those professionals feel able to deliver. We are taking a
lot on trust.</div> <a name="06071456000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would not be beneficial to ask the Committee to vote on our amendment,
but the Government&#146;s provision must be fleshed out on Report.
The hallmarks of this Bill have been the lack of definition and the
confusion among Ministers about who is included, how and when, to the
extent that they have promised us a record number of letters. I do not
mean to take anything away from them, as the Bill is highly technical
and legalistic, and it covers largely uncharted territory, but that
makes it all the more important that in Committee we receive real-life,
specific examples of how it is&#151;or is not&#151;likely to work
in practice.</div> <a name="06071456000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
who seek to abuse, particularly paedophiles and suchlike, are
exceedingly devious and will find ways of getting round the law and of
ingratiating themselves with trusting and vulnerable people. We have
heard many examples, and it is essential that the legislation is
crystal clear to those who are responsible for enforcing it and for
monitoring people who are in positions of trust with vulnerable groups
of adults and
children.</div><a name="06071456000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, we
are in the hands of the Government on their amendments, but we shall

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000506"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Again, these are probing amendments to try to
get to the definitions of exactly who is covered within various
health-related activities. We have dealt mostly with educational
establishments until now, and these three amendments are designed to
ensure that just about every health provider who should be included is
included, and that that is clear in the Bill. Again, this is a bit of a
grey area. I am sure that the Minister will be able to give those
assurances, but we need them on the
record.</div><a name="06071456000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
139 would add a further qualification of &#147;NHS body&#148;. The
national health service is an increasingly complicated and fragmented
body these days. We know that it relies on a good number of private,
independent and not-for-profit providers from outside for operations
and other services. There are shortcomings in the explanatory notes,
because the note to clause 15 does not mention that. The only body it
refers to is NHS
Professionals.</div><a name="06071456000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
reading of subsection (2) as drafted is that the only people covered
are those who are directly on the payroll of a hospital, primary care
trust and so on. If that is so, what is the status of a private firm
providing cataract operations and other providers of therapies, such as
physiotherapy, in a hospital, domestic or surgery environment who are
not directly on the payroll of a hospital or primary care trust but
have been contracted by that hospital or primary care trust for a
certain number of services? The amendment would also cover
single-handed employers, so I am not seeking to cover only firms that
provide those services and would be responsible for their own staff.
There are occasions when operations and treatments are contracted out
to a single-handed
provider.</div><a name="06071456000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know what
certain single-handed GPs in the form of Dr. Harold Shipman can get up
to. He did not just abuse his patients, he killed them. Obviously, that
is one of the most extreme examples, but some single-handed providers
contracted by certain health trusts are not GPs and would not be
covered by the safeguards that GPs and others in the NHS
have.</div><a name="06071456000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the mental
health field, freelance consultants tend to offer various cognitive
behavioural therapies and other forms of talking therapy and
counselling. They are not employed by an NHS trust, but are contracted
by it&#151;if they are lucky enough to be able to get hold of
one&#151;to provide those services. The clause does not appear to
cover such individuals, and I think that it should. What is the
difference when that private counsellor is contracted to a mental
health trust by an employee of the trust and is providing identical
services? Will the Minister justify why they should be treated
differently?</div><a name="06071456000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 140 is a probing one; I am not calling for an enormous extension to
the number of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 133</div>people covered by the provisions, but a question mark hangs over unpaid
workers. The NHS relies on a great many volunteers&#151;leagues of
friends and people who regularly offer their assistance to vulnerable
people. That assistance can include counselling services and driving
minibuses to take vulnerable people to and from their homes. We need to
be assured that, without making it so onerous and prescriptive that
people would not want to volunteer&#151;we must be very cautious
about that&#151;there will be checks and balances.
</div><a name="06071456000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have qualified
employment therefore as &#147;paid or unpaid&#148; because those
people are retained effectively by a hospital or PCT, but strictly
speaking are not employed. What facilities are available for the
monitoring of volunteers and other unpaid people who offer their
services, and who have frequent and continuing contact with vulnerable
groups of people?</div><a name="06071456000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 141, I am sure that there is a perfectly clear
explanation, but it is not in the Bill or the explanatory notes. Seven
NHS bodies are defined but there is no reference to a mental health or
social care trust. Perhaps by a definition somewhere in the Bill of
which I am unaware, such bodies come under a special health
authority&#151;I do not know. Either way, they need to be included,
because patients of those particular trusts are probably the most
vulnerable people of all in the NHS. So the amendment is a probing one
to see how a mental health trust, or a social care trust&#151;many
are increasingly becoming known as the latter, given the joint
operation between social services and mental health trusts&#151;will
be covered in the Bill. One would expect them to be in the list in
subsection (3), but they are not.</div>
<a name="06071456000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071456000507"></a><b class="B">Sarah
Teather</b> (Brent, East) (LD): Does the hon. Gentleman agree
that it is particularly important to ensure that social bodies are
covered, given the media coverage last week of patients being abused on
wards?</div><a name="06071456000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000508"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> The hon. Lady makes a pertinent point. The
report focused on the abuses in Cornwall and the most unacceptable
practices towards people with learning disabilities. In response to the
revelations in that report, we asked how the Bill would safeguard the
interests of people who had been abused, and about the
Government&#146;s investigation on whether such abuse is more
widespread than we
know.</div><a name="06071456000451"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="06071456000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000509"></a>Sarah
Teather:</b> I was actually referring to the Mind report about
women being sexually assaulted on mental health
wards.</div><a name="06071456000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000510"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> There has been a plethora of worrying reports in
the past week. One of them dealt with learning disabled people in
Cornwall. Another was the Mind report, which has been sat on by the
Department of Health for no good reason for the past eight months,
since November 2005. It contains a catalogue of at least 100
cases&#151;those are just the ones we know about&#151;of rape and
abuse of patients in mixed-sex mental health wards. The Government said
some 10 years ago that they were firmly against such wards and that
they were looking to phase them out, but mixed-sex wards remain
prevalent in the national 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 134</div>health service&#151;particularly in mental health trusts, and they
have become increasingly prevalent in those trusts in the past
12 months because of the financial pressures in the NHS that are having
a disproportionate impact on
them.</div><a name="06071456000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have visited a
number of mental health establishments in the past few months and there
are a number of examples of such establishments that now have mixed-sex
wards whereas previously they at least had some division between men
and women. In those establishments that still claim to have division of
wards, the divisions amount to a flimsy curtain or screen. Such a ward
cannot seriously be taken as a single-sex ward on any reasonable
definition.</div><a name="06071456000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
reports have come out in the past week; or rather, the existence of one
of them has come out, though it has yet to be published&#151;I hope
that the Minister will publish it soon. Given what we know from them
about the abuse that is happening, it is important that the legislation
protects people in mental health establishments, who are the most
vulnerable of all, and those with learning disabilities, both of which
groups are currently being threatened. Will the Minister therefore
confirm that such people will be covered by the Bill, and that the
reason why mental health and social care trusts are not mentioned
expressly is that they are covered either in the seven definitions of
NHS bodies or elsewhere in the
Bill?</div><a name="06071456000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000511"></a>Mr.
Lewis:</b> When the hon. Gentleman said that Ministers were a
little shaky on the earlier clause, it was he who failed to spot the
specific reference to sheltered housing. I shall not hold that against
him, however, because I acknowledge that he makes a legitimate point in
amendment No. 139. The amendment concerns contracted-out staff who work
for an organisation that provides services to the NHS. I shall go away
and examine the point and present the Government&#146;s view on
Report. We should consider not just those who are directly employed by
the NHS but those who provide services to the NHS through other
organisations. I do not know whether we can apply the same rules, but
the point is a legitimate one.</div>
<a name="06071456000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 140 is designed
to clarify that the arrangements apply to both paid and unpaid staff.
We have not sought to make the distinction in the clause or anywhere
else in the Bill. We believe that &#147;regulated activity&#148;
applies regardless of whether it is done formally or informally, so we
do not believe that the amendment is necessary.</div>
<a name="06071456000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first point that I shall
make on amendment No. 141 is that we are united&#151;across
the House&#151;in our outrage at what happened in Cornwall. At the
beginning of the 21st century such occurrences are completely
unacceptable, and the abuse and exploitation of people with learning
disabilities in such settings is unforgivable. It was significantly
systemic, as well as involving individual behaviour. We have a joint
responsibility to put in place whatever systems and levers we can to
minimise the risk of such abuse ever happening again. I do not use the
word &#147;eliminate&#148; because no Minister can ever promise
that, but it is our responsibility to minimise the risk of such actions
and behaviour ever being allowed to happen again.</div>
<a name="06071456000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the priorities in my new
responsibilities will be to examine these issues in the context of how
people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 135</div>with learning disabilities are treated more generally. My right hon.
Friend the Minister of State at the Health Department will be looking
at some of the issues that hon. Members raised about mental health
services as well.</div><a name="06071456000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn to something that is specifically linked to that point. A care
trust is used to described a partnership arrangement put in place by an
NHS trust or primary care trust and a local authority social services
authority. The status of the NHS trust or PCT concerned does not change
in these circumstances, and both the trust and the local authority
retain their original status, while changing the governance functions.
There is no other legal significance, and staff operating under
partnership arrangements will remain employed by the NHS trust, PCT or
local authority concerned. I can reassure the hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham that these partnership arrangements are therefore
adequately covered by paragraphs (a) and (g) as they stand. I give him
a categoric assurance that the concerns he expressed about a
partnership arrangement or a mental health trust will be covered fully
by the Bill.</div>
<a name="06071456000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000512"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. On amendment No.
141, I purely wanted to know where the definition of those trusts would
appear. The Minister seems adamant that they are covered in parts of
subsection (3). It is useful to have that stated, given the debate we
have just had.</div> <a name="06071456000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second point, that unpaid workers are fully covered, if I understand
the Minister rightly, will have many implications for voluntary
workers. I am not sure how extensive that coverage will be. Many of us
have been at pains to try to keep occasional volunteers out of such a
rigorous vetting system because they will be completely deterred
otherwise. If he says that my amendment is unnecessary in that respect,
we will take him at his word.</div>
<a name="06071456000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased, but alarmed,
about the Minister&#146;s acknowledgement that amendment No.139 might
have some merit because it is not covered in the Bill. He knows, in his
position as a Health Minister, just how much NHS work is now contracted
out across the piece, not just short operations and episodes, but
ongoing treatment, rehabilitation and mental health services, and
everything else. Such things are provided by the independent sector,
and in some cases by not-for-profit organisations.</div>
<a name="06071456000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not new. It has been
going on for a while and it is certainly taken into account when
dealing with other pieces of legislation. In respect of all the
children&#146;s legislation we have had in recent years, we raised
the question whether the private sector, to which work has been
contracted out, is covered. The Minister has always been able to give
us assurances that it is, which is what we
want.</div>
<a name="06071456000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000513"></a>Mr.
Lewis:</b> As I understand it, the specific issue that we are
discussing is that when people move around in jobs while directly
employed by the health service there will be no need to recheck them
constantly. The point that we are making in this narrow context is that
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 136</div>same principle ought to apply to those who are working in independent
organisations that provide services to the NHS, be they in the third
sector or the private sector. When I say that I will come back on this
on Report, it is not about needing to come back on the question of
those employed in independent sector organisations, because they would
be covered anyway. The issue is that when they move around in terms of
their employment status the same common-sense approach would be applied
to those workers as to those employed directly by the
NHS.</div>
<a name="06071456000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000514"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am not entirely sure that I follow that. The
Minister appeared to say earlier that he was not sure what measures in
the Bill covered not people who move around opting in and out of
working for the NHS but full-time independent providers, whether
single-handed or part of private firms, who do NHS work but are not
employed by an NHS body. Subsection (2) covers only people employed by
an NHS body.</div><a name="06071456000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thousands
of people working for the NHS without being employed by it are
providing operations and treatment to many vulnerable people and should
surely be treated on exactly the same basis as directly employed NHS
consultants, doctors, nurses, therapists, physiotherapists, mental
health counsellors or whatever who deal with the same cohorts of
vulnerable people. Surely there should be no differentiation between
those on the payroll of the local hospital trust or PCT and those
contracted through a firm or single-handedly to provide identical
services to patients. What matters at the end of the day is not
structures or who produces the employment dockets; it is patients and
the treatment that they are getting, whether from a private and
independent, a not-for-profit or a state-run, directly employed NHS
source.</div> <a name="06071456000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
disappointed. I had hoped that I would be reassured by the Minister
saying, &#147;Yes, it&#146;s a very good point. In this part of the
Bill, of course all those independent providers will be
covered.&#148; He might be able to say that now, from the looks of
it. If they are not, it should have been thought about earlier, and he
needs urgently to convince us now or on Report that they are covered.
If he wants to intervene to assure me now, that will be
welcome.</div><a name="06071456000181"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000515"></a>Mr.
Lewis:</b> The hon. Gentleman has an awful habit of making me
believe that something I had thought was absolutely certain is not
quite so certain, when in fact it is. Such people will be covered by
the definition of &#147;vulnerable adult&#148; in clause 44(1)(d)
and the definition of &#147;regulated activity&#148; in schedule 3
part 2. All the way through the Bill, I have said to him that I believe
that health services provided by the independent sector to meet the
needs of the national health service are covered in the mainstream part
of the Bill.</div> <a name="06071456000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said
in my contribution&#151;I gave the hon. Gentleman the credit for
raising an important issue; he is not very magnanimous on these
occasions&#151;that we are discussing whether people who move around
in their employment within the independent sector should have to
undergo repeated checks and monitoring or whether the same common-sense
approach used with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 137</div>directly employed national health service staff will not require them to
be checked on a multiplicity of occasions.</div>
<a name="06071456000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the point that I made
in my direct response to his amendment, which referred to the
inconsistency between the rules applying to directly employed NHS staff
and those applying to people commissioned from the independent sector
to provide a service to the NHS. There is no question about it. I give
him a final clarification that those working in the independent sector
who are contracted to provide services to the national health service
will be covered by the mainstream part of the Bill, and I can give him
specific
references.</div><a name="06071456000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000516"></a>Tim

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000518"></a>Tim

by saying that he would have a look at it and come back. After some
in-flight refuelling, he has been able to say that actually, there are
some definitions later in the Bill that will cover those people. That
is what I wanted to know. It is the answer that I should have had in
the first place, and the answer that he should have been able to give
off pat if he really knew who the Bill covers.</div>
<a name="06071456000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is pretty basic stuff.
Vulnerable people should be covered whether they are treated by an NHS
employee or by somebody who is not an NHS employee but a private,
independent provider of the same treatment. That is the simple question
that I asked at the outset. It was perfectly clear to all of us in the
Conservative party, and the amendment is simple and straightforward. At
last, and only because we have extended the debate slightly, we appear
to have the answer that the amendment was designed to elicit and that I
asked for some time ago. I am glad we have it now, and on that basis,

Loughton:</b> These are, again, probing amendments, but I hope
that we will not have to probe for quite so long this time before we
establish whether they are required. Amendment No. 142 concerns people
who have the &#147;opportunity to have access&#148; to the health
records of a vulnerable adult. The measure should not be limited to
health records because, after all, what constitutes a health record?
Does it cover only information that is provided by a GP or specialist?
What about forms of counselling that do not, strictly speaking,
constitute medical or health treatment? What about other records
containing detailed information about a vulnerable person&#146;s
family background, or traumatic events that have happened to them, such
as domestic sexual abuse?</div>
<a name="06071456000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">A paedophile could use records
of a vulnerable person&#146;s past traumatic experiences or difficult
domestic time as a child to exploit a chink in their armour and
ingratiate himself or herself with that vulnerable person. Those are
not health records, but if people can gain access to those sorts of
records, which I have termed as &#147;personal&#148;, surely they
too should be included. I believe that &#147;health records&#148;
is too narrow a definition, and I would be grateful for the
Minister&#146;s response as to whether more extensive personal
records could be just as useful, or even more useful, to a potential
abuser who could use that information to abuse a vulnerable
adult.</div> <a name="06071456000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
amendment also concerns the definition of health. I know that the
Minister will come straight back and tell me that it is not necessary
because it is covered in whatever paragraph such definitions are
covered. Hospital services are defined through six different
categories: a national health service trust,an NHS foundation
trust, a primary care trust, an independent hospital, an independent
clinic and an independent medical agency. At least this part of the
Bill has explicit references to the independent sectors, which is part
of the point that I was getting at earlier. However, it refers only to
establishments&#151;in effect, a hospital, clinic or medical
agency</div><a name="06071456000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;within the
meaning of that
section&#148;,</div><a name="06071456000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">which again is
rather vague. Surely what should be covered is an independent health
provider. It is the person who is going to do the damage if they are so
minded, rather than the establishment in which they are contracted to
work.</div><a name="06071456000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is
designed to probe whether&#151;perhaps this will be in schedule
3&#151;all independent personnel are covered. We want to know that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 139</div>independent personnel are not covered just by virtue of the fact that
they are working in an independent hospital, an independent clinic or
through an independent medical agency, because many such people will be
working in the homes of vulnerable people. That is what we are getting
at.</div><a name="06071456000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000522"></a>Mr.
Lewis:</b> I will try to help the hon. Gentleman. He accepts,
to some extent, that these are probing amendments. Controlled activity
will include access to the health records of a vulnerable adult.
Amendment No. 142 would add the words &#147;or personal&#148; after
the word &#147;health&#148;. &#147;Health records&#148; is a
clearly understood term and is intended to cover all records that
relate to a person&#146;s physical and mental condition. The
amendment would extend that to other personal
records.</div><a name="06071456000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that the intention is to ensure that access to records of a similar
level of sensitivity is included in controlled activity. The problem is
that the additional words are wide and nebulous and might cover things,
such as bank records, that we do not intend to
catch.</div><a name="06071456000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">That said, I
will offer the hon. Gentleman some assurances on the regulation-making
power in subsection (5)(c). That gives the Secretary of State the power
to prescribe</div><a name="06071456000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;other
information...relating to a vulnerable
adult.&#148;</div><a name="06071456000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">We intend to use
that power to prescribe clearly and accurately social care records
relating to a vulnerable adult. Such records are clearly of a personal
nature, but will be described in regulations so as to make them clearly
identifiable. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that
reassurance. We will use the power to be clear about what &#147;other
information&#148;
means.</div><a name="06071456000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000523"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Would that include records of counselling? I
gave the example of someone who has had a traumatic child abuse
experience and has received counselling. Such a record is not a health
record, but it is a record of some form of counselling. Is that
specifically intended to be included in the prescription to which the
Minister
referred?</div><a name="06071456000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000524"></a>Mr.
Lewis:</b> I can assure the hon. Gentleman that that example
would be covered in those circumstances. He makes a perfectly
legitimate point. The situation that he describes would be incredibly
sensitive.</div><a name="06071456000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 143 deals with independent health providers and those who are
employed in those sectors. The amendment is genuinely unnecessary, as
independent health providers are included in paragraphs (d), (e) and
(f) of the list. Those providers are required to register with the
Healthcare Commission pursuant to part 2 of the Care Standards Act
2000. That will include providers who contract with the NHS. Where the
NHS contracts with providers outside the regulated sector&#151;an
example might be an acupuncturist&#151;it will be possible to ensure
that the appropriate checks are made through the contracts issued. The
contract will provide an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 140</div>opportunity for the commissioner to make it clear what checks are
expected in the case of a provider outside the regulated
sector.</div><a name="06071456000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 159 to 161 are minor and technical, making consequential
amendments to adjust references in the Bill to national health service
legislation to ensure that the references are consistent with those in
the National Health Service (Consequential Provisions) Bill. On that
basis, I hope that hon. Members will not press their amendments and
that they will support the Government
amendments.</div><a name="06071456000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000525"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am grateful for that clarification. It is as
easy as that&#151;I asked a specific question with the probing
amendments and the Minister has been able to agree that the provision
will cover counselling such as that in the example that I gave and that
such scenarios will be included in the regulations to be issued by the
Secretary of State. That is reassuring, and we therefore do not need to
press amendment No. 142 to a vote. He has also explicitly referred me
to definitions in another part of the Bill that make amendment No. 143
redundant. On that basis, and with delight, I beg to ask leave to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000528"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> A great deal of the Bill is complex and technical.
Indeed, that was one of the first things the Minister said when we
began our discussions. Nowhere is that more true than in the
introduction of the concept of controlled activity. Employers are
required to check the barred status of an employee, but with the
discretion to employ barred individuals if appropriate safeguards are
in place. The provision covers many health, further education and
social care
settings.</div><a name="06071456000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
is pivotal in as much as it provides for statutory guidance on the
steps that employers should take when employing individuals in
controlled activities. The amendments in my name and the names of my
hon. Friends are intended to do three things: tighten the language to
ensure that guidance is issued, which is not how the Bill is currently
worded, ensure that there is a full and open debate on what should be
included in the guidance, and ensure that that guidance is acted on.
Those are three simple objectives, and they are vital because guidance
on the matter cannot be viewed as an optional extra. It must be issued,
and that is not how the Bill is currently
worded.</div><a name="06071456000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guidance
needs to be debated in full using the affirmative procedure. It is an
important element and I would have preferred to see it in the Bill. The
Government have chosen to do it in another way, but we need to ensure
that we do not lose the opportunity to debate the issues in full. We
also need to know how the guidance is being acted on. It is important
that employers do not just need to have regard to it.</div>
<a name="06071456000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government do not always
have a good record in this area. The Minister will no doubt remember
the recent Ofsted report on employment practices in schools. It showed
a considerable amount of confusion and inconsistency among employers as
to their duties and obligations under the various laws and regulations
that have been issued. I am sure that the Minister and other members of
the Committee will remember that we were unable to discuss the report
in detail on Second Reading because, for some reason that still remains
rather vague, it was not fully available to all hon. Members. I wish
therefore to take this opportunity to go through one or two of its
findings, which are pertinent to the
debate.</div><a name="06071456000453"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="06071456000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
confusion, hon. Members who have read the report will have
read:</div><a name="06071456000438"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Schools
and LAs are confused about what action they need to take about existing
staff members. The messages from the CRB, via the DfES, are not making
the situation clear.&#148;</div><a name="06071456000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is clear that regulations and rules can often be misleading and are not
helping employers in such 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 142</div>situations. That underlines the point made in the amendments, which is
that the regulations need better and fuller debate than they have
received in recent
years.</div><a name="06071456000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Ofsted
report also found many instances of inconsistency, including poor
record keeping by schools and local authorities on employment checks,
and a widespread belief in schools that somebody else was checking
staff, with the result that nobody carried out those essential checks.
On page two of the report, Ofsted
says:</div><a name="06071456000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Such
practice lacks rigour and
thoroughness&#148;.</div><a name="06071456000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The report
also says that the letter from the then Secretary of State on 19
January 2006, which was intended to clarify the rules following the
problems over list 99 and paedophiles in schools, added to the
confusion. Many schools thought that the rules had suddenly changed,
with the result that a further letter had to be sent out on 25 January
to clarify the position. Again, that adds weight to the argument that
these issues have not been dealt with well under current practices.
That is why the amendments are
important.</div><a name="06071456000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">As with so
much in the Bill, a lot of the important detail has been left to
regulations. Without adequate scrutiny, the risk is that processes will
not be subject to thorough debate and discussion. We could continue to
make the mistakes that the Government have been making if we do not
change the way we do things. Amendments Nos. 115, 118 and amendment No.
131, tabled by the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon), work towards
guarding against such a situation and would ensure that regulations on
employers&#146; duties receive full debate and approval in
Parliament. They would also ensure that employers acted in accordance
with such regulations and did not just have to take regard to them,
thereby preventing some of the confusion and inconsistency that Ofsted
so graphically outlined in its
report.</div><a name="06071456000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
essential that we set out the framework clearly and unequivocally.
Otherwise, how can we expect schools and other employers to follow
through? If we fail to do so, we are just creating a future problem for
ourselves. The loose language, which has been a theme within the
debate, does not help us communicate and does little to ensure
consistency in
future.</div><a name="06071456000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
would also address a significant hole in the Bill, whereby employers
may employ a barred individual in situations where they might not
normally directly come into unsupervised contact with children and
vulnerable adults&#151;for example, a receptionist in a
dentist&#146;s surgery. Although that would add an extra layer of
complication, the amendments generally attempt to prevent the current
confusion. The amendments will, hopefully, guard against the
inconsistency that Ofsted says is currently occurring and improve the
Bill.</div><a name="06071456000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000529"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I am disappointed with some of the comments from
Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen, who must either have got out of bed
on the wrong side or have a short memory about safeguarding when they
were in power. The hon. Lady has a short memory, too, in respect of the
debate on Second Reading, when she was prevented from reading from a
report because it had been leaked to her. She was selective then and
she 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 143</div>is selective now about what that report said. It actually said that a
lot of good work was taking place in schools and that they are far
safer places than they used to be. However, a lot of work needs to be
done on checking records. If the hon. Lady wants to play political
games on an issue that I felt had some level of all-party support, that
is a matter for
her.</div><a name="06071456000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000530"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="06071456000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000531"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> No, I will not. Labour Members have shown great
restraint in listening to Opposition Members going on and on about a
system that they claim to support, yet never mentioning their own
record. However, I shall speak to the amendments and try to take some
of the heat out of the debate.</div>
<a name="06071456000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intention behind amendments
Nos. 115 and 108 is, in different ways, to strengthen the provision in
the Bill for ensuring that controlled activity providers take the
necessary steps when employing individuals in controlled activities. As
my right hon. Friend the Minister for Children and Families said on
Second Reading, we are doing further work on the sanctions that might
apply in relation to controlled activity. That work is considering
whether the current provision is sufficient, albeit not only in the
ways suggested by the wording of the amendments. Before that work is
completed, I would not want to rule out any option, including the
wording of the amendments. For that reason, it would be premature to
accept either of them at this stage. However, I intend to return with a
final position on Report. With that reassurance, I hope that the hon.
Lady will see fit to withdraw the amendment.
</div><a name="06071456000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 131
stands in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend. First, we
would certainly expect employers undertaking controlled activity to
conduct a full risk assessment before employing an individual who was
on a barred list. That would be critical to determining the appropriate
safeguards that needed to be put in place. Secondly, we intend to
consult stakeholders on the specific safeguards that need to be put in
place when engaging a barred individual. Providing that detail in the
Bill at this stage would pre-empt critical consultation with key
stakeholders on what is an important issue, as I am sure my hon. Friend
will understand. Lastly, it is essential to retain flexibility. It
would be very difficult, for example, to change the steps that
employers need to take as new best practice emerges if the risk
assessment is set out in the Bill.</div>
<a name="06071456000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given those points and the fact
that I will take on board the wording of amendment No. 131 when we
consider the issue before Report, I hope that the hon. Member for
Basingstoke will withdraw the amendment. Before she does so, however,
if she has such concerns about a receptionist working in a dental
service, perhaps she could explain whether it is her view that such a
person who has been on a barred list should not be employed in
controlled activity with safeguards in place, because we would be
delighted to hear the Opposition&#146;s policy on
that.</div><a name="06071456000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000532"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I am not sure that anyone is implying that we
should not have safeguards in place. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 144</div>Minister should perhaps remember that we are here to listen to what the
Government&#146;s policy is, not to debate the Opposition. However,
if he would like to swap places, we would be more than happy to try to
improve the Bill and make it much better not only for those of us on
the Committee, but those who have to try to put it into practice. We
have heard constructive ways of trying to improve the Bill from my hon.
Friends and Liberal Democrat Members, so it is somewhat disappointing
that at the first sign of identifying the problem, the
Minister&#146;s reaction is defensive.</div>
<a name="06071456000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">My comments about the Ofsted
report related to the Government&#146;s communication failures. They
gave the report to the press in advance of Second Reading, but not to
Opposition spokespeople, which put us in a difficult position. However,
that is in the past and I do not want to dwell on it. We are talking
about the safety of children and vulnerable adults, not the
sensibilities of the Government and the way in which they choose to
leak their information.</div>
<a name="06071456000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clearly disappointing to
my hon. Friends and I that the Government are not willing to learn from
their mistakes. Amendments Nos. 115 and 108 are constructive, and try
to solve the problems that the Government have experienced in
communicating to the many people who will be affected by the Bill.
However, they are not willing to learn from the communication problems
of the past. We should ensure that it is clear to employers that the
guidance is not merely something to take heed of and simply
&#147;have regard to&#148;, but that it should be put in place and
acted in accordance with. That is a different form of words. The
amendment would fundamentally change the way in which employers would
consider the guidance, and it is disappointing that the Minister does
not seem to understand or appreciate that difference.</div>
<a name="06071456000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all share the objective of
improving the Bill, and we are scrutinisers in that matter. We have an
obligation to put forward what we feel would constitute an improvement.
Clearly, the Minister has heard the issues and perhaps he will have
time to reflect in a more measured manner outside the Committee. I hope
that he will have time to reflect on the amendments before Report, and
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000535"></a>Joan

Secretary of State to prescribe additional requirements that must be
fulfilled before a person is regarded as being subject to monitoring
within the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 145</div>meaning of clause 21. The current criteria are that the individual is
not barred and has satisfied the prescribed identification and
application requirements. Only a person who is subject to monitoring
may engage in regulated activity for a regulated activity provider.
Amendment No. 162 widens clause 21(1)(c) so that the prescribed
requirements do not relate merely to identification. Amendments Nos.
163 and 164 make consequential changes to the other parts of the clause
that relate to identification.</div>
<a name="06071456000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would allow
requirements to be added to the identification requirements that must

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000538"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> Before talking about the amendments, I should
first like to comment on online checks. A key feature of the new scheme
is the facility for online checks, which will allow an
individual&#146;s up-to-date status to be checked quickly by
prospective employers. The checks will be available to a wider range of
employers than is the case at present, and will include private
employers such as parents for the first time.</div>
<a name="06071456000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have been consistent in
underlining, as Sir Michael Bichard did, that the ultimate
responsibility for deciding whether to employ an individual, must be
the employer&#146;s. It is our responsibility to ensure that there is
reliable, clear information to help to support that decision, but the
information provided by the vetting and barring scheme will be only one
element in the overall judgment. That does not remove or replace the
responsibility of the
employer.</div><a name="06071456000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister for Children and Families said on Second Reading, in our work
on the design of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 146</div>vetting and barring scheme, we explored some of the details involving
the security and implementation of the online check facility, which led
us to amend its design. First and foremost, we must ensure that
employers and parents can access the information they need to inform
recruitment decisions quickly, easily and reliably.</div>
<a name="06071456000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Showing explicitly via the
online check that a person is barred would require elaborate security
procedures. Given the sensitivity of the information, that would
seriously obstruct the speed and ease of access of the
facility.</div><a name="06071456000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000539"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Is one reason why there has been a delay that
individuals can hack into the system, not just to look at information
on other people but actually to change it so that it shows, for
example, that a person is barred, rather than unbarred? Has the
Minister encountered that problem, which has occurred in the United
States?</div><a name="06071456000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000540"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> No. I have worked with officials on the scheme but
that has not been a principal issue. It is a matter of getting the
right structure and process in place to give the right information. I
will come to that in a moment, when the hon. Lady may wish to respond
to what I say with further comments and questions.</div>
<a name="06071456000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will table amendments on
Report that will change the online check to show whether an individual
is subject to monitoring, which is confirmation that he is being vetted
by the scheme and is not barred. That fundamental reassurance will
enable the employer to proceed to the other checks that are necessary
on recruitment, such as taking up references and verifying
qualifications. We will table similar amendments to clause 26 so that
employers are notified that monitoring has ceased, rather than that the
individual has been barred.</div>
<a name="06071456000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">When an individual is shown as
not subject to monitoring, it may mean that he has not yet applied to
the scheme, that he has withdrawn from it or that he is barred. For
regulated activity providers recruiting to a regulated activity, the
effect is the same: they can employ only people who are subject to
monitoring, as the Bill lays down. We shall ensure that the online
check facility provides clear messages for employers and parents about
the implications of an employee being subject, or not subject, to
monitoring and the further steps they need to take in recruiting. We
shall develop and test those messages as we prepare for
implementation.</div><a name="06071456000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
revised approach to the information conveyed by the online check will
ensure that it directly supports employers&#146; needs and helps them
to find appropriate staff, and that notification will be quick. We are
committed to delivering the improvements that online checks offer and
to implementing them in the most effective way. No one will forgive us
if we do not develop the best possible system to protect children and
vulnerable
adults.</div><a name="06071456000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over time, we
would like as many people as possible to be monitored in the vetting
and barring scheme. We intend that the scheme will encourage employees
in the relevant work forces to be monitored and employers to use good
employment practice and recruit only those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 147</div>who have been vetted and who are monitored. The monitoring will ensure
that information about employees is continuously updated and that
employers are notified of changes in status. That approach to the
online check will help to secure the benefits of monitoring while
ensuring that employers have fast and easy access to information about
employees&#146;
status.</div><a name="06071456000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000541"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I did not get an answer from the Minister&#146;s
comments to a very simple question. Who will be responsible for the
accuracy of the online scheme and who will be responsible for any
errors that are
made?</div><a name="06071456000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000542"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000545"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> The two amendments deal with the same problem. I
suppose that we are trying to give ourselves an option, with two
different ways to solve it. It is not only we who have identified the
problem; those who debated the issue in the other place and a great
many of those involved in the Government&#146;s extensive
consultations have highlighted their concerns about overseas workers.
Again, it is somewhat disappointing that, despite all the consultation,
nothing in the Bill helps employers further.</div>
<a name="06071456000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments are probing.
They address the problem of overseas workers. It was identified as
important not only in the post-Bichard consultation but by a great many
other groups that were consulted by the Government. I said in February,
on Second Reading, that my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr.
Willetts) had written to the then Secretary of State for Education and
Skills asking for assurances in respect of overseas workers in schools.
The Minister said on Second Reading that he would follow the matter up,
because we had not received a reply to that letter. Unfortunately, we
still await a reply. Perhaps the Minister is still undecided. If so, I
hope that he accepts the amendments as constructive solutions to a
problem that has yet to be resolved. I shall therefore consider them in
more detail.</div><a name="06071456000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind
the Minister of the statistics. There is a growing number of overseas
workers in all the sectors under the Bill that deal with vulnerable
adults and children. Almost one in five nurses and one in three medical
practitioners come from overseas. About18 per cent. of social
workers and 15 per cent. of carer assistants come from overseas. They
work with some of the most vulnerable people in quasi-domestic
settings.</div> <a name="06071456000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we all
know, overseas workers make a vital contribution in schools, hospitals,
care homes and many of the other settings covered by the Bill. It is
important that we find a way to deal with them as a set 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 150</div>of workers within our communities. The Bill must offer a robust system
to ensure that those workers who come from overseas can, whenever
possible, enjoy the same affirmation for their role in the workplace as
those from the UK. We need to work a little harder on that
problem.</div><a name="06071456000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have read
the many notes that Lord Adonis sent with the Bill to clarify those
areas that are a little opaque. One note contained details of the
Government&#146;s work in setting up agreements with certain
countries. It is interesting to note that the countries that the
Government are making a priority are Australia and Canada. We welcome
that important move, but I am concerned that it does not adequately
address the problem. The official statistics show that the majority of
overseas workers who deal with children and vulnerable adults come from
Africa, Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Perhaps the Minister will
take the opportunity afforded by this debate to outline what the
Government are doing in relation to those other parts of the world,
which cover the majority of people from overseas working
here.</div> <a name="06071456000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
194 and 195 would broaden the scope of clause 35(7). Instead of
allowing the Secretary of State merely to draw up regulations on
arrangements with Northern Ireland and Scotland, he would be able to
draw up regulations that included all countries and territories, which
would obviously cover all overseas workers.</div>
<a name="06071456000455"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="06071456000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
194 would have the added advantage of allowing us, should the country
in question not maintain a relevant list in the way in which we do, to
look at the relevant criminal charge or conviction and assess whether
it would lead to barring in this country. We could then take
appropriate action. </div><a name="06071456000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have outlined the statistics. This is not a peripheral matter that can
be put to one side. It has been suggested that we could deal with this
group of people as though they had never put themselves forward for
monitoring before and were fresh on our database. The number of
overseas workers in this country is growing. They are important, and we
need to ensure that the Bill shows them the level of respect that they
deserve regarding their roles within our community. The amendments give
the Minister the opportunity to respond to several questions on the
issue.</div><a name="06071456000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is not a
unique problem. In many other areas, individuals from overseas are
dealt with adequately. In the realms of the legal profession, there are
recognised ways of acknowledging overseas lawyers. Perhaps, in reaching
his decision the Minister could consider such examples outside of our
proceedings. I hope that we can find a better way of dealing with this
important group of
people.</div><a name="06071456000297"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000546"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I agree entirely that overseas workers are
important, not least when their children become MPs and
Ministers.</div><a name="06071456000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments relate to foreign barred lists, foreign offences, and the
duty on the Secretary of State to notify the keepers of certain
registers&#151;registersof medical practitioners and social
workers, for example&#151;such as the General Medical Council, when 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 151</div>a person is subject to certain disqualifications. Amendment No. 194,
which is a probing amendment, would require the Secretary of State to
notify the keepers of such registers when he becomes aware that an
individual has been charged or convicted in another country of a
criminal offence that would have led to consideration about whether
that person should be barred if it had been committed in the
UK.</div><a name="06071456000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both amendments
would ensure that the keepers of such registers were notified if the
Secretary of State became aware that an individual was included on any
foreign barred list specified by the Secretary of State. That sounds
reasonable, in essence, but this Bill is not the appropriate vehicle by
which to introduce new measures about the treatment of foreign
offences. The Government have already introduced a number of measures
to tackle the issue of foreign offences. They include notification
orders, which ensure that people who are convicted of sex offences
overseas are made to sign the sex offenders register in the UK, and
sexual offences prevention orders, which can also applyto
offenders who are convicted of sexual or violent offences
overseas.</div> <a name="06071456000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take on
board the hon. Lady&#146;s point about not wanting to start from
scratch and to consider just offences in the UK. That is exactly what
we are doing. However, there is a way in which the Bill allows us to
take account of overseas offences. Paragraph 20 of schedule 2 allows
the Secretary of State to specify that, in addition to UK convictions
and cautions, the following criteria qualify a person for automatic
barring: orders such as sexual offences prevention orders and
notification orders, which I just mentioned; inclusion in a foreign
barred list equivalent to the children and vulnerable adults barred
list; and overseas orders or directions. The regulations prescribing
those criteria are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. In
addition, under the discretionary route, the IBB will, of course, be
able to take account of any information regarding offences or behaviour
abroad when it receives that information. The Bill therefore ensures
that the barring scheme can take account of offences committed
abroad.</div> <a name="06071456000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary
of State already has a duty under the Bill to notify the keepers of
relevant registers when an individual is barred, and that will achieve
the intended effect of the amendment, without the need for a separate
set of information to flow to the keepers of registers about foreign
offences and lists, with which they are not necessarily familiar and to
which they may not know how to respond. I hope that with that on the
record, the hon. Lady will not press her probing
amendments.</div><a name="06071456000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000547"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for taking the time
to outline what is already in the Bill, but I remain a little confused
as to why so much emphasis and effort have been put into negotiating
agreements with Canada and Australia, but not other countries from
which we receive many overseas workers. He said that the amendments
sound reasonable, but that the relevant issues are already dealt with
in the Bill. Surely, if he agrees that the amendments are reasonable,
and given that they merely clarify what is already in the Bill, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 152</div>would not it be entirely sensible to make it clearer to the employers
who will have to try to interpret this legislation that specific
actions need to be taken with regard to overseas
employees?</div><a name="06071456000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I expected
the Minister to say something slightly different&#151;that, as we are
talking about employment practices, the Bill might not be the right
place in which to articulate the need for more vigilance with
employment, given that the criminal records of individuals might not be
fully available to us. I would have been open to an argument that we
need to consider other ways in which to communicate that to
employers&#151;perhaps through codes of practice. The
Minister&#146;s intention might be to cover overseas employees, but I
am concerned that the Bill is a little hazy on
that.</div><a name="06071456000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000548"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> When I said what I said about the amendments being
reasonable, I was not in any way accepting that they would be
reasonable amendments to the Bill. It is fair to say that more work
needs to be done on the matter, and the Government are committed to
doing that. It is also worth considering that there is an issue about
the reliability of criminal records in areas such as Africa and Asia.
With the European Community initiative, we are doing a great deal to
share information across national boundaries. We will continue to do
that work and build on it through regulations made under the
Bill.</div><a name="06071456000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000549"></a>Mrs.

glad to hear him say that more work needs to be done on that, and that
he acknowledges that further debate is important. As he agrees that
that area has not been resolved, I look forward to the Government
introducing further amendments on the issue on
Report.</div><a name="06071456000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
talked about the reliability of criminal records in other countries. I
did not go into that issue only because I do not have any concrete
evidence on it to hand. If, as he asserted, there is an issue with
reliability, I invite him to explain what support and help the
Government will give to employers to ensure that they are aware, when
they employ people from overseas, that there might be a slight hole in
the information that is available about the previous employment and
behaviour of those employees. Perhaps he would care to consider that
further on Report. Given that we have had a good discussion on the
issue, I am happy to withdraw my amendment, and hope that the

is a quick one, but it is important, and I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s response on it. The rules and regulations that we are
discussing will have an impact on many thousands of people&#151;I
believe that the Government estimate that up to 9 million people will
be covered by this monitoring, vetting and barring
procedure&#151;and, as the Minister acknowledged in Committee and on
Second Reading, mistakes will be made. We highlighted the fact that the
CRB has made 3,000 mistakes since it was set up. The Minister thought
it appropriate to say that that was a small proportion of the total
number of people who have been looked at, and that many thousands of
people have been prevented from working with children and vulnerable
adults as a result of the procedures put in place under the
CRB.</div> <a name="06071456000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mistakes will
undoubtedly be made; that has been acknowledged. I am sure that nobody
in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 154</div>Committee or who looks at this Bill will be complacent about that. The
objective behind the amendment is to ensure that adequate compensation
is in place if mistakes are made. There is a provision in the Bill that
states that people will be able to claim their rights under other
legislation, but I am not sure whether that goes far enough. There must
be some accountability to ensure that data held by the IBB about
barring, and the decisions that it makes based on that information are
correct. We are talking about people&#146;s livelihoods and
reputations, and the amendment would create an incentive for the IBB to
get it right and ensure that people have a more apparent and readily
accessible form of redress if things go wrong. I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s response on the matter, which will be of great
interest to many
people.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000551"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I am in quite a helpful mood today, Mr.
Martlew. It is extremely important that appropriate measures are in
place to correct any mistakes that are made under the new scheme. If an
individual is included in a barred list as a result of an error such as
mistaken identity, the IBB will be able to remove them from the list,
much as I described tothe hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North
Poole the other day. In cases in which the error is the responsibility
of the CRB, it will, as now, consider providing ex gratia consolatory
financial redress, based on the Treasury&#146;s guidelines that the
individual must be put back into the position in which they could
reasonably have expected to be but for the error or
maladministration.</div><a name="06071456000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
IBB decisions, a distinction must be made between the different types
of cases that might arise. In cases in which the IBB&#146;s decision
to include the individual in a barred list is later overturned in an
appeal, the appeal process will rectify the situation, and the case
will be reconsidered as appropriate.</div>
<a name="06071456000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">The IBB will also be able to
initiate a review of its own accord&#151;for example, where a
conviction which led to a person&#146;s inclusion on the barred list
is quashed. Proceedings before the IBB are of a quasi-judicial nature,
so it would be inappropriate to allow claims for damages. However,
there may be cases in which individuals were included on the barred
list as a result of maladministration by the IBB in which some form of
compensatory payment might be warranted. Any new scheme of financial
redress would need to comply with Government accounting requirements
that underpin such arrangements under this and previous
Administrations.</div>
<a name="06071456000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000552"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> That is an interesting point. The Minister says
that the IBB is a quasi-judicial body, but I was not aware that a
non-departmental public body could be quasi-judicial. Either it has the
role of a tribunal in a court situation, or it has not. If it has the
role of a judicial body, then, obviously, damages are dealt with in a
very different way, but if it is a non-departmental public body, it
does not have quasi-judicial powers and should therefore be open to
damages in the same way as any other body of a similar description.
Will the Minister clarify that?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 155</div><a name="06071456000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000553"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I am always happy to widen the hon. Lady&#146;s
knowledge of these matters. I think I did so the other day, too. She

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000555"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> So am I; it does not seem to help, does
it?</div> <a name="06071456000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that I
have made it fairly clear&#151;the IBB is quasi-judicial&#151;in
the same way that we clarified matters about the burden of proof on
which the IBB is working. I do not see any issues or complexities with
that, and I urge the hon. Lady to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06071456000327"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000556"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I shall go away and consult our lawyer. It was
entirely my impression that non-departmental public bodies do not have
quasi-judicial powers. Perhaps the Minister can consult his lawyers and
I can consult mine and we can come to a better conclusion.</div>
<a name="06071456000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a serious note, the type of
errors that we are discussing will be of exceptional importance to the
people about whom they are made. We therefore need to ensure that there
is an incentive for the IBB to ensure that such errors are kept to a
minimum, and that those involved get the compensation that they
should.</div> <a name="06071456000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
Minister for clarifying the situation with the CRB and ex gratia
payments, but I would like to leave open the issue of the IBB and its
role and status. Perhaps he will write to me about that; I certainly
would like more clarification on that point, but I will withdraw the
amendment at this stage. Perhaps we will revisit this matter when we
have received more expert opinion. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06071456000330"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000560"></a>Mr.
Lewis:</b> Amendment No. 173 is designed to narrow the
circumstances in which a pregnant woman or a nursing mother may be
considered vulnerable. I think that the Opposition share our concern
that, as drafted, the clause is far too wide. For example, the teacher
of an antenatal yoga class would at present be regarded as undertaking
a regulated activity.</div>
<a name="06071456000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would tighten
that definition and limit it to those groups that receive community
care services. As a result, only those staff who work closely with
pregnant women or nursing mothers in the provision of community care
services will be subject to monitoring, and barred people will not be
able to undertake such work. For example, the tighter definition would
include some health visitors that deliver community care services to
new mums. We want to ensure that women in those circumstances have the
same reassurances about the staff working with them as others using
community care services. I hope that the Opposition accept that
including a tighter a definition of the receipt of community care
services for pregnant women is sensible.</div>
<a name="06071456000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
174 is a minor, technical and consequential amendment to adjust
references to national health service legislation, to ensure that those
references are consistent with those in the NHS Consolidation Bill. I
hope that the hon. Members for Basingstoke and for East Worthing and
Shoreham accept what I have said about the definition and that they
will not feel it necessary to press amendment No.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000561"></a>Mrs.

was rather surprised when I first read the clause to find that all

struck me as a retrograde, sexist and insulting way of categorising
women who are pregnant or nursing.</div>
<a name="06071456000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having been pregnant three
times&#151;perhaps other female Members have been pregnant&#151;I
was surprised that the Minister should allow the Bill to include such a
provision. Times have moved on since the days when it was thought that
women were fragile and in need of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 157</div>special attention purely because they were pregnant. I hope that I can
draw on the support of other women in the room on that
matter.</div><a name="06071456000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was unaware
that the Government had noticed that rather large mistake, so I raised
the issue with the National Childbirth Trust, which does much excellent
work in that area. It was rather shocked; it clearly had not been
consulted. I understand that, at that point, it contacted the
Department, which may have led to the Government amendments. I
acknowledge the fact that it was clearly a drafting error, but given
that the Bill has been so long in the drafting, it is concerning that
such a sizeable mistake could have been make. I am glad that the
Government have seen the error of their ways. I am glad not to have to

meet the criteria for referral under clause 31, so it will still be
important to share information with the police to feed possible future
disclosures to the IBB under part 1 of the Police Act 1997.</div>
<a name="06071456000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sharing information and
building up a picture may be relevant in connection with individuals
who later seek work with children. We want a proper protocol from the
word go. Some of it will be soft information, and it is difficult to
know how that is to be handled. We know from the Soham tragedy that
there were many bits of information about Huntley but that they were
never pulled together.</div>
<a name="06071456000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister will
give a full response, as what the new clause seeks is comparable with
the approach taken in &#147;Every Child
Matters&#148;.</div>
<a name="06071456000365"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000564"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I shall try to give the full response that the
hon. Lady seeks. New clause 1 would impose a duty on the Secretary of
State to issue guidance to police forces and local authorities on
sharing information for the purposes of safeguarding children and
vulnerable adults. It is an important area of practice, but it is
covered in existing guidance.</div>
<a name="06071456000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Working Together to
Safeguard Children&#148; explains the circumstances in which
information needs to be shared in the course of action being taken to
safeguard children. &#147;Information sharing: practitioner&#146;s
guide&#148; provides practitioners across all children&#146;s
services with clear guidance on when and how they can share information
legally and professionally. The two guidance documents were published
in April 2006, and together they provide an effective framework for
sharing information between local authorities, police forces, health
organisations and
others.</div>
<a name="06071456000457"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="06071456000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">Significant
progress has also been made on implementing the recommendations aimed
at improving police management of information contained in the Bichard
report. Regular progress reports have been provided to Parliament.
Guidance to the police on information management and sharing was issued
in March under the code of practice on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 159</div>police information management. Police and local authorities will also
have regard to the guidance in &#147;Working Together to Safeguard
Children&#148;.</div>
<a name="06071456000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the circumstances, we do
not believe that further guidance is required at present. I therefore
ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the motion.</div>
<a name="06071456000369"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000565"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I can quite see the point of existing guidance. My
one concern is what will trigger further changes. Perhaps lacking at
the moment is the trigger for work to be done on such protocols. The
advantage of having something in the Bill is that it would focus the
mind on the need for continual monitoring and revising in this
important area. I am happy to withdraw motion.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000566"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="06071456000373"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000567"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss new
clause 3&#151;<i class="I">Other organisations: duty to provide information on
request&#151;</i></div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1) This
section applies if IBB is
considering&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) whether
to include any person in a barred list; or</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000568"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Again, the new clauses are probing. I wish to
touch on other areas that we feel are not fully covered by the Bill.
One gives power to organisations to refer cases to the IBB, and the
other suggests that other organisations should have the duty to provide
information on request. They both tackle the same area, and I seek a
little more detail on the responsibilities and duties of those other
organisations. </div><a name="06071456000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
debates in the other place, the Government clarified that under the
Bill it would be possible for other bodies that do not have a duty to
refer cases to the IBB to do so. Examples that have been mentioned in
discussions include doctors, psychologists, some NGOs,
Barnardo&#146;s and the National Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children; they will obviously encounter cases in which they
believe that an individual&#146;s conduct is of concern, in that they
pose a risk to children or vulnerable adults, and they may want to
refer such cases to the IBB.</div>
<a name="06071456000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be helpful if the
Minister were further to clarify the Department&#146;s thinking on
referrals. For example, will the criteria for such referrals be based
on the criteria set out in clause 31 on referrals from local
authorities, as the new clauses suggests? What might happen in terms of
the IBB seeking more information from the referrer? Unlike local
authorities, under clause 32, those other organisations have no
requirement to provide prescribed information; the starting point might
be for those bodies to provide information, but what happens if the IBB
wants more information? That is how the new clauses are
linked.</div> <a name="06071456000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
would organisations that refer conduct cases to the IBB outside the
statutory scheme be able to avail themselves of the protections against
damages set out in clause 42? Do the Government agree that bona fide
referrals should be protected, as are those from local authorities? I
should like clarification on that, because it could make referral
either less likely or more likely. I await the Minister&#146;s
response.</div> <a name="06071456000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have gone
through my questions rather quickly, and shall be happy to intervene on
the Minister if he asks me to. I hope that he sees that the new clauses
are two sides of the same coin, dealing first with an offer and then
with a need on the part of the IBB to seek more information. We can
imagine how that would happen; as MPs in our surgeries, we sometimes
get a little information but need to know more about a situation before
we can proceed.</div> <a name="06071456000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have put that into context and that the Minister will
address the questions. I hasten to say that these are probing
new clauses. The issue of organisations offering up information will be
really important; it represents new territory beyond the
confidentiality that we have had so much of in the
past.</div><a name="06071456000380"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000569"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> We are discussing two probing new clauses; that is
unusual, as we usually talk of probing amendments. However, I welcome
them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 161</div><a name="06071456000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill does not prevent an
organisation or individual from referring information to the IBB when
it or he is not under a duty to do so. The Bill also provides that the
IBB must consider any information that it receives from whatever source
and of whatever nature. New clause 2 would create a power for any
organisation to refer information to the IBB.</div>
<a name="06071456000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">We agree that the IBB should
not be limited to considering information only from organisations under
a duty to provide it, and I reassure the hon. Lady that the Bill
imposes no such limitation. For organisations not covered by the duties
in the Bill, we plan to issue guidance setting out when we would expect
an organisation to make a referral to the IBB. The guidance will advise
individuals who wish to make such referrals to refer the information to
the police or another appropriate authority, such as a local authority
or social services, so that it can be properly investigated and any
action needed to protect children or vulnerable adults can be set in
train quickly.</div><a name="06071456000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 3 would enable the IBB to require information from any
organisation when it is considering whether to include or keep a person
on a barred list. We have already ensured that the key organisations
likely to have such information are under a duty to provide information
to the IBB. That duty is imposed on employers that are regulated
activity providers, including former employers, local authorities, the
police, keepers of registers such as the General Medical Council and
supervisory authorities such as Ofsted.</div>
<a name="06071456000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">The IBB will also be able to
ask any other organisation for information relevant to a barring
decision. It seems unlikely that an organisation would not comply with
such a request, given that the protection of children and vulnerable
adults would be at stake. If such an organisation were reluctant to
provide information and if the details that the IBB already had
suggested that the child or vulnerable adult might be at risk, the IBB
would be able to refer the case to the police and/or other local
services for further investigation. That is pretty important.</div>
<a name="06071456000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our approach strikes the
correct balance between ensuring that the IBB has access to
information, so that it can make decisions, and avoiding duplicating
the investigative and intervention roles of other organisations,
including the police and social services. Given those assurances, I
hope that the hon. Lady will not insist on her probing new
clauses.</div><a name="06071456000386"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000570"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I shall not, although I have one question
outstanding. As the Minister is in such writing mode, needing plenty of
work over the summer recess, I hope that he will answer in due course
my other question about the protections against damages, as set out in
clause 42. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="06071456000387"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000571"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="06071456000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased
that we have reached new clause 4; we have had many discussions during
the past few days, and it has looked doubtful whether we would get this
far.</div> <a name="06071456000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">We grappled with
the important issue that the new clause addresses on the first day of
our proceedings; I hope that it gives us an opportunity to flesh out
further the arguments and discussions about it. The definitions of
&#147;frequently&#148; and &#147;occasionally&#148; have been a
vexed question throughout discussions of this Bill in both Houses.
Originally, the new clause was to have been reviewed and discussed
alongside our original amendment to remove the idea of
&#147;frequently&#148; from the Bill and allow professional people
within the settings covered to establish a definition of
&#147;occasional&#148; relevant to their
setting.</div><a name="06071456000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of Lord
Adonis&#146;s notes attempted to clarify the meaning of
&#147;frequently&#148;, and in doing so define what was meant by
&#147;occasionally&#148;. At that point, it was said that if an
activity was undertaken for longer than five days continuously, or more
than six times a year, it would be deemed to take place frequently and
be subject to
monitoring.</div><a name="06071456000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
strikes us as a rather arbitrary figure in respect of what constitutes
&#147;frequently&#148; as opposed to &#147;occasionally&#148;.
Can the Minister say anything that would suggest that there is more
robustness behind the thinking? If so, he should share it with us, as
we have been unable to find that in correspondence on this
subject.</div><a name="06071456000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">At another
juncture, Lord Adonis stated that it would perhaps be up to the barred
individual to determine whether contact was occasional or frequent. We
Conservatives feel that that argument is unacceptable. I should be
interested in hearing the Minister&#146;s view. Can the Government be
reasonably expecting those who are subject to the rules in the Bill to
determine whether they are undertaking activities on an occasional or
frequent
basis?</div><a name="06071456000395"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000572"></a>Anne
Main:</b> I remember that during discussion of this matter in
the House, one of the issues raised was the annual Eisteddfod in
Llangollen, which takes place for five days every year. Perhaps
predictable regularity could be incorporated. If it is known that
something will come up regularly but not fall within the time scale,
that could also be regarded as falling within the remit of the
Bill.</div><a name="06071456000458"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div><a name="06071456000396"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000573"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for her intervention.
Perhaps our new clause would cover what she is talking about. It would
oblige an employer to define &#147;occasional basis&#148;, so an
Eisteddfod could be dealt with as the people on the ground saw fit,
rather than there being a one-size-fits-all approach.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 163</div><a name="06071456000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to touch on a
couple of comments made by Ministers today that suggest that they might
be more in favour of the new clause than I initially thought. Perhaps
the Health Minister will support it. He said earlier that we should
allow the judgment of front-line professionals to come into play, and
front-line professionals are exactly what the new clause is about. If
he cannot recall, I should say that it was when we were talking about
exemptions. My new clause is intended to let the people who know best
about what is happening on the ground have discretion to define what is
meant by &#147;occasional&#148;, rather than leaving it to the
Minister in his office in Westminster, which I am sure is wonderful, to
do it.</div>
<a name="06071456000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposal would, along with
removing &#147;frequently&#148;, which received cross-party support
on the Opposition Benches, allow employers to use their discretion to
determine how to define &#147;occasional&#148;. If the Minister
feels that that way forward is inappropriate&#151;although I am ever
optimistic on these issues and he may see the merit in the argument
that we are advancing&#151;perhaps I could urge him to think a little
further. I have asked the people who have to implement such rules and
regulations about how they regard Lord Adonis&#146;s description of
what counts as occasional and frequent, and the Government may be a
little bit more out of step with the people who will apply those
procedures than they think they
are.</div><a name="06071456000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hampshire county

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000575"></a>Mrs.

constitutes occasional
work:</div><a name="06071456000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Occasionally,
volunteers may be engaged to assist with a single event only, where
they will be working under the supervision of a qualified member of

education authority felt that Lord Adonis&#146;s proposal on the
definition of &#147;occasional&#148; was not in line with what it
would like to see in respect of schools in the county. This is a most
important aspect of the Bill that deserves to be focused on a little
more by the Government. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell
me how he will deal with the differing views of what constitutes
&#147;occasional&#148; or &#147;frequently&#148; and whether he
will allow employers such as Hampshire education authority, which has a
great deal of experience in this area, the flexibility that they will
need to deal with the circumstances on the
ground.</div><a name="06071456000404"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000576"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> For the first time in many hours of debate we are
moving towards a new Tory party policy being fleshed out. I am looking
forward to having a good look at <i class="I">Hansard</i>. I am rubbing my hands
with glee, because I cannot wait to get my hands on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 164</div>document from Hampshire to see exactly what it means. Having got our
teeth into that, we shall assume that that is how the Tory Front Bench
want to define &#147;occasional&#148; and
&#147;frequently&#148;. We will see about that in
time.</div><a name="06071456000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause takes us into consideration of a key term in the Bill:
&#147;on an occasional basis&#148;. We did more than touch on that
issue on Tuesday. The exemptions from the obligation on the employee to
be subject to monitoring and on the employer to check whether a person
is subject to it apply when a person is engaged in specified
activities, such as caring for children or vulnerable adults in a key
setting such as a school or care
home,</div><a name="06071456000446"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;only on an
occasional
basis.&#148;</div><a name="06071456000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
be clear that the term, &#147;on an occasional basis&#148;, is
intended to take its normal meaning. We do not think that it is
desirable to restrict the circumstances in which an employer, for
example, would not be under a duty to check an individual&#146;s
status. In reality, an interpretation of the term
&#147;occasional&#148; will, to some extent, depend on the
circumstances of the employment. Our guidance will support employers
and employees in taking those decisions. However, having said that, I
am looking forward to reading <i class="I">Hansard</i> closely to see what the
hon. Member for Basingstoke said and returning to that on Third
Reading.</div><a name="06071456000407"></a>

Brooke:</b> Although I might be enjoying the political
sparring as a spectator, I think that it is important to sort out the
meaning of the words &#147;frequently&#148; and
&#147;occasional&#148;. I hope that, come what may, the Minister
will look at this issue closely. The new clause might not be quite the
right solution for all circumstances, but there might be some merit in
it in respect of large employers. I emphasise that this aspect of the
Bill is so important. At present there are serious loopholes in the
Bill. It is incumbent on all Committee members to sort out the issues
involving &#147;occasional&#148; and
&#147;frequently&#148;.</div><a name="06071456000408"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000578"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> The hon. Lady makes her point well. I do not
disagree that these are important issues. However, I remind the
Committee that, as we discussed on Tuesday, it is important to consider
the consequences of the definitions we decide on and that we come up
with the right balance. Our intention is that, subject to the
circumstances of a particular job, anything happening less than once a
month and any contract shorter than a week can be regarded as occurring
occasionally. Some hon. Members do not like that, which is fine. I am
pleased to hear some alternative policies being fleshed out, so we can
start to consider
them.</div><a name="06071456000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">We intend that
parents who help children with reading in primary schools should not
have to be subject to monitoring and schools should not have to check
their status if they help only once, or help once a term during a
school year. That is not unreasonable. However, as I said on Tuesday,
we are currently keeping the definition of &#147;frequently&#148;
under consideration and we will return to it on

However, when she speaks, I should like her to consider 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 165</div>something. She asked about whether we should ensure that those involved
with an annual event should be monitored and part of the scheme. Does
she think that it is possible that the people who organise such a
yearly event&#151;possibly volunteers&#151;may cancel it, because
they will be under a form of regulation and will have to be part of the
vetting and barring
scheme?</div><a name="06071456000412"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000581"></a>Anne
Main:</b> I should like further clarification. Does the
Minister think that there is a greater difference between someone
popping in for a few hours once a week and somebody who has sole
control of a child for 24 hours a day for a festival lasting four or
fivedays? Such a situation would provide significant
opportunities for abuse to take place, whereas one hour a week in a
classroom may not. That is not a fair
comparison.</div><a name="06071456000413"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000582"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I was hoping for the second part of that
intervention, but it never came. The hon. Lady makes a fair point about
people who have close contact with children. However, the Bill has to
be proportionate. Is she saying that any person who has 24-hour contact
with a child once a year should be part of the
scheme?</div><a name="06071456000414"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000583"></a>Anne
Main:</b>
No.</div><a name="06071456000415"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000584"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> She is not saying that. These matters need to be
fleshed out. We have the early parts of a policy developing from
Basingstoke and Hampshire and I should be delighted to hear the view
fromSt.
Albans.</div><a name="06071456000416"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000585"></a>Anne
Main:</b> I did not say 24-hour-a-day contact happening once.
I was talking about a significant period of four or five days, which
might be a whole camping, eisteddfod or festival period, which could
give rise to opportunities. I want to be sure that the Minister has
given such instances real consideration&#151;that he has not just
dismissed them lightly but thoroughly examined the issue and concluded
that there is no real loophole.</div>
<a name="06071456000417"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000586"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I am not ignoring it, and I will consider
it&#151;and all other cases. If the hon. Lady is making
representations to me about those who are involved in festivals and the
relevant groupings around the country&#151;and if she is also telling
them&#151;that that is what we should do, I welcome her saying so.
However, I think that she will find that there are consequences.
Through guidance, therefore, we shall give employers and employees a
measure of clarity about the circumstances in which the exemptions will
apply. Our extensive work with stakeholders has led us to expect that
employers and individuals will take account of the guidance, so that
putting a duty on employers to act accordingly would add little. Given
the existence of criminal offences in this context it is highly likely
that the type of consideration set out in the new clause would happen
in any event, without the need for a potentially burdensome duty on
employers. With all that in mind, I ask the hon. Member for Basingstoke
to withdraw the motion.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 166</div><a name="06071456000418"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000587"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> The Minister will know, from reading all the
briefing documents on the Bill, that this issue is its Achilles heel.
Perhaps some of his reactions to the new clause are due to his
realising that he needs to think more about the topic. The stakeholders
to whom he has referred have clearly identified issues such as
frequency, what is meant by &#147;occasional&#148;, and the lack of
definition. My hon. Friends and Liberal Democrat Members have time and
again pointed out those issues, which the Government choose to brush
aside. That is a shame.</div>
<a name="06071456000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has contradicted
himself several times. The Health Minister has talked about allowing
front-line professionals their judgment; if the Minister cares to refer
to <i class="I">Hansard</i> he will see that in Tuesday&#146;s debate he talked
about the problems of the issue of frequency and the fact that there is
a need to look further at the issue. I am heartened by his saying that
he will return to the matter on Report. I will hold him to that
promise, because the Government are being more than a little vague. In
the interest of time, however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="06071456000420"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion and
clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="06071456000421"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000588"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Martlew. The least I can
do is to congratulate you on the excellent job that you have done in
chairing your first Committee. I also congratulate Opposition Members
for the probing job that they have done, even if they have
been slightly irritable at times during the week. I also thank
Mr. Conway for his contributions, as well as the police and those
involved from the House authorities. I am grateful to my hon. Friends
the Under-Secretaries of State for the Home Department and for Health,
for their steadfast support, and to Back Benchers on both sides of the
Committee, who have contributed to a week of healthy debate. It would
be rude of me, Mr. Martlew, not to mention also the excellent
work of the two Whips who ensured that we finished our consideration
and used our time to the full.</div>
<a name="06071456000422"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000589"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr. Martlew, I add
my thanks and those of my hon. Friends. You did an excellent job in
your first chairmanship of a complex Bill. I also thank Mr. Conway for
his chairmanship. I should clarify for the Minister that he should get
used to the fact that Conservatives feel deeply about these issues;
that is not irritability but a probing spirit and a desire to ensure
that we get such Bills right.</div>
<a name="06071456000423"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000590"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Martlew. May I quickly add my thanks to you and Mr.
Conway for chairing the proceedings? It makes a nice change for us to
complete consideration of a Bill, and that is pleasing. I thank the
Minister for the answers that we have had, and look forward to future
exchanges. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Sarah
Teather) who has made some interesting interventions, and all other
members of the Committee.</div>
<a name="06071456000424"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071456000591"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I thank the Committee for the comments on my
chairmanship.</div>
<a name="06071456000425"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Bill, as amended, to be
