<H4><center>[Mrs. Marion Roe in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/049/2000049.htm">Utilities Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Motion made and Question proposed, That further consideration be now adjourned.—[Mr. Pope.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Chope </B>(Christchurch): It is rather odd for that motion to be moved, given that people have assembled here in the expectation that proceedings are to continue all day, with sittings in the morning and the afternoon. Does the Government's desire to adjourn the Committee have anything to do with a story that appears in today's Financial Times under the headline ``Utilities regulation bill to exclude telecoms''? It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Stephen Byers, trade and industry secretary, will tell the Commons today that telecommunications is to be dropped from the utilities bill, after a revolt by telecoms companies. Water is also expected to be removed.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall not continue with the rest of the text. However, if any part of the House is to be told of the withdrawal of substantial parts of the Bill, the Committee should be told first. I hope that we shall receive the courtesy of such a statement from the Minister before the Committee adjourns.
<P>
This is a humiliating day for the Government. It shows that their legislation is in a state of chaos, and is a great endorsement of the vigorous way in which my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) has pursued the Government on these issues.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> With permission, Mrs. Roe, I shall make a brief statement, which follows the text of the statement that is to be made in the Chamber later today during Trade and Industry questions by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Eleanor Laing </B>(Epping Forest): On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. How can a statement be made during questions?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. What happens in the House is nothing to do with the Committee.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Roe. When any of us open our mouths we make statements, and I meant the word in that sense. I shall rephrase my remark. What I am about to say is based on what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will say later.
<P>
As I have informed the Committee on previous occasions, the Government keep under review all measures that may increase the burden of regulation on business. As a result, we have been considering the views that have been expressed by the telecoms operators—and, indeed, the opinions that have been voiced in Committee—on the Bill. We intend to publish a communications White Paper later this year. My right hon. Friends and I believe that there is a powerful argument for tackling the necessary reforms in one vehicle, and have therefore decided to remove the telecoms provisions from the Bill.
<P>
In addition, we shall remove the provisions relating to water, and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions will instead bring forward measures in a draft water Bill, covering those matters, which it intends to publish later this year. That will enable Parliament to consider proposed changes to the regulatory regime for water alongside other proposals resulting from the review of competition in that sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Norman Baker </B>(Lewes): That was an interesting statement.
<P>
I welcome back the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe, who has been unwell, and hope that she is fully recovered. We have missed her. I am sorry that she has come back for an adjournment, and hope that she does not feel that her time has been wasted this morning.
<P>
It is odd for a Bill to be filleted in this way after such a short time. Has the Minister only just found out about the telecommunications White Paper that is to be published later this year? It has been known about for some time; indeed, I have raised it in Committee and with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. It is obvious that telecommunications needs to be dealt with through that process, and it is bizarre that no consideration was given to that. I would have expected the Government either to decide that the inclusion of telecoms regulation in the Bill was consistent with the White Paper to be published later this year, or to have analysed the matter and decided that it was inconsistent. It seems odd that they have not analysed it, but decided a short way into the progress of the Bill that it does not fit. That is not joined-up government but joined-up chaos.
<P>
In respect of water provisions, I made a suggestion early on in this Committee, which was pooh-poohed by the Minister, that there might be a difference of opinion between the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions on whether the regulation should proceed under this Government. I suggested that the DTI was in favour of light-touch regulation and the liberalisation of markets, whereas the DETR was rather more conservative in terms of regulation, and that the Deputy Prime Minister's view on regulation might be different from that of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.
<P>
It now appears that the Deputy Prime Minister wishes to take the matter back to the Government and to deal with water under a separate Bill, as and when time is available for such legislation. There is no guarantee of such time in the near future. We do not know what kind of legislative pressure the Government are under. The Fur Farming (Prohibition) Bill has been withdrawn; we do not know where that has gone. We were promised a ban on hunting; we do not know what has happened to that. All sorts of Bills are being stacked up in the Government's list of legislation, and there now seems to be another one from the DETR.
<P>
Why was the Bill not more carefully analysed by the Government before being brought before the Committee? It is an extremely complicated Bill, and my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) has expressed the view that a degree of pre-legislative scrutiny would have been appropriate. Why was that not done?
<P>
Given the Bill's complexity, the Government must listen to the views of the telecoms operators and analyse the position in relation to the proposed communications White Paper. It would probably be the right decision at this point to pull telecommunications from the Bill. If the DETR is not going to play ball, it is probably sensible to let it take responsibility for its own legislation, if it so wishes. We are in a mess, and we must ask ourselves how we arrived there. One wonders whether the Bill can survive at all, or whether the Government should go back to the drawing board and re-examine the whole issue. When one dismantles what is supposed to be a cohesive unit, do the threads that are left hang together in an integrated way? The Government should not only adjourn the Committee, but return to the drawing board and consider whether it is worth our while proceeding with what is left of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe (Mrs. Helen Liddell):</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his good wishes. I am back in Committee, and I am at least upright. Whether I am hale and hearty remains to be seen.
<P>
I shall respond to the points that the hon. Gentleman raised. He referred to the proposed telecoms White Paper. Earlier in the Committee's proceedings, we had a full discussion about the fact that the telecoms industry is extremely fast-moving. As I pointed out to the hon. Gentleman—one of the Dorset three—on that issue, we always recognised that we would need to do more about the regulation of telecoms within the context of the electronic media. Representations have been made by the industry in the light of the pace at which change is taking place, with a view to ensuring that overall regulation should be dealt with in the White Paper.
<P>
We are a Government who listen. We pride ourselves on our ability to listen, and we have listened to the views of the industry. Before Conservative Members become overly passionate about their contribution in relation to these matters, I would refer them to Hansard. Those of us who look at the record will see that the most impressive case in relation to telecoms has been that put forward by the industry.
<P>
The Committee will not be surprised by my commitment to energy policy. The hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker) suggested that the entire Bill should be withdrawn. I am surprised at him, especially when one considers his commitment to the renewable energy industries, and to the issue of fuel poverty. Those matters are all contained in the Bill. The Government are also committed to introducing new electricity trading arrangements that will lead to a reduction in wholesale electricity prices of about 10 per cent. and end gaming in the electricity sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I assure the Minister that my commitment to those objectives remains undiminished. The question is whether the Bill can deliver them.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The Bill will deliver them. Indeed, the proposed introduction in the autumn of new electricity trading arrangements, which the industry and consumers both want, is currently on schedule.
<P>
One of the most significant aspects of the Bill is the protection it will offer to energy consumers. We witnessed the previous Government's haphazard dash for privatisation, which put the shareholder above the consumer, and the resulting inequities. Were Opposition Members to visit my constituency, which is one of the coldest in the United Kingdom, they would appreciate the impact of a 10 per cent. reduction in electricity bills. That will constitute a significant improvement, and the matter must be addressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Fraser (Mid-Dorset and North Poole):</B> During a previous sitting, at which the Minister was not present, one of her colleagues agreed that privatisation leads to reduced bills, and another accepted that competition is good for that very reason. Will she concede that point?

<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> We acknowledge and value competition. Indeed, the regulatory structure that we are putting in place for the electricity and gas sector will allow competition to thrive. One difficulty in respect of the water industry is that the competitive structures associated with the electricity and gas industries do not exist. However, I should say to those who defend the fat cat salaries that were paid during the previous Government's haphazard dash for privatisation that the rights of consumers were denied. The Bill must reform utilities regulation and put the consumer at the heart, so that the true benefits of competition are felt by all consumers, including the fuel poor.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Linda Gilroy (Plymouth, Sutton):</B> I welcome my right hon. Friend the Minister's return to the Committee, and I hope that she will ignore the Opposition's synthetic rage. I am surprised at Opposition Members'—[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I cannot hear what the hon. Lady is saying. I realise that emotions are running high but they should be tempered, so that Committee members on both sides can be heard.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Roe.
<P>
I am surprised at Opposition Members' attitude towards the Bill, given the vital importance of the new electricity trading arrangements. I hope that my right hon. Friend will give due emphasis to those arrangements, which it is anticipated will deliver a further reduction of 10 per cent. in the price of electricity.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. The introduction of the new electricity trading arrangements marks an important change, and will enable us to become world leaders in electricity trading. It is not simply a matter of ensuring lower wholesale prices, some of which are entering the system as the futures market allows for NETA's introduction in the autumn.
<P>
I turn to the points that the hon. Member for Lewes made about the water industry. Last year's Queen's Speech made it clear that water legislation would be introduced this year. To enable the Government to make legislative progress, not least in making critical changes to the regulation of electricity and gas, it was felt that the water industry's cause would be better advanced by legislation that was framed in the whole, rather than introduced as part of this bill. There is no doubt that the inclusion of water clauses would slow down the Bill's progress. The water industry differs from the gas and electricity industries, in that it is not as competitive. Moreover, factors relating to the environment and other matters are also significant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Will the legislation dealing with water be introduced during this parliamentary Session?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that those matters are dealt with by the usual channels and that, as a Minister, I cannot answer his question. A measure of the Opposition's enthusiasm for a proper regulatory structure in the water industry will be the extent to which they help the Government to introduce the legislation.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): I apologise, Mrs. Roe, if I sound rather annoyed this morning. We expect the Minister to be honest with the Committee. However, it is well known that the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions disagrees with the Department of Trade and Industry over what the Bill should contain. The Department of Trade and Industry rightly said to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, ``If you want that load of old rubbish in the Bill, you'll have to deal with the matter yourself.'' Does the Minister acknowledge that that is the truth?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is living in fantasy land. I have made no attempt to mislead or to be untruthful to the Committee. I suspect that he has let his passions get the better of him.
<P>
On Second Reading and in Committee, we discussed the fact that the water industry is different. No secret was made of the matter in the Queen's Speech, in which it was stated that water legislation would be introduced. My hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) serves on this Committee and is the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. We must examine the water industries as a whole, and we have decided that the provisions relating to water should be removed from the Bill.
<P>
The Bill's core elements relating to gas and electricity remain such a significant part of the Government's programme that we are anxious to make rapid progress with the Bill, which will benefit the industry and consumers. In order to attain a truly competitive UK economy, we must bring down energy prices and secure an energy environment that is second to none in the world. Energy prices in the United States are 50 per cent. lower than those in this country. Real competitiveness in the energy sector will help to secure British industry's competitiveness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I want to press the Minister on the Government's decision about water. Will the new Bill cover the water industry in Scotland, which is still nationalised? Householders there face increases in their water bills of up to 50 per cent. Is not the Minister trying to avoid discussing water because it is embarrassing for her that the nationalised Scottish water industry is pushing up costs so significantly?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Those are matters for the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. Despite resistance from the Opposition, we have devolved authorities in an attempt to modernise the government of this country. Devolution in Scotland was strongly welcomed by Conservatives in Scotland because it allowed the dodo to come back from the dead.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I am astonished by the Minister's response. I expected her to come to the Committee with a degree of humility, but all we have heard is an arrogant rant. She is personally responsible for the most incompetently drafted Bill that I have seen during my short time in the House of Commons.
<P>
This is an incredible situation. When the Bill was published, we heard rumours that 900 amendments—Government amendments, not Opposition amendments—would be needed to sort it out, although that number has somehow been whittled down to 450 Government amendments. Now we have been told that 50 per cent. of the Bill needs to be removed—all of the provisions relating to telecommunications and water. Despite that, the Minister attacks the Opposition for their views, although she misrepresents them because she was not present in the Committee during the relevant debates. She has misjudged the Committee's mood.
<P>
In Committee, we have had worthwhile debates and a good dialogue, but the right hon. Lady shattered that approach. I am surprised by her arrogance.
<P>
It shows that there must have been almost no consultation on the Bill before it came to the House. The fact that she suddenly saw the light when she saw the letter from the operators group reveals that there was almost no consultation with those companies. The letter from the operators group, and from British Telecom, which supported the operators group, says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the current Bill is inappropriate and that its underlying approach is flawed.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is most odd that on the one hand the Government declares the need to legislate for a single Communications regulator but on the other is actually legislating for communications to be treated as if it were a traditional utility.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That letter is very hard-hitting, but the Ministers would have known of the view of 24 major communications companies in this country, as well as British Telecom, if there had been proper consultation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> My hon. Friend may not be aware that the operators group discussed its views with the Government probably a year ago, expressed exactly the same views and then found that the Government had gone ahead anyway. To suggest, as the Minister has, that it has only just occurred to the Government to consult the group is nonsense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. What is going on? Is it pure arrogance? Is it ignorance? Did the Government not know that there would be a White Paper on broadcasting and telecommunications later this year? Surely they knew: it is from the same Department. The Minister is in a perilous state, which her approach to the Committee today highlights. The element of arrogance is damaging to the Government and damaging to that industry.
<P>
Why was the water sector included in the Bill? Do the Government not know that the Department of Transport and the Regions is producing a water Bill? Why have they suddenly decided that water must come out? The level of incompetence displayed in the Bill is incredible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, as it is such a complex and technical Bill, it would have been very much for the benefit of the House if there had been a pre-legislative scrutiny session when some of the issues which the hon. Gentleman has correctly drawn to our attention could have been exposed? Perhaps, in a less confrontational session the Government could have responded more positively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. Any method of scrutinising the Bill before it came into Committee would have been better than the level of scrutiny that the Government appear to have given it before Second Reading. The Bill should have another Second Reading. It should be withdrawn, rewritten and brought to the Committee in a competent state. There are 900 possible Government amendments, even without the telecoms and water ones, with 54 already tabled so soon after the start of the Committee stage. That is unacceptable.
<P>
The Bill reveals the Government's wider problems. Even when they are in Government, and not just in Opposition, they put masses of resources into presentation and spin, but too few into the detailed administration of government, and we see the consequences of that in the Bill. They should withdraw it, so that it can be rewritten from scratch.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Linda Gilroy </B>(Plymouth, Sutton): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that a consequence of withdrawing the Bill would be to deny consumers the savings that will come from the important parts of it, which should be taken forward? Is he prepared to deny them that price decrease?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Bill will not deliver lower prices to consumers, because it is interventionist and highly regulatory. As the hon. Lady knows from listening to our debates—if the Minister had been here, she would have heard this important debate—when one adds to regulatory cost, one adds to regulatory risk and increases the cost of capital to these highly capital-intensive industries. That is then passed on to the consumer in higher prices or prices that have not fallen by as much as they would have done.
<P>
The hon. Lady might argue that the new electricity trading arrangements are advantageous. We agree with that. We have said from the beginning that we support them, but that is one clause in the Bill—clause 56. If the Government want to introduce a one-clause Bill, we shall assist them in pushing it through as rapidly as possible, but the rest of the Bill is highly interventionist and highly damaging to consumers' interests.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> The hon. Gentleman is overlooking the provisions that reform the structure of the regulator, by turning it into an authority. They do the opposite of what he is suggesting. Most of the energy utilities have welcomed them as providing more transparency and certainty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Lady is contradicting the Minister, who said in Committee on Tuesday that the Bill is not a revolutionary measure and does not change fundamentally the regulatory regime affecting the industries. She and the Minister cannot have it both ways—either it will not revolutionise the regulatory structure, or it will. If it does, it will damage consumers' interests because it will increase regulatory costs and risk and those costs will have to be passed on to consumers.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I was a little perplexed by something that the hon. Gentleman said earlier. He agreed with the new electricity trading arrangements, so does he now oppose the joining together of the gas and electricity regulators?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> We have always said that if the regulatory structure is to be revised, it is sensible to merge the regulation of gas and electricity because the two industries overlap. It is also sensible for the consumer council to cover the same two bodies. However, the overall objectives in clauses 8 and 9 are very damaging to the consumer interest. We would be pleased to help the Government to get through clause 56 to bring about the new electricity trading arrangements, which must be in place by October this year. The industry needs clause 56 to receive Royal Assent before the summer.
<P>
This episode is embarrassing and damaging for the Government and reveals the explosion of contradiction between their rhetoric and what is happening underneath—for example, the rhetoric of Government papers such as ``Our Competitive Future: Building the Knowledge Driven Economy'', which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Britain's success in the knowledge driven economy of the future is ultimately down to business. But Government has a critical supporting role to play. The present Government will not resort to the interventionist policies of the past. In the industrial policy making of the 1960s and 1970s, to be modern meant believing in planning. Now, meeting the requirements of the knowledge driven economy means making markets work better.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not what the Bill does. It intervenes in markets and is highly regulatory. The paper continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government believes strongly that open, transparent and effective markets are vital to encourage efficiency and innovation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill does not do that. The paper continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The law greatly influences the extent to which markets are open and competitive. Protectionism and unnecessary regulation limit choice and increase costs to business and consumers. Well-crafted liberalisation unleashes ideas and capabilities, helping business to create innovative new products and services.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendments that we tabled to try to salvage this appallingly drafted and damaging Bill were rejected by the Government. If they really believed the rhetoric, they would not have produced a Bill that is so highly interventionist and regulatory and/or they would have accepted some of our amendments, which would have resolved the problem. The paper continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At present, all those who run telecommunications systems have to be licensed. When this requirement was introduced, it was expected there would be only a few public operators—in fact there are now over 270 operators. We need a new, more flexible approach: one in which regulation can be rolled back more easily as competition increases; one which caters better for the way in which telecommunications and media are combining.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is nothing in the Bill about media combining. The rhetoric is contradicted by the Bill.
<P>
There are many examples of rhetoric in the Government's papers. In ``Regulating communications: approaching convergence in the Information Age'' they state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Regulation should be the minimum necessary to achieve clearly defined policy objectives. The presumption that broadcasting and communications should be regulated should therefore in general be reversed.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The rhetoric goes on and on in Government publications and in speeches by labour Members and by the Chancellor, who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The sharpest spur to innovation, efficiency and improvement is competition.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill denotes the promotion of competition to a secondary objective.
<P>
The Bill is evidence of a contradiction between the Government's rhetoric and reality. They admitted today that they have got it wrong. If the Minister would come to the Committee with some humility and say that they have got it wrong and want to redraft the Bill—
<P>
<B>Mr. Greg Pope </B>(Hyndburn): Like the Tories.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> No. We would admit it if we got something wrong and if our view of what is right for consumers was wrong. If the poorest consumer would not benefit from a more fiercely competitive market, there is a role for the Government to intervene to protect the poorest people in society, through the Department of Social Security, the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Employment, but not through economic regulation of industry. The Opposition accept that we are sometimes wrong, but the Government do not do likewise. They pay no attention to the detail of government; they are all spin and rhetoric. This is a shambles of a Bill. It required 450 or 900 amendments. Half of it is now being torn apart. The common-sense response would be take it away, rewrite it, think about it again, and engage in proper consultation with the electricity industry.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is a lesson here. If industry is concerned about the Government's proposed legislation, the approach to take is to protest. That has been shown in relation to BT and the operators group. They put in a lot of effort, they protested and they got their way. Too many people in industry are terrified of vindictive measures by the Government and will not protest in public, although they do so in private to the Opposition. Industry must begin to stand up to the bullying tactics of the Government. If it does, it will succeed. Bullies react to only one thing—being bullied back. I congratulate the telecommunications industry on its achievement. The White Paper, which will be published in October, should be written on the basis of wide and deep consultation, so that we do not have another fiasco like this Bill later in the year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): This is a sad and disappointing occasion for Opposition Members. We wanted to assist the Government in improving the Bill. During the Committee's first sitting, when we were discussing the sittings motion, hon. Members will recall that I rose to declare my interests and put them on the record early. I made only one substantive point about the Bill—that telecommunications should not be a part of it. Its inclusion in the Bill is complete nonsense. My words are recorded in column 16 of Hansard for that sitting. Although we are glad to see the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe return to the Committee, she was foolish to do so. In column 17, she dismissed what I said about telecommunications. The Government must now simply adjourn the Committee. They have not told us when we shall return, or whether the Bill will be withdrawn. The Bill is in such a mess that they have to say, ``No, we cannot talk about this any more this week.'' The rumours began on Monday, and on Tuesday the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs used a form of words that implied that telecommunications would be excluded from the Bill. We then heard that the Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce had made a similar speech outside the House. On Monday, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry apparently signalled that the water industry would be excluded from the Bill.
<P>
I want to compliment a certain group—Department of Trade and Industry officials. Perhaps the Government did not purge them sufficiently when they came to power. The officials have their heads screwed on. When the Government have gone off in stupid directions, the officials have advised against doing so. That happened in relation to the Electronic Communications Bill, with which the Government were attempting to overregulate the internet. The foolish elements of the Bill were removed by the DTI officials—which is similar to what is happening in the Committee this morning—but, lo and behold, they turned up again in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill. In fact, they turned up in spades. Under this absolutely stupid unjoined-up Government, anyone picking up an extension at home and listening to somebody else's conversation will be given a two-year prison sentence and unlimited fines. The Government do not know what they are talking about.
<P>
I am suspicious about what is happening in relation to the water industry. Why did the DETR fall out with the DTI? Why did the DTI throw up its hands and say, ``Right, we're not going to continue with this''? Water is the only element in the Bill that is to be kept as a utility, because one cannot, under the regulations, buy one's water from other people, and some form of utility regulation is therefore required. Why is the water industry going back to the DETR? Why does the Deputy Prime Minister want it under his wing? Does that indicate that we are going to see the renationalisation of water by any other name—that is, apart from the fact that the Government will not pay for it. They will simply ensure that the assets that are owned by shareholders are taken over by the DETR and used in the way that the Deputy Prime Minister wants.

<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I remind the hon. Gentleman that we have a DETR Minister with us in Committee this morning. It would be helpful to the Committee if he would intervene to explain the DETR's policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> It would, of course, be helpful to the Committee, and indeed to the water industry and the House. However, I know that the Under-Secretary is a wise Under-Secretary, and will probably stay in his seat.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> I hope that I shall still be wise if I tell the hon. Gentleman that my Department has been closely linked with the DTI throughout these proceedings, and that there is no difference between us on the course of action that we are about to take. We are holding over the water provisions until next year because another Bill is on its way, and on reflection we decided that it is more logical to include these measures in the water Bill that is likely to appear during the next Session.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful for that. I am sure that you are following this, Mrs. Roe, as are all members of the Committee. The Under-Secretary claims that Ministers are as one in their knowledge of what they are doing in respect of the Bill. However, the DTI Ministers refused to confirm what we just heard the DETR Minister confirm: that the water Bill has been abandoned for this year, and will appear during the next Session. That has happened within the space of 30 minutes. I have not noticed any conversations going on between the DTI Ministers and the Under-Secretary. Perhaps there is an invisible barrier between them.
<P>
I know, without having set foot in the DETR or the DTI during the past week, that the two Departments are completely set against each other about how to deal with the water industry. Although I am glad, as others will be, that there will not be a water Bill this Session, the fact is that the Government have, yet again, failed to follow through on commitments that they made in the Queen's Speech.
<P>
I now reach the more technical part of my remarks about whether the Committee should be adjourned or whether we should conclude that the Government have totally abandoned the Bill. I am not an expert in parliamentary procedures, but the long title of the Bill states that it is to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Provide for the establishment and functions of the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority, the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council, the Telecommunications Authority, the Telecommunications Consumer Council, the Water Advisory Panel and the Consumer Council for Water; to amend the legislation regulating the telecommunications, gas, electricity and water industries; and for connected purposes<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and my understanding is that one cannot, having published a Bill, change the long title. In that case, how can a Bill with that long title be enacted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bill Tynan </B>(Hamilton, South) rose—
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am glad that an expert is about to advise us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tynan:</B> I am no expert, and I want to ask the hon. Gentleman a question. As a professional adviser to the Telecommunication Managers Association, and an individual with substantial holdings in telecommunications companies, does he agree that telecommunications should be withdrawn from the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I believe that the hon. Gentleman has been present throughout almost all the Committee's sittings. He should, therefore, be aware that I have continually pointed out to the Government that their policy when in opposition was to change the regulation of telecommunications into regulation of communications and to bring broadcasting and all other parts of those industries together. He thinks that he is in the party of joined-up government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tynan rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I will explain my point to the hon. Gentleman and he may wish to intervene when I have done so. I am sorry that the Whips have not explained to him that the concept of joined up government was simply spin, not reality. Let us move into the realms of reality. Joined-up government would have involved the Labour party coming to power, deciding to change the laws relating to communications and following a model similar to the American system of regulation in those industries. They would, no doubt, have read the report of the all-party group of which I have the honour of being vice chairman—EURIM, the European informatics market group—which came to the same conclusions as the Labour party. I have been campaigning in the Conservative party and it, too, has accepted that that is the right way forward.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman seems to be accusing me of having sufficient knowledge of these matters that people will pay me to advise them what to do—[Hon. MEMBERS: ``Ah.'']—yet I tell the Government that for free. I declared my involvement with the industry in the Register of Members' Interests, and explained it in my first speech to the Committee. The Government are now announcing that I was right all along, and that they were wrong.
<P>
The problem is not that the Government will not announce the right way forward, but that we are discussing the adjournment of the Committee on a Bill—the long title of which I have just read out—a quarter of which deals with telecommunications issues that are no longer to be included, and another quarter of which deals with the water industry, which will no longer be covered. At this rate of progress, one wonders which other industries might be pulled out of the Bill. Are we to sit here until Christmas discussing a Bill that no longer contains any of the intentions mentioned in its long title?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tynan:</B> Can I take it from that contribution that the hon. Gentleman agrees with the withdrawal from the Bill of the measures relating to telecommunications?
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Yes or no.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The answer must be yes.
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Hooray.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> Why does not the hon. Gentleman congratulate the Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Because, having told them what they should do, I would have congratulated them if they had introduced an appropriate Bill. However, we are not in that position. The Whip has stood up and uttered the words ``Let's adjourn the Committee.'' We are making no progress towards the Government's intention of reforming Oftel and the communications regulatory system in the way suggested by everyone in the industry.
<P>
I am not congratulating the Government because when they consulted on the Bill in its draft form they were told by the telecommunications industry, ``This is nonsense. One should not proceed in this way.'' We have continued to demonstrate all through the Committee's proceedings why it was nonsense to have those provisions in the Bill, so—yes, why not?—let us congratulate the Government on their U-turn.
<P>
We would congratulate them even more if they could now stand up and say ``We realise what has been going on, and we would like to apologise.'' The right hon. Lady might have said that she had this morning come from her sick bed to apologise for what was happening, instead of which we have heard this rant—I am not sure where one could use the word ``arrogance'' here—about how the Government were continuing to fight the forces of conservatism. Those are the forces that gave us a 30 per cent. reduction in our fuel bills, that told the world that there is no natural monopoly in the local loop of telecommunications, and that privatised telecommunications in the teeth of Labour party criticism. Indeed, the entire programme of the forces of conservatism has changed the Labour party into the new Labour party. The Minister should congratulate the Conservative party on showing them the right way.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Which Conservative party?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I would give way, but I cannot allow an intervention from a seated position.
<P>
We are in a mess. We are being asked to adjourn the Committee, but we have not been told when we will resume, and we are waiting to find out what is going on. I do not want to be ruled out of order, and I shall ensure that my remarks remain in order, but I should point out to the Government that the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill, which has yet to have its Second Reading, is an even bigger mess than this Bill. The Government may go off in the wrong direction and get in a yet bigger mess, but unless the Utilities Bill completes its passage or is withdrawn, or we are told that there will be a few months' grace to enable its rewriting, I will be unable to assist the Government with the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill.
<P>
I turn to matters that are even more crucial. The Committee has examined events carefully, and I pay tribute to the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs in that regard. We have discovered that office blocks have been purchased and people have been employed on five-year contracts for jobs that the Bill has yet to create. Most of those individuals are employed in the electricity and gas industries. I suspect that, on reading their morning newspapers, they will say, ``I gave up a good job and a pension to work for this Government and do something for the consumer.'' Where is their future? Do we know whether they will all be sacked?
<P>
Those people were taken on in the belief that we have a joined-up Government who will deliver. The Government have a massive majority: they can do anything they want. They are perfectly able to make a complete mess of everything and vote it through time after time. We have never heard Government Back Benchers say so much. The Government announce that they have made a complete mess, and they all jump up and down in defence of their Ministers. The hon. Member for Hamilton, South (Mr. Tynan) has said more this morning than he has since entering this place, let alone since participating in this Committee. We are in a truly incredible situation.
<P>
This morning, the Minister talked about reducing the price of electricity by introducing a new pooling arrangement. She keeps saying that bills are likely to reduce by 10 per cent., but the Government have not made that claim for the pool. It has been suggested that, on occasion, some prices might reduce by 10 per cent. [Interruption.] The Minister says, ``We'll see'', but it is extremely important—

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I said ``wholesale''. I was talking about wholesale electricity prices.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying what she was talking about. If she consults Hansard, I think she will find that the word ``wholesale'' is not there, but I am prepared to stand corrected. [Interruption.] It is good to see that the barrier has come down and the Ministers from the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions are now talking.
<P>
I am surprised that the electricity industry has not beaten a path to the Opposition's door, saying, ``This new pooling arrangement is unacceptable. We want it removed. We are worried about our profits.''
<P>
Anybody who looks at the profits currently being made by the electricity generators will see that they are not making a 10 per cent. turn on the amount that they are generating. I have asked for the figure from the Electricity Association, but have not yet been given it. I suspect that it is a 1 per cent. or 2 per cent. turn. Why is this group of generators not beating a path to the door of the Opposition and others saying, ``Please will you overturn this new pooling arrangement''? I shall give the Committee a clue. The generators may have worked out that, under the new pooling arrangements, instead of electricity prices going down, on many occasions they will go up, and that their profits, and consumers' bills, will be higher at the end of the day. Most of the profits in the electricity industry have been made through redistribution of electricity by those who had a monopoly on its delivery.
<P>
Although the Minister has had the generous offer, which I am sure we will all support, of having the new pooling arrangements sorted out, because that has been acknowledged as something that the industry wants, the Government should not put in their manifesto the reduction in people's electricity bills that will arise from the Bill, or expect a 10 per cent. reduction in them. I suspect that some of the 30 per cent. reduction that the Conservative party achieved through the old, discredited pooling arrangements will be taken back.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I am becoming concerned about the direction of the hon. Gentleman's argument. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton offered a free passage for clause 56 and full support for NETA. I understand the hon. Gentleman to be saying now that that is a ramp that will put up prices for consumers. Which of the two is the right argument?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no split. What Conservative Members have said, and my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has said throughout our Committee proceedings, is that we were glad when the Government said about 18 months ago that they wanted to change the pooling arrangements. I think that I am on record as saying—I certainly thought it, if I did not say the words—that the previous pooling arrangements seemed extraordinary. When they are described, one tends to say ``Surely that can't be right. That doesn't sound like a proper market mechanism.'' The arrangements are certainly available to be manipulated by a small number of people. We said that the Government were on to a good point if they were changing them.
<P>
Nobody has claimed that the total cost of electricity to the distributors will go down by 10 per cent. The claim was that, on occasions, it may be down by 10 per cent. We do not know whether, in parentheses, there will also be occasions when it will go up by 10 per cent. and the average will be more or less where it was. We need to warn the public, who listen to our debates avidly—one cannot get a seat in the Room for this debate on whether to adjourn the Committee—that the delivery of electricity will be changed by new pooling arrangements.
<P>
I hope that the Government are considering, in particular, building and bringing on stream new generating capacity, because that again is an important part of the pooling arrangements. The previous set-up concentrated on ensuring that electricity was always available and that people could get a good price for their electricity if they were in the system. The arrangements are quite complex. If the previous Government could easily have put the pooling arrangements in differently, I suspect that they would have done so.
<P>
I do not think that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove was here—but I am sure that he will have read my speech—when I talked about the original pooling arrangements. I was on the Industry and Parliament Trust, looking at what was happening in the Central Electricity Generating Board. I was taken to one of the generating headquarters, where the expert who wrote the original pooling arrangements explained the system to me, leaving me as baffled at the end of the explanation as I was at the beginning.
<P>
About a week later, those complex arrangements were scrapped and replaced by the simple mechanism that is still in place. People appeared to throw up their hands and say, ``Unless we put some sort of arrangement in place, neither electricity privatisation, nor the breaking up of the electricity industry into competitive companies can proceed.'' Our discussions today should make reference to the approach that was used a dozen years ago, when we moved from a natural monopoly to a competitive market. What was done then is not set in stone. In our debates about what we should do, the Conservative party should not apologise for decisions that were taken then—they were right at the time.
<P>
Before we adjourn, the Government should explain what they want to do with the Bill. People in the gas and electricity industries will examine their contracts of employment, and those who signed contracts with officials and the organisations that have been established want to know whether the contracts for the marble-clad building will be honoured. The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs may be interested to know that when I was going home last night I stroked the side of the ICI building to check that it is actually made of marble. He knows that I have a thing about marble—
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am afraid, Mrs. Roe, that you missed the sitting at which we debated marble halls in a big way. I admire the hon. Gentleman's enthusiasm in many regards, but he is lucky not to have been arrested last night.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill makes it clear that one can be arrested for all sorts of things but, so far as I can see, the Government have not yet made stroking the side of a building a criminal offence. I admit my behaviour freely, and perhaps I should apologise for cheering up the Minister. Ministers should be feeling miserable this morning I hope that they are.
<P>
The Government should explain what they intend to do with the Bill. If Ministers think that they can sit in their seats and get away with not giving a full explanation, my colleagues and I may seek to catch your eye again, Mrs. Roe, to establish their intentions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. First, Ministers explained that they intend to remove the telecommunications provisions from the Bill. How can the telecommunications provisions be withdrawn from the Bill when clauses 84 to 88 have already been agreed to? Secondly, we need a response to the important point that was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) about the Bill's long title. Is it technically possible for the Committee to continue to consider the Bill in view of the fact that all of the telecommunications and water provisions will be removed?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> First, on the clauses to which the hon. Gentleman referred, the Bill can be amended on Report. Secondly, the long title can be amended at the end of our considerations to reflect the Bill's contents at that stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> We expected the Minister to respond to some of the points that have been raised. When the Bill was introduced, its core purpose was said to be to set up a common regulatory system. While waiting expectantly for the Minister to explain in more detail how the Bill will be amended, I examined clause 124. The explanatory notes state that that clause
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>provides for the abolition of the Competition Commission's three sector-specific Utility panels (for electricity, telecommunications and water), and their replacement with a single, cross-utility group.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause goes to the heart of the Bill, because it reflects the Government's original opinion that all these utilities are similar and should be treated similarly. Will the Minister say whether clause 124 will be withdrawn from the Bill and whether the Government will now abandon any aspiration to amalgamate the three sector-specific utility panels in the Competition Commission?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Does the Minister intend to amend the short title of the Bill? The long title is not the only issue. The Bill is called the Utilities Bill. Might it not be more appropriate for it to be called the Gas and Electricity Bill? We have not yet heard a word of apology from the Government or from Ministers. I hope that we shall before the Committee adjourns this morning.
<P>
What opportunities will there be for the membership of the Committee to be reconstituted before the next sitting? I understand that the Committee of Selection normally sits on a Wednesday. If this Committee reassembles on Tuesday, will the Under-Secretary have had an opportunity, for example, to make his representations and ensure that he no longer has to serve on the Committee, as he has done so diligently?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The correct terminology is ``to make his excuses and leave''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The Under-Secretary deserves plaudits from the Government Whip for having been present during many deliberations that were not of any relevance to him, when he clearly realised that in due course the Deputy Prime Minister would have his way and separate off his own part of the Bill.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will be able to answer some of those points. Otherwise, some of us may be tempted to vote against the motion to adjourn the Committee today.
<P>
When the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs read out his statement, he said that it would be echoed by a statement to be made by the Secretary of State during Trade and Industry questions in the Chamber this morning. I have looked at the Order Paper, and it occurs to me that it will be difficult for him to make such a statement. The first question deals with the consultation period for statutory trade union recognition; the second with assessing the prospects for improved trade links with Bulgaria; the third with measures that his Department is taking to promote enterprise in the East Midlands region; the fourth with the UK manufacturing sector improving its performance relative to overseas competitors; and the fifth with the action that the Secretary of State is taking to ensure that changes in the price structures for high bandwidth telecommunications encourage the rapid development of e-commerce. It is possible that the Secretary of State could say something on that. It would be typical of the Government if, instead of the Secretary of State coming clean and saying that he wished to make a proper statement on the Floor of the House after questions, he had in mind to try to smuggle the news through in the context of another question that is clearly not material to the core issue.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Surely if anybody intended to smuggle anything, we would hardly have told the Committee this morning. We have told the Committee because we want to be open and transparent about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I respect the Minister for saying that he has told the Committee this morning, but unfortunately the Government told the newspapers yesterday. The Minister may not look at the Financial Times, but I assure him that it contains an article by no less a person than Brian Groom, the political editor. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Stephen Byers, trade and industry secretary, will tell the Commons today that telecommunications is to be dropped from the utilities bill, after a revolt by telecoms companies.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It then states that water is also expected to be dropped from the Bill.
<P>
The Government's spin doctors made that statement so that it got into the press before an announcement was made to the Committee. That is an insulting way to behave to members of the Committee who have so diligently considered the Bill and now realise that much of their time and effort has been wasted. Our debates on telecommunications and water will now be of nil value. We are paid by taxpayers to represent their interests in Parliament, but outside bodies, lobby groups and the industry have been subject to an unnecessary burden as a result of being told by the Government when they introduced the Bill that they were intent on legislating in a form similar to that which was reflected in the text of the Bill that we discussed on Second Reading. When the Secretary of State introduced the Bill, he said that it had had more consultation than any other piece of legislation introduced by the Government. The Government did not say that they had responded positively to that consultation. They may have consulted, but they did not listen until late in the day and that caused a lot of confusion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tynan:</B> The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton stated in the Committee on Tuesday:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If the Government, having considered that letter—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
from Vodafone—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>thought it appropriate to remove from the Bill all provisions relating to the telecoms industry, they would have the support of the Opposition, given that there is to be a review.—[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 29 February 2000; c.184.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does the hon. Gentleman agree?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> It is normal for me to agree with my hon. Friend because he is a man of wisdom, and this is no exception. I remember being much illuminated at our previous sitting by his description of what Mr. Stephen Littlechild had said in a pamphlet written for the Institute for Economic Affairs. That opposite reference helped the Committee to become wiser about the difference between anti-competitive regulation and regulation that facilitates competition.
<P>
It would be an impertinence if the Committee did not receive an apology, because it has been inconvenienced by the Government's behaviour. The Government owe it to us to be a little more open about the progress that the Committee will make on the Bill and whether clause 124 will be withdrawn with other references to telecommunications and water.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I want to respond to some of the questions raised by the hon. Member for Christchurch. I am sure that he was not disagreeing with the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who assured the Committee that if we decided to withdraw the clauses, the Opposition would provide the necessary co-operation. I see the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton nodding his head, and I am pleased to see that, as it means that the hon. Member for Christchurch was merely giving us the benefit of extra carbon dioxide for five minutes, which is fine.
<P>
The clauses to which the hon. Gentlemen referred will be debated when we come to them in the order of consideration. We have nothing to hide. Their party was in government for 18 years and did little to open up the procedures and allow Parliament to understand how they work. If nobody have ever changed their mind, civilisation would not have advanced far. The whole basis of advance is that people occasionally change their minds. I do not worry about admitting that I am wrong, or even apologising. Real arrogance lies in pretending that no Government ever get it wrong, and that no Department can make a mistake. The Government have reacted pragmatically and responsibly to the concerns expressed by business since the publication of the Bill. I assume that that is what every hon. Gentleman and Lady in the Room would want the Government to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Why did you get it wrong?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Governments can get things wrong. I have got many things wrong, even after lengthy consultation.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am glad that my hon. Friend has intervened—I was about to say something about my first marriage.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the previous Government's approach was ``Damned if you listen, damned if you don't, so why listen?'' This Government listen. I hope that the Minister will assure us that, in making progress on this Bill, he will not only continue to listen but act, even when it is difficult to do so.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I thank my hon. Friend; she has expressed the problem better than I would have. The principles identified in the utilities review will be applied in separate legislation. This Bill must now focus on the Government's legislative proposals for the gas and electricity markets. We aim to secure Royal Assent before the summer recess, so that electricity and gas consumers can benefit, for example, from lower prices arising from the early implementation of the new electricity trading arrangements. We aim to proceed with those clauses that affect the electricity and gas industries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. At the beginning of this Committee, Mr. Hood gave a ruling that all amendments would have to be tabled in good time—at least 24 hours in advance—before they could be considered by the Committee. He said that he would not accept any amendments received after that period, even if there were an afternoon sitting. We are now adjourning the Committee. We do not know when it will resume, although we assume that it will be on Tuesday, with a revised sittings motion. What is the procedure? Will Mr. Hood's ruling be changed to allow amendments to be tabled during that sitting? I have no idea what we will discuss on Tuesday, and no idea what clauses we will debate. I therefore have no idea what amendments I can table, and in what time scale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pope:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Roe. The Government intend to table amendments today. I shall certainly ensure that they are sent to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Roe. Does that mean that those amendments will not be debated in Committee before they are regarded as binding? That is not acceptable. The sittings motion should first be debated and approved by the Committee. The 48-hour period should be observed before amendments are debated.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I make a ruling, I shall take some advice, because I do not want to provide the Committee with wrong advice.
<P>
Having taken advice, I am informed that amendments tabled today could be selected for debate on Tuesday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. To which clauses can amendments be tabled today?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am advised that amendments may be tabled in relation to any clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Roe. The Government have told the Committee that they will withdraw two quarters of the Bill. We need to know whether we will no longer discuss the clauses dealing with the water and telecommunications industries. It would be helpful if the Government were to tell the Committee the order in which they want to consider the Bill in a sittings motion. Those hon. Members who have tabled amendments could then concentrate their efforts on the relevant clauses. Clearly, one would expect the Committee to make more rapid progress in dealing with merely half the Bill. It would be helpful to know which clauses will be discussed, and in which order.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I do not know whether a Front Bencher wishes to help the Committee at this stage. There will be a sittings motion on Tuesday, but I cannot advise the Committee beyond that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pope:</B> We intend to table a motion to reorder the Bill. That will be discussed on Tuesday, when we shall also discuss the deletion of points relating to telecoms and the water industry. I hope that that will prove helpful, and I shall ensure that Conservative and Liberal Democrat Front Benchers are provided with copies of the selection list when those motions and amendments are tabled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. I wonder whether the Minister has told you, or whether he can tell us, on which Department of Trade and Industry question the Government intend to make a statement.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a matter for the Chair, but I am sure that the Minister has taken note of it.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Adjourned accordingly at sixteen minutes past Eleven o'clock till Tuesday 7 March at half-past Ten o'clock.
