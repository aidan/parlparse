                        </p>‘(7) The police and
crime commissioner for a police area must arrange public meetings on a
quarterly basis in each and all of the police neighbourhoods in that
police area.(8) The police and
crime commissioner must also make arrangements to meet regularly with
victims of crime and with representatives of victims of
crime.’.<p class="tabbed">Good
afternoon, Mr Howarth. We had a good discussion this morning. There are
differences between the Government and the Opposition, but many issues
were raised and points made in a way that aids the Bill.
I know that we will continue in that
vein.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000011">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This is a
probing amendment that tries to understand a bit more about the
relationship between the police and crime commissioner and the
different areas that they represent, and how that will work. If the
amendment were enacted, depending on the definition of a neighbourhood,
the PCC could do nothing but attend public meetings. If they were
somewhere in Devon and Cornwall and went to a public meeting every
quarter in every ward, that would be hundreds of meetings. As much as I
want to see PCCs become much more accountable at
neighbourhood/ward/local level, even I think that would be
unreasonable. Nonetheless, we have tabled the amendment to try to
understand a little bit more about the Government’s thinking
with respect to gathering information from police neighbourhoods. I
know that the definition is left loose to be defined by the chief
constable—I think that is right, and it is important to
understand
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000012">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second part of the amendment deals with the need to encourage the views
of the victims of crime and their families to be expressed. I have
heard the Minister say that an important part of the function of the
PCC is to gather information from victims of crime. We all say it, but
it would be interesting to hear the Minister say how that is going to
be brought about in practice. The relevant part of the Bill is clause
1(5)(b), which says a police and crime commissioner
has<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000013">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>If
we turn to chapter 3, we find a great list of things that the PCC is
required to do. However, there is very little detail about how that is
to happen, so it would be interesting to hear some details from the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000014">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">How does the
Minister envisage the PCC keeping in touch with local neighbourhoods?
What specifically does he think is going to happen to enable that? If
it is not quarterly meetings—as I said, that would be
unreasonable—what is a reasonable way in which the PCC could
make himself accessible to local communities? For example, my hon.
Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak has made a point about the
public not knowing the home affairs team. The Minister quite reasonably
said that generally a high number of local MPs are recognised by their
constituents. How does the Minister envisage that a police and crime
commissioner responsible for a big area will be accessible to local
communities if they do not hold quarterly meetings? On of our earlier
amendments, which was defeated on a vote, said that the area was too
big for one person. If the model is to have one person, it is
legitimate for the Committee to want to understand
a bit more about how it will work.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000015">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
responsibility to consult on police and crime plans and to receive
feedback, but how will that happen? How will somebody concerned about
crime in an area contact the PCC? To use an example from Devon and
Cornwall, if the PCC’s office is in Exeter and someone in west
Cornwall wants to contact them, will they write or phone? What is
expected to happen then? How will they feel a connection with the PCC,
so as to overcome the democratic deficit and the problem of
accountability that the Minister has identified?<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000016">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Visibility is
an issue. The Minister is right to point it out, and it is why I made
the point that we were not keen to defend the status quo. Police
authorities have struggled, some more successfully than others, to
raise visibility. Is he confident that the police and crime
commissioner will be sufficiently visible, other than through the
ballot box? Again, some forms of visibility involve the person’s
name, but I think that the Minister wants more than that. If the
commissioner does not hold meetings, how will they be visible? If the
Minister does not agree with quarterly meetings, does he think that
they should occur once a year or every six months? I am not trying to
be smart about it, but there is a problem. What sort of visibility and
accountability is he seeking to bring about by establishing one
commissioner for a big area?<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Chapter 3
gives the commissioner various functions. It is not clear exactly how
one person will do all of them. Consulting on police and crime plans
includes many different things. How will crime and disorder reduction
grants work? Who will get them? How big will the budget be? I accept
what the Minister says—I understand that the commissioner cannot
dictate from London how that will happen—but what is the purpose
of co-operative working if quarterly meetings are not held?<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000018">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our amendment
deals with information and consultation. It is not clear to us exactly
how information for the public will work better than it does at the
moment. We have suggested quarterly meetings. As I said at the
beginning, it is a probing amendment—we do not necessarily think
that that is a sensible use of the commissioner’s
time—but it raises other issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Each elected
local policing body must produce an annual report, send it to the
relevant police and crime panel and make arrangements for it to be
published. Police authorities already publish annual reports. How will
it make a difference to publish those annual reports and send them to a
police and crime panel? There is a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 185<a class="bkMark" name="Column185">&#160;</a>
                           </div>requirement to have public meetings, although not necessarily quarterly.
Proposed new subsection (1B) of section 96 of the Police Act 1996 deals
with arrangements for obtaining the views of the community on policing
and sets out different things that are supposed to happen. The purpose
of the amendment is to try to be helpful—it might not seem like
it—otherwise we will recreate a system with the difficulties,
frustrations and problems that the Minister is trying to overcome. Most
police authorities would say that they have arrangements for obtaining
the views of the community on policing. The fact that we might not

raised a genuine concern. I do not doubt that the Minister is sincere,
but I have great trouble in understanding the scale of the change. In
the West Midlands force, in the Birmingham area alone, local policing
units have been broken down to constituency size. If we were to
replicate that across the West Midlands force, we are probably talking
about at least 20 LPUs with about 75,000 people in each one. When I go
to a local police tasking meeting, I usually see a well-attended
meeting with perhaps 25 to 30 people, although the police probably
notify perhaps 2,000 people that it is going to happen. If the measure
is to be representative and genuinely getting in touch with everyone
who has an interest, how will it be managed on such a
scale?<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000024">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes a very good point. It is a
difficult question, but it is constructive. I am sure the Minister will
see that the detailed and practical questions that we are now asking
about this part of the Bill are part of the scrutiny process. Given
that we lost the vote on amendment 107 this morning—we will vote
later on clause 1 stand part—and given the Government’s
intention to have one individual in this position, it is important that
we test the issue. I have said it is a probing amendment—I will
not press it to a vote. If quarterly meetings are not held, how will
the new model ensure that local people’s opinions are taken into
account, so not only can the police and crime commissioner say that
their opinions are taken into account but our constituents feel that
they have some influence or say in a way that has not happened

difficult to manage the physical workload. If we are going to set up
the system, it needs to work and to be effective. I hope that the
Minister can offer some assurance so that local people are not
disappointed. I know that the counter-argument is that they can express
that choice through the ballot box, but no one wants to see a system

expectations, but then disappointing people if we cannot fulfil the
expectations that they were encouraged to have. The Minister will be
aware that if we are not careful, we will build a huge bureaucracy to
try to overcome the problem. Chapter 3 is about publishing plans,
consulting on them and ensuring that information is available. All
those things are very worthy, but they will end up costing a fortune
and the PCC will have to employ a significant number of people. At
least the face-to-face contact that we are talking about is relatively
cheap, apart from the cost of travel. People only have to put up a
poster saying, “We will be in this hall on this date. Please
come and talk to us.” It is difficult to see how some of the
things that are proposed will happen in
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000027">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
would be interested to hear how the Minister believes that PCCs will
help with giving victims of crime more of a voice. We all think that
there is much more work to be done in that area. There is no doubt that
often—not always, but often—people who have been a victim
of crime feel as if their concerns and their voice have not properly
been heard. Sometimes the problems that they have had and the hurt that
they have experienced mean that whatever anyone says, it will be
difficult for them to feel that the system has responded to them
adequately. Given the aim that the Minister has expressed, which I
support, how does he envisage that a PCC will improve that situation?
What does he think will happen that will make a difference? I think
that it is about more than just being
elected.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000028">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a further point. If we are talking about face-to-face meetings, as
the amendment proposes, whom does the PCC meet who properly reflects
the views of victims? How does the PCC know that the people they meet
or contact speak for the majority? How do they know that they are a
legitimate voice, rather than just an individual voice? I have said
that this is a probing amendment, but it is extremely important. The
heart of the problem is that the model that the Minister and the
Government have established involves single individuals covering what
are sometimes massive areas. The Government believe that that is right
to improve accountability, but the fundamental question is, given the
Government’s intention to legislate in this way, how will those
individuals relate to particular communities and
localities?<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000029">&#160;</a>

them, ensuring that they have the statistics that they need and so on.

consulted and how—by letter, over the internet or at meetings?

I appreciate the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman has moved the
amendment, and the importance of ensuring that PCCs attend to the views
of both the public and victims. That is the twin purpose of the
amendment. I do not think that there is any disagreement between us
about how important it will be for these new elected representatives to
do that. The broad answer to his question is that we can fully expect
these new representatives to take all the steps that they judge
necessary to engage in this form of communication. There is no reason
to expect that they will not, and there is the real issue, which he
mentioned, of the extent to which we should be prescriptive in the
legislation and say that the newly elected people should do certain
things in certain
ways.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
we think about our own position as Members of Parliament, no one tells
us how often we should have surgeries, how often and where we should
hold meetings in our constituencies or to which groups of people we
should pay attention. There is nothing written in law, nor is there a
code of practice or any guidance. So what is it left to? It is left to
the judgment of the individual Member who, when first elected, will
look at what his or her predecessor of whichever party did, and fashion
his or her own arrangements, looking at what other Members of
Parliament do, which will vary from constituency to constituency. The
kinds of activities that I engage in, in representing my Arundel and
South Downs constituents, are rather different from those that the hon.
Members for Birmingham, Selly Oak or, especially, for Vale of Clwyd
engage in. There will be some similarities with surgeries and so on,
but there might also be some very different forms of activity. It is
all left to our
judgment.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000032">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What
puts the pressure on us as individual Members of Parliament to respond
in a certain way is the accountability that we have, the fact that we
are elected and the sense that we are put in these positions by the
people and have a duty to respond to our constituents, even if, in
fact, the formal duty of a Member of Parliament is to vote on laws in
this place. It is widely seen that Members of Parliament have a broader
role, and for many that will be to consider the implications for
re-election should we not do those things. However, I think that most
Members of Parliament are driven by more than that, by conscience and
by a desire to do the job
properly.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

are also driven by public demands, by the number of e-mails and letters
that we receive, and by the public wanting to see us, which we try to
facilitate. I think that all hon. Members will agree that the volume of
that demand is growing considerably. That is not the case, however,
with police authorities, and that goes to the problem: police
authorities are invisible. A series of freedom of information requests
was recently made to police authorities by the think-tank Policy
Exchange, including requests for information about how many letters and
e-mails they had received over the past four years, from members of the
public, not from the force  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 188<a class="bkMark" name="Column188">&#160;</a>
                           </div>or the Home Office, about their duties. A number of the authorities
chose not to reply, but some did, and I particularly wish to draw the
attention of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak to the West
Midlands police authority’s response. I wonder whether he might
like to take a stab at how many letters the authority received over the
four years, from 2007 to 2010. It received 231, which is an average of
one and a half a week. All the other police authorities that chose to
respond—I am not surprised that others did not—had a
similarly pitifully low rate of correspondence from the public. Why is
that? It is because the public do not know that the authority is there,
or who is
involved.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000034">&#160;</a>

obsessed with the public knowing exactly who the people are. In my
North Wales area, we had a chief constable who everyone knew extremely
well, and who was referred to as the mad mullah in the <em>Daily

people in North Wales would struggle to name our current chief
constable; I happen to think that he does an excellent job. I am sure
that most people throughout the country could not name their chief
constable, but that does not mean that those chief constables are not
doing a good job. Notoriety does not necessarily mean that chief
constables are more open to the public whom they

about the previous chief constable of North Wales. We would be here for
a long time if we did so, tempting though it might be. My point is
simple. If the public do not know who bodies and individuals are, it is
unlikely that they will correspond with them, and the evidence is that
they do not.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000036">&#160;</a>

representative of the police authority, it is a challenge for all of us
as Members of Parliament, as it will be a challenge for the new
commissioners, to ensure that it is not simply a case of responding to
correspondence from those already in a position to engage. Our
challenge is to reach out to those who might not have a voice. The
difference here is that the person involved will be seeking an
electoral mandate. Some of the most vulnerable in our communities are
often not registered to vote, but their voices should be heard. I am
thinking particularly of crime. Victims of domestic violence, for
example, are often unable to make their views known publicly, but those
views should be made known, and it is important that the commissioner
engages with vulnerable groups when drawing up the
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000041">&#160;</a>

have face-to-face meetings with the public, how does someone who is
functionally illiterate—something like 15% of the UK population
is functionally illiterate—get their voice across to the
commissioner? They may live in an area which has a massive crime level.
They cannot put their words in writing because they cannot write. They
cannot send e-mails because they probably do not have computers. How do
those who are disconnected and disadvantaged in society get their voice

they would be represented by interest groups and people who support

Let me make it clear that I am not disagreeing about the value of
public meetings. I do not think that it is necessary to prescribe in
legislation that there should be quarterly meetings? Why quarterly? Why
not have monthly meetings? Some police and crime commissioners might
want to

                           </div>meet more often, and some less. It really is a matter for them. None of
us is disagreeing about the value of such public
meetings.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is an area in which we have been more prescriptive, and that is in
relation to the requirement on forces—not on police and crime
commissioners—to conduct regular beat meetings. It is our
long-standing view that there is a particular value in ensuring that
the police have regular meetings in their local area and that the
public know about them, so that the public have the opportunity to meet
the police. I saw the power of that some time ago when, along with the
members of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, I visited Chicago and
saw its community alternative policing strategy and its meetings that
were clearly of value, especially in areas in which there had been
tension and in which minority groups felt that they had not had
attention paid to them. Subsequently, we saw the growth of such a
policy among police forces in this country.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000047">&#160;</a>

the view that, along with the requirement for transparency, it is
something that is so fundamental that it crosses the line that we want
to prescribe. Therefore, clause 34
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000048">&#160;</a>

can debate that issue when we get to clause 34, but it is also germane
to this set of amendments. It does not say how they are to obtain the
views or where, and it is not completely prescriptive about the time
period—it would be unwise for it to be so. I hope that hon.

the neighbourhood and how often views are obtained. I realise that
quarterly meetings are ridiculous, which is the point that I made
earlier. Although I appreciate that such a matter has been put in the
Bill, it does not alter the fact that at some point or
other—notwithstanding localism and police and crime
commissioners being locally accountable through the ballot
box—the Minister will be asked how he knows that the system is
functioning well and that clause 34 is working. It may be when he is
assessing the police and crime commissioners, or it may be when we get
to clause 34. I accept that it is a

the provision that police and crime commissioners should also obtain
the views of the victims of crime has been an important development.
Hon. Members will know that that was something that the victims
commissioner particularly praised in her evidence to the Committee.
Again, why be so prescriptive about that? Is that not something that
police and crime commissioners are bound to want to do anyway? Here, we
wanted Parliament to send a clear signal to these newly elected
individuals that thinking about the victims

                           </div>of crime should be one of the things that they do. Our general view is
that we have a criminal justice system that does not think enough, at
all points, about the victims of crime, and we therefore thought it
proper to write in that provision. It would be unwise to be
prescriptive about exactly how the commissioners should do
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000052">&#160;</a>

report back on a regular basis on what they have done? If we do not
have some form of accountability on connectivity between the
commissioner and their communities, they will play to their natural
audience—the audience that selects them. The Minister has asked
how we, as MPs, connect with ours. In total, 5,000 people have visited
me in the House of Commons. I have sat them down on the Terrace, bought
them a cup of tea and listened to them. I have 50 surgeries a year. My
Welsh Assembly colleague, who is a Labour colleague, also has 50
surgeries. I have 200 visits a year. That is how I connect with my
community, and I can prove it. Will the commissioner be able to prove
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11012639000001">&#160;</a>

Gentleman will see that the police and crime commissioners must publish
specified information for the public and set out an annual report. The
function of the police and crime panel will be to scrutinise all that
and ask questions. I expect that members will ask questions such as,
“How much have you done in terms of obtaining the view in such
and such an area?” The individual members of the police and
crime panel will, of course, have a particular interest in their
area.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000053">&#160;</a>

                        <p>and
one of the functions is to obtain the views of the victims of crime.
There is sufficient provision in the Bill for regular beat meetings for
the police and for obtaining the views of the victims of crime, and we
have transparency arrangements, which mean that all the reports about
what they must do have to be produced by the police and crime
commissioner. Indeed, if a criticism were to be levelled at the policy,
it would be that it is highly prescriptive about what a police and
crime commissioner must do each year. We took the view that the public
need the information to be able to hold the person they have elected to
account, and the police and crime panel will need that information,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000055">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is plenty of provision in the legislation. I do not think that there is
any disagreement between us about its importance. We live in the age of
accountability and transparency, so everything that the police and
crime commissioner does will be seen. All the papers and so on will be
seen, because the principle of transparency is embodied in the
legislation. We live in a world where access to new technology makes
communication much easier. Not everybody has access to it, but the
numbers are growing, which is something that they will have to have
regard to, just as we do as MPs. With the use of the web, e-mail,
Twitter and Facebook, I am confident that police and crime
commissioners will be able to put in place innovative arrangements to
secure dialogue and engage with the public.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000056">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is quite helpful. It demonstrates some of the
problems between the desire to have localism and the recognition that
if we do not prescribe some things, then we are not quite sure what
will happen. If something goes seriously wrong, it will not be the
police and crime commissioner’s head on the block, so there is a
tension there, but I understand the way in which the Minister is trying
to reconcile
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is interesting to note that there are 28 order-making powers in the
Bill, according to the Library. I am not sure whether that is a high or
a low number for a Bill of this size. The Minister has made the point
that one of the order-making powers concerns the information that
police and crime commissioners will be required to issue. Our debates
are important, because the Committee can at least try to influence the
Government’s thinking on what those regulations should include.
If we look through chapter 3—given the fact that the Minister is
trying to promote the localism agenda, and, to be fair, he touched on
it at the end—there are a significant number of
“musts”, which effectively mean that
the Minister is expecting the police and crime commissioner to do
certain
things.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Wherever
arrangements are put in place and whatever model is finally passed by
Parliament, I re-emphasise the Minister’s point about the
importance of new media in contacting different groups, in particular
the groups that do not always participate. People sometimes scoff at
Twitter and Facebook, and there are sometimes issues around them. If
used properly—for example, if the police and crime commissioner
were to establish that—there would be an effective way to get
information out to people instantaneously. When the Minister considers
how the police and crime commissioner might relate to and connect with
many more people than happens at the present time, the use of new media
would be effective in doing that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000059">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
place for face-to-face meetings, but the question of how many there
should be is difficult. I agree that that cannot be prescribed, which
is why we only put it as quarterly in the amendment. There is a case,
given what I have said on new media, for face-to-face meetings as well.
It has been an interesting debate, and I know that the Minister and
others will take into account the points that have been made as they
try to ensure that this aspect of the Bill works as it should. I beg to

is no need to spend long on this particular amendment. I was intrigued
when I read the Bill—I am sure that everyone has noticed
this—about why the words “in particular” were put
in there. Why is it that those functions are “in
particular”, and what are the other things that the PCC should
not have particular regard to? It may sound a trivial point, but there
is a list there. It is important, because the chief constable is held
to account “in particular” for those things. What are the
other things, which are not on the list, that they are held to account
for, but not in a particular way? I do not understand
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000063">&#160;</a>

I expected in the clause was that it would say, “The police and

for—” with a catch-all part at the end, such as
“anything else that is regarded reasonable

                           </div>by the commissioner in conjunction with the police and crime
panel.” I do not understand why it is phrased in that way.
Unless the Minister has a really good answer, there will be problems
down the track, because someone will say, “It didn’t list
it in the ‘in particular’.” The chief constable
might say, “I am being held to account for things that are not
listed. Why is the PCC giving such importance to a particular factor,
which is not listed?” It is a simple question, and I am
intrigued. I am not trying to trivialise it; I just wondered why it is
there.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000064">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The purpose of the words “in
particular” is to ensure that the list of functions, which the
PCC is holding the chief constable to account for, is not exhaustive.
If the words “in particular” were not there, the chief
constable could only be held to account for those functions by the PCC.
Equally, it would not be practical to draw up a complete list of every
function that chief constable might have. This precisely follows how
police authorities work at the moment, where there is not an exhaustive
list. We might have introduced a general provision for the PCC to hold
the chief constable to account for the exercise of his duties. Instead,
we have tried to set out, in particular, the principal duties for which
the chief constable will be held to account, but it is not an
exhaustive list.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000065">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A good
example of such duties is complaints, which we have discussed, and how
a force deals with those. I am not sure whether that is covered by
subsection (8), but it is an important function of the police force. It
might be argued that it comes under the general provision of
effectiveness and efficiency in relation to arrangements with local
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000066">&#160;</a>

well, but my point is that if we remove the words “in

and crime commissioner could hold the chief constable to account only
for those listed functions. The forces will have other, unspecified
functions and if we want, we can sit in Committee and keep thinking

50, in
clause 1, page 2, line 31, at

                        </p>‘(h) the system
by which complaints and conduct issues are dealt with within the
relevant police
force.’.This amendment
is to ensure that the PCC is involved in examining complaints and
conduct
issues.<p class="tabbed">The
amendment is similar to many others in that it probes the powers of the
PCC to hold the chief constable to account. It is proposed in a similar
fashion to those that have just been debated, which were tabled by the
Labour party, to challenge whether the list in subsection
(8) deals with all the relevant duties of the chief
constable.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I think we
can agree that a key function of police and crime commissioners must be
to increase the engagement of local people with their local police
forces, as is expressly set out in subsection (8)(e). One of the major
points of engagement between local police and local people is the
process for dealing with complaints against the police. Indeed, the
main time I see people in my surgery in relation to the police is when
the interaction that has already taken place between police and public
has failed, and either a complaint has been made formally or is about
to be made.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is clear
that in a structure where a police and crime commissioner exists that
would be the correct person to look at how that complaint is dealt
with. To be clear, he or she would not be responsible for the
individual complaint, but must surely be involved in monitoring the
complaints process. It is one of the key points of interaction between
public and police, and to exclude the PCC from scrutiny of that process
would be completely wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many others
agree with that opinion. One example that has been used many times and
will come up in future, is the West Midlands police authority’s
submission:<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
Authority would therefore propose that the complaints handling
function, currently under the direction and control of the chief
constable, becomes one of the functions of the PCC. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 195<a class="bkMark" name="Column195">&#160;</a>
                           </div>This would give additional independence to the handling of complaints
through what could be the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner.
In addition it would also provide an invaluable source of detailed
information to the PCC on the effectiveness and quality of service
provision.”<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000339">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
could not put it better myself. In particular, the point they make
about giving a level of independence to the handling of complaints is
an important one. I know there are many people who do not complain,
precisely because they feel there is no point because of the lack of
independence. There is a perception of its being an old boys club
looking after its own. I stress that is a perception and not a reality,
because I have significant professional, although not personal,
knowledge of the complaints procedure. It is, nevertheless, a
perception that has to be addressed. The adoption of this power by the
commissioner would go some way to do that. I accept the point that it
is not an exhaustive list, as the Minister has said, but the power to
scrutinise the complaints procedure is central to the engagement
between police and public. I would like to suggest that is something
that the PCC should do in
particular.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000079">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We are in much the same area of discussion that
we were with the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Gedling. The
question is whether we can rely on the general provision in subsection
(7)  to ensure that the PCC will hold the chief constable to
account for the exercising of his functions in how to deal
with complaints, or whether a specific provision should be made in the
non-exhaustive list in subsection (8), so that the PCC must
in particular hold the chief constable to account for the way that
complaints are dealt with. I have already said that we will go back and
look at the drafting between subsections (7) and (8).<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is
force in my hon. Friend’s argument that if there is to be this
non-exhaustive list, which brings out particular duties that the chief
constable has, complaints are a particularly important area—we
know that it will be important for a PCC to ensure that complaints are
dealt with properly. I do think that there will be a migration of
complaints from the force to the police and crime commissioners
themselves. That was the experience in London, and it will increasingly
be the case. Indeed, the whole approach to complaints will change
because of the visibility of the police and crime
commissioners.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I entirely
understand the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh
West. It seems reasonable, and I want to reassure him that, as drafted,
the Bill definitely allows under the general provision in subsection
(7) the police and crime commissioner to hold the chief constable to
account for such functions. There is no doubt about that. It certainly
allows it. There is no lacuna, as drafted. The only question is whether
we want to draw particular attention to the handling of complaints in
that
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is also reassurance under paragraph 145 of schedule 15 in that we have
amended section 15 of the Police Reform Act 2002 so that it will apply
to police and crime commissioners in the same way as it currently
applies to police authorities. Commissioners will be under the same
duty to keep themselves informed about the handling of complaints and
conduct issues raised 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 196<a class="bkMark" name="Column196">&#160;</a>
                           </div>about the officers and staff in the force as police authorities are at
the moment, so they will have to keep themselves informed. The
combination of the two provisions and the fact that there is a general
provision in subsection (7) and that they will be under the
duties to keep themselves informed of complaints means that it is not
actually necessary to make the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
I have already said that I shall consider the concern of the hon.
Member for Gedling about the use of the words “in
particular.” I shall be very happy to reflect on whether they
would add something to the signal that we want to send about the
importance of complaints and whether they should be added to the
non-exhaustive list. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for
Edinburgh West will be reassured by that commitment. I do not think
that the amendment is necessary, but can I go away and discuss with
officials the extent to which it would add something by being included
in the

Act 1998,(i) the exercise of

there is no need to delay the Committee too long. I suppose that it is
a continuation of our debate on functions. We have tabled the amendment
because such issues are obviously important. However, such things could
be automatic. The compliance with the Human Rights Act 1998 and the
Race Relations Act 1976 might be automatic legal obligations that do
not need to be specified as functions. Diversity has been raised as a
worry in respect of police and crime commissioners and, as we know, is
an issue for us all. We all want human rights respected. We all want
diversity encouraged and the proper enforcement and implementation of
various race relations
measures.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is a probing amendment. It goes along the lines of similar
debates that we have had on the previous two amendments about whether
such a measure is needed, and whether it is implicit in other
legislation that such duties are automatically held to account under
the two laws or whether there is a need for such functions. It is
amazing how the inclusion of a couple of words such as “in
particular” causes more issues to arise in respect of what is
actually meant than anything else. I notice that one or two hon.

is a real problem with the way in which the measure is drafted. The
hon. Member for Edinburgh West drew attention to his particular
concern. I am not sure what the answer is to my own question, about

automatic application of the Acts to everyone, and I shall be

                           </strong> Many of the arguments that we discussed in
relation to the complaints procedure apply here. The first point is
that clause 1(7) requires the police and crime commissioner to hold the
chief constable to account for the exercise of all his functions, and
it is a question of judgment as to what should be put in the list of
functions, which I have already said we need to consider. The police
and crime commissioner will hold the chief constable to account for the
exercise of his functions under the Human Rights Act 1998 and the
Children Act 2004, and there are statutory functions in any
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the commissioners’ duties, the intention behind the Bill is to
ensure that the commissioners are subject to exactly the same duties as
police authorities, and there is no intention to change that. In some
legislation those duties are imposed on all public authorities, and
since police and crime commissioners are public authorities they are
included, whereas in other legislation the bodies to which it applies
are listed, and the Bill replaces references to police authorities with
references to police and crime commissioners. I assure the hon.
Gentleman that it is my intention that his specific references to the
Race Relations Act 1976, the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, the
Disability Discrimination Act 2005, the Equality Act 2006 and the
Equality Act 2010 will be captured within those
duties.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a specific issue in relation to the Race Relations Act and the
Equality Act, and I will be tabling an amendment to be debated in the
Committee, to ensure that any gaps in the equality and diversity
provisions, which the Government take very seriously, are addressed. I
thank the hon. Gentleman for reminding the Committee how important it
is that the new model pays due regard to that. Diversity is an issue
that has been raised in relation to police and crime commissioners, and
there are many ways other than the statutory means by which we propose
to deal with that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
opportunity for ensuring that diversity issues can
be dealt with is the appointment of two independent members to the
police and crime panels. That is one reason why I was persuaded that it
might be a good idea to have independent members on those panels, as we
have on police authorities at the moment. That might provide an
important opportunity, as a potential route to tackling diversity
issues that have not otherwise been addressed by the nomination of
councillors to the police and crime panels.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000094">&#160;</a>

pretty certain that we have not specified that. The appointment of the
independent members will be a matter for the councillor members to
decide, and we can come back to that when we talk about how the police
and crime panels will be drawn up. The debate on what kind of members
should be independents is interesting, and it might be valuable to have
them as people who can help with diversity, as is the case in a number
of police authorities, where particular attempts are made to ensure
that the authority can pick up on the issues. Indeed, I have just
approved the extension of the appointment of police authority members
in certain areas for precisely that reason, in order to take them up
until the point at which the legislation will introduce
PCPs.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000099">&#160;</a>

may be other reasons why it is a good idea to have independents, such
as their particular expertise in relation to policing and so on. There
is, again, an issue about how prescriptive we should be about that, but
I think that we should have a further debate about it when we come to
the
PCPs.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000100">&#160;</a>

that they will not be elected councillors, which is the case with
police authorities at the moment. We have said that it is for the panel
to decide, based on the skills and experience of the
members—those are the considerations that we have set out. When
we issue the general guidance on the legislation—assuming that
it will be enacted—we may want to indicate the kinds of members

the Home Office to discuss that. We should also take account of the

is an important issue, and the Government recognise it, but there is
real concern that the relationship between the police and crime
commissioner and the chief constable is such that there will
be—whatever the protestations of the Minister and the
Government—interference with operational independence. For good
reason, the allegiance that an officer swears is not to the Government,
but to the Crown—we all understand that—and the final
words are “according to law”. The Government are sincere
in their desire that chief constables will be able to operate
effectively and professionally without interference and in accordance
with their own judgment. Indeed, the Bill tries to make that clear, but
every single witness and officer is, when spoken to in private,
concerned about the relationship between the police and crime
commissioner and the chief
constable.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000115">&#160;</a>

operational independence. Given the policing issues in Northern
Ireland—you will remember the responsibilities that you had as a
Minister, Mr Howarth—the Chief Constable being operationally
responsible is important, and the Patten report has made a huge
difference in that area of our

is much better to talk about operational responsibility and not
operational independence. The police should not be in a situation where
they are not accountable at all. That is the point that Patten
made—the phrase “operational responsibility” means
that those having responsibility for the police are not independent of
everyone, but are accountable for what they do. The Patten report was
excellent, and it has helped enormously in Northern Ireland. The use of
that terminology has changed policing there and is something that we
might reflect on
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000119">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of our amendments is to say to the Government that there is not
enough in the Bill that is certain, clear and emphatic about the
division of responsibility between the police and crime commissioner
and the chief constable. Every person to whom I speak is concerned
about a police and crime commissioner being elected on local policing
priorities. The hon. Member for Cambridge raised the example of a
police and crime commissioner who says, when standing for election,
“We should get rid of Tasers—I don’t believe in
using them,” and is elected on a mandate for that. Other
examples can be made up—one might be elected on a mandate of not
believing in such-and-such a way of policing demonstrations, or in
kettling and the use of
horses.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
cannot see anything in the Bill that sets out what a police and crime
commissioner can or cannot say when standing for election. All those
things might be said, and if a commissioner is elected on such a
mandate, what does he say to a chief constable who turns round and says
that Tasers are an appropriate use of technology to tackle certain
issues occurring on the streets? As the hon. Gentleman has pointed out,
the police and crime commissioner might say, “But I have been
elected on a mandate not to use
them.”<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000121">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that the Minister will argue that the police and crime
commissioner will not be able to do that, as those are operational
matters for the chief constable. That is all right in Committee Room 9
at 5.20 on a Tuesday. I can only say that out there in Exeter,
Cambridge, Birmingham, Liverpool or Cardiff, when the police and crime
commissioner meets the chief constable straight after an election, what
is currently in the Bill does not do enough to enshrine that
independence, which is part of the purpose of our
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000122">&#160;</a>

populist cause that a populist candidate for commissioner might stand
on, which is the abolition of speed cameras? That is very popular, and
a candidate would probably get elected on that ticket, especially in
north Wales, where they were pioneered. Even if the statistics proved
that the cameras saved lives, the person elected with that mandate
would be able to declare that he would abolish them in north Wales.
Where does the buck stop—with the commissioner or with the chief
constable?<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000123">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Again, that is a further example of the points
that I made. The Minister’s stock answer is that this is not a
problem, as the Bill clearly lays out that they are matters of
direction and control, which are down to the chief constable. Everybody
we talk to asks what will happen, and the Minister cannot just assert
his view; he has to take on our argument that the Bill is not
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000124">&#160;</a>

my hon. Friend the Member for Houghton and Sunderland South said, and I
see members of the Home Affairs Committee all around the Committee
Room, a recent report of the Home Affairs Committee
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000125">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“We
recommend that the concept of operational independence should continue
to apply in respect of the important work of the police in detection
and law enforcement, including arrest, but that the concept of
operational responsibility be developed and clarified in a memorandum
of understanding between the Home Secretary, Chief Constables and
Police and Crime Commissioners. It is important that arrangements are
made for parliamentary scrutiny of the terms of any such memorandum and
subsequently its impact on police work. The police and not politicians
must, as now, be solely responsible for individual decisions with
respect to arrest and
investigation.”<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000341">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I
know that the Minister agrees that it is for the police to decide on
investigations, arrests and so on. The Home Affairs Committee is one of
the most highly respected and important Select Committees in this House
and the Minister has to take its point on board—well, he does
not have to, but I would advise him to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
the chief constable of the west midlands came to give evidence, I
specifically asked him whether he thinks that it would be important and
helpful to the Committee and to Parliament if such a memorandum of
understanding or code of practice, as some prefer, were published. Part
of the purpose of the amendments under discussion is to inform the
Minister of our belief that it is important that, at least at some
point in the Bill’s progression through its House of Commons
stages, we are informed of what the Minister and the Government expect
to see in a draft. I know that it would be a draft of a draft, but it
would be important for every member of the Committee to know whether he
accepts the recommendation of the Home Affairs Committee. Perhaps he
could specifically state whether he agrees that there should be a
memorandum of understanding on this
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
apologise if the Minister has already said that he accepts that point.
If he accepts that there should be such an undertaking at some point in
the future, does he not agree that it would be extremely helpful for
the Committee to see that code, a draft of it or a draft draft of it,
so that we get some idea of what we can expect to be the
responsibilities of the chief constable and the PCC? It would also give
us an idea of the interface between the two of
them, one being a professional police officer in
charge of a police force, and the other being a PCC elected solely on
the basis of a manifesto in which anything may be
included.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000128">&#160;</a>

the answer to that question. At what point is it an operational matter,
and at what point is it something on which the PCC can say he does not
think the police force is doing enough? Let us say that somebody is
elected on a manifesto of bobbies on the beat and says, “This is
what I’ve been elected on. I don’t want officers in
sexual violence units or domestic violence units. They can be more
effective in helping people across this police force area by being out
there on the beat.” I do not know how you then square that
circle. The president of ACPO and every chief constable is concerned
about that particular issue. The Minister says that there is no need to
worry, because it is clarified in the Bill. Yet that has not satisfied
any
one.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000131">&#160;</a>

is no definition of direction and control. We will have a legal battle

right to do something and a chief constable saying that they do not.

leave the Minister to answer it. The Minister knows that when the
original proposal was made for elected police and crime commissioners a
couple of years ago, the Opposition policy at the time was that if an
individual was elected whom the Minister or the Government regarded as
unacceptable for whatever reason, there would be not only a power of
recall once somebody was elected but the opportunity to demand that the
election be run again. I know that is the case, because we had a debate
with the Minister about it at the time. I can see from his face that he
agrees with me; he thinks that that was daft and so did I, but that was
the policy at the time. I will leave him to answer the issue of
recall.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000134">&#160;</a>

place between a police authority and a chief constable; that goes
without saying, because one can have a legal dispute between anybody. I
am saying, and the ACPO and many others have said this, that the
concern is where one individual is directly elected on a mandate. That
is not the case with police authorities; as the hon. Gentleman knows,
they are not directly elected at present. The difference is if a
directly elected individual has put out a manifesto and a series of
promises to a force area saying that they will do certain things, and
that individual is competing with somebody else who wants to be elected
as the police and crime commissioner in that area, who has promised
other things. One can imagine another leaflet going out where people
try to outbid each other in order to be elected as the police and crime
commissioner, which leaves us with the problem of the
mandate.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000142">&#160;</a>

use of the words “must not ask.” It might be that his
legal training is coming into play. However, as a non-legal person, I
would have thought that if he was saying that it is okay to ask, he is
actually saying that it would be all right for the commissioner to push
the chief constable as far as he could. Is there not the likelihood of
creating an intimidatory relationship, which is the very thing we do

operational independence and the ability of the chief constable to be
operationally responsible, without interference from a politician
directly elected on a mandate, is of fundamental importance to all of
us and to all of the people who have given evidence. The
Minister’s response on the issue—saying that it is dealt
with in the Bill and there is no problem—simply will not do.

accepted.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000150">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the issue of operational independence, I am concerned about some of the
detail of the measure and I hope that the Minister can offer some
assurance that those matters will be looked at carefully. I am sure
that anybody who stands to be elected as a police commissioner will be
motivated by the right reasons, as anyone who stands for public office
will make sure that they fulfil their duties properly and do their best
by the people who have elected
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000151">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
I were looking to be elected as a commissioner, I would campaign very
much on the ultra local issues that matter to people, such as
antisocial behaviour. There would be nothing wrong with that. We want
people to be responsive and we want politicians to listen to their
local communities and make sure that they adequately address
people’s concerns. I am fully aware 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>of the important role that specialist units play in my area, having
worked closely with them, but I am not sure that they are a vote
winner. That is the tension at the heart of the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I say, I am confident that whoever is elected will discharge their
duties properly and do their best to make sure that they address the
wide range of policing that goes on in an area. It is not simply about
the front-line response; it is often about the delicate and difficult
work that officers do in specialist units and in relation to, for
example, counter-terrorism. That is why it is all the more important
that a chief constable can say to the elected individual, “Yes,
I accept that you were elected on a mandate to put more police on the
streets, but I feel it is more important to safeguard child protection
services within police teams.” The chief constable has a
professional job to do and should be able to say to the elected
commissioner, “I am afraid that’s an operational matter;
I can’t fulfil that”, even if it means that the
commissioner cannot fulfil the mandate that they stood on.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have made
the only point I want to make. It is brief, but I hope that the
Minister will tell us what help the Government will ensure is
available, so that when such individuals are elected, they look at the
broader range of policing in their area and do not simply focus on
certain issues. Those issues may matter, but they are often raised by
those who are most able to make their views known. That is not simply
by those who are articulate; it is sometimes the “fearful
safe”, as we heard in the Home Affairs Committee. With people
who are most in need of help and support from the police service, it
can be the same as it is with Members of Parliament. I am all too aware
that sometimes people who would benefit from the support and help of a
Member of Parliament do not contact them. Clearly, we all want to
improve on that and do everything that we can to reach out to all our
constituents, and not simply to those who are able or willing to make
direct representations to us.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000154">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government need to look closely at operational independence, so that
the risk of disagreement between the chief constable and the
commissioner can be minimised. Therefore, if we have this system, it
should work, and we should not constantly be dogged by disagreements
and public spats, which, in the process, would damage the local service
that people receive.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000155">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Earlier in the debate, the Minister said that
there was no fixed way for an MP to do their job, using that as an
example of how people may approach things differently. I think he was
talking particularly in the context of consultation and engagement with
the public. It is true that no particular qualifications are required
to be a Member of
Parliament—<em>[</em>
                           <em>Interruption.</em>
                           <em>]</em> The Minister is
being very smart, but I missed it. So, there are no fixed
qualifications, or requirements about how to do the job. In reality,
for the vast majority of Members of Parliament, until they reach the
Minister’s exalted position, their responsibility is solely to
the electorate as they carry out their job.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000156">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In this case,
however, we are talking about someone with a much wider responsibility.
The Minister and I might slightly quibble about the range of the West
Midlands force, but we both agree that it serves a population of more
than 2 million. My electorate is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 207<a class="bkMark" name="Column207">&#160;</a>
                           </div>about 75,000; this person has responsibility to a much greater
population than someone such as me, and of course, the West Midlands
force also employs about 14,000 people. The difference is that if I am
not very good at my job—perhaps that is some people’s
view—it does not have a devastating effect on most people, and
there is a relatively easy remedy for it at the next election. In this
case, an individual, who is responsible to more than 2 million people
and for the employment of more than 14,000, may have the potential to
wreak havoc during their period of office. There is a much bigger
emphasis to be placed on exactly what that person does, and how
positive their contributions to policing are in a place such as the
West Midlands, than on the difficulties that they may cause.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000157">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We took
evidence from witnesses, and although quite a number of them said that
the issue of operational independence was not particularly new, there
was no agreement between them about how to safeguard it. In fact, the
chief constable found himself at odds with some of the other witnesses,
as well as the hon. Member for Cannock Chase, when they were trying to
understand how to safeguard operational independence in such a
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000158">&#160;</a>

still in post, I could imagine a candidate standing with the intention

priorities on which he did not agree with the chief constable. Is that
the model we want across the rest of the

                           </strong> That would be a fear of mine. I do not think
anyone who opted for election with the idea of settling a score or
reopening an issue on which they were unable to succeed the first time
would necessarily have the best interests of the community at heart.
Equally, if I were a Conservative Minister, perhaps I would not be
thrilled at the prospect that chairs of police authorities I have just
abolished are likely to end up running the show. I am not sure that
their instincts would automatically make them desperate to fit with the
ambitions of the Minister for
Policing.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000160">&#160;</a>

with other things in the proposals, we cannot afford to wait until it
is happening to discover if there is a problem. If we create a crisis
in a major police force because we have not thought through these
problems in advance, it is too late. Surely the onus is on those
proposing the changes to show that they have at least considered the
eventualities and the things that might go wrong, and that they have
answers to those problems. Perhaps the Minister has the answers, but he
has not so far been willing to share them with people who have the
concerns. That is not to say that the plan is entirely wrong or that
there cannot be new ways of working, but he must share the doubts
expressed by others. Surely, at this stage of Committee, it is
reasonable to give us some understanding of how he thinks he would deal
with the problems.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000161">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The interplay between the chief constable and the
commissioner is crucial. There will be clashes on policy, personality
and, perhaps, politics, if the person elected with a political mandate
tries to ram it

                           </div>down the commissioner’s throat. How we deal with this is
important and it needs to be specified. Hampshire police authority
dealt with accountability through the ballot box, and it rightly points
out that if a candidate is standing for one term only, there is no
accountability. He gets elected, and he will not get elected next
time—he is not even going to stand. If he is going to stand for
the full two terms, his accountability is at one point in eight years,
which is when he stands for the second
term.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000162">&#160;</a>

the Minister and his team given any thought to recall, if there is a
clash between the commissioner and the chief constable, and the
commissioner is not doing their job? It is being considered for MPs if
they are not doing a good job. As MPs we are analysed on the net with
theyworkforyou.com, which says how many times an MP has spoken, what
Committees he is on, how many times he has attended, what his interests
are and what he has been active on, so we are accountable there. The
Minister referred to MPs and accountability, but we are accountable,
and there are moves afoot to make us accountable through recall if we
do not do our job. Have the Minister and his team given any thought to
what would happen if a commissioner was not up to the job? We should
not have to wait for four years. This is an important issue, especially
for those who have been affected by crime. We should have recall of a
commissioner who is not doing a proper job.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000163">&#160;</a>

key issue that has arisen in relation to this legislation. I understand
this is a probing amendment in order to open up the issue of
operational independence. If the hon. Member for Gedling is shaking his
head and proposing a substantive amendment, I think it gives rise to
some serious issues, changing quite fundamentally the current balance
in relation to the functions of the chief constable and the
authority that holds the chief to
account.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000164">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to repeat what the Government have said in the House, outside and
in terms to the police: there is no intention on the part of the
Government to interfere with the operational independence of the
police. It is common ground that the police should be operationally
independent. The question arises of what we mean by that and whether
the Bill changes anything in the current arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000165">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First: what
do we mean by operational independence? Strictly, operational
independence is held to mean that, in Lord Denning’s dictum, the
police are accountable only to the law, in the sense that no politician
should, for instance, be able to tell a police officer whom to arrest.
That goes to the issues that the hon. Gentleman raised in relation to
the oath—that is, the independence of a sworn officer, his
allegiance to the Crown and the exercise of his functions as an
officer. Nevertheless, it is widely agreed that that definition of
operational independence is very narrow, and that the police must be
held to account by someone. In the end, a politician or a group of
politicians will have to decide how much money a police force is to
receive; will have to provide an input of the views of the public; will
have to set the priorities of the public and so on.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000166">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman is right that the question whether operational independence
is the right definition, or whether we should move to a definition of
operational 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 209<a class="bkMark" name="Column209">&#160;</a>
                           </div>responsibility was discussed extensively by the Patten review in
Northern Ireland. In the review it was decided that there should be a
new definition of operational responsibility, and that
“independence” was not the right word. That is currently
being discussed in Northern Ireland, because it is not entirely popular
with the police service, which perhaps unsurprisingly adheres to the
concept of operational independence. It is also common ground between
the Government and the police service—though I am not sure
whether the Opposition will agree—that we should not attempt to
define “operational independence” in this Bill. There is
a great deal of case law here. The view of the police service is that
it would not be helpful to cut across the growth in understanding about
what the term means by seeking to rewrite it here in the legislation.
The experience of the Patten Commission, with the considerable period
of deliberation, the proposal for a new definition of operational
responsibility, and the fact that it has not yet been implemented,
might lend force to that
argument.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000167">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
service itself is not asking us to define operational independence. It
has sought, through debate such as this and discussions with the
Government and more widely, an answer to the sort of perfectly fair
questions raised by hon. Members. What happens if a politician who has
a responsibility for the police stands on a platform of saying,
“I would like the police to do something”, and that
starts to cut into an operational matter? He could stand on a platform
and say, for instance, that he wanted more community policing. A police
and crime commissioner who is standing for office is very likely to say
that he is committed to that and that he wants more of it within the
available resource. Given that that appears to cut across a decision on
deployment, that is a commitment for the chief constable to
make.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000168">&#160;</a>

way to both hon. Gentlemen? I will illustrate it with a couple of
examples. The Mayor of London stood for election on a platform of
seeking to deal with knife crime and to put uniformed officers on
public transport. It could be argued that both proposals cut across the
operational independence of the Metropolitan Police Commissioner
because they related to deployment. It is for the commissioner to
decide when he undertakes a knife crime operation in London under
Operation Blunt 2. It is for him to decide how to deploy
officers  on public transport. The commissioner sat down with
the Mayor and devised a way to give effect to what the Mayor sought to
do, because he recognised that the Mayor had a mandate, and that there
was public concern about such issues. Had there been a dispute about
that, it could have gone to the courts. There is a series of
cases—there were some high-profile ones in the 1980s—that
went to court because police authorities fell out with

to draw this example to the attention of hon. Members. Tony Blair
effectively summoned chief constables to Downing street and told them
that something had to be done about street crime. It could be argued
that that cut across their operational independence. They then went
away and had to deploy a resource—at the time, they were given
the resource—to deal with street crime. Any one of those chief
constables could have argued that it was not right to be arraigned by
the Prime Minister. It is possible to argue that the Government,
through the Home Secretary, have a wider duty that enables them to talk
to chief constables about this kind of thing, but it almost certainly
strictly cuts across the operational independence of the
police.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000175">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
most cases, therefore, these issues are settled by sensible debate and
accommodation between the chief officer and the authority. The last
point that I want to make before giving way to hon. Members is that we
do not propose any change in the Bill to the functions of the chief
constable and the police and crime commissioner that affects the issue
of operational independence. It can be argued that there is a different
kind of change because the elected individual—the police and
crime commissioner—will be a more powerful person than the
authority with a mandate. However, there is no change in the powers and
duties that the commissioner has to secure an efficient and effective
force, in relation to giving the chief constable control and direction
of the force. Those are the established legal principles that apply to
police authorities and chief constables at the moment. Every day, there
are discussions between police authorities and chief constables as to
what that means. There are often little skirmishes and wrangles, but
that is the reality under the current system. It is a reflection of the
tripartite arrangement, as between the powers of the centre—the
Home Office—the powers of the chief constable and the powers of
the police
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000176">&#160;</a>

perfectly possible to campaign to be a police and crime commissioner on
the grounds that, in the interests of efficiency, officers must patrol
by themselves, rather than in pairs. He was clear that that was a
legitimate position for someone campaigning for the job of commissioner
and that, if successful, that person would be entitled to put it into
effect. The chief constable told him quite clearly that he regarded
such a decision as operational, so he would not be prepared to pay heed
to that proposal in such an eventuality. Does that not suggest, right
at the start, a major problem? Who is

it is unlikely, if a police authority or an elected individual such as
a mayor had a particular policy, that the chief constable would not
wish to discuss that sensibly in order to implement it. If the chief
constable felt strongly that it was fundamentally wrong, he would have
to make that point to the elected individual. Ultimately, it could
become the subject of a dispute. Such decisions have resource
implications, and the function of the elected individual, as with
police authorities, is to set the budget and the plan and to appoint
the chief constable in the first place. That is the existing
position.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000183">&#160;</a>

would like to challenge the hypothetical argument that has been made,
because we cannot allow it to run on: the idea that someone who runs
for elected office is bound to want to denude all the specialist, less
visible units under his command of police officers, so that he or she
can put them out on the streets. Can someone tell me if that is what
has happened in London? Has the Mayor attempted to denude specialist
units? It would be perfectly legitimate for the Mayor and the deputy
Mayor to have the discussion with the commissioner about how certain
units should be resourced. I have no doubt that the commissioner would
hold that the force is under his direction and control and, ultimately,
that decision is
his.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000184">&#160;</a>

whole point of accountability is that someone should be able to have
that conversation and ask questions. I should point out that in its
report “Valuing the Police”, the independent inspectorate
of constabulary raised the question of whether some of those units were
overmanned.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000185">&#160;</a>

elected after promising change. There might well be a bidding war among
candidates over how far that change will go and the areas in which it
will take place. It is possible that soon after the commissioner is
elected, he will take a more confrontational approach. He will say,
“I have the mandate for this change,” regardless of
whether the chief constable sees it as being within his operational
requirement. If that is not defined, surely the clash will be more
difficult.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000188">&#160;</a>

see through pledges that are not realistic or grounded, particularly if

questions about whether they would actually deliver that. That might

is true that it gives the public a greater voice, and I make no apology
for that. Part of the purpose of the reform is to ensure that the
public have a greater voice and feel that their views are being
reflected. However, it is important that we maintain the principle that
the chief constable is not an employee of the police and crime

Home Secretary’s departure to become shadow Chancellor, I advise
the Opposition to abandon that point, because it resulted in the chief
inspector of constabulary arraigning the right hon. Gentleman about
claims that he made on the Floor of the House about the independent
inspector’s report. The report says—it is worth a read
and I urge every hon. Member to read it—that the visibility and
availability of police forces is, on average, 11% of force strength,
and that that is too low. It is not us saying that it is too low,
although I agree, but the independent inspector. That is being caused
by the draw of officers into specialist units and the growth of
regulation. The inspectorate suggests that that needs to be reversed
and I
agree.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000195">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a serious point about the way in which some specialist units are
resourced. Such decisions will be precisely those that will be
exercised by chief constables in the future because they are, at least
in part, operational matters relating to deployment. PCCs will also be
involved because they set overall budgets and plans. A PCC would want
to have a discussion with a chief constable about how resources were
allocated within the force, and any sensible chief constable would
engage in that discussion. Any sensible police and crime commissioner
would listen very carefully to what the experienced  chief
constable was telling him about the importance of those
units.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000196">&#160;</a>

go back to what I have been saying. What elected individual would
dismantle domestic violence units or missing persons units? Over the
past few weeks, we have seen the most appalling case in relation to a
missing person, which turned out to be an awful murder. The public are
very concerned about missing persons. Domestic violence has been a
growing issue. I do not accept that a credible elected individual who
stands for office and seeks to oversee a force would be persuaded that
it would be sensible to dismantle those units, given all the opprobrium
that would fall on him. In any case, he would not have the power to do
so, because direction and control come under the responsibility of the
chief
constable.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">These
are important issues because it is important that we reassure the
police service that there is no intention that the reform will cut
across operational independence. It is also important that operational
independence is not used as a fig leaf to prevent chief constables and
forces from being properly held to account. My concern about how the
hon. Member for Gedling has drafted his amendment, in which he brings
into play the oath of constable, which arises from common law, is that
as a way of achieving the operational independence that he seeks, it
would come dangerously close to giving the chief constable a free rein
to act as he or she wishes. I do not think that that is the hon.
Gentleman’s intention, but I am advised that that is the danger
of the amendment. It is not the right way to try to define operational
independence, and I repeat that the police service has not asked us not
to make such provision in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000198">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked specifically about the Home Affairs
Committee’s proposal for a memorandum of understanding about how
the relationship would work. I have been discussing a protocol to
govern this arrangement, rather like the one being drawn up in Northern
Ireland. I have already said on the Floor of the House that a
memorandum of understanding would

                           </div>be a good idea. We should not envisage that this document will seek to
define operational independence when we are being advised not to do so.
However, it would help the service if we had clearly set out the
principal role of police and crime commissioners
and the role of the chief constable, and indeed the role of the Home
Office, as the other member of the tripartite group, because it is not
always clear where the responsibilities lie.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000199">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A number of
recent issues have raised the question of where responsibility lies
between the chief constable, police authorities under the current model
and the Home Office. One very important example is the use of water
cannon. Some chief constables were suggesting that the deployment of
water cannon would be entirely a matter for them—I agree. If
water cannons were to be permissible in this country, I think that it
would be for a chief constable to decide. Such an operational decision
should always be a decision made by a chief officer, not a politician.
However, I think that a chief constable who took that kind of step
would be very unwise if there had not been previous discussion with
their police authority about the use of water cannon and the authority
had then agreed to that use. Such previous discussion is required for
the use of force such as Tasers, and some authorities do not permit the
use of such force. Furthermore, the Home Secretary has pointed out that
the use of water cannon has to be authorised by the Home Secretary in
the first place. There is no definition of operational independence
that says that these decisions are only for chief
officers.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000200">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the real world, no chief constable would ever want to take such a step
without ensuring that his or her own police authority agreed with it
because, frankly, it requires political imprimatur to take such a
decision. Indeed, we find that the Home Office has a role in
authorising the use of such equipment. The Home Office has an ongoing
role in the governance of policing in a number of areas, another good
example of which is surveillance.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000201">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not think that we are talking about the same
thing. The Minister quite rightly describes a situation of a chief
constable seeking approval for an action that he thinks is justified,
which I understand. The conflict that we are worried about is when the
commissioner wishes to impose what he thinks is a political mandate,
but the chief constable does not agree. As the Minister
pointed out earlier, the chief constable can be
sacked by the commissioner, so he is not exactly in an equal
position.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000202">&#160;</a>

happened in London. I accept that the commissioner of the police in
London—effectively the chief constable—resigned, although
that was not over a disagreement about deployment; it was simply that
the Mayor had lost confidence in that individual. I happen to think
that the Mayor was reflecting the view of Londoners and I do not think
that most Londoners disagreed with that decision. The Mayor was
absolutely entitled to exercise that view, and that was a strength of
the system, not a weakness, because the system had previously not
allowed the view of Londoners to be expressed because the then Home
Secretary appeared to be determined to keep that particular
individual.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000203">&#160;</a>

policing issues with ACPO leads on particular areas of crime. My hon.
Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup, the Minister for Crime
Prevention, has had such conversations as well, and the chief officers
discuss such issues with us. I am sure that they did so with the hon.
Gentleman, too. There would have been occasions when what the previous
Government were doing could have been cutting across the operational
independence of chief officers by demanding that certain things were
done in certain ways, but they were the elected Government with the
responsibility to ensure efficient and effective policing and to keep

of debate there has been an assumption that, in some way, elected
politicians might make their decisions on where to prioritise police
resources for political reasons and politicise the police, whereas
chief constables would always make decisions based purely on
operational requirements. However, when Sir Ian Blair was first
appointed to his post in London, he stated that one of his top
priorities was to crack down on middle-class drug-taking. I remember
thinking at the time that that could not be a priority for London. Is
it not the case that actually senior police officers have been making
political decisions for years, and that these changes will actually
bring policing back to the people because they will have someone
representing the concerns of the many, expressing those concerns to the
senior police officers at the
top.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000213">&#160;</a>

does not cut across the conventions and the legal position of the chief
constable and those who hold the force to account. The bigger problem,
actually, has been that chief constables have tended to look to
Whitehall and Westminster for such political direction, when what the
tripartite arrangement should have achieved until it was distorted was
that chief constables were attending to the views of local people. That
is the change that we wish to

that we do not allow chief constables to exercise any element of
producer capture, or not to be held to account for the way in which
policing is conducted. It is right that the public should have a

the ability to appoint and dismiss chief constables. Police and crime
commissioners will have that ability, too, subject to the checks and
balances that we have set out. That is part of the reassurance that we
have given on operational independence. We have put in place
measures—I am sure we will come to this in later

difference in the Committee. The Minister, for all the reasons that he

more difficulty than can be overcome by a good deal of common sense,
stiff upper lip and away we go—all sorted. We are moving into a
fundamentally different environment with directly elected people in
every police force area, as I have said, with a mandate. To get
elected, people will make promises. Other people will make promises.
There will be a manifesto competition. When people are elected on that
mandate, they will seek to implement it. The Minister says that that is
not a problem, because they will sit down and talk about it and come to
an agreement. He quoted a couple of examples of when that had happened,
including in the
1980s.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000224">&#160;</a>

fact of the matter is, there is a very real problem here. We have heard
evidence galore that there is a very real problem. The Home Affairs
Committee has said it is such a problem that there needs to be a
memorandum of understanding. The police prefer a code of practice, but
it amounts to the same thing. The Minister clearly

memorandum to clarify the respective roles of the police and crime
commissioner and the chief constable. If it was as clear as the
Minister made out in the arguments he articulated, there would not be a
need for it, because everyone would understand what was going to
happen. I am glad that he has agreed to it. It would be churlish of me

                           </strong> Is not the problem with the Minister’s
response that he has based his argument on the fact that we are dealing
with the familiar problem of police authorities and operational
independence? He bases his argument for the Bill’s provisions,
however, on the fact that he is going to do something radical, new and
different that will empower PCCs. He is sweeping away police
authorities and introducing a much more powerful body. How can he use
one argument to justify his defence when his argument for the Bill is
the exact
opposite?<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000227">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The point is that each area has somebody with a
mandate who has been elected as a result of making certain promises.
The Minister must be worried about that, otherwise there would be no
need for a memorandum of understanding or a code of practice, and the
existing arrangements and good, common sense would be
okay.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000228">&#160;</a>

Minister did not respond to one point. It is important that an
elementary draft of the memorandum of understanding or code of practice
should be placed before the Committee and Parliament, so that we can
look at what the Minister, along with his officials and based on
discussions with others, is trying to put together to help to resolve
the tension. This debate is important and I would like to test the

amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000277">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Would
the Minister say a little more about the staffing arrangements that he
expects for the PCC? We have made reference in the amendment to the
possible need for a staffing plan, and it would be interesting to know
what salaries he expects. From my reading of the Bill I understand that
the PCC must appoint a chief executive, a chief financial officer and
so on. What does the Minister envisage as the salary of the
commissioner himself? Is £120,000 the accurate staffing figure
for a PCC? What salaries does he expect for the chief executive and the
chief financial officer? Will there be a maximum budget? Will staffing
be regulated? Is there a limit on the number of staff that a PCC may
have, or does that depend on circumstances? I am not clear about where
the budget comes from and how much they can actually
have.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000278">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
also want to raise some issues that have been mentioned by a number of
organisations. One is diversity, which the Minister addressed earlier.
We need to have diversity within this structure. If a PCC establishes
an office that functions well, what does he envisage happening to those
staff when the PCC stands down or is not returned? Would all the staff
working for the PCC automatically be made redundant? As he knows, there
is a concern about the loss of expertise in such circumstances. I am
trying to find out a little more about the staffing structure for the
PCC.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000279">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The cost is a very important point, because we are
told by the Government—I do not know whether they still cling to
this ludicrous point—that it will not cost more than the present
system. As I said earlier, I think the cost is likely to mushroom with
the number of people working for PCCs. We will see that money is spent
on that, rather than on front-line policing, which is what we
want.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000280">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is a fair and interesting point. It is not
clear what we are talking about in terms of cost. How many people can
be employed? What are the salaries? What is going on? There is no
clarity. I want to give the Minister the opportunity to include in the
Bill something about staffing; something about costs; something about
how many staff will be employed; something about where that budget will
come from; and something in answer to the other questions about the
transition.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000281">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I welcome the opportunity to respond to the
question of the salaries of PCCs. The salaries have not been set in the
Bill. We have made it clear that we will take advice from the SSRB on
the level of these salaries. That was the established practice when new
posts were set out under the previous Government, and the Home
Secretary has just written to the chairman of the SSRB to ask for
advice on that
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000284">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
was speculation as to the size of the salaries, because, for the
purposes of providing the regulatory impact assessment, we had to
indicate what the salary might be to work out what the costs of the new
organisation would be. That is all in the regulatory impact assessment,
but that was in no way setting any kind of benchmark or indicating that
the Government’s view was that that total amount of
£120,000 per annum, which included the cost of national
insurance and so on, would be given to police and crime
commissioners.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000285">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister is right that the previous Government
used the SSRB, although not, as I recall, for elected posts. Will the
public know beforehand how much the commissioner they are being asked
to elect is going to cost them? Will that decision have been made and
will it be available to the public before the election, or will they
find out after they have made their
decision?<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000286">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It will certainly be available to the public
beforehand, because it would not be right for  the directly
elected police and crime commissioners to be able to set their own
salary in the same way that Members of Parliament have salaries set
centrally. We felt that it was right in relation to police and crime
commissioners. <em>[</em>

that it is absolutely the determination of the Government that police

is important that they do
not.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000288">&#160;</a>

holding the elections, relates to the proposal from the hon. Member for
Gedling for directly elected chairs of police authorities, which we
heard this morning. The cost of those elections would be exactly the
same, so I do not think that that was ever a strong argument from the
Opposition. It is actually an argument against democracy; it says that
we should not have an election simply because of its cost. That is a
very poor argument indeed for democrats to advance. It is now a doubly
poor argument for the Opposition to prosecute, because their policy
would involve exactly the same cost in holding an election for a
directly elected chair of a police
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000299">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I just wanted to seek a bit of clarity from the
Minister. If I understood him correctly, it is his expectation and wish
that the costs should not be any greater than the current ones. I am
not clear where in the Bill there is any mechanism to prevent the cost
from rising. Does he have a plan for reserved powers or capping? It is
all right to wish it, and I share his wish, but things happen that we
do not foresee. What will happen if the costs rise? How will that be
stopped?<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000300">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let me come directly to that important point. In
designing the policy, we considered carefully whether it would be right
to set a limit on the amount that the police and crime commissioner
could spend on the organisation, which gave rise to a number of issues.
First, there are differing costs for the different police
authorities—costs that relate not only to their size. Secondly,
that assumes that police and crime commissioners would continue to
exercise all the functions that police 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 223<a class="bkMark" name="Column223">&#160;</a>
                           </div>authorities exercise, in the same way. The issue of complaints is a very
good example of an area where the functions of the police and crime
commissioner might increase, because the police and crime commissioner
might start taking more of the complaints that are currently made to
the force. An adjustment of resource might be needed to accommodate
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000301">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The bigger
point, however, is whether the answer is to cap those costs, as the
hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak suggests. We all agree that we
must bear down on administrative overheads, but is it best to prescribe
that in the legislation, which I think would be difficult?
Alternatively, is it best to do as we have done, and to have
transparency—to reveal the costs by providing that they must be
published and scrutinised by the police and crime panel, so that the
public will know? Of course, there will be league tables of the police
and crime commissioners, showing how much they are costing.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000302">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Journalists
will raise serious questions about the overheads of the organisation.
Any police and crime commissioner who sought to increase the overhead
would have to explain why that money was being taken from the policing
budget, and they would be scrutinised by the police and crime panel. In
the current environment, the public expect answerability on costs such
as these, as they have had in the House, as we all know; transparency
will allow that. It will be very hard for a PCC to increase costs in a
way that is out of tune with what the public want, and in a way
that appears to be denuding the policing
budget.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000303">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> So what the Minister is really saying is that he
hopes that the police and crime commissioner will not exceed the costs,
but he is not prepared to put any mechanism in place to ensure that
that does not happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000304">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This goes to the heart of a new approach. The
hon. Gentleman subscribes to the bureaucratic accountability that we
seek to sweep away from our public services. We subscribe to a new
politics, which uses transparency and strong democratic accountability
and answerability to achieve the same effect. Our proposals will be far
more effective, revealing this information, holding people to account
and giving the public a
say.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000305">&#160;</a>

me put this back to the hon. Gentleman: what say do the public have at
the moment, and what ability do they have to control the costs of
police authorities? Absolutely none. They do not know who these police
authorities are. They have no control over the budget whatever. When it
comes to these elected offices, they will have a very close interest.
Different candidates will stand, I have no doubt, on a platform of
seeking to control those costs. The democratic accountability will be
sharper and the cost control will be greater, and hon. Members should
see
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000306">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am extremely grateful to the Minister for giving
way, and I do not want to prolong this. It is one thing to argue that
transparency and the threat of the newspapers will hold down costs but,
as he has argued all day, we are talking about a new body with new
responsibilities that may have far more complaints to deal with. It
will certainly have to deal with much 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 224<a class="bkMark" name="Column224">&#160;</a>
                           </div>more public engagement, and that in itself has costs, as he well knows.
It is perfectly possible that a PCC will argue that the costs are
justified because they are required to do the job. In those
circumstances, his wish would be disappointed. What would he do
then?<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000307">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That should be a matter for local determination.
Let the PCC argue that; if it is a good case, the public will accept
it. The PCP will issue a report. Those people do not have a direct
relationship with the PCC, and they do not stand on the same electoral
platform. They are appointed by their local councils, and they will
scrutinise and make a judgment. If a PCP issued an excoriating report,
saying that the PCC had put up costs excessively, that would be very
difficult for the PCC to justify to the local media and his electorate.
Equally, if the PCP says, “There is a perfectly reasonable case
for this”—if what the PCC actually did was institute a
new unit or a new programme of engagement, and it accepts that that is
a good use of public money—it is likely that
the local electorate will accept that, too.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000308">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are not
setting up anything that will give rise to a problem. We are actually
giving the public a greater say in all those matters. It is important
to note that police governance is not cost-free at the moment; there is
a cost to police authorities, and that will read across. We are talking
about standing up an organisation that collectively spends £13
billion a year. Of course there has to be some overhead, but I think we
all agree that it should be reasonable and minimised.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000309">&#160;</a>

have broader responsibilities than authorities. They are police and
crime commissioners. They will hold a budget, devolved from the Home
Office, for engaging in crime prevention measures and so on. We are
determined that, in spite of their broader responsibilities, they
should continue to be able to exercise those within the same budget as
authorities. So we are proposing, to coin a phrase, that they deliver
more with
less.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000310">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Police authorities have staff at present. What
used to be known as clerks of police authorities have become known as
chief executives, and they provide advice to the authority. The police
and crime commissioner will wish to have staff. We will make
transitional arrangements for the passporting of staff from existing
authorities to PCCs in the first instance, then we will come to the
transition arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000317">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It will be up
to PCCs whom they appoint. We are determined that such appointments
should be on merit and should be politically restricted posts. That
sends an important signal that we do not wish staff to be political
advisers or people who are exercising party functions; they should be
professional. The PCC will receive advice from his or her own
staff—that is the first point. Secondly, the PCCs will certainly
receive advice from the police and crime panels. Such panels will
exercise a formal scrutiny role of PCCs, but will have a relationship
with them. Thirdly, PCCs are free to obtain advice from anybody. They
may appoint non-paid advisers if they wish—we have not said
whether they have to do so, it is entirely a matter for them, but I am
sure that they would find that useful. There is flexibility for the PCC
to employ staff as he or she sees
fit.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000318">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am confident in responding to the hon. Gentleman about the matter of
existing staff maintaining their contracts if a PCC were to stand down
under any of the procedures that we have set out, because staff will be
employed by the PCC in their corporate role, which is precisely why we
are creating a corporate entity. The PCC’s rights and
liabilities as an employer will pass automatically to the successor and
there will be no change in the employment status of staff as a result
of the transition. I hope that I have addressed the key
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000319">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Does the Minister not see a situation arising in
which, particularly if a new commissioner has come in and defeated the
sitting commissioner, there could be issues with some of the staff,
perhaps including close advisers? Would such staff have opportunities
to move outside the organisation—to be transferred
elsewhere—if the new commissioner did not feel confident to
maintain that arrangement?<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000320">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Two positions are provided for in the Bill in
relation to a chief executive and a chief finance officer, thus
ensuring proper governance of the corporate entity around the PCC. The
PCC will then employ staff, some of whom will no doubt be on long-term
employment contracts, others of whom will be on short-term contracts as
policy advisers.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000321">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">An incoming
PCC may wish to bring in some staff to provide advice on particular
issues. That will be up to them, but such advice would be scrutinised.
Again, principles of transparency would apply, which the PCP

                           </div>would be able to scrutinise. I repeat that PCCs would not be able to
appoint political advisers; our clear intention is to prevent that, and
we have legislated to  do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000322">&#160;</a>

have addressed the concerns that hon. Members have expressed. The

the schedule, and it would not be the appropriate way to achieve the
clarification that the hon. Member for Gedling wants. I hope that, on
the basis of what I have said, he will feel able to
withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000323">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I intend to withdraw the amendment. However, I do
not share the right hon. Gentleman’s optimism. I share the view
of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak, on the matter
of somebody being a new police and crime commissioner, then worrying
about what will happen to staffing in four years’ time. I think
they will recruit. The chief financial officer or the chief executive
and the question of what their salaries will be was not mentioned.
Other people will be included. Chapter 3 refers to a large number of
responsibilities that the police and crime commissioner will be
required to take on. The Minister and I differ on the cost, and I would
be extremely surprised if the cost came in anywhere near the 
existing
level.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000324">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister needs to be very careful. He might not like the
£120,000 figure but, as he said, that figure is in the Home
Office documents that accompany the Bill and it is the figure that
everybody is quoting. He will have a real job putting that one back
into the box. On the last point on political advisers, what the
Minister is talking about is active political activity. According to
the legislation, someone can still be a member of a political party and
be a member of the commissioner’s
staff.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000325">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> May I ask the hon. Gentleman to accept, first,
that we are not setting the salary at £120,000 a year. That is
not our intention. As a former Minister, he will know that we have to
complete these impact assessments to say what the costings are. That is
why the figure appeared. However, it will be for the SSRB to determine.
Secondly, it is our policy intention to prevent political advisers from
being appointed by police and crime commissioners. If he has a proposal
to improve upon the drafting to achieve that—that is not a
straightforward matter—I would happily consider
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11012617000326">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will have a look at that. On the issue of the
£120,000, it would have been helpful if the Minister said what
