                        <p class="tabbed">The
objectives of amendment 16 are many and varied, and I think that it
will be useful if I take the Committee through them one by one. First,
proposed new subsection (2)(a) would secure the placing of at least one
representative from those directly employed by the privatised Royal
Mail or its successors on the board of the new company. I am sure that
the Minister will agree with the sentiment that that would be a
beneficial step for the new company and that it must be secured in the
negotiating stage with the prospective bidders. If the amendment was
accepted, it would become a requirement in law and it would be
necessary for the agreement to be effective immediately in the
construction of the new management set-up. It is appropriate that the
Secretary of State should have the power and responsibility to police
and approve such a contract and satisfy himself that the aims and
objectives of the legislation have been met to allow him to comply with
his other responsibilities under the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000021">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Including a
representative from the work force directly employed by Royal Mail or
its successors would provide an opportunity for a close working
relationship at board level, which would be a real advantage to the
company. From the employees’ point of view, it would provide an
opportunity to ensure that their concerns and suggestions were raised,
and that they had input into the company at the highest level. It would
be a natural avenue for developing a relationship between management
and work force in a way that would only strengthen the company in what
we have been told by the Government and the witnesses in our evidence
sessions will be an ever-challenging set of circumstances. Employees
would be able to have greater faith in the management decisions of the
new company as it moved forward into that uncharted territory if such
an arrangement was in place and they could be part of the
decision-making
process.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
would expect a clear set of regulations to be worked out by the company
to ensure that there was a precise set of channels to allow a two-way
flow of information, to and from the work force and the board, through
the directly employed representative. On the employer side, such an
arrangement would be a sign of faith that the work force are one of the
biggest assets that a company can have—the other, of course,
being the customer. Furthermore, my hon. Friends and I would not object
to the appointment of a customer representative on the board. Perhaps
the Minister will think about that suggestion and draft a Government
amendment to incorporate such a proposal. We will wait with bated
breath.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
such representation existed, the board would be able to make quicker
and clearer decisions. As Mr Brydon, the chairman of Royal
Mail, said in his
evidence:<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>The
amendment would allow quickness and flexibility, which would be lost if
such representation did not exist in the company, which has had several
problems in the liaisons between management and work force in the past.
I am sure that the Minister and the board of the new business agree
that good working relationships are vital. They will be extremely
important in the new business so I firmly believe that the amendment
would be a great step forward. It would compel the management to invest
and show its faith in the work force. My hon. Friends and, indeed, the
work force would expect the representative, if the amendment were
accepted, to have the same power and responsibilities of other board
representatives to ensure equal representation. It would not be
acceptable to have anything
less.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000025">&#160;</a>

employee on the board just because the organisation is in private not
public ownership. The previous Government, particularly through the
Postal Services Act 2000, made it clear that Royal Mail Holdings
operated at arm’s length from the Government and that they would
not intervene. Indeed, the Government did not intervene in the
relationships between the work force and the management. It would have
been appropriate, therefore, given the hon. Gentleman’s
argument, to have an employee representative on the board under the
previous Government. Why was that not the
case?<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000031">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We are debating the Government’s Bill, not
what happened in the past. In evidence, Richard Hooper talked about
employee representation on Post Danmark and how successful that was. We
have heard from the Committee about international competition and how
we should learn from what is happening internationally, so we should
learn about what is happening internationally on this matter,

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would not restrict representation on the board to only one
representative, but it would provide for “at least one”
directly employed representative. If the management and, indeed, the
work force saw real added value in increasing the number from one,
nothing in the amendment would prevent that from occurring. However, we
always want to provide flexibility and such matters should be for the
whole organisation to determine when the work load of the first
representative has been evaluated.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000033">&#160;</a>

hon. Members, and perhaps even the Minister, think that that might be a
foregone conclusion and that the provision is unnecessary, but let us
just put it in the Bill, in case Royal Mail is purchased by an overseas
company that wants to incorporate the headquarters of the newly
privatised Royal Mail into, say, its own HQ elsewhere in Europe or,
indeed, further
afield.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000035">&#160;</a>

may be in our interpretation of the word “royal,” but as

UK.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000036">&#160;</a>

an operating HQ in the UK would make things easier and less demanding

and solutions in relation to the issues we are considering. It is also
preferable to retain management jobs in this country, to ensure that
the work force can relate appropriately to those in the relevant
positions, and so that all workers in the business can have available
to them a ladder of development that does not rely on their eventual
relocation overseas, with all the difficulties that that would

am surprised that no one has intervened on whether there would be legal
difficulties relating to the amendment. How will the Government be able
to tie a successful bidder into an extended inter-business agreement
with the Post Office? That is seen as instrumental for the survival of
the Post Office. It is an objective that the Minister himself holds. If
one can be done, I do not see how the other cannot be done. If none can
be done—if we cannot have a long-lasting IBA and cannot have the
HQ in the UK, for legal reasons—perhaps the Minister will tell
us
why.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000055">&#160;</a>

the Secretary of State agreed such a plan to allow the business
headquarters to relocate overseas, it would be possible for Parliament
to question him on the basis of that decision and hold him accountable.
That would create a level of transparency and accountability lacking
without such an amendment. Indeed, as in paragraph (b), if the Minister
thinks that that would never occur, there is little to be lost from his
agreeing to the amendment, just as an insurance
policy.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000056">&#160;</a>

of the Committee for the proposed new subsection to clause 2, in its
entirety, would be necessary for paragraph (c) to be activated, but if
the Minister feels unable to accept all the excellent suggestions put
forward in amendment 16, I encourage him to go away, as has been
suggested, and think about the bits that he can relate to. I am sure
that there must be many and I am sure, as the debate goes on, that
there will be even more. However, I encourage him to go away and bring
back Government amendments on those areas to allow me, and my hon.

him.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000057">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
paragraph (d), it is vital that such a consultation exercise with those
involved in the provision of postal services in the UK be undertaken
where the details of the proposal can be made clearly to those with an
interest in the provision of services, and in a way that allows a
valuable dialogue to be established in the consultation process. I do
not want to be prescriptive here as to who “all” is, and
I want to provide the Minister with a degree of that word flexibility
that everybody is talking about, but I have no doubt that the Minister
and his officials would be able to draw together an appropriate list of
consultees, ranging from employee groups to sub-postmasters and
business provision partners. That consultation would allow all those
vital sectors of the organisation, and its service provision, to
comment on the proposals of any such transfer, and it would be expected
that all possible details not covered by commercial confidentiality
would be made available to the consultees, as that would add value to
the consultation
process.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000058">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
consultation process would result in the Secretary of State having a
clear understanding of the views of the consultees on the proposals.
His response to the consultation would allow him to absorb the areas of
improvement that may come from the consultation in such a way that
empowers him, if necessary, to return to improve, or alter, the
disposal arrangements with the preferred successful bidder. I accept
that that would become a negotiating matter, but the Secretary of State
would be empowered by the strength of the consultation exercise.
Indeed, the preferred bidder would also be able to judge the strength
of issues coming from the process—a win-win situation. The
content of the formal response would, of course, be within the powers
of the Secretary of State to determine—again, an example of my
acknowledgment of the need for flexibility. I would, however, expect
any Secretary of State to take detailed cognisance of the submissions
made and have their contributions evaluated fairly before making any
response.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000061">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">After the
completion of that process, it would be necessary for the Secretary of
State to instruct that a ballot of all employees of the affected Royal
Mail company be held on the issue of disposal. That is covered in
paragraph (e) of the amendment. It would be necessary for the Secretary
of State to ensure a simple majority of the work force to enable the
disposal to take place. That restriction on the Secretary of State
would be beneficial for the bidder because, if the required majority
was achieved, the preferred bidder would be very secure in the
knowledge that a majority of the work force was in favour of the
agreement that had been reached between them and the Secretary of
State. I hope my hon. Friends agree that this would be hugely important
to the well-being of relationships within the new company and would be
a sound platform for the business to develop in the years
ahead.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000062">&#160;</a>

and I support him to a great extent, but could he explain the slight
contradiction between paragraphs (d) and (e)? Paragraph (d) asks for a
consultation with all those engaged in the provision of postal
services, which is much wider than the workers in Royal Mail itself. I
understand that his argument may be that the workers in Royal Mail are
the ones who are directly affected by a transfer, but given that Post
Office Ltd has been split off from Royal Mail, sub-postmasters and
consumers will also be directly affected. Has he thought of any way,
other than the consultation, that their views can be taken into account
before a sale to a specified bidder takes
place?<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000063">&#160;</a>

which I am sure the Minister has noted. He may come back on Report with
just such an amendment. The aim of all this redrafting is to achieve a
level of consultation and approval for the selling off of Royal Mail
that does not exist at present. Our amendments may not be perfect and
the Minister and his officials may well be able to improve on them, but
there is a process for doing so and I look forward to that debate
developing and the Minister coming back with some suggestions of his
own.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000064">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As I have
employed people for many years, I know how vital it is to have a
contented work force. As I have said on many occasions and as I will no
doubt say again in this Committee, any business has two main assets:
its customers and its work force. In an organisation such as Royal Mail
the work force are also, partially, the customers so there is an even
greater need to have their agreement on such a fundamental change to a
British institution. I make that comment in relation to what the hon.
Member for Angus just said. In the ballot proposed in the amendment
there would be some customer representation because everybody who works
for Royal Mail is a customer
too.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of
course, there is a possibility that the work force could reject the
proposals put forward as a result of the Secretary of State’s
deliberations with potential bidders, but if that were the case I would
have to conclude that it was not a very good deal for either the
business or the employees. In such a case I am sure that the Secretary
of State would welcome the arguments made in such a process and use
those to his best interests in the future. He could renegotiate and
revisit the consultation exercise and work force vote. That would be
his prerogative, but it would have to be done in a way that was
constructive and showed improvements on any previously rejected
proposals; otherwise he would be wasting everyone’s time and my
hon. Friends and I do not believe that this or any future Secretary of
State would want to embark on such
posturing.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
like Mr Sibbick, the secretary of the Mail Competition Forum, who gave
evidence to the Committee, I would like to be optimistic. So I will be
optimistic on behalf of the Secretary of State and assume that his
negotiating skills, consultation abilities and balloting skills have
got him to a position where he has an option that has been positively
consulted upon and has secured a work force majority. At this point
paragraph (f) would be engaged and the Secretary of State would have to
present to Parliament a Bill that conferred on him the power to dispose
of the business in relation to the bid on which he has already
consulted and secured work force
approval.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
suggest that the Minister should see that hurdle as little or no
obstacle, because, if all the preceding points have been secured, the
approval of Parliament should be a follow-on step in the process. That
would allow parliamentarians to comment and vote on the proposals,
which would be a just and appropriate part of the process, and would
add a further level of transparency and authority to any sale, which is
sadly lacking from the Bill as it

been much said, and there will be more, about the universal service
provision—it is dear to my heart for a number of reasons. My
constituency has many rural parts—indeed, I have lived in some
of those locations, which make part of my constituency look like a
metropolis. I can understand, therefore, any new provider’s
business argument to reduce the universal service obligations. However,
for constituents who live in rural parts—in some cases in
absolute isolation, as the hon. Member for Angus mentioned in the
previous sitting—the service must not be allowed to be
eroded.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000081">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Why should I get a six-day service when I am in
London on parliamentary business, but a lesser service when I return
home to Scotland, just because it is a bit more isolated? Why should
people—or businesses—who want to contact me by post have
to pay a premium because I live a bit further away than somebody else?
It simply is not fair, and the Government must guarantee the universal
service provision. My hon. Friend and I had in mind the best interests
of families up and down the UK when we tabled the amendment. At the
same time, we were considering the Minister’s position and we
thought that he needed a little help.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As the hon.
Member for Angus has suggested, we need to consider the impact of the
universal service provision on UK businesses. In evidence to Committee,
I highlighted how many small businesses rely on the post for a range of
services, including payments. Many also receive purchase orders, legal
documents, architectural drawings, products to sell and products that
they have bought, and myriad other things. Why should such businesses
in my constituency, or in that of the hon. Member for Angus, get a
lesser service than businesses in city centres? I do not think that
they should—neither, I am sure, do the hon. Gentleman or my hon.
Friends. To protect households and businesses, the universal service
provision, as currently enjoyed, must be secured in a Bill that would
empower the Secretary of State to sell off the best china—the
amendment proposes just that.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
paragraph (f)(iii) of the amendment would require the Secretary of
State to include in such a Bill a report on the progress of Royal
Mail’s modernisation at 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 240<a class="bkMark" name="Column240">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the time of the proposed transfer. That measure is necessary because it
will be vital for parliamentarians to understand the level of progress
that has been made, to ensure that they are able fully to evaluate the
benefits, or otherwise, of any deal that the Secretary of State
proposes.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What will be
the value of the unspent budget allocated to the modernisation process
at that point in time—if there is a balance, depending on when
the sale proceeds and how future modernisation is funded, assuming that
the business is not sold by the end of this modernisation period? We
have tried to draw the Minister on that. He has not yet bitten the
hook, but we will continue to try to get him to comment on
that—not to have him wriggle on our line, but so that we may
understand his intentions for future modernisation should Royal Mail
not be sold before the end of this modernisation process. It is
important to be able to evaluate that, which will empower
parliamentarians with the knowledge of how much progress has been made,
and at what cost. It is also important to establish the Secretary of
State’s vision for the unspent modernisation budget, if there is
one. Does he see it returning to the Treasury, where it would be out of
Royal Mail’s control, or does he intend to donate it to the
successful bidder? That is a vital question, but the Bill does not
require it to be addressed. Our amendments would prompt the dispersal
of such
knowledge.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are serious issues that require the Government’s attention, and
by accepting the amendment the Minister could ensure that such matters
receive not only Government attention, but parliamentary attention.
That would provide him and the Secretary of State with a level of
transparency that I am sure they are anxious to achieve in any
deal.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Pulling
all that together, amendment 16 is large and important. It is important
because it delivers a level of security, checks and balances, and
transparency that the Bill fails to provide. As it stands, clause 2
does not do what it should say on the tin. In the evidence session last
week, the Minister was found wanting in his response to my hon. Friend
the Member for Telford. It is with those reasons in mind that I have
delayed the Committee on this matter for so long this morning. I look
forward to hearing further contributions on this amendment. If the
Minister feels that the conditions laid out in the amendment are too
onerous, I will offer him, in the spirit of giving, three
alternatives to
consider.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000091">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I move on to amendments 17, 18 and 15, which are in
my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli. First,
amendments 17 and 18 call for either a super-affirmative motion or an
affirmative motion before the Bill, or the order to which it refers,
becomes lawful. As there are a number of new MPs on this Committee, it
might be useful if I explain how those work. Older heads, such as the
Minister, can rest their ears at this
point.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First,
if anyone is keen to read about it in more detail, the
super-affirmative resolution procedure is defined by section 18 of the
Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. In a nutshell, the
procedure outlines a 60-day period following the laying of an order by
the Minister, during which the relevant parliamentary Committees 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 241<a class="bkMark" name="Column241">&#160;</a>
                           </div>may report on the draft order, or either House may make a resolution on
it. The Minister would have to have regard to any such reports or
resolutions, as well as any other representations made on the draft
order. Once the 60-day period has expired, if the Minister wished to
make the order with no changes, he would have to lay a statement before
the House. He could then make an order in the terms of the draft,
assuming that it had been approved by a resolution of each House of
Parliament. Alternatively, if the Minister wished to make an order that
is a revised version of the draft order he has laid, he would have to
lay before Parliament a revised draft of the order and a statement that
specifically sets out the proposed revision. If that is approved by the
aforesaid resolution of each House of Parliament, he may then make the
order. If Members would like an example of where such a
super-affirmative motion could be used, they could look at sections 17
and 18 of the Digital Economy Act
2010.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000094">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

am<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000170">&#160;</a>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">Members
will perhaps be relieved to know that the super-affirmative motion is
the more complex of the two, and that an affirmative resolution
procedure is less complicated. In this matter, the Minister may make an
order in terms of the draft only if the draft order has been approved
by a resolution of each House of Parliament after 40 days, not 60 days,
of the order being laid before Parliament. Again, if Members wish to
see an example of this procedure in action, they can look at section 47
of the Higher Education Act
2004.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000095">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Turning
to amendment 15, if the Minister wished to dispense with these
procedures too, as I expect he might, the option would remain for the
Secretary of State to lay a Bill before Parliament, which is not to be
confused with the Bill referred to in amendment
16.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments are important as they would put a duty on the Government to
come to Parliament and seek the Houses’ permission to sell the
business based on the deal on the table. In my view, and that of the
Opposition, the duty to report back to Parliament is vital. I am sure
that the Minister will agree that I have been incredibly gracious and
flexible in offering him three—indeed four—alternatives
to the Bill as it stands, or three alternatives, should he find the
sacrifices in amendment 16 too demanding. I am sure that the Minister
will also agree that any decision to sell off part of such an historic
and valued organisation as Royal Mail must, at a minimum, be subject to
a vote by the people’s representatives on the value of the deal
on the
table.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000097">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not want to repeat what I have said earlier, but I want to stress to
the Minister and the Committee the importance of bringing any proposed
decision to sell to Parliament for approval. As the Bill stands, the
only duty on the Secretary of State after he decides to sell is to lay
a Command Paper in the Vote Office, and referred representation about
what that may mean. Surely we need a little more detail from the
Minister and a larger commitment from the Government to report
adequately to Parliament on this vital
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000098">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
conclude, I am trying to help the Minister by offering four
alternatives that would allow him to engage Parliament. The Minister
has sat on the Back Benches 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 242<a class="bkMark" name="Column242">&#160;</a>
                           </div>long enough to appreciate that the authority of Parliament should be
absolute, so it is my hope that he will  consider the
amendments seriously in his deliberations with
officials.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000099">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In another
nutshell, when the criticism rains down on the Minister’s head
that not enough consultation has taken place and that the proposals
have been rushed through Parliament, I hope that he will think back to
today and remember that he had the opportunity—indeed, four
opportunities—to ensure that Parliament has been properly
consulted on the decision to sell off part of the national institution
that we all know as Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000100">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to make a brief speech on the clause and on
amendment 16. I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman, and I have a
great deal of sympathy for his argument even though, as I pointed out
in one or two interventions, I see some difficulties with it.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000101">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The main
difficulty, particularly with paragraph (a), is that we do not know the
final structure of any privatised company, should that disaster come
about. The Bill, as it stands, allows for 90% of Royal Mail to be sold
off, with 10% of shares going to the work force. If Royal Mail is sold
off by a public offering, it may have many shareholders, in which case
the 10% shareholding of the employees could be significant. If Royal
Mail is, however, sold off to, for example, Deutsche Post or TNT, which
would then control 90% of the shares, the 10% share held by the work
force would not be that significant. The final structure will depend on
how many members of the board should be from the work force. While I
fully appreciate the amendment and would agree that it is important
that a representative of the work force is on the board, the number and
how that is done will depend on the final structure of any privatised
company—although we hope that it is not privatised, but that is
an argument for
later.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000102">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
was interested in what the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire
had to say about the headquarters of the company. Again, that is
something that I have a great deal of sympathy for. In Scotland, we
have experience of companies that have been taken over and of promises
being made that the headquarters will remain in Edinburgh. What
happens, however, is that there is a brass plaque on a plate somewhere
in an office in Edinburgh and real control is exercised elsewhere. That
has been a problem of the Scottish economy for many years. I am
concerned that the same thing might happen here, especially if there is
a sale to a foreign company, which might have its main business
elsewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister intervened on the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire
to ask about British Energy. Now, as someone whose hands are clean and
who has never voted for the privatisation of anything, I want to
comment not on British Energy, but on the privatisation of energy
companies, because there is an analogy there that may be of interest in
the case of Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
we all know, the previous Government privatised the state-owned energy
companies, and there was to be competition between all those companies.
The number of companies has, however, progressively shrunk to the point
where there are now the big six that basically control all energy
within the United Kingdom. Of the big six, only two are now based in
the United Kingdom—Scottish and Southern Energy and British Gas.

                        <p class="tabbed">Hon.
Members may remember that in hard winters in previous years—I am
sure that if we have a hard winter this year, it will happen
again—concerns have been raised about the way that some of those
companies operate vis-à-vis the energy supplied on the continent
and the energy supplied within the UK and about whether they are, in
fact, giving a better deal to continental
customers.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
particular concern—I remember this from my time on the Business
and Enterprise Committee and Energy and Climate Change
Committee—is the operation of the interconnectors, because the
energy system within the UK and the continent depends on those
interconnectors, through which, in theory, if the market is working
properly, energy flows one way or the other depending on price. The
evidence from previous hard winters in the UK, however, is that that
has not happened, because even though the price is higher in the UK,
the energy is still flowing the other way. That has raised concerns
about whether foreign-owned companies are giving due weight to the
interests of consumers in the UK. I do not want to try your patience,
Mr Hood, and go on too long about energy, but the question is, if a
company is foreign-owned, whether the interests of UK consumers will be
adequately
protected.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
view is that Royal Mail is part of our national infrastructure and
cannot be looked at as just another company to be sold off on the stock
exchange or otherwise. If control is not retained within the UK, the
interests of UK consumers may be diminished. That is important because,
as the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire rightly said, the
universal service obligation, which is a political obligation imposed
by Parliament, is vital to businesses within particular rural areas.
Later, I am sure we will talk a great deal about the universal service
obligation, on which I have comments to make.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The point,
however, is that Government Members talk about choice and competition
when the reality is that in rural Scotland—I am sure it is the
same in rural parts of England and Wales—there is no
competition. Royal Mail has the only people who will deliver. My
concern is not ideological, about who owns Royal Mail, but about what
services will be delivered to rural areas.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000109">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> To elaborate on what I think the hon. Gentleman was
saying, and I think I agree: Royal Mail is currently the only service
deliverer, and there is no likelihood of anyone else coming into the
market to cover parts, or all, of our constituencies, when they can
cherry-pick and take the best parts of the business. That would put his
constituents’ businesses at a significant disadvantage compared
with others throughout the UK.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000110">&#160;</a>

                           <strong> </strong>Although the hon. Gentleman is entirely
correct, it is actually worse than that. To use my constituency as an
analogy, the main road from Dundee to Aberdeen passes through the
centre of it. I guess that what will happen is that communities on that
main road will get the service, because Aberdeen and Dundee are
reasonable markets. A service provider may well decide to 
deliver to Dundee and Aberdeen and stop off in one or 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 244<a class="bkMark" name="Column244">&#160;</a>
                           </div>two places on the way, such as Forfar, Brechin and Stonehaven—who
knows? Or they may go straight past, because they want to; we do not
know that. I can guarantee, however, that villages such as Tarsfide or
Glen Clova will not get a service, because they will have to go an hour
off the main road to get anywhere near such places, and that is just
not going to happen. The reality is that there will not be choice
there—as there is not now, to a great extent.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">An analogy is
perhaps with the parcel service, which has been fully liberalised for
many years. Look at adverts in any magazine for delivery of goods by
post and there is a little bit at the bottom that says, for example,
“This does not apply to the highlands and islands of
Scotland.” Couriers will not deliver there, or will only do so
at a very high price. My fear is not so much about the personal letter
market; it is about the small package market, which is the important
thing for small businesses in my constituency. The universal service is
so important because such businesses need to be able to receive and
send small packages to keep their businesses going, and I worry that
that is not going to happen.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000112">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The point
about the universal service is well made, but there are also serious
concerns about control of the business. I support what the hon.
Gentleman has said, but I do not think his proposal is perfect, because
it needs more thought. The direction of travel, however, is certainly
something I would support.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000113">&#160;</a>

intend to take up too much time, not least because I am well aware that
some members of the Committee are finding it difficult to
concentrate—I hope, however, that hon. Members will indulge me a
little. I understand that one hon. Member on this Committee finds it
very dull and, rather than listening intently to the debate as I am,
they are intent instead on tweeting their thoughts. We all know what
the Prime Minister has said about what too many tweets might make. On a
serious note, I am sure that employees, users and potential investors,
whose long-term futures are very much at the heart of what Opposition
Members are focused on, will share the Prime Ministers sentiments about
tweeting, at least during this Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000115">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I will now
speak to the amendment, if only to help me achieve a better
understanding of it. Paragraph (a) would allow at least one employee in
the privatised Royal Mail or its successors to sit on the board of the
new company. The inclusion of such a representative would allow for a
close working relationship between the board and the employees. It
would allow employees a point of view and provide them with an
opportunity to ensure that any concerns they may have would be heard.
That could only serve to strengthen the company, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Ochil and South Perthshire has suggested. It also fits in
well with the Government’s mantra that we are all in this
together. I am obliged to my hon. Friend for reminding the Committee of
Richard Hooper’s evidence, because it had slipped my mind. Mr
Hooper responded to a question from the hon. Member for Bedford by
suggesting that the situation in Post Danmark, which has a union
representative on its board, works very
well.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000116">&#160;</a>

(b) would require the headquarters of the new business to be located in
the UK. I do not see why any member of the Committee would not want to
ensure that. It would surely be a good thing for all concerned. It is a
real prospect that the potential purchaser will be an overseas company,
so the amendment would protect the integrity of Royal Mail. My hon.
Friend was right to say that the amendment will also help to protect
management jobs. That is an important point. Not agreeing to the
amendment would send a message that the Government do not care whether
Royal Mail resides in the UK and that they are not concerned about its
identity. Indeed, it contradicts the assertion that we are all in this
together.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000117">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Paragraph
(c) provides a safeguard that would require the Secretary of
State’s approval before future owners could relocate the
headquarters outside the UK, once it is up and running. The provision
would give Parliament the opportunity to question the Secretary of
State on any of the company’s relocation plans, and it would
offer proper accountability to the electorate. Again, that certainly
relates to the proposition that we are all in this
together.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000118">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
would be sensible to undertake a consultation exercise, as proposed by
paragraph (d). It would allow for informed comment on the proposals
and, as my hon. Friend rightly says, the Secretary of State would
benefit from the consultation process. It would serve to improve
things.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000119">&#160;</a>

of any agreement reached between them and the Secretary of State. It

he had consulted the work force and secured their approval. That would
allow for further scrutiny by Parliament and, of course, goes much
further than simply requiring the Secretary of State

simply provides for greater inclusion of interested parties and allows
for better accountability. I cannot see any reason why the Minister

short speech. Also, I hope that I have helped to reiterate the concerns

certainly not a new idea; it is not even a revolutionary idea or just

have known for many years about many successful examples of good
collaboration between management and boards. Sometimes people have
patronising ways of speaking about employees on boards, in the same way
that they have patronising views about young people being on governing
bodies or about primary school children taking part in interviews for
members of staff. I assure Committee members that in the work I have
done in schools and with youth clubs, the young people are usually very
perceptive and extremely sophisticated in how they approach the work.
The same is obviously true of employees; they have tremendous
experience and understanding of what makes the company tick, and they
can bring that huge wealth of knowledge and networking to the
board.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000126">&#160;</a>

are already improving. We had glowing reports about how industrial
relations have improved from Donald Brydon, the chairman, union

were drafting the amendment, we bore in mind the fact that work force
and management relations are fundamental going into this uncharted
territory in which the work force may find themselves. Paragraph (a)
strengthens the Bill; it is lacking now, and to preserve the good work
force and management relationship there is no alternative other than to
approve paragraph (a).<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000128">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I agree. My hon. Friend has taken the words out
of my mouth. Having the full confidence of the work force and the work
force’s involvement in every possible way are obviously
important at this time of change, because—let us be
honest—if we want a successful Royal Mail, the work force have
to be fully engaged. They are the ones who will make it successful and
who have a vested interest in it being
successful.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000129">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What
are the advantages of having the work force on the board? The first
advantage is transparency. For far too long, people have had the idea
that there is a terrible secret plot against them, that there is
determination on the part of management to make everything as difficult
as possible for employees, and that the board in particular has a
number of secrets it does not wish to divulge. We talk a lot nowadays
about the need for transparency, and having employee representation on
the board gives that
transparency.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Having
the work force on the board is also important for communication. If
there are messages to come down through the company, communication is
vital. We know there are often difficult decisions to be taken, and it
useful to share those discussions with employee representatives, so
that they can see what the challenges are. They can see why difficult
decisions have to be made and why the choices are not very
nice.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000131">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It would be ironic if it did not have that, as
it is crucial. However, communication in the work force is never easy.
Trust, communication and transparency are difficult to give tick-box
answers to on a performance management sheet, but they are vital
qualities. If one evaluates what is going on in any company, poor
communication nearly always leads to poor performance and results.
Whereas, good communication can build up those vital industrial
relations that make a successful company. Those qualities are almost
impossible to quantify, but they are crucial in the running of any
successful modern business.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000133">&#160;</a>

on to the topic in paragraph (b) of headquarters in the UK. The
National Federation of SubPostmasters is adamant about that. Woe
betide  any politician who ignores the National
Federation  of SubPostmasters. It gets its feedback from a
wonderful network of sub-postmasters across the country, because the
post office is the hub of gossip and the place where everything that
happens in the local community is known. If the Government are
interested in putting more business into the post offices, instead of
employing expensive consultants, they could use the vast network of
sub-postmasters, which would provide a clear picture of what is
happening on the street. They will put the politician back in touch
with what is happening out
there.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000134">&#160;</a>

I have been on the doorstep or in my local post office, what is the
talk? We all know the usual political issues, but how many times have
we heard, “This country is being sold to foreigners all the

and everywhere. It is bad enough with private companies, when we see
British Steel become Corus and then Tata. We see familiar names such as
Morris Motors metamorphose into such things as ThyssenKruppTallent and
Calsonic Kansei, to give just a couple of examples. People feel aghast,
but that is nothing compared to how they feel about the energy
companies. The fact that E.ON and EDF are taking over energy companies
is brought up time and again in that local post office and on the
doorstep. In Wales, the fact that a French company is now running the
tolls on the Severn road bridge, between England and Wales, is brought
up again and again. How is it that a French company is benefiting from
that?<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000135">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Returning to Royal Mail, it is one step too far.
Most people do not want to see Royal Mail in foreign hands. Some good
arguments have been made today to that effect, and I will make a couple
more. People always have a tremendous trust in the security and the
integrity of the post. They know that their postman or postwoman will
not indulge in identity fraud, and they know that their details will
not be sold to anybody. They are worried that if a company is not based
in the UK, there may be ulterior motives, which is a particular concern
with Royal Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000139">&#160;</a>

Is it possible that a foreign company that purchased Royal Mail might
liquidate assets from Royal Mail in order to keep prices cheaper in
another country where it also provides a
service?<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000140">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes a good point, and that is a
considerable worry. People feel that it is the British who are giving
and others around the world who are gaining. They are worried about a
precious national asset being used to prop up businesses elsewhere.
Having spoken about paragraph (b), paragraph (c) follows logically; if
Royal Mail is to have a headquarters in this country, people would like
it to remain here. They do not want to see it whisked abroad five
minutes after the Secretary of State has relinquished
control.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those points
are important for confidence, which is vital to future success. People
feel strongly that Royal Mail should remain in the UK. It would be
ironic if we were to have a royal wedding with a Royal Mail that had
been privatised and was being run from a foreign part. That would be
the ultimate irony.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000142">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Paragraph (d)
is about consultation with employees, which is important. As the hon.
Member for Angus has pointed out, it is about ensuring that the
employees not only of Royal Mail, which will be privatised if the Bill
becomes law, but of the whole Royal Mail group have their say. It is
all very well to say that they had their say in Hooper, but this is a
Bill. Circumstances are different, and a little more detail has been
provided—nothing like enough detail for many of us, because many
questions remain unanswered—but it is nevertheless a significant
step forward from Hooper. A case can be made for further consultation,
and such a major step as separating Post Office Ltd and Royal Mail
deserves full and thorough
consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000143">&#160;</a>

will now discuss paragraph (e), which is all about the importance of
democracy. Nobody in the room could possibly deny that a 51% majority
is vital to show what the work force want in a yes-no situation. The
Minister may remember that the AV vote is all about showing that an MP
has the confidence of their constituents,

other candidates. It will be interesting to see how the AV vote goes
next year. In my constituency, we shall—as people in Scotland
will —be knocking on doors and saying, “First off, I
would like to introduce you to our candidate in this election and tell
you a little about him. Then, I would like to tell you about the list
system. Yes, that’s the one where there are four of them
standing, but only one cross on the paper.” They might respond,
“That’s the one where the losers get the prize,
isn’t it?” I would reply, “Well, yes, actually, it
is the one where the losers get the prize. You’ve got the
system.”<a class="bkMark" name="10111860000144">&#160;</a>

(f) addresses why we want to have detail about the universal service
provision. Many hon. Members have spoken about this already, and they
will return to it later. One of the difficulties of rural communities
is that not only are they a long way away—if they did not have
the universal service provision, or if the costs were higher, it would
be difficult for them to function—but it is difficult for them
to attract the inward investment of large companies that need to
transport goods a long way. The argument is that the companies always
want to be nearer to their markets. The advent of the internet has been
a tremendous boost to those of us in the more far flung corners of the

therefore not be able to access funds for developing their business,
