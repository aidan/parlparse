			Column number: 26<a class="bkMark" name="Column26">&#160;</a>
                  </div>I am simply going to explain amendment 35. I hasten
to add that it is strictly a probing amendment. It would simply ensure

               </p>
               <p>was
included in the list. As the hon. Member for Hemsworth described, the
intention was to draw attention to the possibility of co-operatives and
mutual societies taking over particular matters referred to in the
schedules to the Bill. It is only a probing amendment because it is
very easy to structure these things as having a subsidiary that is a
company limited by guarantee, which then takes on the transfer in
question. We simply wanted to make this point: do not forget about
co-ops and mutuals. They were incorporated in the Localism Bill as
bodies that might take over services from local councils. I will be
interested to hear my hon. Friend the Minister’s comments as to
why that should not be the case
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
has been said previously that one cannot necessarily quite trust
co-operatives and mutuals. Who knows what their members might be up to
and what interests their members might represent? That was the thrust
of the argument. I take issue with that and remind the Committee that
housing associations are organised as mutual and provident societies in
many cases. Trade unions are organised on such a basis. Many Members of
Parliament are representatives of the Labour and Co-operative party,
and I would not question its members’ belief that they serve the
community. As is well known, the previous Government established
foundation hospital trusts, which also organise in effect as mutuals,
albeit heavily regulated ones. The idea is to have a membership base
that fosters
engagement.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000028">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Why
do we like co-ops? Why have the House of Commons and Parliament
previously supported co-ops and mutuals and had a place for them? This
is an issue of engagement and accountability that goes to the heart of
all the issues in the Bill. Much of it is about restoring
accountability, be that back to central Government or to another body
to carry on the functions. Accountability lies at the heart of the
Bill, which is why I, for one, so strongly support much of the thrust
of what it seeks to achieve. I believe that co-ops and mutual societies
should be seen as part of the toolkit to establish the
Government’s purpose in restoring accountability, which I think
hon. Members on both sides of the House agree has been weaker in recent
years than it might be. I will be interested to hear the
Minister’s comments in due
course.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">

                     <strong>Hywel
Williams</strong> (Arfon) (PC):<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000411">&#160;</a>
                  </span> I want to speak briefly in support
of the hon. Member for Dover. As we saw this morning, one of the
fundamental questions about mutuals and co-ops might be, who benefits?
To put it rather more coarsely: follow the money. I can see that on a
very large scale that might be
problematic.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000030">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will draw the Committee’s attention to a few Welsh examples on a
much smaller scale. I am not offering this as a way forward, but in the
village that my family come from, Llithfaen, the community own the pub.
They used to own the shop as well, but they had to sell that off when
it no longer remained viable. There is a shared community of interest
there, which it is possible to manage in a small community of 400 or
500
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000031">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Equally,
in the nearby village of Llanfrothen, the community have bought the
shop, rebuilt it and reopened it not only as a shop but as a post
office. They have also 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 27<a class="bkMark" name="Column27">&#160;</a>
                  </div>introduced some community facilities there. There are those two small
examples, but there is the much larger one of Glas Cymru and Dwr Cymru,
which is the water provider in Wales and the undertaker for sewerage
and all that sort of work. Let me entertain the Committee with a story
that occurred to me when the hon. Member for Hemsworth was talking
about the Brown Cow and the possibility of its taking something over.
An association with which I am familiar is the Henvic Society for the
Promotion of the Importation of Scottish Non Dairy Products. The
problem with having it taking over food from Britain is that it is a

</em>I thought that hon. Members might like that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000032">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let me return
to the serious points about Glas Cymru and Dwr Cymru. The previous
provider, Hyder, was widely criticised by many commentators for
investing in everything but water. It diversified in every direction,
and it came to grief in the end and had to fold. Its undertaking was
taken over by Glas Cymru, which is a group of publicly spirited people
who have set up first-issue bonds. It has given the business to Dwr
Cymru, which now runs it as a separate company. As for what the hon.
Member for Dover said, one of the virtues of the water market is that
it is stable. It is a bit like undertaking—people will always
die, drink water and pipe water away. Dover has a stable market as
well. It is the leading port for import/export. I think that some
£80 billion goes through Dover.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The other
point about Glas Cymru is its ability to reinvest any surplus. The
water market in Wales has quietened down tremendously since Glas Cymru
and Dwr Cymru have taken over. All they do is work in the water
business. Unlike the previous undertaker, they do not buy hotels,
public relations companies or anything else. They have a defined
provision which they manage well, and when any surplus comes along they
reinvest it. As a result, the water business in Wales has prospered
tremendously.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000034">&#160;</a>

                  </span> The hon. Gentleman is making a
powerful case, as did the hon. Member for Dover. He is describing an
organisation that is providing the community with a benefit. It is not
disposing of its assets or using its pockets for anything other that
further to develop the service it is there to provide. Is that
guaranteed in statute or is it a choice the board has made? How is that
being secured so that the concerns I was expressing earlier are
avoided?<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000035">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The question
really is one of accountability. If the people of Dover collectively
feel that such an organisation would be accountable, then that would be
the ideal. As far as Glas Cymru is concerned, it consults and reports
to the people of Wales. Most people, however, do not even know that it
exists because it just gets on with it. That might be the case in
respect of Dover as well. It is a way of cracking this particular nut
that has much to commend it. I will be interested to hear the

share a reputation for firmness and fairness with your co-Chairman.
Time will tell whether you share his confessed susceptibility to
flattery. I am sure that that will be tested by the Committee over the
days to come. We have had a good debate around these amendments. The
hon. Member for Hemsworth described me as reasonable. That was bad
enough but when he then described his amendment as “designed to
be helpful” the alarm bells really began to ring. In truth
though, having listened to him carefully, his amendments are helpful,
both in the general and in the specific. His speech was helpful in
clarifying that the Opposition agree with the general principle of the
Bill and with the need to reform and reduce the size of what he
described as the overly bureaucratic state. He talked about a
democratic deficit, which we all know is real. It was therefore useful
to have on the record the cross-party support for the principle
underlying the Bill. I say that because, frankly, the Labour
party’s walk was less impressive than its talk when in power,
and in opposition the messages have been foggy. It was good to have
that placed on the
record.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000038">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
group of amendments concerns the definition of an “eligible
person” to whom the functions of a body or office can be
transferred via an order made under clauses 1, 2 or 5. Amendments 30
and 31 would require that regulations set up the names of those persons
exercising public functions, and bodies of trustees, to whom functions
can be transferred. Amendments 32, 34, 35 and 39 would amend the
definition, removing the reference
to<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000039">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“other

               <p>or
adding specific reference to community benefit societies and registered
charities. I understand, and it was clear from the debate, that the
spirit of the amendments is to query the reasoning behind the
Government’s definition of “eligible person” for
the purposes of such
transfers.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000040">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Before
responding specifically to the amendments, I will briefly set out the
process leading to the Bill because, during the course of the hon.
Gentleman’s remarks, I felt that he either had missed or was
deliberately missing a central point of the legislation. It might be
helpful to the Committee if I set out how we got to this place and how
we see the process for making what are generally recognised to be the
overdue changes to public bodies that will follow Royal
Assent.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000041">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
proposals that the Bill will enable through clauses 1 to 5
and the corresponding schedules, which we will debate, are the result
of a cross-Government review of public bodies, which took place last
year and was reported to the House by the Minister for the Cabinet
Office and Paymaster General, my right hon. Friend the Member for
Horsham (Mr Maude) on 14 October 2010. The proposed changes to
individual bodies and offices, and to which person functions may
transfer in the case of bodies listed in schedules 1, 2 and 5,
are—as I stressed in my intervention—the responsibility
of individual Departments and their Ministers. That is entirely in line
with the Government’s approach, which is clear that Ministers
should be ultimately accountable for the delivery of public
functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000042">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Given
remarks made by a number of hon. Members, I would like to emphasise to
the Committee that the Bill as drafted would not create a power to
transfer any of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 29<a class="bkMark" name="Column29">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the functions of S4C, which is listed in schedule 3 only, to another
person or body. As the hon. Gentleman said, the
Bill does not set out explicitly what will happen to each body listed
in the schedules, but that does not mean that the Government have not
been clear about their proposals. Ministerial statements, information
provided by the Cabinet Office to the House and debates in both Houses
and elsewhere on the Bill have seen significant transparency and
scrutiny of many of the proposals for individual bodies in the Bill.
Such debate will continue in
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000043">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
I have made clear, the Bill is enabling, and the proposals we discuss
will be the subject of a secondary legislative process, which will
require draft orders to be scrutinised and approved by both Houses of
Parliament, through an enhanced procedure if either House decides that
that is appropriate. Such a draft order can only be laid following
consultation on the proposal, as described in clause 10. Both
procedures will require Ministers to make available detailed proposals
about the future of the bodies, including, in cases in which functions
will be transferred, precisely who the proposed transferee will be,
what functions they will inherit and on what basis. For that reason,
returning to amendments 30 and 31, it is not necessary to include in
the Bill such a requirement for regulations. The accompanying
explanatory material would clearly state to whom a specific function
would be transferred.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000044">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Parliament
will therefore have the opportunity to debate each proposed transfer of
functions and the suitability of each proposed transferee; crucially,
it will retain the capacity to reject an order that is deemed
inappropriate. To require separate regulations would result in an
additional layer of procedure; it would also prevent Ministers from
taking a flexible approach to their proposed reforms in the event that
a potentially valuable and sensible option for transfer of functions
was not set out in the regulations proposed by the Opposition. That is
particularly pertinent, given that new innovative approaches to
delivery, perhaps not anticipated by the Government—we cannot
anticipate everything—may emerge as a result of the consultation
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000045">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
turn now to the amendments that deal with the definition of
“eligible person”. The thinking behind this provision is
simple. The Government envisage that effective public body reform in
the short and long terms will best be delivered by transferring
functions to a range of persons. For example, the Government are
working to establish local enterprise partnerships across
England—something that we shall debate later—to provide
targeted support for regional growth. However, the Government do not
seek to prescribe the form that LEPs should take, and they could
include unincorporated bodies. We believe that such decisions should be
taken by the partners
themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000046">&#160;</a>

                  </div>of Parliament only recently and was in various businesses and charitable
organisations for the 30 years prior to that. When I see an
unincorporated body of persons, I see people who are prepared to take
full legal responsibility for what they do; they do not hide behind
trusts, companies or guarantees that limit their liability. The hon.
Member for Hemsworth gave the example of groups of people getting
together in pubs, but I think that people are prepared to work for
organisations where they can be held responsible. That is an excellent
thing for accountability, and I welcome that
definition.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000048">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful

is broad and covers a wide range of organisations. We welcome that. We
need to retain flexibility to create the space for exactly the sort of
innovation that I mentioned earlier.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000049">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I return to
the example of local enterprise partnerships. They could include
unincorporated bodies. The Committee will be aware that Government
amendments have been tabled that will take forward the abolition of
RDAs; the transition to LEPs will be by a different route. However, it
remains the case that to restrict the Bill in the manner proposed by
amendment 34 could prevent innovative approaches to the delivery of
public functions. As I said, the Government view the scope to open
opportunities to a diversity of organisations as being crucial to the
success of public body reform.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000050">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The category
of “unincorporated body of persons” to which the hon.
Member for Hemsworth takes exception is broad. It could include
charities not registered with the Charity Commission and, as he
suggested, it could also include a variety of community associations. I
appreciate the hon. Gentleman’s interest in seeking clarity on
the processes and safeguards that might needed to apply to such
categories—indeed, to all reforms that can be made under the
Bill—and I hope to provide some reassurance on that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000051">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have
already discussed the important safeguards provided by the consultation
and parliamentary procedures that apply to this enabling Bill. In
addition, there are two other crucial safeguards that I draw to the
Committee’s attention.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000052">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some hon.
Members, including the hon. Member for Wigan, have expressed concern
about the independent operation of public functions. That is an
extremely important point. I assure them that clause 7 prevents
Ministers from making orders that would prevent some important public
functions from being exercised independently, including those important
scrutiny functions that we would associate with bodies such as the
office  of the Children’s Commissioner. In addition,
clauses 20 to 22 create a set of restrictions that prevent certain
functions from being transferred to persons not already exercising
public functions, such as companies limited by guarantee. That would,
for example, prevent functions, including a power to search, to seize
property or to compel evidence, from being transferred in an
inappropriate manner.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000053">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Hemsworth is right to point out that this is not the whole
story. To ensure that public functions are delivered effectively,
efficiently and with due accountability, the Government need to be sure
that the appropriate mechanisms are in place. As I 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 31<a class="bkMark" name="Column31">&#160;</a>
                  </div>said—this is the key point—the Government’s public
bodies programme is underpinned by the notion that Ministers should be
accountable for public functions. Where the hon. Gentleman saw evidence
of the Executive seeking to accumulate power—he used the
expression “nationalisation”, which was emotive—I
see an opportunity to reassert and increase ministerial
accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000054">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Like many
members of the Committee, I see this through the prism of my
constituency and the views expressed to me by a number of constituents
who are frustrated by the size, complexity and cost of government and
the public sector and would like to see it simplified and made more
efficient and effective and cheaper. They would also like to be clear
about who is in charge. What I often hear is: “Who is
accountable? Who is in
charge?”<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000055">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> As I said earlier about who these unincorporated
bodies might be in the event that that was the appropriate solution for
any proposed reform, the clarity and definition would come through the
secondary legislative process. In terms of accountability, at the end
of the day accountability for the delivery of a public function lies
with Ministers. It is a requirement on them and that is set out clearly
in clause 8. There is a requirement on them to ensure that, in
proposing and implementing any transfer, there is adequate
accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000057">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Moving
on from the central point about the motivation to increase ministerial
accountability and make it clearer who is accountable and in charge,
the Government intend to abolish 200 public bodies, in many cases
transferring their functions back to the sponsor Department. The hon.
Member for Hemsworth characterises such changes as renationalisation.
As I said, I prefer to think of it as making Ministers, not unelected
chairs and boards, directly accountable for public functions and for
the use of public
money.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000058">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
the Committee will be aware, Government Departments and agencies are
subject to rigorous audit through the National Audit Office. The
Government are also committed to increase transparency in their
actions, as evidenced by the publication of detailed Treasury data on
public expenditure and by the new departmental structural reform plans.
Where public bodies have been retained and where functions have been
transferred to them from other bodies, I can assure the Committee that
they will continue to be subject to existing requirements on
accounting, reporting as well as data protection and freedom of
information
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000059">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Non-departmental
public bodies are required to have in place robust governance and
accountability arrangements and both the Cabinet Office and the
Treasury provide detailed guidance on that. The Government are further
committed to extending the scope of the Freedom of Information Act 2000
to provide greater transparency and they have announced their intention
to extend it to a range of bodies carrying out functions of a public
nature.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000060">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">There may be
instances where public functions are transferred to an eligible person
outside the scope of some of these protections, such as a company
limited by guarantee or a community interest company. In such cases, it
would be the responsibility of Ministers to make sure that appropriate
safeguards are in place to ensure that the body is properly accountable
for its delivery of public functions. Such information will perform
part of the proposals for consultation and orders laid before
Parliament. As I have emphasised, the Government’s clear
position is that the ultimate accountability lies with Ministers. I
have no doubt that Parliament will wish properly to scrutinise any
order made under the powers of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Hemsworth also emphasised the value he attaches to
asset locks as a means of securing for the community any proceeds
stemming from the delivery of public functions. The list of eligible
persons in clause 1 already provides for one type of legal form which
must, by law, include an asset lock, which is the community interest
company. The list also provides for other legal forms which can, but
are not necessarily required to include asset locks—namely,
companies limited by guarantee and bodies of trustees or other
unincorporated bodies or
persons.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000062">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
be a charity, an organisation must be established for wholly charitable
purposes and for public benefit. The hon. Member for Hemsworth knows
that. In practice, that means that whatever its legal form, the
organisation must have an asset lock and a non-profit distribution
clause. Otherwise, it would be considered to exist for private benefit
and would not qualify for charitable
status.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000063">&#160;</a>

approaching the discussion, which is enormously helpful. He has just
moved on to charities and asset locks. The truth is that the eligible
persons do not include charities; that is the reason for our amendment.
Why did the Government not include charities as eligible persons? Is

relation to amendment 32, and speaking to the hon. Gentleman’s
point, I assure the Committee that we believe existing charities are
already within the scope of the Bill. Charities can take a number of
legal forms, including charitable trusts, companies limited by
guarantee and unincorporated associations. We believe that each of
those forms is covered by clause 1(3) as drafted.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000065">&#160;</a>

Government propose to use the powers in the Bill to transfer a number
of functions, including the specific example of those of British
Waterways, to charitable bodies. We believe that amendments 32 and 34,
taken together, would have the effect of excluding some small charities
which, while subject to charity law, are not required to register with
the Charity Commission, and exist as unincorporated
associations.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000066">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
35, in the names of my hon. Friends the Members for Dover and for Esher
and Walton, and amendment 39 seek to add community benefit societies
and co-operatives to the list of types of organisation defined as an
eligible person. As has been noted, the Government are, as part of our
commitment to the big society, keen to explore how alternative models
such as 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 33<a class="bkMark" name="Column33">&#160;</a>
                  </div>mutuals, co-operatives and social enterprises can be supported to
deliver public services where appropriate. The Committee will note
that, for example, the Bill already makes provision
for public functions to be transferred to community interest
companies.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000067">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have a lot
of sympathy with the spirit of the amendments, which have been
particularly helpful in the specific. There may indeed be circumstances
where public functions could be effectively carried out by community
benefit societies, and potentially by other forms of co-operative. I
will bear in mind the points about the use of assets made by the hon.
Member for Hemsworth. I commit to consider the matter further before
Report. I hope that provides some assurance that the Government are
committed to exploring a range of options to support community-focused
provision of services and
functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000068">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
the hon. Member for Hemsworth raised the question of salary control, an
extremely emotive issue about which we have read in the press. We know
that is an extremely important matter, not least for our constituents.
I assure him that the Government have taken steps to ensure that
appropriate controls are in place. I think the hon. Gentleman knows,
because we have debated the matter in a Standing Order, that the Chief
Secretary to the Treasury signs off all civil service and NDPB
appointments that pay salaries that exceed £142,500—which
is the extraordinarily good-value salary paid to the Prime Minister, I
would like to place on the record.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000069">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government publish annually the salary details of all staff earning
£150,000 and above. The Committee should know that there are 291
individuals on the recently published 2011 list, compared with 345 in
the equivalent disclosure for 2010. That represents a salary bill
saving for the highest earners of approximately 16%, or a cash saving
of around £10 million. I hope I have assured the hon. Gentleman
and the Committee that, in relation to controls on salary, we are
moving in a better direction.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000070">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This has been
a substantial debate—with good reason, as it speaks to the
importance of the functions carried out by many of the bodies the Bill
proposes to reform, and to the responsibility of Government to ensure
that appropriate levels of transparency and accountability apply to
their actions and proposals. As I have stressed, and perhaps laboured,
the Government’s position on that is clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000071">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Ministers are
ultimately responsible for the effective delivery of public functions,
many of which require a degree of independence from Government, and
they are accountable to Parliament in that regard. The mechanisms of
the Bill and the safeguards that it includes reiterate that position.
Clause 1 is a valuable and important contribution to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000072">&#160;</a>

afternoon. We look forward to working under a benevolent, but probably
fairly tough, chairmanship. I certainly suffered from that this

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 34<a class="bkMark" name="Column34">&#160;</a>
                  </div>feel humbled by Mr Amess’s exercise of power. What hon. Members
do not know is that I lost my speech on the way across here. It was a
two-hour speech. Being chastised by the Chair was a salutary lesson not
to forget speeches, but the Committee may not like it if I end up with
two-hour speeches rather than 55-minute ones. However, having said all
that, it is a pleasure to serve under you, Mr
Robertson.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
are anxious to get on to the bones of the Bill, which are in the
schedules, but I want to make a couple of points. We agree across the
Committee that there is a wide perception in the country of a gap
between the governed and those who govern and that we ought to narrow
down what we have come to describe as a democratic deficit wherever we
can. The previous Government had, therefore, begun the process of
reviewing quangos. We probably did not work fast enough or go far
enough, and I accept that. We support the principles of the Bill, as
the Minister was generous enough to indicate, and on that there is no
disagreement whatever. It is the detail of the amendments that I want
to turn to for a
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000075">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Overcoming
the clear democratic deficit of the quango state in general is not
necessarily best achieved by increasing the power, functions and size
of the centralised state or by giving extremely strong powers to
Ministers. Although the other place introduced—the Government
accepted this—a number of checks and balances on the power that
Ministers can exercise relating to quangos, the Opposition are somewhat
troubled by it. That is why I wanted to open up clause 1 to a
significant debate before we get on to the schedules. It would still be
better were the Minister prepared to publish regulations on how he
intends to proceed with “eligible persons”, but we would
not want to vote against clause 1 as a whole, because it gives
Ministers the power to
abolish.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000076">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister was good enough to say that he would look again at the
amendments that have been submitted by both sides of the Committee
relating to co-ops or community benefit societies, which are a narrower
form of co-op that gives an asset lock and guarantees community
benefit. Given the Minister’s generosity on that, it would be
bad of us not to reciprocate and say that we are happy with that
assurance, and we await his further comments as the Committee
proceeds.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000077">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
amendment 32, which relates to charities, it would have been better to
have had charities as a separate “eligible person.”
Listening carefully to what the Minister has just said, it is possible
for vehicles (c), (d) and (e) to be charities, and it is clear that a
trust can be a charity. It is also possible for a company limited by
guarantee to have charitable status and, therefore, to be registered by
the Charity Commission.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000078">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There might
be charities that do not take the form of a trust, community interest
company or company limited by guarantees. I want a generic commitment
to the charitable sector, which the Government have made a lot of in
their talk of the big society. Having said that, we will not press the
amendment because the Minister has again indicated that he sees a role
for the charitable sector in the provision of services. We now have a
better understanding of his
intentions.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000079">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
other amendments, apart from amendment 34, which I will press to a
vote, address the possibility that orders explaining the
Minister’s intentions are not followed. I do not accept that it
will be best to deal with them case 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 35<a class="bkMark" name="Column35">&#160;</a>
                  </div>by case. The Minister’s argument is,
“Look, we are obliged to consult on each case, and we are
obliged to go to both Houses. There will be an enhanced procedure
should either House not agree.” That is all very good, but it
addresses individual decisions being taken one at a time; I want a
generic debate on how the regulations will operate across the board,
because there are issues that ought to be addressed by the House. In
the spirit of trying to make some progress, for the moment at least, we
will allow our amendments to rest with what I have said, the
Minister’s response and the comments of other
Members.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000080">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have spoken already about the co-op, and there was no
disagreement on that, which leaves us with unincorporated bodies of
persons, about which I am genuinely troubled. An unincorporated body,
as I said earlier, is a legal non-entity; it is not a legal person in
its own right. The Minister wants public functions guaranteeing the
common good in particular areas of activity to be regulated by bodies
independent of the Government. That is fine, and we agree with it, but
he wants to include unincorporated bodies of persons, about which I am
genuinely troubled.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000081">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let me read
out a brief note—I will not detain the Committee
long—that defines an unincorporated
body:<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000082">&#160;</a>

Watford:<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000083">&#160;</a>

               <p>That
is important, because an unincorporated body cannot exercise functions,
could not be sued if it were to be neglectful in some way and cannot
hold property. Each individual member of the unincorporated body, which
could change over time as individuals come and go, would individually
be liable for the decisions taken by that unincorporated body. That is
a serious problem and it troubles
me.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000085">&#160;</a>

that my hon. Friend makes is correct. If a body of people who are
unincorporated come together to make a decision about the common good,
exercising a function currently performed by a quango or NDPB, that
group has no legal existence at all. It cannot hold property and it

used to be a lawyer, and it is not right to say that because
unincorporated bodies of persons and unincorporated associations or,
typically, partnerships, do not have legal personality as companies
they do not have legal identity. They have legal identity through the
individuals. The key difference is that we can burn a company, put it
into bankruptcy, wind it up and stuff the creditors, but we cannot do
that individually because our house, property and personal assets are
on the line. As such, and ironically, we will have to take greater
responsibility than a company.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000095">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Is that really how we want to run our society?
Public functions created by Parliament are handed over to individuals
who are left to be sued and left homeless if a mistake has been made,
perhaps through poor advice. I do not think so. It would be better if
we were to enrich our society by using co-operatives, charities or
other bodies to deliver services, not by using individuals who from the
goodness of their hearts volunteer to undertake activities on behalf of
the wider community, thereby leaving themselves exposed, as the hon.
Gentleman said, to legal action. The unincorporated association has no
existence, as he confirmed, other than the existence of the individuals

association.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000096">&#160;</a>

the Minister had been able to help us by printing regulations that made

that was one of the possibilities in his argument, not the thrust. On
that basis, it is difficult for us to say that such 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </strong> It is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr Robertson. I have some general points to raise about
schedule 1, but I will leave those until the clause stand part debate.
The fact that amendments 26 and 27 have been tabled at all partly
relates to the conversations that we had in this morning’s
Committee. I will be asking the Minister a number of questions and
seeking some reassurance, partly because it has not been possible to
quiz the bodies directly and also because of the lack of available
information about the Government’s deliberations so far
regarding successor arrangements. I hope that the Committee will bear
with me as I go through a number of issues that we need to consider as
part of the scrutiny process.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000130">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is easy to
overlook the work of advisory bodies. The Advisory Committee on
Hazardous Substances provides expert advice to Government on the
science behind hazardous chemicals. At present, it is made  up
of 11 scientists, who are drawn from private  sector industries
and public sector non-governmental organisations, and a lay member. The
Advisory Committee on Pesticides is a statutory body that was set
up  by Ministers under section 16(7) of the Food and
Environmental Protection Act 1985 to advise on all matters relating to
the control of pesticides.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000131">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Those are
very important committees that have as a key aspect of their work the
protection of public safety. They cover issues such as the effects of
pesticides on human health—for example, the effects of garden
pesticides on children. Each year, they look at the national poison
survey and at reports about incidents relating to hazardous substances
and pesticides, so they are very important bodies. If the Government
are to change arrangements that appear to have worked reasonably well
to date, it is incumbent on them to tell us why.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000132">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">These
amendments are largely probing ones. It is important that the Committee
gets reassurances so that members of the public and those working in
related industries and occupations dealing with hazardous substances
and pesticides are not put at greater risk by the abolition of those
two
bodies.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000133">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>We
thought that we already had expert scientific committees. However, that
is the point that he made. He goes on to say that it reflects the work
that the Department is undertaking with the Government chief scientific
adviser and the head of the Government Office for
Science<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000136">&#160;</a>

               <p>The problem with that is
that there is no mention of how and in what ways the new arrangements
of the committees of experts will do a better job than the current
advisory committees. Indeed, no evidence has been presented that
suggests that the committees to date have done something wrong or given
information that is inaccurate or ineffective. Perhaps when we hear
from the Minister later, he will explain to us why that point was made
and whether it is it one that is shared by other Ministers. Indeed,
quite the reverse could be the case. It is possible to argue that the
current arrangements have really stood the test of time.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000137">&#160;</a>

give the ministerial team the opportunity to correct the really
significant omission that occurred in the other place and to give us a
reasoning and rationale as to why these committees are to be abolished.
Will it tell us exactly what is to be gained by setting up two new
committees within the Department?<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000138">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister explain why one of the reasons that was given by the
Government for abolishing the committees on pesticides and hazardous
substances is that statutory regimes for hazardous chemicals and
pesticides are increasingly driven by EU legislation? That suggests two
things: first, that the current committees do not deal with EU issues
so they are increasingly irrelevant; and secondly, that there is no
need for the committees as the Government must do what they are told by
Europe without further scrutiny. However, neither of those two things
is correct.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000139">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The current
committees give valuable advice on EU legislation. I quote an example
from a 2009 report by the Advisory Committee on Hazardous Substances,
in which the Chair
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000140">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“We
also had the privilege of hearing a number of high quality
presentations to inform our work especially on the EU Water Framework
Directive”.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000349">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>There is, therefore,
clear evidence that the existing committees deal with EU directives and
appear to have been capable of giving the Government advice on such
matters. Will we be assured this afternoon that the successor
committees will also give advice on EU
directives?<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000141">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the current committees value the independence that enables them to put
public safety right at the top of their agendas. In doing so, they have
been able, because of their independent status, to draw on a range of
outside experts. I again ask that we be given some assurance that that
will continue, once the committees are moved within a departmental
structure, which is what we think will happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000142">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Independence
is especially important when one considers that the Government have
recently abolished the Sustainable Development Commission and scrapped
the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. Those were well
respected, independent bodies, which worked in a related area to the
two advisory committees that are the subject of the amendments. That
raises concerns among the public and those working in related sectors
that the Government, in this area of possible environmental pollution,
do not want proper, independent, external scrutiny. I am sure that we
will get more information this afternoon about whether that is the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000143">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Will we be
told how the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
proposes to access expert opinion more widely than what is immediately
available from committee members themselves? We have seen that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 40<a class="bkMark" name="Column40">&#160;</a>
                  </div>accessing that is a valuable trait of the independent bodies, as
currently constituted, but what will happen under
the new arrangements?<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000144">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Thirdly,
because of their independent status, the committees have been able to
provide a co-ordinating role, so that evidence could be taken across a
range of Government Departments, either on specific issues, or perhaps
more importantly, to help develop a strategic view of how best to
protect the public and the environment from hazardous substances and
pesticides. Will the Minister confirm that the new arrangements will
enable this co-ordinating and strategic role to be carried out? It
would be quite unusual if that were not the case, because bodies in one
particular Department generally find it quite difficult to work in a
cross-departmental way. We want some assurances that the ability to
work across Departments will not be lost under the new
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000145">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Fourthly, we
have it on the record that the committees operate in an open and
inclusive manner. Will the Minister guarantee that the new committees
will operate with same spirit of openness and
transparency?<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000146">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point.
She is absolutely right to say that we need strong reassurances on this
matter, given the sensitive issues that the two committees deal with.
Once they are moved into a departmental structure, they might be
subject to a wider range of objectives and they might  be
tempted on occasion to listen to other voices rather than do what is
immediately in the public interest. For example, will we get the same
openness, transparency and wide range of views taken when a committee
is dealing with such difficult questions as the use of animals in
chemical testing? There are many other sensitive issues as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000148">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Given the
importance of well rounded, independent scientific advice to
Government, can the Minister explain why he has decided to take such
committees in-house when that will lead, by the Government’s own
admission, to negligible savings? The Government are not disputing that
the committees are needed, so why are they making the changes? How does
the Department propose to reassure stakeholders that those important
areas of work will continue to be resourced adequately by DEFRA and
that, once those committees are taken inside, they will not simply
disappear or merge into other committees? That is a really important
point. There is a lot of anxiety out there that when finances are under
pressure in future, those committees might simply disappear. They also
have an important regulatory function, and we need to hear from the
Minister that that function will be addressed and managed by the new
structure.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000149">&#160;</a>

                  </div>committees to look at a wide range of issues, and it might help the
Committee in its deliberations if I go through a few of these. The
committees advise the UK Chemicals Stakeholder Forum on appropriate
research needs and the development of relevant indicators, so they have
an important advisory role for a whole range of bodies beyond
Government.

the point that the committees in question have a wide range of

Importantly, they are doing so without direct interference from
Government. There is a huge risk that that might not happen in future.
I would be grateful to hear from the Minister what will happen to that

It was a good debate, and some important points were raised, many of
which were carefully considered by Ministers, which is shown in the way
the changes have been taken forward. I think I can provide the sort of
reassurance that she sought on the other matters. Let us make one thing
absolutely clear, because it is important: there is no intention to
turn off the flow of independent and impartial scientific advice to
Ministers or others on hazardous substances or pesticides. We fully
intend and expect the proposed successor bodies to operate
independently. They will be able to put advice directly to Ministers,

have a responsibility to deliver more effective ways of working and
making policy. The proposals in the Bill are part of a much wider,
consistent approach across all 18 scientific and technical advisory
bodies of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The
hon. Lady will have seen the statement made by the Secretary of State
about that approach on 26 January, when she announced the new
arrangements for the Science Advisory Council to DEFRA. It will
preserve the independence, and provide greater scrutiny and

first degree was in a scientific subject—peer review seems to me
to be a crucial element in providing competent, evidence-based advice.
The Department, and the new expert committees with which we intend to
replace the ACHS and the ACPs, will benefit greatly from that
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000171">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The new
bodies will bring together independent people with a range of
specialist scientific expertise, and will work independently of
Government and in an open manner. They will be able to put advice
directly to Ministers where members consider that to be appropriate.
Importantly, the new arrangements will be inherently more flexible and
adaptable than current arrangements. That touches on a point that the
hon. Member for City of Durham raised: why change at all if we have
something that works reasonably well and everyone accepts that it
does?<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000172">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The new
bodies’ non-statutory basis will allow changes in membership or
terms of reference to reflect developments in relevant sectors. That
will help negate the risk of a statutory body being overtaken by
legislative developments. That is quite important in this highly
technical field. It is no good having an advisory committee that is
bound, through its terms of inference, by statute, to limit or restrict
its advice on matters that are no longer part of the legislative
framework that is being
addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000173">&#160;</a>

Member for City of Durham asked about specific areas. I have indicated
why I think the new arrangement is better. It might
help her and the Committee if I give a little more background. The new
model for the Science Advisory Council that the Secretary of State
announced follows an arm’s length body review and a separate and
independent review of the Science Advisory Council led by Professor
Charles Godfray. The arm’s length body review sought to ensure
better co-ordination among the science advisory bodies. As part of
that, DEFRA reviewed the roles and functions of all 18 scientific and
technical advisory bodies. On 14 October, the Government
announced that the majority of DEFRA’s advisory bodies would be
reconstituted as committees of experts. In DEFRA, they will continue to
provide independent advice, but will now work more closely with the
Science Advisory Council and the chief scientific adviser. We are
getting better integration, not only of the advice that the specialist
bodies offer, but also in the way such bodies work with other advisory
bodies elsewhere, the chief scientific officer and the Science Advisory
Council.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000174">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">There
is an issue with European legislation. I do not want to over-stress it,
because part of the function will be, as the hon. Lady rightly says, to
advise Ministers on the effects of European legislation. Legislative
developments might stem from Europe. For example, the regulation on
hazardous substances is now largely occupied by the EU
REACH—registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of
chemical substances—regime, which means that we no longer make
domestic regulations as such. There are Europe-wide regulations, and
previously the advisory committee would obviously have been deeply
involved in that function. It is now involved in providing a view and
advice to Ministers, but not involved in the sense of developing the
legislative proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000176">&#160;</a>

advisory framework. I think I talked about transparency and openness,

aware, the AWB’s purpose is to set the  scale of
agricultural wages and related minimum terms and conditions of
employment. It is an independent statutory body, established by the
Agricultural Wages Act 1948, but it has a lineage that can be traced
back 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 47<a class="bkMark" name="Column47">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to 1924. Given its long period of existence, I have to question whether
it is still needed and what the Government propose as an alternative.
Will that be an adequate guarantee of the terms and conditions of
employment for agricultural workers? The answer to that is a pretty
straightforward no. As far as the Opposition understand the Government
proposal, it will not be an adequate safeguard.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000195">&#160;</a>

that agricultural workers, like others, are now covered by minimum wage

not cover the range of wage levels and categories that the AWB covers
and it does not look at the other terms and conditions at all. Why are
the Government doing this, and in whose interests? I hope that the
Minister will be able to give us some additional information to help us
to understand why the Government want to abolish the AWB, and what will

farmers—even if they are members of the NFU—who employ
agricultural workers support its abolition. Indeed, many farmers,
particularly small farmers, do not feel that their needs and concerns
are adequately represented by the NFU. Many farmers like the AWB
because it sets out a clear template for wages and terms and conditions
of employment without their having to negotiate or regulate those. The
Farmers Union of Wales does not support the abolition of the body
either. In listening to the NFU and using what it has said as a reason
for abolishing the AWB, the Government appear to be listening only to
some of the larger and most powerful farmers, and completely ignoring
the views of many small farmers.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000199">&#160;</a>

remember that an awful lot of very small farmers are members of the

farmers of a variety of sizes belong to each of

abolishing the AWB, the Government are representing only the interests
of the larger farmers and not listening sufficiently to the needs of
smaller ones. One reason why a number of small farmers support the AWB
is that they often have close 
<div class="columnNumber">

the consultation in Wales in August 2010, no progress whatever has been
made on any of the issues that the FUW raised with the Government. It
has also clearly said that as a union, it believes

                  </strong> My hon. Friend makes a really excellent
point, which I may return to later if there is time. Indeed, the TUC
made the comment on the proposal that the Government may be incurring
long-term costs—industrial relations problems could be one of
those costs—to get short-term gains. That is an additional
reason why we want the Government to think again about whether
abolition is the correct way
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000208">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
hope that my comments demonstrate my point that the minimum wage
legislation does not cover all the dimensions of the AWB’s work,
and in making that point, I owe the Committee a deeper explanation. The
agricultural industry needs to attract people with the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 49<a class="bkMark" name="Column49">&#160;</a>
                  </div>right skills and aptitude, and that is becoming more important as
farming methods continue to develop technologically. There is a grading
system in the terms and conditions of employment for agricultural
workers that reflects the diversity of skills needed and the
responsibilities attached. Level 1 is for unskilled, seasonal and
temporary workers and is barely above the minimum wage. Level 2
requires minimum basic qualifications or comes with certain
responsibilities, such as working with animals. That is currently
£6.58 per hour—just a bit above the minimum wage. The
grades continue to reflect additional skills needs and supervisory
duties up to £8.23 an hour. Let us be clear: that is a farm
management grade. A person on £8.23 an hour could be responsible
for managing a whole farm and its staff. It is not a huge salary by any
stretch of the imagination. The Government and Ministers have to
explain why they are picking on such a relatively low-grade group of
workers by seeking to abolish the body that ensures key protections for
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000209">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some people
argue that we do not have as many agricultural workers as we did a
century ago, so the AWB is not needed. It is true that we have fewer
agricultural workers, but the AWB provisions cover about 150,000
workers, with a further 14,000 in Wales, so it is not an insubstantial
group. The small numbers are not a reason for getting rid of the AWB.
It is clear that the abolition will not help agricultural workers or
farmers. My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh), our
DEFRA spokesperson, has grave concerns that abolishing the AWB will
result in a race to the bottom in agricultural wages. Labour members of
the Committee share her concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000210">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If the
Government manage to get approval for the abolition, it is incumbent on
the Minister to explain how he will prevent such a dreadful situation.
To that end I have a number of questions for him. What will he do to
prevent wage levels in the sector dropping? As I have argued, he cannot
say that minimum wage legislation will do that, because it would cover
only level 1, and even then not quite when we have the next uprating.
What will happen to the other levels? Everyone knows, as stated in the
other place, that supermarkets put pressure on farmers to reduce costs
every day. Unite’s representative for agricultural workers
identifies that one of the reasons why the horticultural sector has
problems with the AWB is the pressure put on the sector by supermarkets
to lower costs. She recommends strengthening the negotiating position
of the agricultural industry with supermarkets. I agree with her, but
perhaps the Minister does not, because Unite’s negotiating
position will not be strengthened by the withdrawal of the
AWB.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000211">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is likely to be extreme pressure on farmers to reduce staff costs. What
will the Minister do to ensure that wage levels are not affected? Lord
Whitty, speaking in the other place, said that within a week or two of
the legally binding minimum wages disappearing from horticulture and
agriculture, the supermarket buyer will say, “You now do not
need to pay the wages that you previously paid. You can lower your
costs and your prices to us and provide a significantly lower
rate.” He pointed out, poignantly, that in such a scenario the
savings do not go to the farmer but to the supermarket. So the
agricultural worker, who is not that well paid in 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 50<a class="bkMark" name="Column50">&#160;</a>
                  </div>any case, sees his or her standard of living drop. The only people who
will benefit are big business. That prompts the
question of whose interests it is in for the body to be abolished. A
strong fear expressed by those working in the sector is that it will
benefit not farmers—though they think it might—but big
business.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000212">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In
the 1980s and 1990s, when other wage boards were abolished by the
Thatcher Government, average wages in the sectors concerned dropped
significantly. Even Mrs Thatcher recognised the peculiarities of the
agricultural industry and decided to keep the AWB. I will not argue
that the AWB could not be updated or improved. It could be more open in
its deliberations; it could consult more. Those are reasons to
modernise the board, not abolish it. It is not clear that the
Government have recognised the needs of modern farming, and in
particular the need for an experienced and skilled work
force.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000213">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Has the
Minister consulted Lantra, the skills organisation for the agricultural
and horticultural sector? I am fortunate in having—unusually for
a Member with a city seat—an agricultural college in my
constituency, so I deal with Lantra and those seeking to build skills
in the sector probably weekly. There is real concern in the
agricultural and horticultural sector that not enough people are
getting the skills to work in that sector. There is a problem in
encouraging some young people to think that it is a career that they
might wish to take up. Lantra does excellent work, going round schools,
trying to persuade young people that they can make a good career in
agriculture in particular. It is perhaps not such a problem in
horticulture.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000214">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The point
Lantra would make is that unless there is a really good process in
place to move people up the skills levels, so that they can upgrade and
receive higher wages, there will be a complete loss of skills to the
sector, and people will not choose it for an occupation. It says that
there is a clear, identifiable need to build and maintain
professionalism. We do not know how the situation will be improved if
progression rates are not clearly visible and there is not proper
remuneration. We know that because of the ease with which the
Government seek to abolish the six different grades of agricultural
worker. The Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs, the right hon. Member for South East Cambridgeshire (Mr
Paice), says that on the abolition of the AWB, the six grades of worker
will not be replaced. He makes the point—again,
wrongly—that the minimum wage will meet that problem. It will
not. We need to hear from the Minister what will happen about the
different grades.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000215">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The crucial
missing element in all that the Government have said so far is how the
other levels are to be protected. Many workers have set salary scales
in other occupations that depend on skills and experience. We need that
to remain, and certainly not be removed, for agricultural workers. We
are concerned that members of the NFU and the Government constantly
refer to the national minimum wage as the protection. Perhaps they
think the only wage level in place in the sector in future will be the
national minimum. If that is not to be the case, we again need
clarification and
reassurance.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000216">&#160;</a>

also ask for the reinstatement of all the other wages boards that were
created in 1948 and have since been abolished? Many of those sectors
are complex, and for many of those, the minimum wage is not suitable. I

policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000220">&#160;</a>

to all the names of hon. Members’ constituencies. Perhaps
industrial disputes, which I mentioned, were one reason why Mrs
Thatcher did not abolish the AWB. We know that Mrs Thatcher enjoyed a
good industrial dispute, but a dispute in this sector is particularly
serious because of the effect on food production, and security of
supply on food production. Anything that puts industrial stability in
this sector at risk is very serious.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000222">&#160;</a>

it is not the AWB? Which civil servant will person the existing
helpline, or will it be scrapped? How will complex arrangements to

Government given any consideration to how the economy of rural areas
will be affected by a depression in rural wages, should it occur
because of this ill-thought-out proposal? Why has there been no

order covering the sector for this year has already been produced, and
if Members have a quick look, they will see that at present the AWB
addresses all those issues in some detail. Part 4, for example,
addresses minimum rates of pay for workers in grades one to six, and
part 6 addresses allowances, grants and supplements, including dog
allowances, on-call allowances, night work supplements and birth and
adoption grants. The order also addresses piecework, overtime for a
range of workers, training, travelling, bad weather, flexibility of
employment and entitlement to rest breaks. Those issues, which are
vital to the sector, are addressed by the board, so what will happen in
future? The AWB has much stronger powers for enforcing the order than
currently exist for the minimum
wage.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000226">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Wigan was right to make her comments about the young in the
farming sector. My constituency is in a large, important rural area in
Wales, and it contains 600 farming families and 147 villages. I have
fought four elections, and every year at election time we have meetings
with the Farmers Union of Wales and the NFU, two functioning unions in
my constituency. At the end of those meetings, we are always asked,
usually by an elderly farmer—our farmers are increasingly
elderly; the age profile of farmers is going up—whether the
candidate would advise their son or daughter to remain in the farming
industry. I am always asked that question, and the hon. Member for
Arfon has had the same experience in his constituency.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000239">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">With hand on
heart, it is incredibly difficult to say, “Yes, your son or your
daughter—maybe more than one—should stay in the
industry.” One of the reasons for that is the low wage base in
the low-wage economy that many of our constituents in Wales grapple
with daily. I have a great deal of sympathy with what the hon. Member
for Wigan has said. It is very hard to attract young people into the
industry. We have vibrant young farmers’ clubs across our
constituencies, but all too often those people have to farm part time
or leave the industry altogether.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000240">&#160;</a>

the supermarkets, and I am pleased to say that the Government are

existing legislation. I look forward

               <p class="tabbed">Like the hon.
Member for City of Durham, I start with the spirited debates in the
House of Lords, in which my noble Friends Lord Maclennan and Lord

amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000242">&#160;</a>

Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome, who will be responding for

has direct experience of them because he represents a rural

by posing to him the final question that my noble Friend Lord Greaves
asked in the other place; it reflects what I ask from the Government,
which is to lift the haze. As we have heard, it is not totally
acceptable to rest behind the national minimum wage legislation,
because other concerns about terms and conditions need to be addressed.

board”, because I am looking for some reassurance from my hon.
Friend the Minister on new structures and systems that will be put in
place. Some beauties of the wages board were the differentiation of the
six levels and how skilled, often highly technical, work could be
rewarded at an appropriate level. I do not think that it has been a
disincentive; it has been a reassurance.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000247">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I represent
some family farmers who work in the most sparse and scattered
communities, often made up of one or two individuals. They might be
members of the FUW or the NFU, but the wages board gives some
reassurance that there is a body to assist them. I am not sure that it
will be the Agricultural Wages Board, but that is the reassurance I
seek from the Minister. There has been talk of the Low Pay Commission

               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for City of Durham was right when she talked about the
other issues, such as terms and conditions. In particular, she talked
about the implications for the wider rural community. We are talking
about very small communities and the prospect of people leaving the

               <p class="tabbed">My wife and I
are blessed with four young children. There was great concern in my
village that had I lost my job, four children would have been taken out
of my village school and school numbers would have plummeted. We have
only 30 children in our school. There was an interest in electing me.
In very small, close-knit communities, the job base waning and people
leaving the industry has a direct effect on the wider rural economy and
the ability of councils and the Assembly to respond to needs in
education, transport and so on. We need acknowledgment that that is an
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000250">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I was going
to remind the Committee that this is an English and Welsh matter, but
there has been no need to do so. When I intervened, I made a point
about the consultation. The former Agriculture Minister in
Wales—we share the same constituency, though not the same
party—said in the National Assembly, in response to questioning,
that she did not feel that the Department for Rural Affairs in Cardiff
had been adequately consulted. I believe that the Government are
serious about the respect agenda with the devolved Administrations, but
there have been serious lapses and this may well be one of
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000251">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
former Agriculture Minister in Wales also said that had the Assembly
Government wished to pursue a Wales-only agricultural wages board,
DEFRA would not have intended to devolve the Welsh share of any
savings. I may be corrected on that, but that was certainly my
understanding of what she said in the Assembly. There are arguments to
be had about a Wales-only agricultural wages board because there is
movement of workers between England and Wales, which has benefited my
constituency.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000252">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am waiting to be reassured by my hon. Friend the Minister. There is a
role for clarity on these matters, but I am not sure we have had it to
date—the point raised by my noble Friends in another place. I
look forward to the Minister’s lifting the haze. These are
matters of great concern, not only in a handful of scattered rural
constituencies in mid, west and north Wales, but across the country. I
think we are talking about 154,000 workers. I know that my hon. Friend
empathises with these points. They need to be
addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000253">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is also an honour to discuss such an important issue. As the hon.
Member for Ceredigion just said, the issue is important for people up
and down the country, but it is also important for my constituents.
People often make the mistake of thinking that Wigan is an urban
constituency because of its town centre and all the fantastic things
for which Wigan is famed, such as football and rugby league in
particular. We recently won the Challenge cup, on which I am sure the
Committee will want to congratulate us
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000255">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
constituency of Wigan actually has huge areas of beautiful countryside
with a number of agricultural workers and employers in Shevington,
Standish and Aspull in particular, and this issue could not be more
important to them. I echo the points made by my hon. Friend the Member
for City of Durham in her introductory 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 56<a class="bkMark" name="Column56">&#160;</a>
                  </div>speech. This is not simply an issue that will affect workers in rural
areas; it will also affect employers. From both those perspectives,
Ministers are making a significant
mistake.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000256">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
AWB has protected thousands of workers since it was set up, but it has
also protected their families. As someone who has spent the past 10
years or so working with children and young people, that is
particularly important to me. I want to remind the Committee that in
this country—one of the wealthiest in the world—one in
five children still grows up in poverty, and a number of those children
are in rural areas. I know that Ministers have expressed concern about
that and have said that they will do all they can to tackle it. I want
to say to them that this measure will make that situation worse; I am
almost sure of it. The matter is not just of concern to Ministers in
the Cabinet Office; it should be of concern to Ministers right across
the Government with an interest in the
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000257">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
point about the AWB, as hon. Members have said, is that it covers not
just pay but a whole range of other things. One issue that I want to
dwell on briefly is tied housing, because nearly one third of the
workers that we are discussing live in such housing. The AWB plays an
extremely important role in that it regulates rent and negotiates to
ensure that people are not evicted. Many agricultural workers have
families and children and that is why I am concerned about what will
happen to them should the AWB cease to exist, with no clear
arrangements or understanding of what will
follow.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000258">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
mentioned earlier that the AWB regulates under-16s, to whom the
national minimum wage does not apply. I want to remind the Committee
that, at present, we have some 1 million unemployed young people in
this country. The Education Committee, of which I am a member, has
recently looked at several issues to do with that  and has
identified that there are particular problems for younger
people—particularly those who leave school  at
16.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000259">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In rural
communities, young people often work in agriculture before they reach
16, with the intention that it will become their full-time job. We
should not be starting those young people off on a lifetime of
employment with the strong message that their labour is not worth much
at all. Given that they are not protected by minimum wage legislation,
I would welcome some kind of response from the Minister on the issue of
under-16s and what will happen to them under the new
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000260">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Several
of my colleagues have pointed out that the AWB is also of considerable
use to employers. My hon. Friend the Member for Leicester South pointed
out earlier that there has been no major dispute in this area for some
time. The last major dispute was in 1923, one year before the AWB, in
its present form, was constituted. It cannot be a coincidence that
there has been no major strike in this industry since the AWB was set
up, and I ask the Committee to reflect on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000261">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <h4 class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000382">&#160;</a>
               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is also true that the AWB has a good track record of success. The hon.
Member for Montgomeryshire asked whether we should conclude that
because there are difficulties in recruiting young people into the
industry, the AWB has not done its job. The reverse is true. There are
a number of examples, many of which have been 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 57<a class="bkMark" name="Column57">&#160;</a>
                  </div>sent to Committee members by Unite and others who represent these
workers. Of particular importance is AWB’s success in removing
discriminatory age wage rates. Given my interest in young people, I
consider that very important. It certainly has not happened in all
industries. In 1993 it successfully negotiated for equal pay and
conditions for women. I am sure that we would all congratulate it on
that and recognise how important that
was.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000262">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
also want to respond to a point raised by the hon. Member for
Watford—whether the logic of arguing that the AWB should remain
should also lead us to set up wage boards in other areas. There are
some unique factors in this industry, which my hon. Friend the Member
for City of Durham dwelt on and which are worth stressing. Health and
safety is a subject close to my heart because it is incredibly
important in my constituency. Many people work in agriculture and the
construction industry, and the injury rates in agriculture are high. It
is a dangerous industry. If we needed a more pressing example of that,
the fact that 45 people died at work as a result of working in the
agricultural industry in 2009-10 should serve to focus our minds. It
seems almost inconceivable in this day and age that people should die
at work. It is therefore important that people be protected and
remunerated and that they have their own negotiating body. The point
applies to that industry more than any other; it is
unique.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000263">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Such
work is incredibly isolating in many instances. There needs to be a
centralised way of ensuring that a forum exists for employers and
workers to come together to negotiate pay conditions and all the other
elements my hon. Friend referred to. There is a real problem of lack of
mobility in this area. My constituency is a former mining area, made up
of a town centre connected to a number of pit villages by narrow roads
formerly used just for carts. A number of geographical factors make it
difficult to widen those roads, including houses being built at the
side of the roads. We have a canal and a railway line. Moving around
the area is therefore particularly difficult for people in the
industry. For someone who works on a farm in Shevington, getting work
in Standish is extraordinarily difficult. They would have to go into
Wigan town centre and then back out again. Also, there is not a huge
availability of such work. At a time when six people are chasing every
job in my constituency, it is hard for people to move around. That
makes it particularly important that people with limited choices of
where they work and the sort of work they do are properly represented
and
remunerated.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000264">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Does my hon. Friend agree that tied
housing, which often comes with these jobs, is very important for the
workers? There is a strong need to protect such housing in contract.
Rural housing costs mean that it is often difficult for workers simply
to move to another job; they have to check that housing is available.
High rural housing costs also impact on this
industry.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000265">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Absolutely. Pressure on housing is just one of many
factors that make such work and the costs incurred when living in these
communities very expensive. As I said earlier, we are talking about
people’s homes, not just jobs—in effect, their lives. I
hope that Parliament 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 58<a class="bkMark" name="Column58">&#160;</a>

taken by the previous Government. The obvious reasons for the
prevalence of gangmasters are the factors I have mentioned: isolation
and the mobility of labour. This is an incredibly serious issue. In
order to protect the vulnerable from the terrible people who carry out
these acts, we must ensure there is a body capable of acting in the
collective interest. One aspect of the AWB is that it works with
employers as well as workers, which is important, as that dialogue is
essential.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000267">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
I wish to talk about the groceries ombudsman. The subject could not be
more relevant to the decision to abolish the AWB. My hon. Friend the
Member for City of Durham gave a good portrait of the pressure from
supermarkets on farmers, who then have to find those savings somewhere.
In some cases, they bring pressure to try to drive down wages and terms
and conditions. It is essential to have a level playing field and that
we reward the employers who do everything they can to act decently and
ethically. In the light of the banking crisis and the News
International scandal, we would all surely now accept that we as
politicians have a huge duty to ensure that we promote the best and not
the worst of business.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000268">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am
concerned that we have seen some action to bring in a groceries
ombudsman, but we do not know when it will happen. I would welcome an
assurance from the Minister on that. The legislation as drafted is weak
and I am concerned about that: if we do not know what action is being
taken to stop the pressure at the top, removing the AWB would be a huge
mistake.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000269">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Many of us were rather mystified when last
October the Government announced plans to scrap the AWB, which sets
wages and conditions for farm workers. One of those who appeared rather
mystified was the Liberal Democrat spokesperson on DEFRA matters in the
House of Lords, Lord Greaves. He made the point that the abolition was
not in his party’s manifesto or in the coalition
agreement.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000271">&#160;</a>

them in England—including almost 24,000 in the south-west, as I
am sure the Minister is all too aware—and 14,000 in Wales. Over
the summer, I had the pleasure of travelling to Pembrokeshire. That
journey took me through Clwyd South, seeing many of those agricultural
villages,  through Montgomery, seeing more of those
agricultural communities, further into Brecon and Radnor, then
Ceredigion. I do not know if I passed through the hon. Member for
Ceredigion’s home village with its school. My stopping point was
the beautiful area of Preseli Pembrokeshire, with its extraordinary
countryside and agricultural communities. One can imagine the
importance of agriculture in those areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000272">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have discussed how, at the lowest level, the AWB is only 2p more than
the national minimum wage—in the House of Lords, Lord Greaves
made the point well that only some 20% of workers covered by the AWB
are 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 60<a class="bkMark" name="Column60">&#160;</a>
                  </div>at grade 1—which fails to recognise that the AWB sets pay and
conditions across six grades, from £5.95 to £8.88. The
point has been well made that the Government are going where not even
Mrs Thatcher dared to tread. Whether that was a great ideological point
or an awareness of the number of agricultural workers in the
south-east, the south-west and the east of England is a moot point, but
it is a point that Mrs Thatcher was not shy to
recognise.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000279">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is important that the AWB is seen as a partnership between industry and
unions, which sets fair wages and terms and conditions for people
working in agriculture. The board also sets overtime rates, rates for
night work, standby allowances, sick pay, bereavement leave and holiday
entitlements. Without the AWB—this is an extension of the point
made about the FUW—each farm business owner would have to
negotiate their own terms and conditions with their work force. Many
farmers want to keep the AWB, because it means that they do not have to
become employment specialists, and they can get on with running their
farms.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000280">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">Should
the AWB be abolished, farm workers could lose up to £264 a week
in sick pay, if they fall sick. Allow me to explain: farm workers are
entitled to agricultural sick pay after one year’s employment,
equivalent to the minimum rate for the grade that they are on. Under
the plans, workers on the lowest grade will lose £150 in sick
pay. Grade 1—initial grade—agricultural sick pay is
£232.05, while statutory sick pay comes out at £81.60,
making a potential loss of £150.45 a week. The source for this
information is the Agricultural Wages (England and Wales) Order 2010.
For grade 6—farm manager—sick pay is £346.32,
while statutory sick pay is £81.60, making a potential loss of
£264.72. Clearly, that would not be affected by a diversion into
any sort of low-pay business, because it would not affect many of these
grades.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000281">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We also have
to look at the wider impact on rural communities. The Joseph Rowntree
Foundation, in its report from last November, “A minimum income
standard for rural households”, made the point that living costs
in rural areas are 10% to 20% higher than in urban areas, due to high
petrol costs, which is something Members across the House have
expressed concern about. There is also the lack of affordable housing,
cuts to public services, and few accessible jobs.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000282">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government plan to take £2 billion in cash out of the DEFRA
budget over the next four years, which is the second biggest cut for
any Department. I hope that the Minister takes on board people’s
concerns, but I cannot help thinking that the same Government who
wanted to sell off the forests now want to sell out agricultural
workers. We have seen front-loaded cuts to local government, meaning
that there are fewer council-supported rural bus services on Sundays
and in the evenings. Next January, the Government will cut the bus
service operators grant, which supports many rural services, by 20%.
That will mean higher fares and fewer buses.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000283">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Getting rid
of the AWB at a time of such cuts, which I believe are
disproportionately affecting rural communities, would be devastating
for workers in the agricultural sector. It would make it even more
difficult for them and for people’s lives in our rural
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000284">&#160;</a>

on a subject that people feel very attached to, and I recognise the
totemic significance of the AWB. I yield to no member of the Committee

affected by the proposals—not to my hon. Friends the Members for
Ceredigion and for Preseli Pembrokeshire, or the hon. Members for Arfon

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I gently say
to members of the Committee that we have to look at this issue not with
the eyes of someone from 1948, or even the beginning of the 20th
century, because agriculture has changed. Not only has agriculture
changed, but the social and employment legislation of the country has,
too. We are not working in the context that Churchill worked
in—I think that that quote probably came from when he was a good
Liberal, rather than a good Conservative. He operated in circumstances
where there were no social protections. People in rural areas were the
poorest of the poor. He was trying to establish a basis of fairness,
equality and social security for those people. That is not the case in
circumstances where we have the national minimum wage—I will
come back to the fact that that is not the be-all and end-all in this
argument—employment protection legislation, working time
regulations, housing protection and contract protection. When we are
talking about people who work in the agricultural and horticultural
industries, a lot of different factors come into play that simply were
not there when this—then necessary—protection was put in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000286">&#160;</a>

that the hon. Gentleman is making a serious point. A lot of other wages
boards have been abolished, and the hon. Member for City of Durham has
been asked why the Labour Government did not bring them back if they
were so necessary. The answer, of course, is that they proved not to
have been necessary, and when we look at some of the wages councils
that have been abolished we can see why. This is a reduction to the
absurd, because it is quite astonishing that some of them got through
to 1993 without being abolished, such as the Aerated Waters Wages
Council; the Coffin Furniture and Cerement-making Wages Council; the
Flax and Hemp Wages Council; and the Ostrich and Fancy Feather and
Artificial Flower Wages Council. If I were trying to make a flippant
point, I would say that perhaps the time had gone for some of

industrial unrest in any of those sectors since they were abolished, he

the valid point that if I felt that protections were insufficient to
protect my constituents and the constituents of rural Britain, I would
not be arguing this case. I will say, however, that there is an
argument—it is perfectly proper and is the argument that the
Government are putting forward—that here we have the only sector
in the economy that retains a specific employment regime for workers.
That is simply fact. That means that businesses in this sector face
regulatory burdens when they employ workers that are not shared by
other businesses in other areas. There are internal contradictions,
which I shall expand on in a moment, within what is proposed, but all
of us want to see a thriving and sustainable agricultural
industry.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000292">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
industry has shrunk massively over the years. I used to have 10 dairy
farms in my village. I now have three working farms and one that is
essentially used for shooting purposes. It has contracted massively.
Most of those farmers no longer employ large numbers of staff. The ones
that they do employ are highly prized, and that may come as a surprise
to some members of the Committee who are perhaps not as close to rural
communities. In the livestock sector, farmers desperately want to
recruit good stockmen and stockwomen who will look after your
livestock. They do not come cheaply or easily. They have to be
attracted. The idea that a good milker could be paid below the national
minimum wage is nonsense in the present agricultural context. I want to
see something developing that will help both employers and workers
alike.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000293">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Looking
at it objectively, the legislation is outdated, restrictive. It
discourages employment and inhibits modern employment practices. I will
give an example, because it is one that people may instantly recognise.
At the moment, the legislation discourages the payment of annual
salaries. In most professions and trades, annual salaries are now the
norm. We do not pay people on a less-than-annual-salary basis. In the
context of agricultural workers, however, because of the way that the
AWB does its business, that is actively discouraged. In contrast, the
national minimum wage legislation, which I have always 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 63<a class="bkMark" name="Column63">&#160;</a>
                  </div>supported, provides for the payment of annual salaries, which benefits
workers by giving them better control over their financial
planning.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000294">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will give another example of the difficulties in the present system.
The current arrangements mean that farm businesses are often required
to operate dual regimes. What constitutes agricultural work for the
purposes of the AWB is not necessarily carried out in isolation from
non-agricultural work, which leads to confusion and difficulties and a
great deal of bother for both employers and employees. An example of
that would be if a farmer operates a packer house on a farm. Under the
current arrangements, packing produce grown on the farm is covered by
the agricultural minimum wage. The packing of bought-in produce is
covered by the national minimum wage. That makes no sense from a
business point of view, and it discourages the use of produce grown
on-farm, which hinders enterprise and job opportunities within
agriculture. That is a real and practical
difficulty.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000295">&#160;</a>

workers will receive the same level of employment protection as workers
in other sectors of the economy. There have been claims that if the
board were abolished, workers would see an immediate drop in wages and
other benefits. For the purposes of the Committee and for those
listening outside, it is very important to stress that all workers in
employment at the time the board is abolished will retain their
existing contractual rights until their contract is varied by agreement
between them and their employer or it comes to an end. That includes
not only basic salary conditions, but the other conditions as well.
There is contract protection, provided someone has worked for the same
employer continuously for 52 weeks. It does not matter whether there is
a written contract of employment; there is an implied contract. There
have been concerns about the loss of agricultural sick pay, but, again,
that would be covered by the implied contract. Workers would remain on
exactly the same
terms.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000300">&#160;</a>

about the competition for people to work in the industry. That is a
real situation in real agriculture, as opposed to the romantic idea of
what happens. Farmers are desperate to get good staff. They will employ
them under contracts that do not put them at a disadvantage to those
already in the industry and elsewhere. That is the reality and I see no

certainly expect the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee to
take an active interest. However, I will mention the important role we
anticipate for the Low Pay Commission, which touches on a point raised
by my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion. Again, I stress that not
all people working in the agricultural industry are at the bottom end
of the wage spectrum, as hon. Members have said. Only about 20% of such
workers are in the lowest bracket, but because it is desperately
important that we protect their interests, it is important that the
responsibility for setting the minimum wage for agricultural workers
will be transferred to the Low Pay Commission. It will consider
evidence from the agriculture sectors when recommending the adult
national minimum wage rate, as well as the rates for young people and
apprentices. It will collect that information.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000304">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, which already enforces the
national minimum wage on behalf of Ministers in the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills, will enforce the new arrangements. The
Committee may be interested to know that the details of the
arrangements for covering the costs to the Low Pay Commission and HMRC
are a matter of discussion between BIS and DEFRA at the moment, but we
expect the change to lead to the development of more efficient ways of
working to help deal with wider budgetary pressures.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000305">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Following the
transfer of responsibility to HMRC, enforcement arrangements would
change significantly. At the moment, agricultural workers’
minimum wage entitlement is enforced only if they make a complaint.
HMRC has traditionally operated a more proactive approach. As well as
dealing with complaints from workers, it routinely undertakes
investigations on the basis of risk. That approach would be applied to
agricultural workers and would put a far larger number of the most
vulnerable workers in agriculture within reach of minimum wage
enforcement. Workers who wish to make a complaint or seek advice will
continue to use the pay and works rights helpline as their first point
of contact. That is quite a significant
protection.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000306">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
me come back to the wider issue, because it is important. This industry
is very dear to my heart, as I come from a part of the county where
milk and cheese production is still a significant part of our economy.
It 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 65<a class="bkMark" name="Column65">&#160;</a>
                  </div>is important that this industry shake off some of the old notions about
what constitutes the industry, and the prejudices involved. Part of
that is low pay. We cannot have a thriving agricultural industry if it
is seen as an industry that pays rock-bottom wages and has to be forced
into providing decent conditions. We need a skilled and qualified work
force. We only have to look at the way that agriculture has changed to
recognise that. We no longer send a chap out into the fields with a
pair of wellies and a stick. They are operating very, very expensive
machinery. They are dealing with very high-tech kit to make this
industry work. It is essential that workers be properly rewarded for
their responsibilities. I hope the whole Committee
agrees.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000307">&#160;</a>

concerns about the Principality in Committee. My qualification for
listening carefully to Welsh concerns is that I can see Wales from my
constituency and the Welsh can see me. I do not accept that there was
not proper consultation with the Welsh Assembly Government on this; nor
do I accept that that is not still carrying on. It is. We still await
the final position of the Welsh Government. There was a point at which

county hall than to the police authority. That is an aside.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000315">&#160;</a>

specific issue of enforcement, because the people who were doing the
enforcement based on demand within the AWB set-up will be doing the
same thing, with the exception that they will be able to instigate
investigations themselves through the HMRC system. I do not anticipate
significant cost savings in that
instance.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000325">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">It
is important that I address the other points raised by Members. Having
dealt with the general terms and conditions, a key issue is the
downward pressure from supermarkets. All of us who have campaigned for
many years against the unequal arrangements between the oligopoly that
the supermarkets represent and the primary producers will recognise
that as a real fear. We are now in a much better position to resist
such downward pressure than ever before. Not only do we have the
grocery supply code of practice, which gives protection in exactly
those terms, but we will soon have a Bill enacting the ombudsman
responsible for the grocery supply chain, which addresses the point
raised by the hon. Member for Wigan. Not only has that Bill been
published in draft form; it has been considered by a Committee. It has
therefore had its pre-legislative scrutiny, and I am hopeful that we
can introduce it as a substantive Bill in the very near future. The
draft Bill will represent a huge improvement in the position of many
primary producers across the country who currently feel as if they have
an unequal relationship with the supermarkets.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000326">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am pleased
the Government have taken the action that many of us have been
advocating for many years. I cannot pre-empt the way in which the House
considers the matter, which is one for the House. It must have time to
look at and go through the draft Bill in due course, but there will not
be a long delay so far as the Government are concerned in introducing
that proposal. Such a delay is certainly not anticipated.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000327">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">It is
important that we promote agricultural skills. In the rural development
programme for England there is funding for training and skills
development in the farming sector, including horticulture, food and
forestry. My genuine feeling is that, once the Bill is enacted, there
will be better long-term prospects for advancement for young people
entering the industry and that agricultural work will be promoted as a
career path, quite separate from the currently rather limited pool,
which consists of those who inherit their family farms and therefore
start with inherited capital, rather than having a stake through their
own wish to engage in the industry. I am hopeful that we will do better
at developing skills and bring people into the
area.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000328">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Wigan talked about young people below the minimum wage
regulations, and she is absolutely right. At the moment, people younger
than the school-leaving age are not protected by the national minimum
wage. That is true in agriculture and in many other sectors. I must say
that a limited number of young people now work in this
sector—or, indeed, any other sector. The
number of pre-school-leaving-age children working is much, much lower
now than it was at one
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000329">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">People
working in the agricultural or horticultural industry will be in the
same position as they would if they were sweeping up in a hairdressing
salon, working in a newsagents or anything else. They continue to be
protected by general employment law and health and safety legislation.
They would also be regulated by the Children and Young Persons Act
1933, which gives local authorities powers to make byelaws concerning
the employment of young people, sets limits on the types of work that a
young person can undertake, and puts a ceiling on the number of hours
worked each week. Byelaws under that legislation can also allow the
issuing of permits to employers to provide a number of documents to
their local authority, including a declaration that an appropriate risk
assessment has been carried out. The dangers of working in the
agricultural industry were mentioned in a different context,
particularly in the case of young people; no one wants to see them put
in dangerous
positions.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000331">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">None
of that answers the question of whether young people will be paid the
national minimum wage. No, they will not, just as they will not
elsewhere. I am not sure that I actually want a system that encourages
large numbers of much younger children into what the hon. Member for
Wigan acknowledges is a dangerous workplace, but we need to look at
ensuring that all the protections that can be put in place are put in
place. I think that relatively few younger children now work in
agriculture. The days when we used to arrange our school holidays in
Somerset to ensure that the children were available to bring in the
harvest are long gone. That was the case, and it is a well-known fact,
but it is perhaps a slightly outdated issue. She mentioned gangmasters
as well, and the changes that were made persist in giving protection
against unscrupulous gangmasters, so that should not be an issue in
this
context.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000332">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
hope that I have not tired the Committee by covering some of the issues
involved. I recognise the Committee’s genuine concern to ensure
that the measure does not disadvantage people in rural areas. I share
those concerns, but having looked at what is proposed, I believe that
those concerns are misplaced. We should continue with 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>consultation through DEFRA, and discussions with the Welsh Assembly
Government, with a view hopefully to helping the industry develop
modern working practices that are untrammelled by the long list of
things that the hon. Member for City of Durham was kind enough to read
out. As she read out all the things that are set by some national body
rather than by the employer and the employee, I thought, “She is
making my argument for me.” They should be set out in a proper
contract of employment, with the security of national legislation
underpinning it. That would be better in the long run. On that basis, I
hope that she can withdraw her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000333">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I will make every attempt to be brief,
because we have had an interesting and full debate this afternoon. I
thank the hon. Member for Ceredigion for his informed speech, and for
helping us to understand the impacts of the possible abolition on his
constituents. My hon. Friend the Member for Wigan made several powerful
points, particularly about protecting young people in the industry, and
the need to give them opportunities and protect their homes and jobs.
My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd South spoke about the importance of
the AWB to farm owners. We must not overlook that, as it added much
detail to the
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000334">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
me turn to the Minister’s comments. As more than 1,000 workers
in his constituency are covered by the AWB, the Opposition respect what
he has to say; we understand that he knows something about the
industry. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 70<a class="bkMark" name="Column70">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Nevertheless, I must disagree with him to some extent. The main argument
seems to be that the AWB is in some way anachronistic. If that is the
Government’s argument, we must try to modernise it, and not
simply abolish what there is. As for the Liberal Democrat voice, it
needs to turn up its volume. Perhaps between now and Report, we can
encourage the Liberal Democrats to do that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000335">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am not
really sure what the Minister means by removing regulatory burdens. My
point in reading out the list was to show that a wide range of issues
are covered by the AWB. I am none the wiser about how those wider
issues will be addressed following the Minister’s comments. If
he could give more consideration to the matter before Report, that
would be really helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000336">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If governing
bodies’ purpose is to ensure that the industry is not
characterised by low pay, why refer issues to the Low Pay Commission? I
am also still bewildered about the whole issue of costs and savings.
The Opposition would like to give the Government another opportunity to
think about the issues. We want to consider some of the responses made
this afternoon, and perhaps consider the issue again on Report. I
therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11090863000337">&#160;</a>
