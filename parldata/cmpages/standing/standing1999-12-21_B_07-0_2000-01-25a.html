</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): I beg to move amendment No. 126, in page 13, line 6, leave out `prejudice' and insert `harm'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 127, in clause 25, page 13, line 17, leave out `prejudice' and insert `harm'.
<P>
No. 133, in clause 29, page 16, line 1, leave out `prejudice' and insert `harm'.
<P>
No. 139, in clause 34, page 19, line 5, leave out `prejudice' and insert `harm'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This is an important issue. The key point of clauses 24, 25, 29 and 34 is that they provide content-based exemptions rather than absolute exemptions. We must determine the degree to which the release or the confirmation of information would be to the detriment of the interests that are protected. Does the word ``prejudice'' convey the idea of sufficient injury? It has to impress on individuals who are charged with the responsibility of deciding how to use the discretion whether it is right to release or confirm information, or whether that could have a detrimental effect. That is the kernel of the Bill and it has caused more unhappiness in the minds of those who would like more information to be released than almost any other matter.
<P>
The White Paper, ``Your Right to Know'', did not use the word ``prejudice''. It said that there should be a substantial harm test. At the outset, the former Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the right hon. Member for South Shields (Dr. Clark), made it abundantly clear that the Government intended to introduce such a test. Paragraph 3.7 on page 11 of the White Paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We believe the test to determine whether disclosure is to be refused should normally be set in specific and demanding terms. We therefore propose to move in most areas from a simple harm test to a substantial harm test, namely``—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
this is the key point—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``will the disclosure of this information cause substantial harm?''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We debated whether the words ``substantial'' or ``significant'' should preface the words ``harm'' or ``prejudice'' in the Bill. As I said, there are arguments on both sides. We are content for the moment to work on the assumption that both words are unnecessary in this context. However, we firmly believe that replacing the substantial harm test with a mere prejudice test in the four clauses is a significant rowing back of what the Government promised in the White Paper. More importantly, it also represents a rowing back from the existing code of practice. Interestingly, the code uses both ``harm'' and ``prejudice'' to describe the injury that could or is likely to be caused in the context of deciding whether information should be released. Arguably, the use of ``harm'' rather than ``prejudice'' would mean that more information would be released because ``harm'' conveys a stronger sense of damage or hurt than ``prejudice'', which has less emphasis and impact.
<P>
I suspect that the Government will say, as we have heard them say before in Committee, that ``prejudice'' is a well known legal term and that they have opted to use that term consistently and not to include ``harm''. The Committee should pause for thought, and should not be mesmerised or hypnotised by the Under-Secretary's response into thinking that there—[Interruption.] My anticipation of his response is based on what we have heard before. I have an open mind, but unless there has been a radical shift in his opinion on the matter during the weekend intermission in proceedings—for which I would be grateful but surprised—that is what we shall hear.
<P>
We should not accept at face value the contention that the use of ``prejudice'' throughout the Bill is a good idea, or the contention that there is no meaningful or discernible difference between that term and ``harm''. There is no certainty that the courts will interpret the two words in the same way or rule that they convey the same degree of detriment.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would explain why he believes that the terms ``prejudice'' and ``harm'' are not virtually synonymous legally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am explaining why it is important to use ``harm'', and the word's significance.
<P>
Let us get down to brass tacks. The Government have used ``prejudice'' and have relied entirely on previous court rulings on the word's meaning. I am not a lawyer; the hon. Gentleman is. By his intervention, he said effectively that, whatever the House decided regarding the Bill, the decision would already have been made—the courts would have already determined the standard. However, it is for the Committee and for Parliament to set the standard. It is not certain that the courts would interpret ``prejudice'' as being the same as ``harm'' if the latter was included and if we debated what it ought to mean.
<P>
The crux of the matter is that remarkably few challenges of acts of discretion by a public authority, and by the responsible official within the authority, would go to court. What really matters is what the Bill will mean for the thousands of public authorities and the people within them who will have to exercise discretion and make judgments.
<P>
Another weakness of the Bill is that the commissioner may review an exercise of discretion, but will have no power to require an authority to release information. The effect is that an individual within a public authority, which need not necessarily be a Government Department, will look at the Bill and exercise his discretion on the basis of what he understands the word ``prejudice'' to mean, but its meaning is extremely wide and extremely weak. That individual will say to the Information Commissioner, ``I am not happy about this.'' The commissioner will review the matter and say, ``I recommend that the information is released'' but there will be no power to require it to be released. So, as the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) has said consistently throughout our proceedings, at each turn, if there is any doubt at all, the doubt will be used in favour of the authority and against the individual who wants the information given to him or its existence confirmed.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is in effect saying that there is a difference between the words ``prejudice'' and ``harm''. Will he explain what he means by that? If he looks at paragraph 65 of volume one of the report by the Select Committee on Public Administration, he will see that it says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Clifford Chance quote an Anglo-American legal dictionary to the effect that `prejudice is a legalism for harm.' ''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to say, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Lord Woolf and sir Richard Scott both told us that `harm' and `prejudice' were equivalent''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So what is the difference? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We do not believe that the word ``prejudice'' is strong enough. The Minister must be aware that the constant criticism of the Bill, including from his Back Benchers, is that the use of the word ``prejudice'' as opposed to the promise of a substantial harm test is a significant retreat from what the Government promised they would do. When we consider the clauses in which the word ``prejudice'' is used—doubtless, we shall have several debates on the matter in Committee—we will find that the content-based exemptions are extremely wide. We ask the Government to think again. We want to impress on the Government the deep frustration and anxiety felt by many people who want more information to be released. Those people welcome the Government's promise to free up information and change the culture in public services—Ministers have consistently promised that that is their objective in the Bill—but they do not believe that the Bill achieves that objective because the word ``prejudice'' is not strong enough.
<P>
In exercising discretion not to release information, the harm, damage or injury that would be caused by the release of information must be more than a fig leaf of anxiety or potential mischief; it must be real rather than imagined. We believe that the word ``harm'' would enable those who will have the job of implementing the legislation to achieve that objective. We do not want to have sterile debates about whether, in the unlikely event that many discretionary decisions are challenged in a court of law, some legal luminaries, including the most noble and eminent lawyers on the Committee Corridor, will turn around and say that it makes not a scrap of difference whether the word ``harm'' or ``prejudice'' is used. Both regarding the practicality of people having to work with the Bill and the expectation in the public mind of what is to be released, we think that the prejudice test is inadequate. Our purpose in tabling the amendment is to point out that ``prejudice'' is not sufficient and that the Government need to think again. Using ``harm'' rather than ``prejudice'' would ensure that more information is released.
<P>
I draw the Under-Secretary's attention to the code of practice; I do not recall there being an argument about the subject when it was introduced. The code uses the word ``harm'' throughout; on occasions it uses the word ``prejudice''. For example, clause 24 relates to defence. The code states that national security or defence would have to be harmed by disclosure; clause 24 states that information is exempt if it is likely to prejudice our defence capability or effectiveness. With some imagination, hon. Members may conclude that the clause is a rowing back from the code of practice. For example, the Ministry of Defence has decided to close a radar station in my constituency and operate it on a remote basis, with the loss of about 200 jobs. It could be argued that, because of the extremely wide exemption, information about that decision should not be available for release because it might prejudice defence capability or effectiveness.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not want to incur your wrath, Dr. Clark, by repeating what was said in a previous debate, but the combination of the weak term ``prejudice'' rather than the substantial harm text in the White Paper, the width of the exemptions, and the final coup d'e´tat, the fact that the commissioner has no power to recommend release, lead to one conclusion: that little information will be released if public authorities decide that they do not want it released. The exemptions in the clauses give public authorities every opportunity to exercise discretion against the release of information and in favour of withholding it. We shall debate such matters in greater detail later.
<P>
Conservative Members and many outside Parliament who share our views hope and expect that the Government will re-think their position. We want the Bill to contain measures that are more akin to what was promised in the White Paper and, more importantly, to deliver the release of as much information as is currently available—

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> One of the key bricks in the wall of the hon. Gentleman's argument is the commissioner's lack of power. However, if the commissioner forms the view that the disclosure of information will not prejudice the matter specified, he or she can order disclosure. It is the commissioner and the tribunal, not the authority, who have the final say on what prejudice means. That takes a brick out of the hon. Gentleman's argument; perhaps he can reconstruct it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Our interpretation, and that of many others who advise the Committee, is that the Under-Secretary is wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): It is possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> It is possible that the Under-Secretary is wrong. Our understanding of the commissioner's powers is that he can rule upon whether there was a discretion—whether the information was caught by one of the exemptions. If the commissioner ruled that the exemption did not apply, he could issue an information notice and, subsequently, an enforcement notice and the information would be released. That was the Home Secretary's position on Second Reading. However, the question remains unanswered as to why, under clause 48, the commissioner may only recommend the release of information when a public authority says that it has exercised its discretion and that it does not believe that it should be released. The commissioner cannot empower its release.
<P>
People view our proceedings in the hope and expectation that the final Bill will more adequately reflect what was promised in the White Paper. More important, they, and we, wish to ensure that it will at least match the code of practice under which information may currently be released. I get one letter after another from organisations telling me that the opposite will occur. Their two chief criticisms are that the prejudice test is too weak and that the commissioner does not have the power to require the release of information. Unless one of those criticisms is met by Report, the Government will be in difficulty and the Bill will fail to honour the promise made in their manifesto and in the White Paper.
<P>
We did not judge that the code should be put on a statutory basis—that was the Government's decision. We fervently believe that the Bill should at least deliver the release of as much information as the code allows. We are not satisfied that that will be so, chiefly because of the use of ``prejudice''. A harm test would be stronger. Those having to decide whether to release information would be encouraged to judge more on potential injury, hurt and damage than on conjectural prospects of prejudice. When we discuss the exemptions in more detail, we shall demonstrate again the extent to which they are too widely drawn. The use of ``prejudice'' only adds insult to the injury caused by the Government's drafting.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The circumstances set out by the hon. Gentleman reminded me a little of ``Alice in Wonderland''. The Queen says that words mean what she says they mean. The hon. Gentleman did not seem sure whether he was arguing for ``substantial harm'' or for ``harm''. His amendment would clearly insert ``harm''.
<P>
He sought to distinguish between ``prejudice'' and ``harm'', but he was on weak ground. The conclusion of the Select Committee on Public Administration, given on paragraph 65 of its report, was different from his. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Lord Woolf and Sir Richard Scott both told us that `harm' and `prejudice' were equivalent . . . we accept that `prejudice' is to be preferred to `harm' on the grounds that it is more common in other legislation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The terms ``prejudice'' and ``harm'' are, in law, more or less synonymous. That was the view given by the Select Committee in that paragraph, and by the House of Lords ad hoc Committee on Freedom of Information in paragraph 32 of its report. Other legislation that has a similar effect in relation to disclosure of information uses the term ``prejudice''. The Australian Freedom of Information Act 1982 uses several different phrases. Sections 37 and 40 of that Act use the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would, or could reasonably be expected to prejudice/endanger''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Likewise, the Irish freedom of information legislation uses several different words almost interchangeably, but sections 21, 23, 24, 30 and 31 use the words, ``reasonably expected to prejudice''. The New Zealand Official Information Act 1983 uses the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would be likely to prejudice/endanger/damage seriously.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I understand that; we have all read the Select Committee report. Given that the Government seem to rely so much on the Select Committee in this respect, it is tempting to ask whether they will undertake to accept all the Select Committee's arguments. The Minister just added the phrase, ``damage seriously''. Perhaps that should be dealt with by a different amendment on Report, but the Minister made my point for me. The word ``prejudice'' is rather weaker than the words used in the overseas legislation to which he referred.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Overseas legislation uses several different phrases, and my point is that several different phrases could be used. Whether one uses the word ``prejudice'' or the word ``harm'' is a judgment. If we take the view of Lord Woolf and Sir Richard Scott, both eminent lawyers, that the two words are equivalent, whichever word one prefers is a matter of judgment. The hon. Gentleman argues that that judgment should be exercised on the basis that one means something different from the other, but he has put forward no legal argument or authority for that claim. The reason we decided to use the word ``prejudice'' is straightforward; it is because lawyers will be more familiar with the word ``prejudice'' than with the word ``harm''. Other legislation regarding disclosure of information uses the term ``prejudice''. For example, I refer the Committee to sections 29, 30 and 31 of the Data Protection Act 1998, to paragraph 4 of schedule 12A of the Local Government Act 1972, or to section 53 of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994. Those and further examples are set out on page 45 of the third report of the Public Administration Committee. It, too, reached the conclusion that, for the sake of clarity, ``prejudice'' is the better word. We believe that where a term is used in other legislation in similar circumstances, it is good practice to continue to use that phrase, unless it is unclear or a different meaning is intended—
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome):Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I will give way in a moment, but I should like to make a couple more points first.
<P>
That is not the case here. The term prejudice is clearly understood by the courts and by the Information Commissioner designate. We intend the term to have a similar effect in the Bill as it has in other legislation, and I see no reason to change it.
<P>
The White Paper was the subject of widespread consultation. The majority of those who responded on that point rejected the phrase ``substantial harm'', which the hon. Member for Ryedale seemed to use almost interchangeably with the phrase ``harm''. The hon. Gentleman referred to the code, which uses the word ``harm'', but the code is non-statutory. We are dealing with legislation and want to give the court clear guidance. The fact that this legislation will relate to other legislation that applies similar tests means that we should use the word ``prejudice'', which is used in other legislation.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that the commissioner has no power to order the release of information. I repeat: if the commissioner forms the view that disclosure of information will not prejudice the matter specified, the commissioner can order disclosure. The commissioner and tribunal, not the authorities, have the final say on prejudice. The hon. Member for Ryedale was conflating the powers in respect of clause 13 and in relation to whether an exemption applies; the commissioner can decide whether there would be prejudice. If she thinks that there would not, she can order disclosure. What constitutes prejudice, therefore, in any case, is a matter for the commissioner.
<P>
I give way the hon. M Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath).
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The hon. Gentleman has moved away from the matter of definition. He suggests that there is no difference between the way in which the words ``prejudice'' and ``harm'' are construed. He will, however, confirm that there is a substantial difference if the word ``substantial'' is introduced as a qualification of either. There is a difference between ``substantial harm'' or ``substantial prejudice'' and the simple nouns ``harm'' and ``prejudice''.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> No, I do not confirm it. One wonders what the word ``substantial'' in this context means and what it does, or does not, add. Later, we may discuss why on earth we want to introduce the word ``substantial''. It is clear from considering how the Scottish White Paper uses the term, and the way in which we have interpreted it, that the word ``substantial'' does not have great substance. In effect, having a clear test—the word ``prejudice''—is much better than having a vaguer and less-used term such as ``substantial harm'' or ``harm'', which have much the same connotation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Fisher </B>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central): Unlike most members of the Committee, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is a lawyer. Is he saying that, in his legal opinion, ``prejudice'' and ``harm'' are the same and will be interpreted by the courts in the same way? Will he confirm that if his view is that one is not weaker or stronger than the other, the test that will lead to more or less information being exempt is the same, regardless of whether ``prejudice'' or ``harm'' is used?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I ask my hon. Friend to rely not on a lawyer of my limited eminence but on those of greater eminence such as Lord Woolf and Sir Richard Scott, both of whom are held in enormously high regard by the House. The Public Administration Committee report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Lord Woolf and Sir Richard Scott both told us that `harm' and `prejudice' were equivalent, although we take the point made by Sir Richard Scott that `harm' is a nice, straightforward word and it has got only one meaning so far as I know, whereas `prejudice' has several.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the Select Committee concluded:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``we accept that `prejudice' is to be preferred to `harm' on the grounds that it is more common in other legislation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is our view; I am not sure what the several meanings mentioned in the report are. I included that in my quotation so that we are entirely clear what Sir Richard Scott said, in case the hon. Gentleman wishes to ask further questions. Sir Richard Scott and Lord Woolf were entirely clear that the words ``harm'' and ``prejudice'' were equivalent. The answer to my hon. Friend's question is that they are not different tests. It is always a matter for the courts to interpret legislation in the light of case law and of what we may say in our proceedings. It is the view of eminent lawyers that the two words are equivalent.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am interested in and impressed by the reputation of those whom the Under-Secretary quoted, but I asked him for the Government's view. Is the Under-Secretary telling the Committee and the public that, when the Bill was drafted, the Government did not mind whether ``prejudice'' or ``harm'' was used because they both carried exactly the same weight? Did they spin a coin and say, ``Well, for reasons of consistency we will use `prejudice' throughout, but we might just as well have used `harm'. However, we will go with the view of Sir Richard and others that one is the same as the other''?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I do not say that. I am saying that the Government made the judgment that ``prejudice'' was a better word than ``harm'' because it is used in other legislation. It was not a matter of spinning a coin, or making a judgment on a 50-50 balance. In law, the two words are largely synonymous, more or less. We want to use phrases that are used elsewhere in the law, which will be clearer to the courts. It is a fairly straightforward proposition: we can rely on the view of Lord Woolf and Sir Richard Scott that they are equivalent. We can say that in law they are more or less equivalent and that is the judgment that we reached. As ``prejudice'' is used in other legislation, we decided that it was a much better word to use than ``harm''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> My hon. Friend can see where I am trying—deliberately—to lead him. As the hon. Member for Ryedale said, the word, and comparable phrases throughout the Bill, are important because of the way in which the harm, or prejudice, test will be interpreted. The Under-Secretary can see that I am leading him towards Pepper v. Hart.
<P>
I was a little concerned that my hon. Friend's words are less than crystal clear. I wrote them down; he said that the two words are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``largely synonymous, more or less''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not terribly helpful in terms of Pepper v. Hart. My hon. Friend seems to be moving to and fro; he says that the Government are happy to rely on Sir Richard, but Sir Richard says that there is no difference between ``prejudice'' and ``harm''. When my hon. Friend was asked about that point, he said that the Government preferred ``prejudice'' for reasons that were perfectly clear and honourable.
<P>
When the Bill becomes law and is applied in the light of the Under-Secretary's remark about effectiveness, I am not sure whether it will be more or less easy to extract information depending on whether ``prejudice'' or ``harm'' is used.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I do not want to count the number of angels on a pinhead, but I do want to ensure that my hon. Friend is clear. I also want to be specific about what the words mean. I am satisfied that, in the context of the Bill, the word ``prejudice'' will be interpreted as the word ``harm''. I hope that that is clear enough.
<P>
In terms of the word ``prejudice'', a lawyer's interpretation of a word must always depend on its context. ``Prejudice'' may mean harm, but it may also, in other contexts, mean discriminate. It may mean particular things, depending on its context. I do not want to put a gloss on the words used by Sir Richard Scott, but that might be what he meant. He was saying that the words were equivalent. We should be careful not to create distinctions that do not exist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen O'Brien </B>(Eddisbury): When I started to listen to the Under-Secretary's reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale, I thought that the subject would not be difficult to understand, but it has become increasingly confusing. I am still a solicitor on the roll, although I have not practised for 10 years—I am a lawyer manqué. From what the hon. Gentleman said, and from the Select Committee report and broad common sense, it seems that ``harm'' and ``prejudice'' may be broadly equivalent. However, the Under-Secretary used the phrase ``largely synonymous, more or less''.
<P>
The difficulty is, for whom the Bill is intended? Is it intended for lawyers and courts, to serve as a charter for those wishing to take defensive points and to prosecute their rights? Is it, instead, for people, with accessibility as its purpose? If the Minister's original response is correct—that ``prejudice'' and ``harm'' are synonymous and are so understood—``harm'' would be a more accessible word, as people know what it means. If he is so convinced that there is no difference—his final point was that that was so, especially in the context of the Bill—why does he worry about substituting ``prejudice'' with ``harm''? It would surely be better to begin by using ``harm'' and to let the lawyers worry about the word. It is simple and single in meaning, as Sir Richard Scott said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The words ``prejudice'' and ``harm'' are, in our view, more or less synonymous, depending on the context in which they are used. I have already noted that they could mean ``discriminate'' in one context and simply ``harm'' in another. There is no doubt what they mean here—it is straightforward. If the hon. Gentleman is confused, it is because he is confusing himself ``Prejudice'' should be interpreted as being more or less synonymous with ``harm''. There is no doubt, confusion or difference of substance on the matter, if I may use ``substance'' in a better context than others have sought to use it.
<P>
``Prejudice'' is a straightforward word. The hon. Gentleman asked why it should be used rather than ``harm''. I thought that I had explained that. ``Prejudice'' is known to law, has a clear heritage in case law, and the courts can interpret it far more easily than words not so broadly used. We have therefore decided that ``prejudice'' would be easier to interpret than ``harm''. That it has been so easy to enter into such angels on a pin head discussions in Committee shows that we have rightly chosen to use ``prejudice'', which is used in many other Acts.
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman looks at the diagrams opposite paragraph 65 of the Select Committee report, he will see references to other Acts. I have identified the vital ones as being the Taxes Management Act 1970, as amended by section 252 of the Finance Act 1994, and section 2 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981. Those Acts make straightforward use of ``prejudice'' or ``prejudiced''—the use can be understood in the context. There ought to be no confusion about the context in which ``prejudice'' is applied in the Bill. Nothing would be added or taken away by including the word ``harm''. We would just create additional confusion by introducing a word that some courts might think meant something different from ``prejudice''. In fact, we intend the word to be used in precisely the same way as the word ``prejudice'' is used throughout other legislation. It should be used in context, but also used to mean ``harm''.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has been notably patient and good-humoured about the Committee's attempts to clarify the issue. I think that he will agree that it is an important matter to clarify. I have followed the waxing and waning of the discussion, in which there have been occasional glimpses of clarity and transparency. My hon. Friend said how he thought the courts would interpret the word, but just as I thought the matter was becoming a little clearer, the clouds rolled forward and the whole issue became more opaque—the words ``I trust I make myself obscure'' come to mind. I am sure that that is not my hon. Friend's intention, but I suspect that the Government's intention and its interpretation by the commissioner and the courts will need to be explored further at a later stage because we have probably taken it as far as we can today. That is not a criticism of my hon. Friend, who has done his best to try to help the Committee.
<P>
May I take my hon. Friend back to an earlier exchange? We shall need to look at Hansard when it is published, but I took down my hon. Friend's words carefully. I thought that he said, ``If prejudice is caused, she, the commissioner, can recommend disclosure.'' If I am right and that is what my hon. Friend said, it seems that clause 24 provides exactly the opposite, and that if prejudice is caused, the exemption will apply. We cannot explore that now because it hinges on what my hon. Friend said and what was reported in Hansard, but it is rather an important point because one is almost exactly the opposite of the other.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Given the fog that has rolled through my hon. Friend's understanding of the issue, perhaps I should repeat what I said for the sake of clarity. I believe the matter is straightforward and simple. In any event, let me deal with the slightly more complex point about the commissioner's powers. If the commissioner forms a view that the disclosure of information will not prejudice the matter specified, the commissioner can order disclosure. It is the commissioner and the tribunal, not the authority, who have the final say on prejudice. It is important not to conflate the powers under clause 13 and the powers relating to whether an exemption applies. The commissioner can decide whether prejudice would be caused, and if she thinks it would not be, she can order disclosure. What constitutes prejudice in any case is a matter for the commissioner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> That is helpful. I am almost certain that my hon. Friend's first explanation omitted the word ``not''. Of course, that is a crucial distinction. If what he has just said is what the Government intend, I accept it, although I am not entirely happy with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> When I came to the Committee this morning, I was not at all convinced where our deliberations would end, but I hoped that it might be at a more finite position than we have reached. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, who, in many respects, has supported what I have been trying to achieve, which I appreciate, said that the Under-Secretary had done his best. I agree with that. I have also tried to do my best to argue that the Bill is seen by those who take an interest in such matters as being inadequate and a huge disappointment following the Government's promises. We tabled these amendments to enable the Committee to discuss whether the word ``harm'' is preferable to the word ``prejudice''. I hear all that the Under-Secretary has said about what is and is not legally acceptable, and the case of Pepper v. Hart has been mentioned, but I want to make two points against the Under-Secretary's argument. First, he cannot cherry pick the bits of the Select Committee's report that he likes and ignore the bits that he does not like—

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. David Lock):</B> Of course he can.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Well, fine, but in terms of the intellectual argument, he weakens his position by doing so. Lord Woolf said that ``prejudice'' and ``harm'' are much the same, but he went on to say some pretty scathing things about other words used in the Bill. At the end of paragraph 66, in relation to the words ``likely to prejudice'', Lord Woolf said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Does it mean `likely to rain' . . . If `prejudice' is the appropriate word, surely the issue is whether some interest would be prejudiced, and the word `likely' can be somewhat weasel.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Select Committee's report is riddled with criticisms of the Government's position. I do not want to prolong the argument, but, in the context of Pepper v. Hart, Lord Lester also made it clear that the Government should say precisely what they mean. The law should state what the law is intended to mean, not what Ministers say it means during the course of parliamentary proceedings.
<P>
I have already said that I hoped that we might have reached a more definitive view of the matter than we have. We understand the Under-Secretary's argument, which I anticipated correctly in my earlier remarks, but I do not think that what he has said will settle the matter one way or the other and we shall have to return to the question when we debate the matter on the Floor of the House. If ``prejudice'' and ``harm'' mean the same thing, why not use the term ``harm'', as my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) said? Yet the Under-Secretary went on to say that ``prejudice'' can have different meanings whereas ``harm'' cannot.
<P>
Apart from making the general observation that we think that the prejudice test is too weak, we want to emphasise what we believe the Bill needs to convey—not to the lawyers, who will have the paradise of yet more legislation to give them a field day and the opportunity to eke out fat fees, because that is not the issue—
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Let me finish first. The issue is how the people in the public authorities—the hundreds of public authorities listed at the back of the Bill—who do not have access to Treasury solicitors and Treasury counsel, and the individuals who are seeking information, will interpret the legislation. We believe that ``harm'' is more meaningful to both of those groups than the word ``prejudice''. What we believe the Government should be doing, and what the Minister failed to do in response to my earlier comments, is to signal that they mean that serious damage would be done if information were released. We shall have to go away and find another phrase to create the higher hurdle of serious damage. According to the Under-Secretary, that is not achieved by ``harm'', but we do not think that ``prejudice'' is any better. We do not have a meeting of minds on the word that should be used or the extent of the damage that could be caused if information was released.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I sought to intervene merely to draw attention to our amusement at seeing the discomfort on the face of the hon. Member for Eddisbury as he reflected on what the hon. Member for Ryedale said about fat fees.
<P>
The public will interpret the law as they always do, based on its meaning as expressed by judges in court. We have spent nearly an hour discussing the meaning of words that are, by and large, synonymous. I am not sure whether Wittgenstein would think that a desirable philosophical approach to legislation, but no doubt Oliver Wendel Holmes and other jurisprudence specialists would find our debate mainly a waste of time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That is where I seriously part company with the Under-Secretary. We have not spent 55 minutes merely debating, from an academic standpoint, whether harm is different or preferable to prejudice. Opposition Members and, to an extent, the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, have explored what the Government intend the damage, prejudice or harm to be. That is what lies behind the amendment. It is the crux of content-based exemptions. The Under-Secretary has not given a satisfactory response. We shall press our concerns again but, in the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed. That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We are concerned about the wording of the clause, although we accept the need for an exemption for defence. In response to the Under-Secretary's point on the commissioner's powers, there is clearly disagreement on how public authorities will interpret the word ``prejudice''. Will he circulate a note to the Committee explaining how the Bill gives the commissioner a power to judge whether prejudice and the expectation of prejudice have been properly interpreted?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful for that assurance. If the note arrives in time to be used against the relevant clauses, it will benefit the Committee. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 89, in page 13, line 27, after `section', insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and subject to subsection (3A) below'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 90, in page 13, line 31, at end insert— 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) For the purposes of this section, information which has been obtained from a state, organisation or court more than 12 months before— 
<P>
(a) the date of receipt of the request under section 1(1), or (if later),
<P>
(b) the date on which the consent under this subsection was last sought from that state, organisation or court in relation to that information,
<P>
shall not be confidential unless the public authority which holds it has sought the consent of that state, organisation or court for its disclosure under this Act and consent has been refused'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Amendment No. 89 is a paving amendment for amendment No. 90, which is the substantive amendment to the clause. The clause deals with information that is exchanged between different countries and their Governments. From my limited experience of dealing with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office over the past couple of years, I appreciate that there is hardly a Department of State that is more likely to declare information exempt from disclosure on the grounds that it will prejudice some intent—a view that the rest of us would rarely share—in terms of its relationship with other countries.
<P>
Clause 25 introduces two exemptions to make good that position. The first exempts information from disclosure if it prejudices the British Government's relations with other Governments or international bodies, or British interests abroad. The amendment, however, relates to the second exemption, which covers ``confidential'' information that is supplied by one of those bodies. We accept that, if confidential information is supplied by another Government or an international body, it is necessary to maintain confidentiality when the information is passed on. Without that, it would be difficult to sustain diplomatic relations. 
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Where we part company with the Bill is that it does not provide a closure to that process. Once information is declared confidential, it will remain confidential for ever and a day. Real life is not like that. What is confidential at one time may be common knowledge later, but there is no test for a Department or any other public body to determine whether information is still confidential when it decides not to disclose it. There are many circumstances in which that could arise. Indeed, it is a commonly held view that to discover the British Government's position on an international matter, it is best to ask another country, especially one with more advanced freedom of information legislation. When the Foreign and Commonwealth Office or another Department happily say that it would be a massive breach of security and confidentiality to disclose a simple piece of information, the information in question is often on the internet. It must be accepted that, as time moves on, it might be appropriate for information to become available.
<P>
The wording of the clause is also worth considering. Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``while the circumstances in which it was obtained make it reasonable for the State, organisation or court''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
from which the information was obtained—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to expect that it will be so held.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The right to withhold information is not a matter of the other party—the state, organisation or court—clearly determining that information is confidential, but of a public body in this country guessing that it might be confidential. The test is an assumption rather than an assertion of confidentiality. My experience is that that will be used when someone thinks that information might be embarrassing rather than when it is genuinely confidential.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The word ``reasonable'' is in the clause and we have discussed its meaning, which is well known in law. The hon. Gentleman is devaluing it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am not devaluing the word ``reasonable''. There are many circumstances in which it could be reasonably assumed that a body might want information to be confidential, even though that preference is not substantiated by fact. A good example of that is the Prison Service, of which the Under-Secretary has some knowledge, which was investigated by the parliamentary ombudsman. Material relating to a prisoner transferred from a foreign country to this country was declared not to be available on the grounds of confidentiality, although the country in which that prisoner had been held had no objection to the information being released. It was merely an assumption by a British department—the Prison Service—that the other country would not want to release the information. That is a concrete example of a circumstance in which, under the Bill, there would be a reasonable assumption that the material was confidential, as many foreign countries are sensitive about matters relating to their prison services, but it was not. In fact, as the parliamentary ombudsman found, there was no prejudice to the other country or to the Prison Service in releasing the information.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Information on prisoners is sometimes withheld in respect of their privacy and sometimes in relation to the confidentiality of the Prison Service operations. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that, in the case that he cited, the argument advanced depended exclusively on the view of the other country concerned?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> That is precisely the circumstance that I have in mind. I do not want to go into details about something that is intended only as an illustration but, in this case, the Prison Service raised many objections to disclosure, one of which was that the file included inter governmental consultation. It was considered to have fallen within a code exemption for information received in confidence from foreign Governments. In that case, the Prison Service had not asked the other Government, but the ombudsman did. The ombudsman filled in the gap. His report stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``My investigation has revealed that the foreign government have no objection to the disclosure to Mr. G''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the complainant in the case—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``of any of the information they sent to the Prison Service about his transfer. Whether or not the information was considered to be confidential before Mr. G's transfer, it seems to me that the foreign government's comments, which I very much welcome, are an indication that confidentiality is no longer an issue. In my view, therefore, there is no information on the file which can be withheld under this exemption.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is document HC438 of May 1999 and concerns the case A.15/99.
<P>
I have been prompted by the Under-Secretary to go further than I would otherwise have done to explain the circumstances of the case. It is a good illustration of a circumstance in which all that was needed was for the Government Department to ask whether the information sought was confidential material. The response in this case would clearly have been no, it is not. In which case, it could have released, as the parliamentary ombudsman found. 
<P>
The amendment simply states that, after 12 months have elapsed, the question must be asked whether material that is exempt on the grounds of confidentiality is still confidential. We accept that there may be an interval in which that is not appropriate, but 12 months is a reasonable period of time. If the reply is yes, it is clearly exempt material under the Bill. If the answer is, ``No, there is absolutely no problem from our end,'' why should not a British citizen have access to the information? It is a simple response. If the Government say that the material remains confidential, consent could not be sought for at least another year. There is thus a further proviso.
<P>
The amendment is sensible; it would ensure that we do not accidentally exempt material for which there is no reason for an exemption simply on grounds of an assumed confidentiality on the part of a country that has not been consulted on the matter. I should be interested in the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman tells us that there is too much secrecy in Whitehall and I agree, that is why we need a freedom of information Act.
<P>
He tells me that the Foreign Office is particularly at fault. There are legitimate areas in which the Foreign Office needs to maintain confidentiality, but I would not exclude it from the Government's broader view that there is too much secrecy in Whitehall. The Foreign Office must open up a bit more, as all Departments and, indeed, all public authorities, should do.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 89 and 90 appear to be inspired by the Campaign for Freedom of Information. They were drafted with the intention that information obtained in confidence from another state, international body or court would remain confidential for 12 months from the date on which it was supplied. Thereafter, the authority could refuse a request only if it had sought the consent of the state for disclosure and that consent had been refused, as stated in paragraph (a) of the amendment. Paragraph (b) is intended to ensure that such a refusal would remain valid for a further 12 months. The net effect of the amendment would therefore be that information obtained in confidence from another state or another international organisation would not be disclosable under the Bill for as long as that other state or international organisation chose for it to be withheld. Depending on the frequency of requests, authorities could be required to ascertain the views of the state every 12 months. In that way, the confidentiality of the information would have to be continually renewed.
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary insofar as it is designed to ensure that information that was once confidential does not remain so for all time. The Bill as drafted already provides adequately for the situation that it is intended to address. Clause 25(3) states that such information is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``confidential at any time while the terms on which it was obtained require it to be held in confidence or while the circumstances in which it was obtained make it reasonable for the State, organisation or court to expect that it will be so held.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
By referring to the terms on which it was obtained, the provision is intended to ensure that any restrictions or embargoes put on the information by the other state or international organisation, and the time in which they are to be effective, are already taken into account by the authority that receives it. Moreover, if no such term was clearly expressed, the Bill provides that the authority may claim that the information is confidential only if it is reasonable in the circumstances to do so. ``Reasonable'' is a word known to the court.
<P>
Thus the clause as drafted already takes account of any time limits that states may wish to place on the release of information. Crucially, it relies on what is reasonable when such terms are not expressly given. The fact that the circumstances surrounding the information have changed to such an extent that it is no longer confidential will be taken into account by the authorities. In addition, the Secretary of State's code of practice will include guidance to authorities on the appropriateness of consulting those whose information relates to, or who would be affected by, its disclosure. That ensures that the sort of consultations that the amendment requires will happen when they are appropriate. Such consultations already take place when Departments and others deal with requests for information. If they are appropriate.
<P>
The amendment would create other difficulties, which the hon. Gentleman has not fully considered. First, it is not always appropriate, nor possible, to seek the consent of other states when considering whether to disclose information that they have supplied. For example, the United Kingdom may have broken off relations with another state, or relationships may be hostile. It would then not be possible to ``consult'' the state or international organisation, as the amendment would require.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Secondly, it might not be necessary to seek consent because it was patently obvious that information should be released. Working relations with a country or organisation might be so good that it was possible to know its view without further consultation; its view might have been expressed through dealings and become well known on both sides. It would then be unreasonably bureaucratic to expect the authority to seek the consent of the state on every occasion.
<P>
Thirdly, we might be dealing with many communications—perhaps with repeated exchanges occurring daily with an international organisation. Checking each piece of information with the other authority after 12 months would produce an enormous burden on it and on this country. Compliance with the amendment would prejudice international relations to some extent, as it would require another state to refuse publicly its consent for the sake of our national law—clause 15 requires authorities to give reasons for refusing a request. The hon. Gentleman must remember those points.
<P>
Fourthly, the amendment would require an answer from another state, but it does not stipulate a time limit within which the answer must be received. Consultation may require much longer than 20 days. The authority could be in breach of its obligations under clause 9 if it complied with the amendment. The amendment fails to provide for a state failing to respond at all to the request for consent. Furthermore, there is no means of enforcing the provision against other states or international organisations, because the UK cannot give the information commissioner international powers of enforcement.
<P>
Finally, the confidentiality of diplomatic relations is universally acknowledged in freedom of information legislation. However, the amendment's arrangements do not represent agreed international practice—no such provision appears in United States legislation, for example. The amendment would be unhelpful because it would place on an authority the difficult bureaucratic burden of having to seek a state's consent before disclosing information that that state had passed to it. In practice, the authority may not be able to, or may not need to, do that. It could even cause the authority to be in breach of its obligations under another part of the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman says that the public authority could guess whether the information was confidential. It may decide that information was confidential only if that decision was reasonable in all circumstances. The commissioner can consider the issue and decide that information is not held in confidence, and that she disagrees with the authority's view. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome to consider withdrawing the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I listened with care to the Under-Secretary's arguments. Most of them seemed to have been posited on information not being exempt under the Bill, and on a bureaucratic burden being placed on an authority to release information. The amendment was based on the contrary view—the aim was to ensure that information that should not be exempt would not be exempt.
<P>
The Under-Secretary suggested a situation in which there were good communications between states and in which information could clearly be reasonably released. There would be no problem and no bureaucratic burden in such a situation. Difficulties would occur when the British public body determined that the material had to remain confidential. I do not entirely follow the Under-Secretary's argument that the Bill already places on an authority a sufficiently clear duty to ensure that matters remain confidential. I understood him to say that the interpretation of clause 25(3), strengthened by the guidance notes provided, is that an authority must take reasonable care to ensure that the material that it is proposing to declare exempt is still confidential. The subsection implies a duty to elicit whether that is so, or at least to consider the circumstances in which confidentiality was applied and whether they still pertain.
<P>
If my understanding is correct, it would be far better for the duty to be explicit rather than implicit. If it is not correct, I should like to know how a body in this country might determine whether the circumstances still apply except by asking. The amendment's simple proposition is that a party proposing to maintain confidentiality should be required to ask. There would be no such requirement if that was not proposed, if circumstances had changed, if the British position was clearly not prejudiced, or if material was otherwise to remain confidential under the Bill. The bureaucratic nightmare that the Under-Secretary described would not apply. The amendment would be relevant only if an applicant was told that information could not be given because it was supplied to the authority by a foreign Government under terms of confidentiality that were believed to apply still.
<P>
Continuing confidentiality will have to be assumed—it will not be known for a fact as it could be known only by making an inquiry. The Under-Secretary has not really addressed the issue. His arguments, such as the one about a foreign Government having difficulty giving reasons for maintaining confidentiality, have been spurious. Where is the provision for that in the amendment or in the Bill? There is no suggestion that a foreign Government should have a duty to give reasons for confidentiality. That they wished to maintain confidentiality under the terms by which the information was originally supplied would be sufficient.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I have been listening to the exchange with interest. Generally, the official Opposition's mind is closer to the Government's mind than to the hon. Gentleman's. The test of reasonableness seems to be a second-guess exercise, based on our Government believing that the state, organisation or court that gave information would reasonably expect it to remain confidential. I cannot imagine how the commissioner might second or third guess what people thought in such circumstances. However, as I said, I am not necessarily attempting to support the Under-Secretary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> My example concerning the parliamentary ombudsman provides the clearest illustration. He wrote to another Government to ask whether they intended the information to remain confidential, and they said no. That was not a difficult exercise. A Department or other authority would still be allowed to guess—it need not know—whether a matter should be confidential, provided that the guess was reasonable. The material might be exempt and so fall outside freedom of information rules, even though there might be no problem with its release.
<P>
I think that the Minister wanted to intervene on the terms of the reasons, but let me restate what I said. The Minister said that a foreign Government would be required to give reasons for maintaining confidentiality, but why should they do so under the Bill? The test is whether the public body has consulted that foreign Government or body and whether the response received was that the information remains confidential. No reasons need to be given for the decision. The only reason that has to be given for maintaining confidentiality is that the foreign body has been consulted and says that it wishes to maintain the confidentiality under which the original information was given. That reason will be sufficient for the law. I do not accept the Minister's reasoning on this, but I do not believe that I shall make any progress by pursuing my argument and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 67, in page 14, line 5, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`but for the purpose of subsection (2) does not include the European Union an its institutions.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In some ways, the amendment is similar to the previous one, although in other ways it is quite different because it deals with our relationship with the European Union and its institutions. I do not want to enter into a major debate on the rights or wrongs of the European Union, but the EU is not the most transparent institution in the world and frequently applies confidentiality to matters to which it is wholly inappropriate to do so. Secrecy is often applied for want of any better course to follow.
<P>
Amendment No. 67 would remove the automatic protection under clause 25(2) relating to information supplied in confidence by the European Commission and other EU institutions. In other words, it would not be sufficient for the European Commission or European Council, or any other European body, simply to stamp ``confidential'' across the top of a document to make it exempt under the terms of the British freedom of information Act. The amendment would maintain the exemption for cases in which the disclosure of information would prejudice relations between the United Kingdom and the European Union or another state. That test would remain because we accept that, for diplomatic reasons, there will be circumstances in which it is not appropriate to release material.
<P>
I am not alone in being concerned about the innate secrecy of European Union institutions. Other exemptions exist elsewhere in the Bill. For example, a separate exemption in clause 39 exempts confidential communications between domestic public authorities, but it should not be possible for that exemption to be evoked simply by writing ``confidential'' at the top of a document. The document must have been obtained in circumstances that impose a legal obligation of confidentiality on the recipient.
<P>
That is not the case under clause 25(2). All that is necessary is for the United Kingdom Government to assume that the European Commission expected the information to be held in confidence. We know from recent experience that the European Commission and the Council of Ministers, both of which are subject to EU disclosure rules, have frequently been found to be in breach of those rules. The fact that they have been brought within the disclosure rules has only served to highlight their excessive secrecy. Of the nine cases so far decided by the European Court of Justice, the decision to withhold information has been upheld in only two. That illustrates how European Union institutions work.
<P>
In a case involving the Swedish journalist trade union magazine, Journalisten, the journalists applied under Swedish freedom of information legislation for a set of 20 European Union documents, mainly dealing with discussions on the Europol convention—I remember discussing the Europol convention in this Room, or one very similar, some time ago—which, at the time, had not been finalised. Sweden's Ministry of Justice and police authority released 18 of the 20 documents, but when the magazine applied to Brussels for the same documents under the EU Council of Ministers' transparency rules, only four were handed over. The decision was later challenged in the European Court of Justice, which noted:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The first reply from the Council, sent to the applicant in French although the applicant had written the initial request in German, confined itself to citing [all the exemptions] in support of its view that the documents were subject to the `principle of confidentiality'.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The court later found that the Council had responded to the requests in such inadequate terms that it was unable to judge whether the tests laid down in the Council's own rules had been applied at all. It ruled that the Council's decision,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must therefore be annulled without there being any need to consider the other grounds raised by the applicant or to look at the contents of the documents themselves.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
That is the purest possible illustration of the fact that a simple assertion on the part of an EU institution cannot be held to be sufficient grounds for material to be exempt under the Bill, yet that is precisely the situation that would apply under the Bill at the moment. The amendment would remove that, although it would retain the rights of authorities not to disclose information where it would lead to prejudice. It would not allow that blanket assertion of secrecy, which, I regret, has become the trademark of too many European institutions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This is a tempting amendment, especially from the standpoint of the Conservative party, and it crossed my mind to table such an amendment. I wonder what effect that would have had and what accusations would have been levelled against me about which side of the European argument I was on. Of course, the credentials of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome are impeccable, given his stance on the European question. Therefore, I suspect that no one would accuse him—
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that he should not necessarily confuse the Liberal Democrat's position on Europe with my own.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That is an important intervention, which we might wish to explore on another occasion, but which I shall not do so now or I might incur your wrath, Dr. Clark. I shall be brief because I hope to catch your eye during the clause stand part debate.
<P>
I wish to consider two or three questions raised by the amendment. First, the code included an absolute exemption for information received in confidence from foreign Governments, courts or international organisations. To that extent, the Bill replicates the code, and as we are keen for that to be the case, it would be churlish to start proposing amendments that would undermine that position.
<P>
Secondly, we belong to many international organisations other than the European Union, but the amendment singles out the European Union. I understand why that is and shall say in a moment what I believe the Government need to think about in that respect. However, there are other organisations, for example, NATO and the World Trade Organisation.
<P>
I suspect that you, Dr. Clark, have also received letters from constituents who are worried about issues that relate to the World Trade Organisation. It is not just the EU that would be affected. There might be cause to consider whether the blanket exemption should apply in other circumstances.
<P>
Where we have difficulty with the amendment is that the information that the international organisation holds may have been provided in confidence by another Government who is a member of that organisation. In respect of the EU, let us consider the recent dioxin scare in Belgium which arose from the contamination of animal feedstuffs. It is reasonable to argue, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome does, that information that should be in the public domain should not be held back. But the amendment would allow information about the dioxin scare that was supplied to the Commission by the Belgian Government to be passed on to the British Government, thereby compromising the confidentiality that exists between the Belgian Government and the European Commission. The Under-Secretary will probably use that argument to resist the amendment, but that does not mean that there is no element of concern to justify the amendment's objective.
<P>
I should like the Under-Secretary to consider the extent to which the Bill applies to European institutions. I suspect that there is a world of difference between information that the European Commission holds, which was provided in confidence by another member state and therefore covered by the general blanket of confidentiality, and information that it holds but which it passes on to our Government, possibly under the cloak of confidentiality, about which people in this country have a right to know. Information that is held by the Commission comes under a number of categories, depending on its source and nature. I accept that there is an argument for some confidentiality. That is partly why we decided not to support the amendment or table a similar amendment; we are trying to be responsible. Given the extent to which European institutions rule our lives, I want a reassurance that, in general, the Government expect the information that they hold in relation to their dealings with the EU to be freely available, within the spirit of the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that we are being irresponsible. Earlier provisions of the clause would apply. Material that would prejudice relations between the United Kingdom and another member state of the EU would remain exempt. His concern is not relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is right. The earlier part of the clause has a prejudicial test. Subsections (2) and (3) are a clear class exemption. No test is required. They relate to information that is provided in confidence. I would support the argument that confidentiality should not be used as a potential cloak for the release of information to the public domain if it would have been released under the Bill were it of the type and nature that is held by our Government or public authorities. That would be undesirable and I am not convinced that it is what the Government intend. Although I accept that there is an issue, the problem with exempting all material from EU institutions that has been given in confidence is that it could compromise confidentiality with other member states. Information might not be given by member states to the Commission because that confidentiality could be breached.
<P>
I hope that I have made our position clear. Although we support the need for a confidentiality exemption, we share the anxiety that the exemption—given that it has statutory force—should not be used to sustain the general culture of secrecy that people perceive exists within many EU institutions. With so many exchanges between those institutions, especially the Commission, and our Government, confidentiality is used more often than it should be to deny the release of information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> This is another amendment that has been inspired by the Campaign for Freedom of Information. The hon. Member for Ryedale and I share common ground, which is surprising on European matters, and we broadly agree on how we should approach the clause. There is a need for greater openness in the way in which the EU deals with member states and informs people who live within them about its activities. The dearth of information does not help the EU or its member states. The more that we can encourage the EU to be open about its activities and its relationships with member states, the better.
<P>
Amendment No. 67 would exclude confidential information from the EU from the scope of clause 25(2). Such information would therefore be protected not on the basis that it was supplied in confidence but because its disclosure would prejudice the United Kingdom's relationship with another state or the EU, as set out in clause 25(1).
<P>
However, the Bill is drafted on the understanding that freedom of information will respect duties of confidence because such disclosure will always be prejudicial. In international relations, the confidentiality of diplomatic documents is universally recognised. The removal of the presumption of this protection would itself prejudice our relations with the EU no less than with other states and organisations. There is no reason to treat the EU differently from other international organisations of which the UK may or may not be a member. Indeed, many communications between this country and EU institutions relate not only to other member states but to other states in their dealings with the EU.
<P>
If the amendment is tabled out of a concern that EU institutions are secretive, I must stress that the Bill does not automatically exempt documents from other states or organisations. Clause 25(2) applies only if the terms on which the information has been obtained require it to be held in confidence, or where the circumstances make it reasonable for the state or organisation—in this case the European Union—to expect that it be so held. Plainly, if the information has not been passed in confidence, or it is not reasonable for the organisation to expect that it is to be so held, the information is not exempt under clause 25(2).
<P>
Moreover, clause 13 will apply to such information, which means that the authority holding it will have to consider whether the public interest in disclosure would outweigh the public interest in maintaining the exemption for the sake of international relations. When it is in the public interest, information contained in EU documents, or documents from any other state or organisation for that matter, should therefore be disclosed.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Finally, the EU itself is committed, so we hear, to increased openness by virtue of article 255 of the Amsterdam treaty. Implementation of this article will mean that more documents relating to the working of the EU will be disclosed by EU institutions themselves. The United Kingdom Government are looking forward to seeing proposals from the Commission. We want to ensure that there is more openness in the EU.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale rightly asked that we consider how the Bill will affect that openness, and, more important, how we will ensure that the EU is more open about its dealings. The Bill cannot increase the openness of the EU because it relates to domestic matters, but in our discussion of article 255 of the Amsterdam treaty and in terms of our relationships with the EU, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we must press forward with an agenda that will ensure that the EU adopts a policy of greater openness in its dealings with this country and other member states and informs citizens of the European Union what it is doing in their name.
<P>
I hope that with that reassurance, the hon. Gentleman will feel able to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The Under-Secretary is still conflating two concepts: first, that of the diplomatic traffic which it is right should remain confidential and for which the Bill should provide exemptions, and, secondly, the many documents printed and published by the European Union which are kept confidential for no reason other than that it has become practice to do so. I think that the Minister is saying that the discretion to release information in the public interest will overlay the clause, and that is right. However, we need clear guidance, in the notes if the Minister does not accept the amendment, that the labelling of material as confidential by European Union institutions must be critically exempt to see whether that is a material problem in terms of the Government or of British bodies that are trying to apply the legislation.
<P>
One matter that should be brought into that consideration is whether material is confidential within the European Union's own disclosure rules. The experience is that often material is labelled as confidential in breach of the disclosure rules that have been negotiated through the Amsterdam treaty and elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I see the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. Yes, the Bill will apply in the way in which we both agree, although he would wish to go further. There is a need, as he said, to get the EU to be more open, but the Bill is not the mechanism by which we could achieve it. The way to do so is by implementing article 255 of the Amsterdam treaty and it is for the EU to change its institutions and approach. We seek, as a matter of policy, to encourage the EU to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary. He and I want to achieve the same ends; I see the British legislation as one means by which British citizens can apply that process. I do not entirely accept the concept that the European Union will change its approach, although it is inching in that direction. The Statewatch organisation, of which the Minister may be aware, monitors secrecy within the EU. It applied for documents covered by the access rules from Brussels and was told that they could not be sent to it. Statewatch was told that a representative had to go to Brussels in person in order to see them. That is an illustration of the obstacles that are placed in the way of those who seek information and who are at present pressing for disclosure by European institutions. The Bill is part of domestic legislation that could provide a lever to assist British citizens to apply pressure on European institutions.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We are not far apart; it is a matter of means rather than ends. We want to use mechanisms within the European Union to encourage more openness. It is a multilateral approach, rather than the unilateral approach that the hon. Gentleman proposes, whereby the Bill would be used to prise open doors which perhaps the EU institutions and other member states may not be ready to open just yet. We may have to do some more convincing. We want to convince the EU; the hon. Gentleman wants to be more forceful. Our approach will probably secure the best long-term results, but we are not far apart in any event.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Again, I am grateful to the Under-Secretary. If we apply a large jemmy rather than waiting for someone to open the door, that is simply a difference in approach. It would be helpful if, the guidance notes to authorities stated that there was an explicit view that a European Union labelling of confidentiality should not be taken at face value. There should be some consideration of whether it is appropriate within the European Union disclosure rules. The public interest test, which is elsewhere in the Bill, should be applied. That would be helpful in assisting public bodies to discharge their functions properly within the Bill. I will leave that thought with the Minister. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I do not want to labour the point, but clause 25 will exempt information that is likely to prejudice not just relations between the United Kingdom and another state, or between the United Kingdom and any international organisation or court. That closely reflects what is in the code, but it goes on to exempt two other broad categories. It was tempting to table an amendment to delete subsection (1)(c) and (d), but I did not want such an amendment to be interpreted as irresponsible. It is better to discuss such matters in the clause stand part debate. Can the Minister explain why the Government sought to extend what is in the code to include the two very broad phrases
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the interests of the United Kingdom abroad''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``promotion or protection by the United Kingdom of its interests abroad''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
First, how wide is the definition ``United Kingdom'' meant to be? I assume that it means rather more than just the Government of the United Kingdom, and includes any commercial interest, or the interest of any individual citizen of the United Kingdom. I suspect that being in Opposition is different from being in Government and one can make all kinds of comments that might be seen as out of character with what one might have said when one was in government. However, the question that immediately came to mind on reading this was the vexed issue of arms sales in other countries and information relating to the sale of armaments or, as in Sierra Leone, the training of mercenaries. Putting aside the fact that we do not think that the prejudicial test is strong enough, given that it is a prejudicial test contents exemption, which widely relies on the phrases,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``interests of the United Kingdom''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the promotion or protection by the United Kingdom of its interests abroad'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the exemption seems to provide the opportunity for civil servants—I thought that the Under-Secretary referred to the Foreign Office in slightly critical terms—to try to use the exemption more widely and beyond what the Government intend.
<P>
These are blanket exemptions. Therefore, it is right that before we send the Bill back to the House, we should try to get the Under-Secretary to say, first, why the Government thought it necessary to extend the code exemption to such an extent and, secondly, what information he believes will be caught by it. Further, can the Under-Secretary reassure the Committee that our anxiety that these blanket exemptions might be used not to free up information but to keep more information secret is unfounded? Our reading of the clause is that it provides a golden opportunity to keep information secret. It behoves the Under-Secretary to justify to the Committee the inclusion of these two broad exemptions that were not in the code but which the Government have chosen to include in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lock:</B> It is a pleasure, Dr. Clark, to be in a Committee under your chairmanship.
<P>
I can reassure the hon. Member for Ryedale that interests referred to in clause 25(1)(c) and (d) relate to information held by public authorities because the Bill relates to public authorities, not to the commercial interests or activities of any individual or company in the United Kingdom. Therefore, it is concerned with the interests of UK public authorities working abroad to promote the interests of the United Kingdom. Clearly, that is a broad category, but it does not mean that every document concerning the activities of the United Kingdom promoting Britain would be caught. Only documents that would prejudice those interests will be caught, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman would agree that any document that seeks to prejudice the interests of this country abroad is not a document that he would think should be disclosed—although there may come a time when whatever it is that would cause prejudice would no longer cause prejudice and it would be proper for the document to be disclosed at a later date.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary explained, clause 13 would also apply. Therefore, it would be open to any individual who seeks the disclosure of that document to go to the Information Commissioner and argue that there was no prejudice. If the Information Commissioner agreed, she would be entitled to compel disclosure. Even if disclosure would lead to prejudice, if it was in the public interest she could make a recommendation.
<P>
Paragraphs (c) and (d) of subsection (1) cover the interests of the UK abroad and the protection or promotion of those interests. For example, if the UK was planning a major trade offensive in another country, they would prevent premature disclosure of that fact and of its details. The Department of Trade and Industry might promote such an initiative, but these days the regions play an important role in promotion. In my region, west midlands enterprise frequently promotes our manufacturing industry abroad. It would be inappropriate for details of a promotion to be made available in advance if the authority planning the promotion, using public money, felt that that was not in its interests.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister seemed to suggest that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the interests of the United Kingdom abroad''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
relate only to the interests of UK public authorities abroad.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> No, these are documents held by public authorities—the Bill covers only public authorities. A major trade promotion of, for example, west midlands manufacturing would be pursued with private sector manufacturers and would be designed primarily to benefit those manufacturers and their workers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am even more confused now, and I think that we will have to think again. The Minister confirms that the clause covers only documents held by UK public authorities abroad, but those documents may relate to arms sales and the training of mercenaries. We have no difficulty with his example of a trade fair, but the clause's two blanket exemptions catch much more than the Government intend. I hope that the Minister will agree to try to find a form of words that more accurately reflects the Government's intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not confuse my examples for the definition. I gave the example of a document being held by a public authority in relation to a trade offensive, but I did not intend to imply that that document is limited. The Bill applies to information and I did not intend to limit its scope by reference to only one example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I understand that ``documents'' are information, but are we talking only about information held by UK public authorities abroad? If so, I hope that the Minister will try to draft a form of words that makes that clearer. Without our exchange of views, I am not sure that any of us not privy to briefings by Home Office officials would have been clear about the meaning of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the interests of the United Kingdom abroad''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He has given us a more restrictive interpretation of the subsection.
<P>
We have a difficulty with the wording. Given the extremely topical events to which I have referred, other hon. Members may seek to challenge on Report whether information relating to issues such as arms sales might be exempted unless the wording is altered. We must all think the matter through further. The purpose of the debate is to probe the Government's intentions. What the Minister has said does not settle the issue—it might resolve what the Government intend, but not what is conveyed by the wording.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> The hon. Gentleman referred to information held abroad. However, the situation will generally not concern information held abroad but that held by British public authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I entirely understand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> In response, I should say only that arms sales would be covered if they were sufficiently significant as to affect the UK's interests, rather than those of a private company. There is an exemption under clause 41 for information concerning trade secrets or that which prejudices someone's commercial interests. Clause 25 considers the much narrower issue of the UK's interests abroad. In addition, it deals with information held predominantly by public authorities in this country, although some may hold information abroad. That is the answer to the hon. Gentleman's concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I should not press the Parliamentary Secretary further because the Committee can judge for itself the explanations, which confirm my worst fears. The Government must re-examine the matter and I would be astounded if, following the exchange, they did not do so. However, we shall not seek for now to block such an important clause from standing part.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 25 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 26</center></H4>
<H4><center>Relations within the United Kingdom</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 130, in page 14, line 12 after `Kingdom' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(or other relevant administration)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 131, in page 14, line 17, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) ``Other relevant administration'' means the administrations of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We like this clause even less than the two subsections to which I have already referred. It might be convenient if I address our general concerns about the clause during the stand part debate.
<P>
Amendment No. 130 is effectively a paving amendment for amendment No. 131. The clause grants an exemption for relations between the new administrative bodies established in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales and any other such administration.
<P>
It seeks to exempt any information between those administrations that might be prejudicial. It does not include, however, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands. We suspect that they are excluded because they are not part of the United Kingdom; nevertheless, disclosure could affect relations between those administrations and other governing bodies. Were relations between the four UK administrations and the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands thought to require inclusion in the exemption? That said, we are not entirely happy with the exemption in any event.
<P>
Hon. Members will be aware of the recent tragic fishing accident with the Solway Harvester in the Irish sea. The Manx authorities are considering whether they can help the Scottish Parliament and the community in Galloway, which the tragedy affected so badly. That shows that there may be occasions when the administrations of the Isle of Man, of the Channel Islands or of the four Parliaments should be part of the exemption.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Amendments Nos. 130 and 131 would extend the scope of clause 26 to include the administrations of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. The clause exempts information if disclosure would, or would be likely to, prejudice relations between any administration within the United Kingdom.
<P>
On this occasion, I think that the hon. Member for Ryedale has got the wrong end of the bailiwick. The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are not, technically, part of the United Kingdom but are self-governing Crown dependencies. The UK is responsible for their external relations and defence. The islands count as ``other states'' for the purposes of clause 25, and relations with the insular authority are given the protection of international relations.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ryedale for tabling the amendments because it has given me the opportunity to explain where they fit into the scheme of freedom of information. I assure him that they have not been overlooked, and I hope that I have so put his mind at rest that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We have had a worthwhile exchange. I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We do not like the clause. Communications between Westminster and the devolved nations should be as open as possible. The Conservative party fought long and hard during debates on the devolution proposals to ensure that the concordats—the agreements that govern relations between Westminster and the devolved bodies—were published.
<P>
Other documents that govern relations between the four bodies should be readily available and not shrouded in secrecy. Any information that would be truly damaging and harmful, as opposed to a perception that it might damage reputations, would probably be covered by the exemption in clause 33. Clause 26 is a mopping-up device to ensure that as much information as possible is covered by the exemption.
<P>
The Government claim that the Bill creates a new culture of freedom of information—an end to the culture of secrecy. Only as recently as the past 18 months have these new organisations been created, and, sadly, the position in Northern Ireland is still tenuous. The clause, however, harks back to the bad old ways on which the Government claim to be turning their back.
<P>
<H5>12.45pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We shall not seek to divide the Committee—we simply do not have the numbers to make that worthwhile—but I hope that my remarks leave the Minister in no doubt that we are deeply cynical about the clause. We do not believe that it is justified. Matters that need to be covered by exemptions could be covered by other exemptions in the Bill, so we hope that the Minister will reflect and consider deleting the clause before Report.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> We share the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Ryedale; indeed, we tabled an amendment to delete it but it was not selected for debate. This debate offers us an opportunity to air our concerns.
<P>
What on earth is the point of the clause? I can suggest only two possible reasons for its inclusion. The first is to create work for the Advocate General—we are all puzzled about what she does to fill her time, but perhaps the clause is a useful job creation scheme. The second is to subvert the new Parliament in Scotland and the other devolved assemblies.
<P>
The clause does not seem to be based on a realistic assessment of need for additional exemptions. The Bill already provides for exempt material affecting the legislative bodies of the United Kingdom. The Parliamentary Secretary, with whom I am pleased to have my first opportunity of debating, might not have been present when we heard the rather disparaging views of the Under-Secretary on the proposed legislation of the Scottish Executive, which will eventually be laid before the Scottish Parliament. He felt that the proposals were not terribly good and that it would have a good deal of difficulty in producing a Bill. 
<P>
I do not share that view. There are significant differences between the proposals in the consultative paper ``An Open Scotland'' and in the Bill. Some of the differences are relevant to the operation of the clause and are important. We discussed the concept of substantial prejudice earlier today. The Under-Secretary dismissed ``substantial'' as having no legal meaning and not strengthening the threshold required for exempt material. The Scottish Executive does not share his view. ``An Open Scotland'' states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We propose that the harm test be demanding and that it be whether disclosure would, or would be likely to, substantially prejudice the matter set out in the exemption in question. Our use of `substantial prejudice', is intended to make clear that information covered by a content-based exemption should be disclosed unless the prejudice caused by disclosure would be real, actual and of significant substance.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Scottish Executive believes that it is applying a higher test than that proposed in the Bill. The proposed Scottish information commissioner will be able to make binding rulings, whereas the UK commissioner will be able to make only recommendations. There are different requirements for the release of factual information on policy decisions—the test of substantial prejudice to collective responsibility or frankness or candour. Under the Bill, authorities can withhold information that, in their reasonable opinion, would inhibit frank advice or prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs. The decisions would be exempt from challenge; none of the Scottish exemptions give legal weight to an authority's opinion.
<P>
I digress to consider the Scottish proposals because there is clearly the prospect of a difference in the climate of freedom of information under Scottish legislation and under the Bill. Criticisms have been made of the Scottish legislation—some of the class exemptions in the Bill have found their way into the Scottish proposals—but there is a significant difference between it and the Bill. We face the prospect of information passing almost on a one-way street between the United Kingdom Government and the administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
<P>
How do the clause's exemptions advance the current position? The memorandum of understanding—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should like to continue the normal traditions of the House, whereby the Minister receives notes from the parliamentary private secretary rather than from officials.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> A memorandum of understanding already exists between the UK Government, Scottish Ministers and the Cabinet of the National Assembly for Wales. It provides that the administration of each country will respect confidentiality between them. On top of that, the overlay of the bilateral concordats between UK Departments and the new administrations reinforce the agreements. Any information disclosed by Whitehall Departments to Scottish authorities that is not given in confidence will be capable of disclosure under the Scottish freedom of information law. That is explicit in the consultation paper. Parallel bodies north and south of the border might make different decisions about similar information.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary might say that that is an effect of devolution and that it is a proper distinction. I agree: there is no reason why identical legislation should apply either side of the border. We do not, however, need a blanket exemption on top of it. Its intention cannot be to protect the confidentiality of information supplied to UK departments by devolved administrations. The memorandum of understanding and the concordats already provide additional obligations and exemptions. It might be argued that the intention is to prevent the UK Government from having to disclose information that could prove damaging to, for instance, the Scottish Executive, but what sort of information would that be, and should it not be disclosed? It clearly would not include decisions on the economy, investment or taxation, because clause 27 covers those subjects. It speaks of disclosure that would prejudice
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the economic interests of the United Kingdom or of any part of the United Kingdom, or the financial interests of any administration in the United Kingdom''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What is the Bill aiming to prevent? What is the evil that the clause seeks to remedy? I can assume only that the aim is to prevent embarrassment between the different administrations. According to the principles of freedom of information, that is an insufficient reason. If the Minister can give sound examples, the circumstances of which will be met by the clause and not by other clauses, I shall listen to his arguments with care. At present, I cannot envisage such circumstances, so the clause is entirely redundant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I apologise to you, Dr. Clark, for the route by which a note was passed to me.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale opened his remarks by saying that he was deeply cynical about the clause. I understand his mindset because he and his party have consistently been deeply cynical about the concept of devolved government. They opposed it from the outset. They opposed it when it was put to the people of Scotland and Wales in referendums and failed to persuade the people of Scotland and Wales of their case. The Government believe in devolved government and in moving government nearer to people, giving real powers to Scotland and Wales to determine the operation of their administrations. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the need for devolution is apparent from the activities of the administrations in those countries.
<P>
Clause 26 exempts information that would, or would be likely to, prejudice relations between any two administrations in the United Kingdom. Subsection (2) defines those administrations as the UK Government, the Scottish administration, the Executive Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the National Assembly for Wales.
<P>
Subsection (3) provides that the obligation to confirm or deny whether the requested information is held does not arise in relation to information that is exempt by virtue of subsection (1), if to comply would, or would be likely to, result in the kind of harm described.
<P>
Protection for such information is not unusual in other freedom of information regimes that have devolution of some kind. It is recognised that it is important to provide protection to information, the disclosure of which could damage relations between the administrations within a country. We provide protection to information that would prejudice international relations. Why is it not appropriate to provide protection to information that would prejudice internal relations?
<P>
Devolution has only recently come in the United Kingdom, and we are all new to it, but it must be right that information that would cause prejudice, which, if released, may cause serious problems between the Scottish Parliament and Whitehall, for example, must be afforded some protection. Our working relationships, between Whitehall and the devolved administrations, must not be damaged, which surely could result by the removal of the clause from the Bill.
<P>
Let us not forget that clause 26 does not exempt all information, but information, which, if disclosed, would, or would be likely to, prejudice relations between the administrations in the United Kingdom. Clause 13 will apply, and so if it is in the public interest to do so, it will be released.
<P>
We are not alone in the United Kingdom in believing that this type of provision is a necessary part of freedom of information legislation. Under the Australian Freedom of Information Act, documents relating to Commonwealth and State relations may be exempted. The Canadian Access to Information Act has an exemption relating to federal and provincial affairs in order to protect the effective conduct of government.
<P>
Therefore, it is right that we provide for the eventuality that some information may prejudice relations between our administrations, and that we therefore provide protection for this information.
