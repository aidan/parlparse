<H4><center>Clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Modification of licences by the Director</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page 10, line 39, leave out from `so' to end of line 42.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 37 to 45.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I start by apologising to you, Mr. Maxton, and to the Committee for the fact I shall be leaving our proceedings early this afternoon, although my hon. Friend, the Minister for Competitiveness, will be here to take over. In case the Committee finishes its deliberations before I return, I thank you, Mr. Maxton, for your exemplary Chairmanship, as I do my hon. Friends for their superb support. I also thank Opposition Members for their close scrutiny of the Bill, which has been a model of how Committee proceedings should operate. I propose to write to members of the Committee to clarify the scope of clauses 7 and 8, which we debated in a previous sitting, and make particular reference to Government contracts, the position of which is even more arcane and complex than I suggested then.
<P>
The amendments deal with modifications to telecommunications licences. Everyone accepts that the existing system for modifying telecommunications licences has become unworkable. The procedure was designed at the time of privatisation to deal with a couple of operators, but it is now swamped because there are hundreds of operators. The problem is that the existing system requires the Director-General to gain the written consent of all relevant licensees before he can proceed with any licence modification, even if it is a minor and technical modification. It would be almost impossible to make the necessary modifications.
<P>
Clause 10 puts in place a more flexible and efficient procedure, whereby silence on the part of the licensees allows a modification to proceed and the Director-General may make fast-track deregulatory modifications in cases where stringent tests are met. However, the telecommunications industry was worried about the further mechanism that was originally included in clause 10, which would have allowed the Director-General to proceed directly with the licence modification without referring it to the Competition Commission, if it seemed to him that objections to the modification did not represent a ``significant minority'' of licensees. The industry was concerned about that and about the possible scope for excessive discretion being given to the Director-General in deciding whether a minority was significant.
<P>
We recognise the scope of those concern, so we are removing by way of the amendments the ``significant minority'' mechanism from the revised licence modification procedure. That will leave in the place the simpler procedure that I have outlined. There is a real benefit to be gained, in that the mechanism will be deregulatory and simplifying. I hope that it will be welcomed by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. There may be a need for more flexible procedures in future, but those can be dealt with during the broader process of reviewing and reforming telecommunications regulation generally, which we will develop next year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Duncan </B>(Rutland and Melton): The Opposition are broadly in agreement with all that the Minister has said. Our approach to this part of the Bill has been to ensure that existing licence holders are in no way disadvantaged by any retrospective action that might take place. We welcomed the Minister saying on Second Reading that she would table amendments in Committee—we always think that it is good to remove certain aspects of a Bill and slim it down.
<P>
The pace of this Committee's deliberations has been quite swift. The Opposition has not received any representations on the amendments, but I am slightly worried that something may yet be said. From our conversations with Oftel and one or two telecommunications companies, it seems that the industry agrees with the amendments. Apart from that one caveat, we are content with what is proposed.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendments made: Government amendments Nos. 37, in page 12, leave out lines 1 to 18.
<P>
38, in page 12, line 34, leave out `, (3)'.
<P>
39, in page 12, line 41, leave out from `objected' to end of line 48.
<P>
40, in page 13, line 1, leave out `or (3)(b)'.
<P>
41, in page 13, line 14, leave out from beginning to `and' in line 19.
<P>
42, in page 13, line 24, leave out `or (3)'.
<P>
43, in page 13, line 26, leave out `or who has already objected to it'.
<P>
44, in page 13, line 28, leave out from beginning to end of line 8 on page 14.
<P>
45, in page 14, line 28, leave out subsection (6).—[Ms Hewitt.]
<P>
Clause 10, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 11</center></H4>
<H4><center>Appeals against modifications without the licensee's consent</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to debate Government new clause 1—Appeals against modifications of licence conditions.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> In asking the Committee to agree to Government new clause 1, I am of course inviting the Committee to disagree to clause 11. The new clause allows us to tidy up a legislative loose end. Yet again, we are simplifying the statute book, and I am therefore confident that we shall have the support of the Opposition.
<P>
Clause 11 provides an appeals procedure that is specific to telecommunication licence modifications. We needed to include it to ensure compliance with the European convention on human rights. However, last month I laid a statutory instrument before the House that introduces a general appeals procedure into the Telecommunications Act 1984 for a range of telecommunications regulatory decisions. That statutory instrument will come into force on 20 December 1999.
<P>
The specific procedure in the Bill and the new general procedure are, to all intents and purposes, identical. The amendment therefore simply takes the logical step of removing the specific appeals mechanism from the Bill and expanding the general appeals system to include licence modification. The result will be one uniform procedure for appeals against all telecommunication regulatory decisions. I therefore ask the Committee to agree that clause 11 should not stand part of the Bill and that it should be replaced with Government new clause 1.
<P>
Question put and negatived.
<P>
Clause 11 disagreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 12</center></H4>
<H4><center>Ministerial expenditure etc</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That clause 12 stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): As we are generously allowing the Secretary of State to spend money, could she give us an idea of how much money she thinks will be required to fulfil her functions under the Bill?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The clause is a standard provision. If we were to activate part I and put in place a statutory scheme, our initial estimate is that the costs would be about £500,000 in its first year. There will not be any costs to other parts of the Bill; indeed, part II will enable Departments to save money by substituting electronic procedures for paper and written ones.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Could the Minister clarify her estimate of £500,000 a year? If she were to bring in a regulatory regime, what assumptions is she making about how much money she will charge the industry for regulating it so that her own expenditure is limited to £500,000?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I cannot provide great detail on that point, although I readily undertake to write to the hon. Gentleman on it. As he may recall from the discussions on part I and from his reading of the regulatory impact assessment, we have looked into the administrative costs of running a scheme and the possible costs to an approved provider of obtaining approval under the scheme, including the costs of obtaining approval by, for instance, complying with other standards and paying the fees in association with those standards. So the £500,000 that we anticipate as the cost of running a part I scheme, were it to be activated, would indeed be funded by fees. It would not be an additional net public expenditure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> We appear to have hit some curious mathematics. If the costs will be only £500,000—the Minister has already told the Committee that the fee charged for a licence might be anything between £30,000 and £50,000—does she envisage only 10 people being charged such a fee or does she intend to make a profit from it?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> We discussed that during our debate on part I. It would be much more sensible to consider those issues in appropriate detail if we were to decide to activate part I. In the first year—to which the figures relate—our working assumption is that 10 providers will seek approval.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> That is a very unsatisfactory reply. We have said from the beginning—and we shall say it again when we reach the next group of amendments, that part I is unnecessary. We are now being asked to write a blank cheque for the cost of part I. Although the Minister has admitted that she has done no research or deep thinking on what it might cost in the long run, we are nevertheless being asked to approve part I and write her a blank cheque for not only the effects of implementing part I but the costs of doing so.
<P>
Clause 12 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 13</center></H4>
<H4><center>Prohibition on key escrow requirements</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 59, in page 15, line 43, leave out from beginning to end of line 5 on page 16 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) treating an electronic communication as not having been made if the intended recipient is not in possession of a key for electronic data comprised in that communication and so notifies the sender within a reasonable time; or
<P>
(b) imposing on a person who is under a duty to store and make available any data, and who stores it in any electronic form such that a key is required to gain access to the data or to make it intelligible, a duty to secure that the key is available when the data is required to be made available.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a small but crucial amendment, about which we feel quite strongly. I fully accept the Minister's good faith in saying that on no account did she want key escrow to be part of the Bill. Indeed, the purpose of clause 13 is to prohibit the requirement for key escrow. We all know the history of the debate. We openly admit that in the early stages it seemed to be a solution to the problem. However, we now accept—indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Ian Taylor), the former Minister, has openly admitted it—that key escrow is not the solution to some of the problems that have been envisaged.
<P>
We are glad to see that, at least superficially, the purpose of clause 13 is to prohibit key escrow. However, the Bill is in some respects self-contradictory. Indeed, even though the clause is meant to ensure that it does not happen, subsection (2) allows such an open-ended exclusion that key escrow could come in through back door. I shall explain what our amendment would to.
<P>
Clause 13(2)(a) enables an unnecessary key deposit requirement to be imposed when all that is necessary is for an unintelligible communication to be treated as if it had not been made, provided that the recipient notifies the sender promptly that it is unintelligible. The amendment would substitute that more limited provision.
<P>
Clause 13(2)(b) is unnecessarily wide and would enable a general requirement for the introduction of key escrow or key recovery facilities. The amendment would limit the requirement to make a key available to only the relevant case—which is almost certainly already implied by law—and that is where the holder of the data is under a duty to hold the record and make it available.
<P>
So my fear is that the Bill may unwittingly allow arbitrary and—I accept—accidental key escrow requirements. It is the objective of both sides of the Committee to make sure that that possibility does not creep into the Bill. Everything that the Minister said on Second Reading corroborates that objective. I hope that, in that spirit, she will accept that our only purpose is to clarify the language to ensure that what she says she wants, which we also want, properly appears in the Bill, and that there is no curious and needless opportunity for key escrow to pop back into the legislation when there is no other need for it. I therefore hope that the Minister will be able to accept the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The hon. Gentleman referred to the amendment as small but none the less important. I had hoped for a small but perfectly formed amendment that I could commend to my hon. Friends, but sadly this is not it.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman said, clause 13 is extremely important. As we promised, it rules out mandatory key escrow under any of the orders that can be made under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): I hope that when the Home Office introduces its own Bill, the Department of Trade and Industry will be scrupulous in articulating the anxieties that have been expressed about key escrow so as to represent the industry's interests.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I readily assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall forcefully represent the industry's views as we proceed with that legislation.
<P>
Clause 13(1) rules out mandatory key escrow. Clause 13(2) does not limit the prohibition on key escrow. Rather, it makes it clear that the prohibition on key escrow will not preclude two common-sense requirements
<P>
Subsection (2)(a) allows for an order made under clause 8 to require the deposit of a key with the intended recipient of the electronic communication, not the third party. That is an important distinction. We are worried that someone could supply information required by statute to be provided to the Government or to a public agency in encrypted and unintelligible form. If the intended recipient—a Government Department, for example—could not understand it, the communication would for all practical purposes have been frustrated, even though, technically, the statutory requirement to provide the information might have been fulfilled. Let us suppose that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food wanted to enable abattoirs to provide information electronically. As such information might be sensitive or involve anxieties relating to the identity of the sender, MAFF might insist that such transfers be effected using a particular type of technology.
<P>
<B>Dr. Stephen Ladyman </B>(South Thanet): The Minister is explaining the Government's position very well. However, the Opposition's argument is rather nonsensical. Third party key escrow requires a key to be given to a third party. In making that a requirement in relation to communication with the Government, the Government would have to ask for encoded information to be sent to them—which they could not read—and for the key to break the code to be given to someone other than the person for whom the document is intended. That is absolute nonsense.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> My hon. Friend has, as always, hit on an important point. Mandatory key escrow involves mandating the deposit of the key with a third party. Subsection (2)(a) is concerned with only two parties, the person sending the communication and the Government, who will be the recipient.
<P>
In the example, if the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food requires the sender to use a certain type of technology, the transfer to the Ministry of the encryption key used by the abattoir might be needed so that the information could be read. It would be ridiculous to prohibit such technology or leave any lack of clarity.
<P>
Subsection (2)(b) relates to a different point. If a key were not deposited with another party, an order under clause 8 could be made requiring arrangements to ensure that data could be accessed or decrypted in case the key were lost or became unusable. An example would be an Act of Parliament that, as modified by a clause 8 order, allowed information to be stored electronically. It might be important for public policy reasons to ensure that the information could be retrieved. In the same way, the Government might require the information to be stored on paper for a specified time.
<P>
A clause 8 order can specify a storage requirement for electronic data only when the original non-electronic data has to be stored in the first place. Railway safety records and information about the location of underground power lines or sewers are topical examples. Clause 13 will prohibit obliging anyone who holds such data to adopt third-party key escrow. However, if the people holding the data decide of their own accord that they do not want to adopt third-party key escrow, they can be required by an order to make suitable alternative arrangements so that the information can be retrieved if something goes wrong with the key.
<P>
The provision is intended to deal with situations such as the death of the only person who holds the key, say the information technology manager of an organisation, or the theft or destruction of the personal computer holding the information. It is a simple, practical safeguard that is designed to deal with the consequences of ruling out mandatory key escrow, not to allow it to be smuggled in by some other means.
<P>
For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment. It would place the burden of proof in subsection (2)(a) on the recipient, who would have to notify the sender of the information within an unspecified ``reasonable time'' that the communication was unintelligible. If the recipient did not do so, or the time within which he made the communication was not considered ``reasonable'', the statutory requirement to make the communication would have been fulfilled even though the information was unintelligible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> In large part, I can go along with what the Minister says. The rebuttal of the amendment is persuasive, but it strikes me that it has one flaw. The hon. Lady's explanation works in cases in which the Government have used the power to require storage, but the Bill is in no way limited to such cases. The Bill applies to any data, so it reaches much further than the circumstances that she described.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman is referring to subsection (2)(b).
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Fine. I explained why I saw no need to amend the requirements of subsection (2)(a). The amendment surprises me in relation to subsection (2)(b), because although the hon. Gentleman has for some time opposed key storage, he now suggests that there might be circumstances in which a key would have to be made available. That is the opposite of our intention and, I thought, the opposite of the hon. Gentleman's policy. We have been careful to ensure that, under subsection (2)(b) as drafted, the user will decide how the information is to be made intelligible for future use: we focused on the objective of future accessibility and intelligibility. When the holder of the data does not want to deposit the key with anybody else, he is required simply to make other arrangements, to ensure that the data can be read in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The Minister's argument holds good when some sort of storage is demanded, but not when no such demand is made. Subsection (2)(b) refers simply to ``data''—whether intelligible or unintelligible—and it is the far-reaching nature of the provision which causes me concern. Her argument has only half addressed the issue. Will the Minister consider tabling an amendment on Report, confining the subsection to exactly what she said, which I would accept?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I was about to come to that point. Clause 13 is not a stand-alone enactment that will give the Secretary of State the power to do whatever he wants in respect of data storage. We have already debated clause 8, which enables us to modify statute law in order to provide electronic equivalents to paper and writing. When there is a statutory requirement to hold data, clause 8 enables us to make regulations providing that that data may be held electronically, rather than by means of paper.
<P>
Clause 13 states that orders made under clause 8 cannot impose mandatory key escrow. Subsection (2)(b) provides that when paper records have to be stored for a certain length of time, to meet statutory requirements, an electronic equivalent can be provided for other than in the form of mandatory key escrow.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The Minister seems to be saying that clause 8 limits the scope of clause 13. She will recall that, in our debate on clause 8, we highlighted how wide its scope was, especially subsections (5) and (6). Because of the wide ambit of those provisions, clause 8 could be used in a much more radical way than she suggests she intends to use it while she is Minister with responsibility for e-commerce.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's concern, but I do not believe that the drafting of subsection (2)(b) would allow that wide open power to make orders or require all sorts of things that are not currently required. I undertake to double check the subsection with parliamentary counsel. There is no need for an amendment, although I understand the hon. Gentleman's concern, but I have undertaken to look at the issue again. On the basis of my explanation and my further assurance, I hope that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) will withdraw his small, though not entirely perfectly formed, amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> It is tempting to all of us to send in our tax returns in the form of unreadable hieroglyphics. I urge the Minister to consider tabling an amendment on Report, so that the clause can be made absolutely clear.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The Minister will explore that possibility, so on that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 13 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 14 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 15</center></H4>
<H4><center>Short title, commencement, extent</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 60, in page 17, line 12, leave out `7'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 61, in page 17, line 17, leave out `five' and insert `two'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> There is a supreme irony in the Bill. In all her public utterances, the Minister has spoken of the need for speed in getting the Bill on the statute book. She has expressed her hope that it will be the first Act of the new millennium, which would suit us. However, the clause contains provisions to delay parts of the Bill being put into effect. We all want to be ahead of the game, so it seems absurd to delay the implementation of clause 7, which is the crucial clause on electronic signatures.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 15 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Part I of this Act'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which we hope will never be invoked,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and sections 7, 10 and 11 shall come into force on such day as the Secretary of State may by order made by statutory instrument appoint''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understand why the Minister wants part I and clauses 7, 10 and 11 to be subject to the Secretary of State's say-so and to the making of an appropriate statutory instrument, but there is no need to delay the implementation of clause 7. Surely her only argument for doing so is that she wants a voluntary system to be in place, but why cannot people get on with things in the knowledge that clause 7 will take effect without further delay?
<P>
There is no logic, need or demand behind any further delay in the implementation of clause 7, so, under amendment No. 60, we are simply saying, ``Get on with it.'' If the Minister rejects the amendment, she will have to stand up in front of the cameras and explain to the House why, having called for the speedy enactment of the Bill, she wants to slow it down. We will all watch that and have a lot of fun, and the Christmas spirit might evaporate. I am making a simple plea to get on with it without any further delay.
<P>
Under amendment No. 61, we return to our original point. Although we disagree with part I, we unreservedly welcome the inclusion of a sunset clause; however, the period specified in it is too long. We simply want to reduce the term from five years to two, so that, if the silly, ridiculous and unnecessary part I has not been invoked before two years have elapsed, it will die a natural death and not linger for the further three years that the Minister wants under the sunset clause. The amendments are consistent: under amendment No. 60, we are simply saying, ``Get on with electronic signatures,'' and, under amendment No. 61, we would remove any risk of implementing part I after two years.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Miller </B>(Ellesmere Port and Neston): As we approach the end of our debates, which Members of all three parties have conducted with such good temper and humour, I cannot resist questioning the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton on his logic. He has said that he wants the Bill to be enacted as quickly as possible, but how does he square that with a quote from a website in which he describes the Bill as a ``hindrance''? Quotes can be attributed wrongly, but his name appears on that site as a patron of the Conservative Technology Forum. If the Bill were a hindrance, he would not want my hon. Friend the Minister to move as rapidly as he has suggested. Will he explain which position is correct?
<P>
The website states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is no understatement to say that the greatest technological leaps have always been nurtured under a conservative way of thinking.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the hon. Gentleman explain that extraordinarily absurd statement? The site invites people to send money to the hon. Gentleman's organisation—which, I hasten to add, is perfectly legitimate e-commerce. The Labour party offers a better service at a lower price, but that is another matter. The notion that Conservative thinking has nurtured technological leaps runs counter to the facts of history, which do not seem to suit the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> When I described the Bill as a hindrance, it was even at that time unpublished. The Opposition's brilliance forced its publication for consultation, since which time we have pretty much cut it in half. I am glad that my website has had a hit, and I can assure the hon. Gentleman that, the way he is going, he is likely to get one too.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not sure that it is in order for one hon. Member to threaten another.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I did not take the hon. Gentleman's comments as a threat. The Committee heard sizeist remarks earlier, so I shall refrain from making any more.
<P>
The site poses an interesting question about sites that seek to raise money from the public and remain live, but are not updated. Is my hon. Friend the Minister concerned about sites that seek to extract public money when history has moved on? The hon. Gentleman acknowledges that history has moved on—even his version of it. The site seemed to contradict the hon. Gentleman's current approach, so I was pleased to hear his response, even though his tongue was firmly in his cheek when he made it.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): I echo the surprise expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton about subsection (2) of the clause. It clearly does not indicate that sections 7, 10 and 11 of the future Act are likely to come into force promptly, although we welcome the fact that part I is unlikely not to take effect promptly.
<P>
Clause 7 is important for legal proceedings and is significant in respect of the delays to which my hon. Friend referred and with which his amendment seeks to deal. Clause 7(1) helpfully clarifies for the courts what should be admissible, as it was intended to do; Clause 7(2) contains a helpful definition of an electronic signature; and subsection (3) describes how a certificate might appear. However, we do not know when clause 7 will take effect, and I find it puzzling to consider why its introduction should be in doubt. Does the Minister share my concern about what the legal fraternity and the courts will think if, next week or in three weeks' time, a contentious case arises in which an attempt is made to admit into evidence an electronic signature? Will she give reasons for the Government's approach?
<P>
My second and final point is to ask why a five-year sunset clause has been included in the Bill? If the Minister wants the voluntary schemes to develop, take effect and get up and running rapidly, a five-year sunset clause seems incredibly arbitrary. Why not use a lower figure, albeit still an arbitrary one? Will she direct her attention to those questions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I should like to speak briefly in support of both amendments. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton might wish to explore the possibility of extracting money from the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) for the removal of intellectual property from his website. Whether what was removed was intellectual property may be in dispute, but it certainly was property.
<P>
It is sensible to consider both the amendments. I hope that the Minister will tell us that a straightforward statutory instrument that will breeze through the House will be introduced to make section 7 come into force immediately, and that nothing more complex than that will be required. I know that the Minister is itching to tell us something along those lines; I shall try not to delay her too much.
<P>
Amendment No. 61 is important because of what the industry has been saying about uncertainty; we should keep returning to that point. For the industry to be globally competitive, it must be certain about the legislative framework in the United Kingdom. Without certainty, it will transport itself elsewhere. It told us that throughout the consultation period and the Government have responded by moving to a voluntary rather than a compulsory statutory scheme. We hope that their intention behind the sunset clause is to remove uncertainty.
<P>
Any figure that we pick will be arbitrary, but two years is more sensible than five years. Any developments that can resolve the situation will occur within two years. Either part I will be brought into force or the industry scheme will be satisfactory. If the figure is five years, we will be left with three more years of uncertainty and that will bring no real benefit. By adopting the two-year limit, the Government would give a more favourable signal to industry about their intention to go fully with the industry rather than to half meet its demands for legislative certainty. That would set a clear and immediate marker.
<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): Amendment No. 61 might be counter-productive. We are moving in new waters. There is a distinct likelihood—not just a risk but a likelihood—that a voluntary scheme will still be unproven after two years. Most of us consider the interesting proposal from the Alliance for Electronic Business as a good first attempt. The risk of a two-year sunset clause is that it forces a decision on the Government as the sunset approaches. If I say to the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton that I will buy him lunch if he joins the Labour party within two years, I may not be giving enough time for his views to evolve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Or a big enough incentive.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> He does not need much incentive to do that. If I give him five years, he knows that he has time to develop his views appropriately, without the risk of the offer of lunch suddenly disappearing.
<P>
While I appreciate the objective of the amendment, it stems from the idea that a government fallback position on the matter is essentially undesirable. If we accept the basic philosophy, as we have done by agreeing to part I, that we desire a fallback position in case the private sector does not prove itself, we need to give it time to prove itself before we let the sun set.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Time moves on, but it is worth pointing out that, having given swift passage to the Bill, the Opposition have proved yet again that, had part I been introduced not now but later—when it was needed—we would have given it every consideration and every ease of passage if the circumstances required. The danger of part I is that a glitch will appear in the arrangements proposed in tScheme. I note that page two of the tScheme prospectus says that it provides an effective voluntary regime
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``making it unnecessary for the government to bring Part I of the proposed . . . Act into force.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Given that, we do not need part I. The easy passage that we have given the Bill demonstrates that the Minister should have shown more confidence in the common sense of the House and proceeded more carefully in her treatment of this important legislation.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> What a great deal of fuss. I am delighted that Opposition Members share my desire to get the Bill on the statute book quickly, and to bring all of it, except for part I, into force as soon as possible. I wish to take this opportunity to correct an error that has crept into the explanatory notes on the Bill. Paragraph 76 on page 16 states wrongly that the remainder of the Bill—that is, all the Bill except part I—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``will come into effect on the date of Royal Assent.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The correct position is set out under paragraph 69 on page 15 of the explanatory notes, which makes it clear that clause 7, as well as part I and clauses 10 and 11, can be commenced on days appointed by the Secretary of State. The rest of the Bill will come into force on Royal Assent.
<P>
The reason for that is simple. It is convention that a short period elapses between a Bill gaining Royal Assent and any substantive provisions being brought into force. Furthermore, no Act or part of an Act should be brought into operation earlier than two months after Royal Assent. That applies whether the date of commencement is specified in the Act or subsequently by a commencement order, as is the intention here.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet Office ``Guide to Legislative Procedures'', a copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library, stresses that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is particularly desirable that the minimum period should be observed in respect of provisions that will directly affect the public, legal practitioners or pending court proceedings.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not aware of any pending court proceedings, but clause 7 is fundamentally about what is admissible in court. It is clearly important that the judiciary has time to prepare for the clause to come into effect. I am pleased that the Judicial Studies Board is preparing guidance for the courts on electronic signatures. We will also prepare publicity on the Bill designed for the non-expert, because the average small business person, for example, does not have the time to understand the intricacies of electronic signatures and cryptography. We shall commence clause 7 after the conventional two-month period has expired. There will be delay, but that is why there is the usual provision under clause 15 to allow for a commencement order to be made by the Secretary of State.
<P>
I shall now say a little about the development of the tScheme. I have written a note to members of the Committee comparing the tScheme prospectus with the objectives that we have set out. The approvals scheme has been put together by the Alliance for Electronic Business. I am grateful to the Alliance for the effort that it has put into the development of the scheme, the prospectus for which has been available since last Thursday. Before I outline the scheme's current status and our position on it, I shall remind hon. Members of some of the background to its development. We received the first version of the tScheme documentation in October, a further version shortly before the Bill was debated on Second Reading and then a final draft of the prospectus. The prospectus showed the cross-sectoral industry support for the scheme, and included a timetable for its further development and launch, and its approvals strategy.
<P>
Now that my hon. Friend the Minister for Competitiveness and I have had the opportunity to study the details of the proposed scheme and to discuss it with Government colleagues, I am pleased and delighted to confirm to the Committee that, if the Alliance for Electronic Business delivers what it is currently planning to deliver, it will meet our objectives. I am confident that we shall be able to confirm to the House before Royal Assent that we are satisfied with the scheme. It would then not be necessary to commence part I; it could be kept in reserve in case anything goes wrong. We shall only be able to do that, however, if we continue to be satisfied by the development of the scheme and if it has the necessary support in the marketplace.
<P>
The development of the scheme shows the value of co-regulation. It is an example of the constructive work that the Government and industry can deliver together in a short time. I am also convinced that we would not have made such fast progress on the tScheme if it had not been for the possibility that statutory arrangements under part I could be introduced instead.
<P>
Our reason for including the sunset clause is to show good faith with the industry, with which we are working in partnership. It now accepts that our preference is for self-regulation, but that we have decided to back that up by setting a definite limit on the length of time for which a statutory option can be held in reserve. Five years has been chosen as the appropriate period, for good reason. In the tScheme prospectus, the Alliance estimates that the tScheme will be operational in the third quarter of next year. Allowing for some slippage, that may well mean that the scheme would not be fully operational until almost a year after Royal Assent—almost halfway through the Opposition's proposed sunset clause time scale.
<P>
We have to recognise that it will take a year or so for the tScheme to bed down, for sufficient service providers to seek and gain approval, for approved service providers to have sufficient customers, and for approved service providers and the tScheme to adjust their procedures in the light of experience and international developments. For example, the exact standards that will underpin the European electronic signatures directive, which is not due for implementation until the middle of 2001, will probably not be available until at least a year after Royal Assent. We will need to assess the operation at that time.

<P>

<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> As my hon. Friend is aware, I am probably the only Member who is not entirely comfortable with the idea of a voluntary system. Could I ask her the question the other way round: how long will it be before the Government give up on voluntary arrangements and impose a system?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> As my hon. Friend has said, we are starting from different ends. Most of my hon. Friends and I are satisfied with the progress that we have made so far. As I said, if the tScheme delivers on what the Alliance for Electronic Business has set out in the prospectus, there will not be any need to activate part I and create a statutory scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The Minister has had the advantage of being able to look at the tScheme in more detail, because we received it rather late. Will she confirm that it will be a Government requirement of the tScheme that only information technology security evaluation criteria or common criteria that certify cryptography can qualify?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman repeated the question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> What cryptography criteria can qualify? There are already schemes known as ITSEC or common criteria that certify cryptography. Will that qualify, or does the Minister envisage something else?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> As the Alliance makes clear, the aim is to have a range of standards. I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman whether it will include that particular one; I assume that it will, but it is not our intention to confine it to one technical standard. My point is that we will need time to assess the impact and effectiveness of the scheme over a period, once the bedding in process has occurred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I should like briefly to welcome the principal sunset regulation; we hope that it will be extended to many other business matters.
<P>
The scheme is not being laid down by the Government. Under it, service providers will be able to choose their own auditors from a list of acceptable auditors. I am worried that there will be insufficient impartiality in a system where service providers can choose their own auditors, and that there will be insufficiently clear assessment of their performance.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Standards of independence and probity exist in respect of auditors, but I shall reflect on the hon. Gentleman's point and perhaps write to him on it.
<P>
My difficulty with the amendment to the sunset clause period is that, if it were made, we would have to assess the scheme and decide whether to go for a part I statutory scheme before the self-regulatory scheme had a chance to bed down or to be properly assessed. The danger is that, if problems with the scheme are experienced at an early stage, we might either activate a statutory scheme, without allowing time for teething problems to be overcome, or ignore those early problems, not take up the statutory default option and bitterly regret having done that when it became clear that those early teething problems were a sign of something much more deep-seated.
<P>
We chose a five-year period so that the scheme can be properly developed and can settle down to enable us to assess it and make a considered judgment following the review in 2004, to which I referred on Second Reading. In the light of that explanation and the assurance that I gave on clause 7, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> On amendment No. 60, we very much welcome the Minister's assurance that clause 7 will be implemented after two months. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> At this appropriate moment, on behalf of Opposition Members and, no doubt, of the Government, I thank you, Mr. Maxton, for the manner in which you have chaired the Committee, and all those in the Clerks Department who have supported you in doing so. We extend to you our best wishes for Christmas and for a happy new millennium.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I wish all members of the Committee a merry Christmas and a happy new year; I am not sure about the millennium, because I do not think that most of us will see the end of it. I thank all the people, including all the members of the Committee, who have made this Committee so successful, co-operative and good spirited. I am sure that those present will pass on my thanks to anyone who is not here now but has served during previous sittings. I pay special thanks to the Clerk, who has had to carry out an experiment using a laptop for the first time ever in Committee. I am sure that we all hope that the experiment will be extended to all Clerks and Chairmen and, at a later date, to all hon. Members.
