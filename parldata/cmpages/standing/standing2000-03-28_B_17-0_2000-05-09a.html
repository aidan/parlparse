<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) that the notice, or any copy of the notice, was not given as required under section 35,'.<P>

No. 409, in page 20, line 17, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) that the access authority failed to take reasonable steps to make an agreement before giving notice under section 35,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> I was responding to amendment No. 409, which proposes that a landowner would be able to appeal against a notice under clause 35 on the grounds that the authority did not take reasonable steps to enter into an agreement first. We were discussing that old friend this morning.
<P>
Whatever the reasons behind the authority's judgment, it has the right to serve a notice setting out the works that it intends to undertake at its own cost. There will then be a right of appeal to the Secretary of State or, in the case of Wales, to the National Assembly for Wales, on whether the works are needed and on where new means of access should be situated. Given that, there is no case for a special ground for appeal to challenge the steps that the authority took to try to reach agreement with a landowner.
<P>
I may say, without going over the slightly troubled ground this morning, that the more that I have thought about the issue that we were debating at the conclusion of our previous sitting the less I am persuaded of the case. It could not be justified to establish a bureaucratic process to determine whether the access authority was fair in believing that it could not come to reasonable agreement with a landowner when no financial penalties were attached for the landowner and he would be required to do nothing. There would simply be no agreement. As I said, I shall consider the matter further. However, so far, the judgment that I reached this morning—that we should not reconsider the proposal—has only been confirmed. We are now discussing amendment No. 409. A special round of appeal to challenge the steps by which the authority made a judgment in trying to reach an agreement could not be warranted.
<P>
We have considered amendments Nos. 407 and 408. There might be a case for a specific round of appeal on the grounds that notice was not given as required by clauses 34 and 35. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) has made that point. Such a procedure would be in accordance with planning regulations, which contain a similar provision. With that in mind, we are prepared to consider the amendments with a view to tabling similar ones at a later date. In the light of the arguments and my commitments to consider the matter, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): We are getting off to a good start this afternoon; I hope that that presages a good evening. I thank the Minister for his kind words about amendments Nos. 407 and 408—we appreciate the sincerity of his offer to go away and consider them. The Minister has not attached the same importance that I do to an issue relating to amendment No. 409. We would be foolish to pretend that problems do not result from personality clashes, and it seems odd that there cannot be a method of appeal in situations in which such problems have arisen.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H4><center>Order to remove obstruction</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I beg to move amendment No. 484, in page 21, line 5, leave out `may' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment takes a familiar form of words. It deals with a curious state of affairs. In the scenario, one has an obstruction sufficiently serious that it cannot be dealt with by an unofficial approach by the access authority—a formal process must be entered into. No compliance has been forthcoming at that stage. Two or more access notices relating to a means of access have already been served and the person has not complied. The magistrates court has then been brought in under clause 37 and has ordered that the obstruction be removed. The landowner has still not complied with the request. At the end of that long process, the net result under clause 37(2) is that the person is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 and the access authority may remove the obstruction.
<P>
Having gone through that process, there is surely a suggestion that the access authority will remove the obstruction and will charge the offending person the cost of removal. It seems extraordinary to allow that wishy-washy ending to such a long saga of punitive measures, not reaching the conclusion that might have been expected. That is the purpose of the amendment. I hope that the Minister will accept it in the spirit in which it is intended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I have much sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's exasperation. I hope that I can persuade him that we are taking account of the objective that he and I share.
<P>
We envisage that access authorities will only rarely need to make use of the powers given to them in clause 37. They are instruments of last resort. Before the powers can be used, an authority must go through several stages. It must have tried to reach agreement with the landowner or occupier with regard to the means of access. Only if it is unable to do that, or if the owner is in breach of such an agreement, may it serve notice to undertake works. The hon. Gentleman has made that point. It is unlikely that the authority will need to serve a second notice within three years regarding the same means of access and still less likely that it will need to apply for an order of the magistrates court to add weight to its endeavours.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's argument is that the objective should be secured after that rigmarole has been gone through. Even if, in those rare circumstances, an access authority found it necessary to apply for a magistrate's order and an order was granted, a person might still avoid a penalty by removing the obstruction. It would be far better if that happened. However, if a landowner were so determined to flout the law that he failed to comply with the order, it would be right for him to risk being fined up to £1,000.
<P>
The circumstances envisaged by clause 37(2)(b) will arise rarely. I agree that, where there was such an obstruction and the authority had already gone to the considerable trouble of securing a court order, it would be surprising if it did not then remove the obstruction, especially given the fact that it could recover the cost. However, there might be circumstances in which, even at that late stage, it does not make sense for the authority to remove the obstruction, because the right of access has ceased to be exercisable in the area concerned since the court made its order. That is an unlikely circumstance, but it could arise if, for example, the land became cultivated or if a direction were made under chapter II for the long-term exclusion of access.
<P>
I do not for one moment believe that, in the great majority of circumstances, events will not occur exactly as the hon. Gentleman and I expect. However, to use the word ``shall'' when it would not be appropriate in a small minority of cases is none the less wrong. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will rest assured that, if the unlikely combination of events arises, the local authority will be pretty sure to act in the manner proposed by the amendment, although it would be wrong to compel it to do so if such action would be inappropriate. For those reasons, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be happy to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I cannot say that I am entirely happy to do so. We have both recited the long sequence of events that leads us to our conclusions. It would be an extraordinary situation if a case reached the magistrates court after such a scenario or if circumstances had changed so substantially at the point of issuing the order that access was no longer required. If that occurred, it would suggest that the access authority had not been acting entirely intelligently in pursuing the case to that point. The term ``means of access'' is defined in the Bill, so if land ceases to be access land, the term will have no meaning in relation to it. Whether the word ``may'' or ``shall'' is used, the Bill will not require the access authority to do something that it cannot physically do, as, by definition, the offending landowner will already have removed the obstruction. There would be no difficulty in either case, because the access authority cannot be required to do something that does not exist.
<P>
The difficulties are, therefore, even less likely to occur than the Minister suggests. The change from ``may'' to ``shall'' would clearly assert what will happen and would make it clear to offenders that they would not only bear the cost of a fine—it will not exceed level 3, which may or may not be a factor in considering whether to maintain intransigence—but the cost of removing of the obstruction, which may amount to considerably more than the value of such a fine. That cost would act as a further deterrent from carrying on to the bitter end. The amendment would be helpful to access authorities in such circumstances, although the implied threat is already so clear that I do not think that it would change the minds of many people. Will the Minister reflect at his leisure on those thoughts? I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I beg to move amendment No. 410, in page 21, line 9, after first `which', insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the specified period has not expired, or'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is designed to improve slightly the drafting of the clause, which deals with the removal of obstructions when an access order has been made. It seeks to make the procedure fairer. The provision to which it applies relates to exceptions, and the purpose of the amendment is to stipulate that action should not be taken if the specified period has not expired. The clause states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``access notice'' means a notice under section 34(3) or 35i 1), other than a notice in respect of which an appeal is pending or which has been cancelled on appeal.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those conditions are obviously fair, and it seems to us equally fair that, if the specified period has not expired, the access notice should not be actioned and will not be an access notice to that extent. Of course, we agree that people who are being unnecessarily obstructive must not be allowed to continue to be so, but we want to make it clear that the clause will not apply to anyone who is behaving fairly. We want to keep relations good. Earlier, the Committee discussed paranoia and persecution complexes. This amendment, like some other Opposition amendments, seeks to avoid the possibility of a persecution complex developing among landowners or other occupiers of land in the countryside. I therefore hope that the Government will accept the amendment, which I commend to the Committee. 
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I hope that I can persuade the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) that a persecution complex will not arise from the clause. Landowners are protected by elaborate and lengthy procedures, but there has to be a point at which enforcement occurs. We do not envisage that access authorities will often need to apply for an order of the magistrates court, but without the power to apply for such an order, an authority could find itself in a cycle of repeatedly serving notices and carrying out works. The only question that arises here is when to make additional powers available to the access authority to put a stop to that potential cycle of abuse, as I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree. We have decided that the authority must have served at least two notices before the enforcement route may be taken.
<P>
The landowner will still have an opportunity to appeal against a notice, and, while an appeal is pending, that notice will not count towards the two notices required as a prerequisite to court action. Such is the weight of business before the magistrates courts that it is unlikely that the access authority's complaint will be heard before the due date for compliance with the second notice has expired. It is equally unlikely that the access authority will want to bring court proceedings if it thinks that action on the part of the landowner is likely.
<P>
The process gives all due protection to a landowner, even if he is being intransigent. However, I agree that it would be undesirable for enforcement measures to be taken before the period of notice had expired, however unlikely that may be. We are, therefore, prepared to consider the amendment, with a view to tabling a similar one at a later stage. I am going a long way to prevent any unreasonable exercise of power, even against a landowner who has held things up for a very long time, whatever his motives. I want to ensure that there is no question of arbitrary or capricious use of power and that the landowner has every opportunity to comply, but there must be a point at which enforcement takes place. I am, however, prepared to make a final concession and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment on that basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am extremely grateful to the Minister. I take his point that the current state of the magistrates courts means that delays are likely to be extremely lengthy. Furthermore, I have no desire to protect the intransigent landowner, although what one person considers intransigence, another will see as the reasonable defence of property rights. I am grateful for the Minister's generosity in stating that he will table something similar. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<H4><center>Powers of entry for purposes of Part I</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I beg to move amendment No. 339, in page 22, line 13, after `the', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`owner and the'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a straightforward case of consistency. As in the other clauses, it is not only the occupier, but also the owner who must be notified. The Minister should be able to accept the amendment if he is so minded.
<P>
The clause is important because it gives relevant inspectors access to land to decide not only whether the access authority needs to make long-term agreements, but to assess whether offences have been committed. All the other clauses in this part of the Bill consistently state that both the owner and the occupier, when different, should be notified. Therefore, as a matter of principle and courtesy, the same should apply in this clause. I notice that, for the sake of consistency, clauses 33(2)(a), 34(1), 34(3), 35(1) and 36(1) all state that both the owner and the occupier should be notified. I hope that the Minister will be able to accept the amendment for the sake of consistency, practice and courtesy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Let me briefly spell out the purpose behind the clause. I hope that the Committee accepts the principle of persons authorised by the countryside bodies, local highway authorities and national park authorities having a legitimate reason for entering land in the performance of their functions. They may do so, for example, to map access land or in connection with appeals on maps and restrictions to access. I know that the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) was not questioning that principle. He asked whether the landowner would be given prior notice, the same as the occupier.
<P>
Although I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's desire that landowners be kept informed of all developments affecting their interests, clause 38 is simply about admission to land and therefore is principally of concern to the occupier of the land. Admission in itself will have few or no consequences for the owner unless he is also the occupier. The owner will have a legitimate interest in some of the purposes for which admission has been granted; for example, for mapping access land and assessing the need for restricting access. In such cases, the Bill makes provision for notification, consultation and appeal procedures for others with an interest in the land. However, that is not appropriate when the issue is admission rather than the purposes for which admission is sought.
<P>
I hope therefore that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am particularly concerned about clause 37(2)(b), which is mentioned in clause 38. It creates an offence and a fine for obstruction of the right of access. The Bill has a shortcoming here. It is possible that an owner may cause an obstruction, but is not notified that he is to be the subject of an inspection, which may result in a prosecution. I should be grateful if the Minister would say something about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> That seems to be met by the point that I am making. The owner of the land will not be subject to any penalty regarding admission to land. The issue relates to the consequences of admission being granted and action perhaps being taken. Certainly, the owner would have to be notified and given the opportunity to comply or to appeal, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Again, that does not apply to admission to land.
<P>
On the question of consistency with other references to owner and occupier, those who have had an opportunity to check the list that the hon. Gentleman gave the Committee will have observed that all the other clauses that refer to owner and occupier are contained in chapter III, not chapter IV, and those chapters serve very different purposes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I accept entirely what the Minister says, but someone who is suspected of having committed an offence should have the opportunity, at an early stage, to be notified that he is being investigated for that offence. Therefore, it seems right, as a matter of courtesy, that if the owner is suspected of committing an offence, he should be notified that inspectors will investigate the matter. That is a lacuna in the Bill, which the Minister might want to remedy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> It is a strange principle that anyone who is being investigated regarding the possible commission of an offence should be advised beforehand. That does not apply in other areas of penal policy. I know that we are not discussing normal criminal activity, but we are discussing compliance with the law. The fact is that no notice need be given in any circumstances to anyone for the purpose of establishing whether an offence has been committed. That is clearly set out in clause 38(5)(c). I do not accept that where admission to land is sought in order to investigate whether the owner has committed an offence, the owner should have to be informed before the evidence is collected. That is not justified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> There is a simple difference of view between the Opposition and the Minister. As a matter of courtesy, both the owner and the occupier should be informed, especially when the owner might be responsible for the offence. However, there is no meeting of minds on this issue because, clearly, the Minister will not give way. In those circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 411, in page 22, line 17, leave out `dwelling-house' and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`building, mobile home, caravan or tent or the curtilage of a building.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hesitate slightly to introduce an amendment that contains the word ``curtilage'' on the grounds that it is some time since the Committee debated its meaning, and only the more nostalgic among us are looking forward to another debate on the subject. Unfortunately, the definition of curtilage is not at the heart of the amendment, which attempts to do two things. First, it attempts to make clause 38, relating to powers of entry, more practical. The Bill currently define the exception as relating to a dwelling-house, but we believe that the wider definition in the amendment would be better. The definition in the amendment includes other forms of living accommodation, as well as the dreaded curtilage of a building.
<P>
I pray in aid the rest of the Bill in support of the amendment because, in at least two places in the Bill, a definition wider than ``dwelling-house'' is included. Those places are schedule 1 and clause 56. The Government seem to have recognised that ``dwelling-house'' might be insufficient as a definition of the special area inside the open land to which access or powers of entry may be required. We believe that the wider definition that is included in other parts of the Bill is more practical and sensible. For practicality and consistency, the Bill would be improved by this small amendment, which I commend to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Member for Ashford raises some important issues about people's privacy—this time in relation to powers of entry to land by persons who are authorised by the appropriate authorities. We have already discussed the matter in relation to the powers of entry contained in clause 38 to carry out site visits for the purpose of mapping access land, to inspect the land in order to assess applications for closures or restrictions on access, or to gain entry in order to put up signs.
<P>
As with many other aspects of the Bill, we need to strike a balance, and I have done as much as I can to do that. Just as we need to provide for authorised people to be able to enter land to carry out their functions, we should properly protect the privacy of those who live and work on or near to access land. As such, I have sympathy with the intention behind amendment No. 411. The hon. Gentleman introduced the amendment soberly, with the possible exception of an attempt to regurgitate the issue of curtilage, which I recall with some horror. However, it is not our intention that officials should go about walking into caravans or unzipping tents in pursuance of their functions. In reality, it is difficult to envisage why that should happen.
<P>
We are not convinced of the need to exclude all buildings, but we accept that there might be some argument about the meaning of ``dwelling-house'', and we therefore propose to consider the matter further and to introduce an appropriate amendment at a later stage. There should not be any doubt about the rights of officials to gain unreasonable, unacceptable entry, or unjustifiably to breach privacy. I simply want them properly to carry out their functions in a way that safeguards privacy. I shall do what I can to table an amendment to ensure that that balance is maintained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am on a roll here, and I am grateful to the Minister. The amendment raises a genuine point, which relates to practicality and consistency with the rest of the Bill. I suspect that the great minds of the Minister's officials will be able to suggest a more robust definition. I am grateful for the Minister's assurance that he will introduce a more satisfactory amendment at a later stage. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`approved by'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those hon. Members who have served on Committees before will know that this vexed issue occurs in every Standing Committee. However, in this Bill, there is considerable merit in changing the statutory instruments procedure from the negative to the affirmative resolution.
<P>
The Bill contains countless examples of regulations being needed. Under clause 3, the Minister can extend the Bill, by order, to coastal land. Clause 10 gives the Minister the opportunity to change the time scale for map reviews. Clause 11 provides for regulations to be made under clauses 4 to 10, including the consultation procedures on maps, the forms of maps, appeals and so on. Clause 21 refers to regulations to exclude or restrict access for a number of days and the vexed issue of access on Saturdays, Sundays and bank holidays. Clause 23 deals with fire risks, clause 24 with nature conservation and clause 26 with national defence or national security. Clause 30 is a long catch-all provision.
<P>
Part I gives Ministers wide-ranging opportunities to make regulations and thereby control the implementation and enforcement of the Bill by secondary legislation. One might accept some of the examples that I have listed as being sufficiently minor to justify the negative resolution procedure, but that certainly does not apply to them all. As clause 40 applies to part I, it is an all-or-nothing situation. I therefore believe that the positive resolution procedure should be adopted. Ministers should not be able, effectively without debate, to make changes to the timetable for the reviews of maps, to make different arrangements for coastal land and to alter the number of access days. They are too major to leave to the negative procedure. The purpose of the amendment is that they should be considered under the affirmative procedure. I rest my case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Let me respond by spelling out the role of regulation which I am sure all members are aware. They provide for the practical details of procedures involved in the Bill's implementation. For example, clause 11 describes how regulations may be made on the preparation and publication of maps, the consultation process and the disposal of appeals. Similar provisions may be made under clause 30 on the giving of directions. Those are not matters of principle but of practicality. Similar provisions are found in countless Bills, which do not call for regulation on such matters to be affirmed by resolution by both Houses of Parliament.
<P>
As I have said, the core matters of principle have already been set out in the Bill—for example, the grounds for the giving of directions, the provision for rights of appeal, the stages in the preparation of maps of open country. In preparing regulations to deal with the detailed implementation of the Bill, we shall want to consult widely on the content of those regulations. The public will certainly have plenty of opportunity to consider and comment on them. I would certainly wish to consult the National Countryside Access Forum, among other bodies, and we shall certainly draw on the experience of the statutory countryside and conservation bodies.
<P>
The one example in the Bill where we agree that that affirmative resolution procedure in both Houses is appropriate—as the hon. Gentleman mentioned—relates to the extension of the right of access to coastal land. That is an important change, which raises a matter of principle. The other regulations, however, deal with practical issues that are qualitatively different from the issues raised by the extension of coastal access. Therefore, I see no need for regulations under part I to be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, bar the exception that I have just given. For those reasons, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. I did explain that some of the issues are sufficiently minor that the traditional negative procedure is adequate. However, I refer the Minister to the issue that he admits is a matter of principle. If clause 40 is left unamended, is it not possible that access to coastal land could be extended by negative resolution? If the Minister could either assure us that that assumption is incorrect or agree to amend it at a later date, we could make some progress. I am not in favour of negative resolution for the implementation of that clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> As I have said, it is not my intention that any extension to coastal land access should be made under the negative resolution procedure. The Bill will not permit that. Clause 40(3) makes specific provision for coastal borders. The Committee does not need to rely on the word of a Government Minister, the assurance can be found in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Obviously, neither the Minister nor I had got as far as subsection (3). I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

We now come to part II and enter the magical world of byways open to all traffic and roads used as public paths. My eyes tend to glaze over when I see acronyms, but I realise that in some circles they talk of little else but BOATs and RUPPs.
<P>
Clause 43 creates a new category of highway, a restricted byway. This will replace ways presently shown on local authorities' definitive maps as RUPPs. RUPPs are an inheritance from 1949 when local authorities were first required to record rights of way on definitive maps. The rights attached to RUPPs are not set out in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. Since 1968, local authorities have been under a duty to re-classify each of the RUPPs as either a footpath, a bridleway or a byway open to all traffic in accordance with the existing rights. Some authorities have failed to complete that task and some 4,000 miles of RUPPs remain. Those are valuable resources for walkers, horse riders and others, but the continued uncertainty over the rights existing over each RUPP is unsatisfactory.
<P>
The Bill removes that uncertainty for most users and reduces bureaucracy by removing the duty on local authorities to research each RUPP individually. The present legislation presumes that RUPPs carry at least bridleway rights. The new restricted byways that will replace RUPPs give statutory rights to walkers, cyclists, horse riders and drivers of horse-drawn vehicles. Those rights will not have to be researched and confirmed on a case-by-case basis and will be conferred by statute. That means that it will not be possible to downgrade a restricted byway to a footpath or bridleway.
<P>
It is possible that vehicular rights already exist over some RUPPs. Where they do exist, all vehicles, including motor vehicles, have a right to use the RUPP in question unless that right is subsequently extinguished by, for example, an order made under the Highways Act 1980. The Bill itself does not extinguish such rights, but evidence of their existence will have to be produced on a case-by-case basis, before the way may be shown on the definitive map as a byway open to all traffic. Current legislation enables people to apply to a local authority for an order modifying the map.
<P>
Government amendment No. 493 ensures for the purposes of clauses 43 to 48 that the term ``definitive map and statement'' covers all the types of map and statement that may be produced under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, including any consolidated maps that are prepared under the new provisions contained in paragraph 6 of schedule 5. These new provisions will enable local authorities to consolidate into a single map any parts of maps that they have inherited following local government boundary changes.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I acknowledge, as did the Under-Secretary, that we are turning a corner—if that is an appropriate metaphor in relation to the Bill—by moving to part II, which deals with linear access and movements. I agree with him that we must now get to grips with a different but equally confusing set of acronyms and technicalities. The Opposition also have a different criticism about part II. The previous part was to some extent divisive and here again, as with much of the Bill, we often agree on ends but disagree with the means by which the Government are seeking to achieve them. I am sure that all Committee members are at one on the end of rationalising complex, confusing and expensive circumstances in relation to byways that are not roads in the full sense. We were looking forward to seeing this part of the Bill, as we hoped that it would clear that up. Sadly, it makes a stab at doing so, but it does not go far enough in some respects and actively imposes more confusion in others.
<P>
It is not only Opposition Members who are concerned. I was interested to receive a submission from the Byways and Bridleways Trust and the National Federation of Bridleway Associations. They say that they strongly support the correct recording of highways for the benefit of all reasonable users, but they describe the Bill as a great disappointment to rights of way users. In words that I suspect will strike terror into the hearts of Government Back Benchers, they state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>there is very little of substance in it for anyone other than landowners, and absolutely nothing of value for horse riders.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That shows their disappointment in respect of the part of the arena with which they are concerned. Similarly, when we come to more detailed amendments, we will find that GLEAM-—the green lanes environmental action movement—-of which I am proud to be a member, is also disappointed. Although it welcomes in principle the move towards restricted byways, it believes that one of the great problems still to be addressed is the unfortunate and inappropriate use of motor vehicles on byways, which are best left to walkers, horse riders or cyclists. Government amendment No. 493 therefore seems relatively non-controversial. I am grateful for the Minister's explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> We are, as the hon. Member for Ashford said, entering uncharted territory—literally so in some instances. Neither side of the Committee would dispute that considerable disappointment has been expressed by several interest groups that part II of the Bill does not sufficiently clarify some long-standing issues of definition. The greatest disappointment is felt by the horse riding fraternity, which had expected great things, especially as the Minister said in the consultation paper that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government believes that there is a case for legislative action in eight main areas.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The first is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>encouraging the creation of new routes including more provision for cyclists and equestrians.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Unfortunately, that is not included in the Bill, which would have been the ideal opportunity.
<P>
Restricted byways have been largely welcomed. It is a useful new category. I ask the Minister whether there is scope for the new creation of restricted byways, or even dedication by individuals of paths with a restricted byway status. Why does the clause restrict the application of restricted byway to those RUPPs that have been maintained as RUPPs and does not seek to apply the same status to those RUPPs that have been reclassified as bridleways? I ask because the activities of carriage riders have been almost completely omitted from previous legislation. They were classified as vehicles, and excluded from bridleways—quite improperly when one realises that many of those roads were created for carriage and cart driving. There seems no logical reason why carriages should not be driven along them. The Government could, by accepting a simple amendment, correct that omission by applying the provisions of clause 43 not only to RUPPs but to carriage road footpaths, or carriage road bridleways as they have been defined in previous legislation, thus bringing everything into the same policy framework. That would be enormously welcomed by the many people who enjoy a growing leisure activity. It would provide new opportunities for recreation and for access and it would be entirely consistent with the principles of the Bill as enunciated by Ministers and which we hope that the Bill will achieve.
<P>
The Government amendment is straightforward. I have spoken about the matter now because the definitive map will show carriage road footpaths and carriage road bridleways, otherwise known by their acronyms of CUFs and CRBs. I ask the Government to consider whether that might be a small and useful amendment, which they could profitably pursue at a later stage. That would give great comfort to many people and encourage them. In no way would it detract from the principles of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): I want briefly to mention a constituent who has been to see me, and also a lobby. The hon. Member for Ashford has left the Room just as I was about to mention him. I am sorry about that. He said that the clause was fairly non-controversial. I would have asked him what he had done with the post from the lobbyists interested in mechanised access to the countryside—the motorcyclists and the 4x4 interest group. There has been a consistent lobby by them.
<P>
The constituent whom I want to mention is Andrew Bailey, a member of the Trail Riders Fellowship. He has been to see me with regard to the overnight reclassification of all roads used as public paths—RUPPs—to make them restricted byways instead of byways open to all traffic—BOATs. He accepts that his lobby group may seek to show, case by case, that it has evidence of a right to access by motorised vehicles.
<P>
Mr. Bailey tells me that his fellowship has conducted a survey of the reclassification of RUPPs. In the counties and districts of Bath and North East Somerset, Derbyshire, Hampshire, Isle of Wight, Nottinghamshire and Wiltshire, 80 per cent. of reclassifications have been to BOATs rather than to bridleways. He suggests that the Government are reversing the burden of proof against the fellowship's activities. He would rather see them change the burden of proof the other way and say that all such routes were BOATs unless somebody could show that motorised vehicles were excluded.
<P>
I wanted to mention that case to the Minister to show that not everything is sweetness and light outside the Room, even if it is inside. The hon. Member for Ashford is back now that I have mentioned his name. Never mind. I wanted him to know the fellowship's point. I must stress one last time how responsible Mr. Bailey and the fellowship are. He showed me the code of practice that all members sign up to. Nevertheless, I have told Mr. Bailey to his face that I do not agree with his argument and that I am happy with the present format, but I promised him that I would articulate the interests of his and similar organisations if nobody else was going to.
<P>
<B>Miss Anne McIntosh </B>(Vale of York): I seek clarification regarding RUPPs. Walkers and cyclists are able to use bridleways. Have the Government sought to omit the fact that there should be reciprocal arrangements to allow horse riders to enjoy equal use of cycle tracks? I am sure that the Under-Secretary is able to do two things at once and I hope that he will be able to satisfy me on that point. The case will have been made in written representations to other members of the Committee. Horse riders will seek to use cycle tracks, so they want clarification. Rights of way should not be interpreted through the amendment; they should be available to all horse users.
<P>
I seek to extend the general right for riders to harnessed horses. I am sure that other members of the Committee have received fancy photographs showing the way in which those horses would use rights of way. Following on from the comments of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, I would say that harnessed horses and horse riding generally have a role in the carriage of disabled people, especially disabled riders. Will the Under-Secretary extend the scope of the amendment so that a restricted byway might be interpreted as being open to use by disabled horse riders and harnessed riders? I would be grateful for clarification on those points.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I shall do my best as we enter these uncharted waters. I assume that everybody is in favour of the amendment. We will have the opportunity later to consider some of these issues again. I am sorry that some are disappointed by the amendment because the Government consider it a significant improvement on the existing arrangements. One of the present difficulties is that there are a large number of different types of users of bridle ways, byways and footpaths. They all have different and in some cases contradictory ambitions. Therefore, some disappointment, particularly among those who use motorised vehicles, is inevitable.
<P>
The hon. Member for the Vale of York (Miss McIntosh) asked about reciprocal arrangements for horse riders and cyclists. The new restricted byways, which will replace RUPPs, give statutory rights to walkers, cyclists, horse riders and drivers of horse drawn vehicles. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome asked about horse-drawn vehicles. They are included.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> The restricted byways are fine because all those types of vehicles are permitted to use them, but only equestrians, cyclists and walkers—and not carriage drivers—are permitted to use the carriage road bridleways, the old RUPPs that were downgraded to bridleways. The idea of the restricted byways is so good. The Minister should extend it to carriage road bridle ways and create new paths where appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We are sympathetic to the idea of creating new restricted byways. We are examining the idea.

<P>

<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> The point is that the public do not understand that the right will be extended to cover carriage users and horse riders. The public appear to be confused. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the matter by fine-tuning the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The new restricted byways, which replace RUPPs, give statutory rights to walkers, cyclists, horse riders and drivers of horse-drawn vehicles, so there is something for most of the categories. There are different kinds of cycle tracks and not all of them are suitable for horses. Some have been created by statute from footpaths and it will require some effort to turn them into bridleways. We can discuss these matters at a later date.
<P>
Entering a world of more acronyms, CRBs or CRFs, which are RUPPS, will be restricted byways. For those who are curious, a CRB is a RUPP with the characteristics of a footpath and a CRF is a RUPP with the characteristics of a bridleway.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I thought that I had left acronyms behind when I left the European Parliament. Will the Minister clarify whether both categories to which he has referred will be enjoyed by all users under his new restricted byway?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes, I am advised that they will.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> The Under-Secretary attempted to help towards the end of his remarks, and was helpful in relation to CRBs. However, he has not clarified whether—am sorry to labour the point but it is important—a path under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, which was subsequently reclassified as a bridleway under schedule 3 part III of the Countryside Act 1968 or under section 54 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, will be reclassified as a restricted byway and therefore open to carriage drivers. It would be helpful if such paths were reclassified because it would greatly extend the scope for carriage drivers on ways that were previously used both by equestrians and by carriage drivers, but which, by an accident of the legislative process, have been downgraded to bridleways almost by default when considering RUPPs. I do not think that the legislation does that, but I ask the Under-Secretary to consider the question because such a provision would improve the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for clarifying his point. He is right; the legislation does not do that, but I shall certainly discuss the matter with officials.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 43, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 44</center></H4>
<H4><center>RESTRICTED BYWAY RIGHTS</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 494, in page 24, line 27, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`; and subsection (1) applies accordingly to any way as so diverted, widened or extended.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may also consider the following: Amendment No. 556, in page 24, leave out lines 28 to 30.
<P>
Government amendment No. 495.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Government amendment No. 494 is a technical amendment. It ensures that, where a road used as a public path has been diverted, widened or extended, restricted byway rights are created over those parts. That is necessary because the legal changes to the RUPP might not be recorded on the definitive map before clauses 43 to 48 come into operation.
<P>
Government amendment No. 495 rewords clause 44(3), which currently prevents the creation of restricted byway rights over a RUPP where no highway exists. The amendment covers a further possibility. It ensures that where the position of a RUPP was incorrectly recorded and that error is put right, there will be restricted byway rights over the correct line of the way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Amendment No. 556 is a probing amendment. It would leave out clause 44(3), but perhaps the Under-Secretary can tell the Committee exactly what that subsection provides. Subsection (1) seems to provide that the public will have rights of way over any way that is described as a road used as a public path in a definitive map or statement, whereas subsection (3) provides that that right will not exist if the way is not a right of way. Why would a way feature on a definitive map or statement if no public right of way exists? That is the source of my puzzlement about why subsection (3) is necessary at all. In introducing the Government's amendment, the Under-Secretary referred to the possibility that ways might be incorrectly marked on maps. I cannot say that that would never happen but it seems unlikely, so the purpose of amendment No. 556 is simply to try to clarify why subsection (3) is necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Amendment No. 556 would remove subsection (3) from clause 44. It would remove the safeguards in that clause that prevent a restricted byway from being created over a RUPP that was recorded in error as there is no right of way at all. That hardly seems justified.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 495, in page 24, line 28, leave out from `apply' to end of line 30 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`to any way, or part of a way, over which immediately before the commencement of section 43 there was no public right of way.'.—[Mr. Mullin.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 557, in page 24, line 41, leave out `a right of way for mechanically propelled vehicles or'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider Government amendment No. 496.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The amendment deals with one of the central issues that exercises those most involved with part II, as the minister will know. I am referring to the problems of potentially inappropriate use of motorised vehicles on green lanes. I take the point made by the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) in my absence, which has subsequently been explained to me. Yes, those who want to conduct motorsport in the countryside are concerned about part II, and I accept that such people have a legitimate right to pursue such activities by agreement in some areas. What causes far more trouble than it is worth to all involved is allowing large motor vehicles—I refer especially to four-wheel-drive vehicles—to drive along green lanes. That applies even to smaller vehicles such as motorbikes. Such access can not only cause danger and damage but seriously affect the character of the green lanes in the long term, and I suspect that the Committee will agree that it is not sensible to allow it.
<P>
We want to remove the conflict that exists on the green lanes, which is why we have tabled this probing amendment. It deals with subsection (5) of the clause, but it should be understood in conjunction with the other subsections. The problem at stake is whether motorised vehicles can have intrinsic legal rights on restricted byways.
<P>
The problem goes back to a now notorious case that arose last November. In what is known as the Grimsall case, eight motorcyclists were prosecuted in Derbyshire for the alleged offence of driving on a bridleway contrary to section 34 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. The defendants admitted that they had ridden on the lane but were found not guilty, because the Road Traffic Act states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``bridleway'' means a way over which the public have the following, but no other, rights of way: a right of way on foot and a right of way on horseback and leading a horse, with or without a right to drive animals of any description along the way.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The defence claimed that because of the words ``but no other'', the prosecution had to prove that there were no higher rights. In other words, they had to prove that the lane did not carry vehicular rights, which means proving a negative. Despite the efforts of Derbyshire county council, which, as the highway authority, went through its old records, which did not show the existence of any rights higher than bridleway rights, it could not be argued that the vehicular rights could never be found.
<P>
Following the acquittal, motorcyclists can and do continue to ride along Grimsall lane, which is a bridleway. It is hard to believe that it was the intention of Parliament when it passed the legislation to allow such activities to continue. Indeed, the judgment seems to contradict the accepted presumption that Parliament does not intend to confer unrestricted power to amend primary legislation by way of delegated powers. It is clear that the magistrate was hampered by confusion over two aspects of the law. First, there was the civil law question of what rights exist over the highway, which must be decided on the balance of probabilities. Secondly, there was the criminal law question of whether the use of existing rights over the highway was lawful, which must be decided beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, the criminal test was influenced by civil considerations, which thwarted operation of the law. That confusion places the Crown Prosecution Service, the highways authority and the police in an untenable position. As such, no prosecutions now occur in similar cases.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am not seeking to stray from the point, Mr. Malins, but it is important to establish the background, so that we can explain what our amendment would do. By including the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>but no other rights of way,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
clause 44(4) will not close the loophole for bridleway rights that was opened by the Grimsall case. Indeed, it will extend the same loophole to restricted byway rights. In its existing form, clause 44(5) will courage confusion. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Subsection (1) is without prejudice to any question whether the public have over any way a right of way for mechanically propelled vehicles.
<P>
</UL></FONT>I freely accept that our amendment, which would remove part of that subsection, may not completely eliminate confusion, but if it were accepted, at least the clause would not reinforce what we know from practical experience to be a loophole that appears to thwart the will of Parliament to pass road traffic legislation.
<P>
I am aware that these matters are extremely difficult. I sympathise with Ministers and their officials, who seek to draft legislation that clearly states how confusion over the level of rights of way along restricted byways can be avoided. Perhaps Ministers can come up with a better formulation. For example, it has been suggested that our amendment could stop farmers using green lanes that may provide the only access to a field for, say, tractors. I doubt whether that is true, although I am willing to be guided by Ministers. However, I am certain that, as drafted, the clause will prove unsatisfactory. Not only will it fail to resolve existing problems—it will make them worse. If Ministers are not prepared to accept our amendment, I urge them to think again and produce an amendment of their own that would clarify matters.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I should like to support the principle behind the comments made by the hon. Member for Ashford. I am also a member of green lanes environmental action movement. Membership was conferred on me, although not, I am happy to say, in return for payment on my part. Nevertheless, the movement has kindly briefed me on the consequences of the provision.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman was right to draw attention to the Grimsall case. It is rather perverse to take an aspect of case law that has been shown to jeopardise the quiet enjoyment of bridleways, and apply the same loophole to new legislation and a new category of path. We should close the loophole in respect of restricted byways, and table further amendments that will close the loophole in respect of bridleways. It is simply unacceptable for motor vehicles of any kind to use bridleways by exercising what appears to be the current law. If the Road Traffic Act 1988 and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 must be amended to accommodate that, so be it.
<P>
I have technical concerns about the amendment, for exactly the reasons that the hon. Member for Ashford mentioned. We must sensibly accommodate those who require access to fields on either side of dwellings that may be approached only by a restricted byway. The principle must be right and I would be interested to hear what the Government intend to do to close that loophole.
<P>
The other point that I want to raise may seem contradictory, but is on behalf of those who engage in motor sport specifically rather than recreational use of motor vehicles. There may be a difficulty—perhaps the Minister can reassure me that that is not so—if a whole category of restricted byways is no longer available for use on those rare occasions when organised motor sport is in progress. For example, rally organisers may want to use such roads perhaps one day a year and that should be possible if the roads are suitable and the appropriate authorities are in agreement. I am not clear whether the clause or any other part of the Bill would permit that. I shall be interested to hear whether that is so and what would be the mechanism by which a motor sport organisation could obtain a licence to use a restricted byway under limited circumstances specifically for an organised sporting event, if that was appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I shall deal first with Government amendment No. 496, which can be disposed of simply. It merely makes a textual change to clause 44(6) so that consistent language is used in the Bill in relation to electrically assisted cycles.
<P>
Amendment No. 557 raises a serious issue and I believe that I can satisfy the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Ashford. He acknowledged that there are problems with the drafting of his amendment. It could exclude farm vehicles and it leaves in doubt what would happen to the rights because it does not state whether such rights would be extinguished. The purpose of introducing a new category of highway in place of roads used as public paths is to build on the existing presumption that they carry at least bridleway rights and give more certainty for walkers, horse riders, cyclists and drivers of horse-drawn carriages than the present legislation. There is no intention to remove existing rights. In some cases, they could be important for local people as well as visitors, so we have said that people who have evidence of pre-existing vehicular rights should be able to apply for a highway to be recorded as a byway open to all traffic. Those who take issue with the evidence will be able to object and to have their arguments heard. When there is evidence of vehicular use causing damage, it can be controlled by traffic regulation orders. Clause 58 extends current powers to make such orders.
<P>
Under the current system, road traffic regulation orders can be made to restrict use . We shall make it an offence to drive motor vehicles on restricted byways and an amendment to that effect will be tabled today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am glad that there will be a capacity to introduce road traffic orders to curtail use of motorised vehicles on inappropriate paths, but the problem is the architecture that comes with it. The difficulty is, first, the process that the local authority must go through to establish road traffic orders and, secondly, that they must then put up signs that may be inappropriate in a rural setting, green lane and so on. A more elegant solution is to have a presumption that works from the start for a class of road of that sort and then to make exceptions to it, rather than the other way round.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I note what the hon. Gentleman says. We do not intend to have lots of signs along these green lanes. We shall table an amendment today to improve the enforcement of traffic offences under section 34 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, which should go some way to helping him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The last intervention by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome was valid, but it seemed to cut the Minister off. The Minister said that he would table an amendment that would make it an offence to drive any motorised vehicle along a restricted byway. Is that where he was about to stop speaking anyway? Would that simply become an offence? Clearly that would take away any concept of inherited vehicular rights on restricted byways. That may be a welcome amendment, but it sounds very strong, which may not be as welcome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes, that will be the effect, unless one can show that there are pre-existing vehicular rights, but it will be up to the person claiming them to demonstrate that.
<P>
The amendments dealing with the Grimsall case will create a rebuttable presumption that where a definitive map shows, for example, a footpath, the way is to be treated as having only these rights. The same will apply to restricted byways. The amendments that we are in the process of tabling will go a long way to meeting the concerns of the hon. Member for Ashford.
<P>
On motor sports—news is flowing in even as I speak—clause 48 enables amendments to be made to the wide range of legislation that applies existing provisions to restrictions. Clause 46 prescribes private rights to drive on restricted byways. Has the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome got that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> That has nothing to do with what I asked.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> It is the best that I can do for the moment. If any further intelligence reaches me, I shall come back to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
I have to pinch myself to recall what we were discussing, but I think that I have dealt adequately with amendment No. 557.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that wide-ranging response, which was entirely justified. As I said, amendment No. 557 was intended to tease out profoundly important issues. I am grateful for his explanation that the Government are tabling amendments to address the issues of confusion caused by the Grimsall case and to tell everyone what a restricted byway is, as that will address what is at the heart of many of the problems. Not only are the definitions manifold and confusing, but nobody quite knows what they are or what they mean. If a restricted byway is clearly a piece of land on which one can walk, ride a horse, cycle or drive a horse-drawn carriage, that will be readily understood and, over time, many of the problems will be dealt with.
<P>
The Minister has also tried to deal with motor sport and possible amendments, where I suspect we shall have less success. Like the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, I am not sure that I am any less confused than I was before.
<P>
Skating quickly over that, I am grateful that the heart of our amendment seems to have been addressed by the Government. I will wait eagerly to see the Government amendments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> Amendment No. 522 is a technical amendment, backed by the Ramblers Association and others, to remedy an oversight in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Amendment No. 523 is consequential.
<P>
Under the reclassification provisions of the Countryside Act 1968, the intention was that all reclassified RUPPs should be publicly maintainable, however reclassified. We heard from the Minister a few moments ago that 4,000 miles of RUPPs remain to be classified. A similar provision appears in section 54 of the 1981 Act. However, the 1968 Act provisions on maintenance apply
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As from the date of publication of the definitive map and statement
<P>
</UL></FONT>in revised form. However, under the 1981 Act some of the reviews were abandoned, and the reclassification was effected by means of an order under section 55.
<P>
What does this all mean, I ask myself? I do not want to take any interventions on this. I believe that there was no publication of the definitive map and statement in a revised form. The important point is that the ways so classified are not automatically publicly maintainable and they should be. I am told that this simple amendment will clarify the law.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The clause ensures that a local highway authority will not be under a new obligation to provide a suitable surface for vehicles on a restricted byway that was formerly a road used as a public path. However, the clause is not intended to relieve highway authorities of any existing obligations. Therefore, Government amendment No. 497, with which I shall deal first, ensures that where the local highway authority was under an obligation to provide on a RUPP a suitable surface for vehicles—as is the case before clauses 44 and 45 take effect—the authority will continue to be under such an obligation.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 522 and 523 would make publicly maintainable any existing footpaths, bridleways or byways open to all traffic reclassified from RUPPs under the Countryside Act 1968, which did not become publicly maintainable at that time because the special review under which they were classified was abandoned. Have I got that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Good. It is not immediately clear what would be the cost of the amendment to local highway authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> Ah-ha!
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Here comes a ``however''. However, I accept that the intention of the 1968 Act was that the footpaths, bridleways and byways open to all traffic that were reclassified under the special reviews were to become publicly maintainable, Indeed, they were, where the reviews were complete and the definitive map published.
<P>
We shall consider my hon. Friend's amendments, but we will need to take account of the expenditure implications. In the meantime, I ask him to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> Given that my hon. Friend the Minister will give my point serious consideration, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 499.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Amendment No. 498 will require local authorities to record any restricted byways created from new, as opposed to those that, under clause 43, will replace roads used as public paths. It may be possible for local highway authorities to create restricted byways under the general powers contained in the Highways Act 1980. There may also be a case for giving local highway authorities specific powers to create restricted byways, broadly similar to existing powers to create new footpaths and bridleways. We are currently considering that.
<P>
Amendment No. 499 arises from the repeal of section 54 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 by clause 43. That clause relieves local authorities of their duty to reclassify each road used as a public path as a footpath, bridleway or byway open to all traffic. Section 54 will be repealed when clause 43 comes into operation. After the repeal, it will not be possible to downgrade a restricted byway to a footpath or bridleway, but the Bill does not prevent the modification of the definitive map to show a restricted byway as a byway open to all traffic, if there is evidence of pre-existing vehicular rights.
<P>
Amendment No. 499 does two things. It ensures that local authorities will not still be under an obligation to reclassify any RUPPs on the basis of evidence discovered before the repeal of the duty to reclassify. The amendment will also allow a person to apply, under section 53 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, for a restricted byway to be recorded on the definitive map as a byway open to all traffic, on the basis of evidence already considered by the local authority concerned. The purpose is to ensure that such evidence is not discounted merely because a local authority failed to act on it previously when required to do so by its duty to reclassify the RUPPs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I have just one question. The Minister said that amendment No. 499 would allow the reclassification of a restricted byway as a BOAT, if there were evidence of vehicular use. What period of time will apply to such evidence? Will it be the same 25-year period as for definitive maps or will it be indefinite? What period is the Minister considering for that upgrading?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> On amendment No. 499, I would say that what I said earlier about reclassified RUPPs would also apply here. It would reduce the number of outstanding issues considerably, and, I suspect, save local authorities a great deal of time and money.
<P>
With reference to amendment No. 498, I would say, in the gentlest possible way, that the Minister is still saying that local authorities may or may not be able to create new restricted byways. The Government should have resolved that issue, before the Bill reached the Committee stage. It is an important new category of byway, which, under certain circumstances, local authorities should be able to create. Amendment No. 498 would help in that process, but an early Government amendment to enable that creation to be specified in the Bill would be of great advantage to all of us and welcomed by many riders throughout the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> In reply to the question asked by the hon. Member for Ashford, any relevant evidence can provide the basis for the claim. We shall table amendments on a definitive cut-off date, so I cannot provide a figure, if that is what he wanted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Will the Government's amendment include a definitive number? That would be welcome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes, I am advised that it will.
<P>
I shall consider the point made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, but amendment No. 498 is necessary and if he believes that it has come too late in the day, I am sorry, but here it is.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill requires that authorities should keep a register of all applications for diversion and extinguishing orders made using the schedule 6 provisions. I believe that that principle could be extended to applications for definitive map modification orders. The purpose of the amendment is to require surveying authorities to keep a register of definitive map modification order applications. The provision of such a register would benefit users and landowners alike and would be a useful tool for those who want to check on unrecorded public rights—conveyancing solicitors, for example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The amendment would place a requirement on local highway authorities to keep an up-to-date record of applications for orders modifying the legal record of rights of way which local authorities are required to maintain. There is a similar requirement in schedule 6 concerning applications from land managers for orders closing or diverting footpaths or bridleways.
<P>
Although we are tabling extensive amendments to those provisions, the need to keep a register will remain. In principle, I agree that there could be advantages in having a similar register of applications for definitive map orders. I am prepared to consider the matter further if my hon. Friend is willing to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I hope that the Under-Secretary will say that he is going to table an amendment that will render ours unnecessary. That would be consistent with the previous set of amendments that he promised to table. Amendment No. 528 would prevent the use of a byway by non-mechanically propelled vehicles from giving rise to its use by mechanically propelled vehicles. In essence, the amendment, which covers some of the ground that we discussed earlier, would remove a potential anomaly by preventing inappropriate vehicles from using certain byways. However, the amendments that the Under-Secretary promised to table would perhaps deal with this issue by preventing false inheritance of rights, and I look to him for reassurance on that point.
<P>
Amendment No. 529 would simply tidy up the schedule by ensuring that restricted byways are included with bridleways in section 116 of the 1980 Act. However, I should be particularly interested to hear the Under-Secretary's comments on the issues raised by amendment No. 528.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Amendment No. 528 appears to seek to prevent the creation of rights of way for mechanically propelled vehicles other than through long use. It would apply to all highways and would not relate specifically to restricted byways. In fact, it would prevent the creation of any carriageway by deemed or implied dedication. At common law, carriageways are assumed to carry rights of way for all vehicles. Currently, it is not possible to create by implied or deemed dedication a carriageway by use of motor vehicles, as it is a criminal offence to drive on a footpath, bridleway or any other land without the owner's consent. Therefore, the only way in which a carriageway can be created at common law is through the use of vehicles that are not motorised. However, the amendment—which would prevent the creation of a carriageway, except by motorised use—would make that impossible.
<P>
I hope to persuade the hon. Member for Ashford that the amendment is unnecessary. Restricted byways are a statutory creation and there is no general public right to drive motor vehicles on them. Moreover, we are tabling amendments to schedule 8—which deals with the Road Traffic Act 1988—that will make driving on a restricted byway without lawful authority an offence. I hope that that deals with the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
More generally, the law relating to the creation of a highway by use depends on several factors. Use must have been unchallenged for several years by the landowner, for whom the law provides a number of safeguards. He can lock gates, or put up a notice stating that any use will not give rise to the creation of a highway. If the notice is torn down, he can give notice to the highway authority that he does not intend to allow the creation of a right of way. He can deposit maps with the highway authority, showing ways to whose creation he admits and, by their absence, those to which he does not admit.
<P>
The landowner has many ways to prevent implied or deemed dedication. It is difficult to overlook vehicles regularly using land, and even horses and carts are pretty visible. Indeed, drivers of horses and carts, who have welcomed the Government's proposal for restricted byways, commonly complain that few quiet highways are available to them. One reason is that, in practice, it is difficult for a vehicular highway to be created by use.
<P>
I assure the hon. Member for Ashford that the use of horses and carts on a restricted byway cannot create motorised vehicular rights, nor can the use of bridle ways by cyclists or the use of cycles on cycle tracks create such rights. Those are all statutory rights and they cannot give rise to higher rights by deemed dedication. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 529 would enable magistrates' courts to replace an extinguished highway with a restricted byway in addition to the existing power to replace it with a footpath or bridle way. The consequences will need to be carefully thought through. Some benefit may be gained from the amendment, so I undertake to consider it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary, not least because, as he described it, amendment No. 528 is rather more ingeniously all-embracing than I intended. I am grateful for him saying that the amendment may be unnecessary because the Government proposed to make further amendments and because there dedication upwards cannot be deemed. I am grateful that he is prepared to consider amendment No. 529 and perhaps come back to us on that matter; it is a small but important issue.

I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment No. 531, in page 26, line 16, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Amendments Nos. 504 and 505 widen the regulation-making power of clause 48. The statute book is peppered with references to rights of way and other highways. We concluded that the clause is not sufficiently wide to cover all the questions that may arise over this new category of highway. For example, restricted byways will be carriageways, in that horse-drawn vehicles can use them, but they will also be like bridleways in that there will be no public right to drive motor vehicles on them. Unlike for bridleways, land managers will not be able to apply to local authorities for permission to erect stiles or gates on restricted byways, nor will there be a right to plough them. It is not possible to go through existing legislation and identify all the changes that may be required and to make those changes in the Bill. Decisions will be required on whether a particular provision should apply and, if it is to apply, whether it should be modified.
<P>
Amendments No. 504 and 505 will enable such decisions to be taken and the appropriate amendments to be made to regulations. That will be additional to the more general power in clause 48 to make consequential amendments. The regulations will be subject to affirmative resolution, and Parliament will therefore have an opportunity to debate them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I appreciate the Minister's explanation. I do not wish to quibble over the need to ensure that the many pieces of legislation, which he rightly described as having had a pepper pot applied to them, are put right.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 530 and 531 are probing amendments. Amendment No. 530 would delete subsection (1)(a). The preamble to subsection (1) provides for the Secretary of State to make amendments, repeals or revocations. The Government amendment removes only the word ``make'' from the first line of the subsection. I am extremely dubious about the propriety of giving the Minister the power to revoke legislation, albeit by affirmative resolution. The clause seems to allow the Secretary of State to amend, repeal or revoke
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any enactment contained in an Act passed before or in the same Session as this Act.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government are requesting a very wide power. I am not certain of the propriety of that provision. As an aside, the amendment seems to screw up the grammar of subsection (1). It should probably have removed more than the word ``make''.
<P>
Amendment No. 531 is an attempt to discover what is meant by subsection (2). The provision seems completely at odds with the Minister's desire to speak in plain English. It seems to go back on itself; it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The amendment by this Act of any provision is without prejudice to the exercise in relation to that provision of the powers conferred by this section.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is without prejudice to providing powers given by the clause. This is a straightforward query about what that provision means, whether it is necessary and whether it could be made clearer. I cannot suggest a clearer description, as I do not have a clue what it means. I hope that the Minister will be able to put me out of my misery and explain more clearly what it refers to.
<P>
The major issue is that raised in amendment No. 530, which is the apparently wide-ranging power sought to repeal or revoke any other legislation.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> While the Minister is putting the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire out of his misery, perhaps he will extend a thought to me. I am still trying to come to terms with the explanation that I was given earlier about how the Bill will deal with organised motor sport taking place on restricted byways. How will clause 48 help in that? If what the Minister told me was the answer to my problem, amendment No. 504 doubtless will assist the process, but I cannot envisage that the RAC rally would apply for a change to be made to secondary legislation by the affirmative resolution of both Houses in order to carry out its activities.
<P>
I realise that I am in damper of sounding as if I support the unlimited use of restricted byways by motor vehicles. I do not. The restrictions on restricted byways are absolutely right, but everyone would agree that it is sometimes and in some circumstances right to allow such use, and I cannot for the life of me understand how clause 48 helps in that process. Perhaps it is because I am not grasping a self-evident truth rather than because of a deficiency in the explanation offered by the Under-Secretary.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> On the last point, far be it from me to suggest that the hon. Gentleman's understanding of the Bill is not adequate. On the contrary, he has demonstrated a clear grasp of most of the provisions. I said to him earlier that clause 48, which gives the Government power to make regulations to deal with eventualities that are not necessarily foreseeable, could cover his point regarding motor vehicles. He talked about vehicles used only one day a year or for a specific event.
<P>
I have difficulty reading other people's handwriting. No doubt that is the fault of my eyesight. I might have to write to the hon. Gentleman expanding on the point. I think that clause 48 could be used to cover the point that he mentioned.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire made a point about grammar that we shall certainly consider. He asked what the purpose of clause 48(2) was. Its purpose is to ensure that amendments to legislation may be made by regulation so that all possibilities are covered.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the propriety of the amendments. We are acting by affirmative order so it will be possible for Parliament to scrutinise measures case by case and to form an opinion of them at the time. We dare not predict all possible eventualities and that is why we had to table the amendments.

<P>
The amendment is simple and straightforward. The new Labour Government are a listening Government, are they not? It is clear from our discussions in Committee that the regulations to be introduced by the Secretary of State might be complex and difficult to grasp. There would be great merit in the Government accepting the amendment, which would oblige the Minister to consult relevant organisations before introducing regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I have heard what my hon. Friend has said but I am not sure that the amendment is the right or the only way in which to deal with the matter. It would require the Secretary of State to consult organisations representing users and potential users of restricted byways before making regulations under clause 48. If he finds such regulations complex, I can assure him that we do, too. I entirely accept the need for consultation and agree that consultation with interested organisations such as those mentioned would be extremely useful and desirable, but that need not be a statutory obligation. We will consult anyway and seek views more widely than the amendment would require. There is no question of our not seeking to consult fully and widely.
<P>
I also assure my hon. Friend that regulations will have to be approved by Parliament before they can take effect. There is no question of regulations, whether complex or not, not being properly consulted on or slipping through. I hope that my hon. Friend will feel that the requirements of the amendment are fully met on that basis.

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 547, in page 27, line 36, after `assessment', insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and the period within which such action is proposed to be taken'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is where we take a quantum leap forward, although next week we shall take a quantum leap backward to discuss the clauses that we have missed out. The amendment is straightforward and would require the local authority when it prepares and publishes the document known as the rights of way improvement plan—[Interruption.] Am I talking to myself? It would not be an unusual experience, especially at home. The amendment's sole purpose is to require the improvement plan not only to cover the matters set out in clause 53(1), (b) and (c), but to include a timetable according to which the highways authority expects to implement the plan.
<P>
Several times during our deliberations, we have seen that the time scale for the establishment of definitive rights of way has left a nasty taste in many people's mouths. It has already lasted for 50 years or so, and seems to be unlimited and to be subject to whatever the Minister proposes later in the Bill. There is a perfectly valid reason for the inclusion of a time scale in the improvement plans, simply so that we know roughly how long it will take an authority to do the work.
<P>
The amendment is perfectly straightforward and I am sure that the Minister will find it difficult to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said, the amendment is perfectly straightforward. The critical element that must be addressed is the resources that will be available to local authorities to enable them to do the work, which will affect its time scale and the effectiveness and efficiency with which it can be done. The Committee has discussed this subject in relation to the access responsibilities of local authorities. All the evidence shows that there is a huge deficiency in the resources applied by local authorities throughout the country to rights of way, the establishment of definitive maps, maintenance of rights of way, clearing of obstructions and all the various associated facets.
<P>
The rights of way improvement plans are significant, as they take us forward in providing a network of paths that will be available to walkers and, I hope, to riders, and should enable better access to the countryside. However, they will founder if they are subject to the same financial considerations that apply to so many footpath issues throughout the country. I do not blame local authorities for always having higher priorities, as it is inevitable that decisions will have to be made on how to apply restricted funds and that other issues such as education and social services will rightly take priority. However, if we are serious about making the Bill work, local authorities and the countryside bodies must have the necessary funds and a realistic time scale to translate the Government's intentions into reality. I suspect that the end is real but the means are not.
<P>
The Bill cannot tackle the matter directly. The Government must address it when they consider budget, including the development of the standard spending assessment and the way in which distribution mechanisms affect local authorities, especially in large, sparsely populated rural areas. Only if those elements are in place will we achieve some of the objectives that the Government have rightly set.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> We have just listened to an excellent quasi-ministerial speech that explained the difficulties of implementing the amendment. I do not completely follow it, but the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome made the valid point that if the Government set targets, they will have to will the means—the resources—and obtain agreement between colleagues to carry them through.
<P>
The amendment is simple. I support it in principle. The local highway authority would be required to set out a timetable for the implementation of the actions proposed in rights of way improvement plans. The Bill does not prevent that, but we intend to deal with the matter in statutory guidance that will be issued by the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales as a result of provisions in clause 54(1)(4). Local highway authorities should have programmes for meeting their statutory duties. There should not be an endless aspiration into the future. Programmes to maintain rights of way and keep them free from obstructions should have clear targets. The provisions on plans are designed to last a maximum of 10 years, after which they need to be reviewed.
<P>
However, there is an issue of flexibility. I am not disagreeing with the thrust of the amendment, but it is not always possible for a local authority to be able to stipulate when its proposals will be accomplished. Creations by agreement will take time to negotiate and depend on the landowner. Creations by order are subject to confirmation by the Secretary of State if there are objections to them. He might refuse to confirm an order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I will give way in a moment.
<P>
We would not want local authorities to be under an obligation to set out timetables in their plans if they cannot realistically be predicted. For those reasons, the matters are best left to statutory guidance. That will provide the necessary flexibility to ensure that highway authorities set robust targets for delivering what is within their control while allowing plans to take into account the circumstances when authorities are dependent on the consent or actions of others.
<P>
That is as far as I can go. I accept that we should be as predictive as possible. I said—inadvisably—a few weeks ago that the Bill is messy. There are a lot of uncertainties. The Government have to take account of all the contingencies and not just what is desirable. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be content with our alternative.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I wanted to challenge the Minister. I propose a statutory obligation on the authority to publish its projected timetable in the plans. My understanding is that that would not create a statutory obligation to adhere to it, although we should want authorities to do so.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister is right: there are many uncertainties. However, in the interest of concentrating minds on the fact that the plan needs to be executed, it would be preferable to oblige authorities—taking into account the sensible point made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome about the availability of resources, and the possibility of public inquiries and appeals—to publish, what they believed to be a realistic timetable: a guideline as to whether the plan would take two, five, 10 or 15 years. If unforeseen events should prevent the authority from sticking to the timetable, the law would not have been broken. It would require only the setting of the timetable in the first place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am attracted to the proposal. I am keen on the setting of robust, tight and, as we love to say in Whitehall, challenging targets, even though there can be no certainty of carrying them through. I do not think that it is good for statutory authorities to make predictions about achieving a target, unless there is a pretty good likelihood of doing so—otherwise plans can be brought into disrepute.
<P>
The guidance will certainly concentrate minds and there will be an express duty to take it into account. The guidance will take account of what the hon. Gentleman wants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I thank the Minister for that further clariflcation. Including the matter in the guidelines is a step forward, although I think that it would have been better to include it in the Bill. We shall have to wait to see how effective the arrangement will be. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I hope that this group of amendments is an attractive pick-and-mix selection of ways of improving clause 53. I recommend each, but not necessarily all, of them, as different ways of solving the same problem. While it is important that local authorities should establish improvement plans, it is also important that they should work within realistic parameters and that as wide as possible a group of people should contribute.
<P>
The simplistic danger to be avoided is thinking that more is better. That might not always be true. Proper account should always be taken of the interests of all those who would be directly affected by an improvement plan, including land managers—and not just those involved in agriculture, but others, who could work in forestry, horse keeping and breeding, or other diversified land-based businesses. Those might include farm shops, food processing or packaging or even recreational businesses. In the interests of all who have an economic interest in the land as well as those with a purely recreational interest, the network will need to be continuously modernised.
<P>
The Minister is free to pick from this group of amendments. Some suggest people whose needs should be met by the improvement plan, and others attempt to suggest some of the parameters that the local authority should have in mind when drawing up the plan. As I say, they all amount to much the same thing, but they suggest different ways of trying to achieve it.
<P>
If the amendments, or only some of them, are accepted, the improvement plans will be more realistic and more widely accepted. The plans are therefore more likely to be implemented with some enthusiasm. In the long run, making continuous improvements to the rights of way network would be more successful than if it was for ever being done against a background of grudging acceptance and foot-dragging resistance. If the amendments or something similar are accepted by the Government, the process of improvement will be simpler and better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that I have the opportunity to pick from a number of the delectable amendments that he floats before my eyes. They all aim to ensure that rights of way improvement plans take account of land managers' needs. Of course, I agree that they should. Amendment No. 548 would do so by adding land managers as a separate category to the list of members of the public who might be expected to use rights of way. Amendments Nos. 572 to 574 would add references to land managers and to the needs of land management.
<P>
The purpose of the new rights of way plans is to require local highway authorities to take a proactive approach to improving their rights of way network for the public benefit. That is our primary purpose, which is why clause 53 requires an assessment to be made of the public's needs. As the hon. Gentleman said, local authorities are already required to have regard to the needs of agriculture and forestry before making orders creating, diverting or closing rights of way, and that duty will apply when local authorities implement their plans.
<P>
Furthermore, before such orders can have legal effect, the interests of those who would be affected must be taken into account. We had that in mind in our consultation paper, which mentioned the needs of land managers in that context. However, that duty does not apply to some other rights of way functions, such as the duty to maintain them and the duty to prevent obstructions. Those duties are owed to the public at large. It does not seem quite right—for instance, when complying with the duty to remove unlawful obstructions—to weigh the public's interest in having them removed against the land manager's interest in having them remain. We must ask what is the appropriate focus and the proper balance.
<P>
We intend to draw attention in the statutory guidance to the importance to the local economy of a comprehensive and well-managed rights of way network. That will certainly include local businesses and farmers who are diversifying into tourist-related activities.
<P>
Clause 54 requires local authorities to consult interested people in the preparation of their plans. It clearly makes sense for local authorities to consult those whose land is affected by rights of way as well as those who use them. We shall amplify that in the guidance. However, I do not believe that a case can be made for giving land managers special treatment in the preparation of the plans over and above those who use rights of way, as suggested in the amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 549 is unnecessary to the extent that local authorities are expected to make an assessment of whether new rights of way are needed. If the intention is to require authorities to consider offsetting any right of way creations that might arise as a result of the assessment by closures, or to extend the network in the interests of land managers—I am not sure whether that is the hon. Gentleman's intention—it is not desirable. Local authorities should not be fettered by such considerations. If there is a case for more creations, that is fine, but we would expect a local authority to plan accordingly, irrespective of whether that would increase the size of its local network.
<P>
The ultimate safeguard for land managers and, indeed, for anyone else, is that they can object to any creation, diversion or closure orders with which they do not agree. The interests of landowners who will be affected must also be taken into account. We hope that the widespread consultation that authorities will undertake in preparing their plans will reduce such disputes, but the safeguards will exist if they are needed.
<P>
That was a somewhat lengthy response to the hon. Member for Ashford. I fully support the thrust of the amendment, but its structure would give undue consideration to one particular interest. We believe that the main consideration should be the interest of the public at large and, without wishing to diminish the importance of proper consultation with landowners, it is preferable that that should be undertaken within the wider structure of consultation set out in the Bill. I hope that that response will satisfy the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I did not regard his response as at all lengthy. He is always discursively courteous when he is saying no.
<P>
The argument that one should not have to consider the interests of a landowner who is creating an illegal obstruction does not bear a great deal of examination because, clearly, if landowners are behaving badly, indeed behaving illegally, their interests would not, and should not, be taken into account by authorities when they draw up improvement plans. Clearly, the Government's opinion is fixed. We shall read the guidance with great interest because it is very important that it strikes an appropriate balance between the different interests that will be affected by the improvement plans. Having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
