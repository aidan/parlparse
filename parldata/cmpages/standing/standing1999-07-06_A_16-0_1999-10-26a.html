<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: Government amendment No. 336.

<P>
Amendment No. 287, in page 26, line 17, leave out `dealing with' and insert `safeguarding the'.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 338 to 340.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> Before we adjourned, I was commenting on amendments Nos. 285 to 287, which were moved by Opposition Members, and on Government amendments Nos. 336 to 340. I was making the point that the position of the directors of contractors of the firm in question will depend on the circumstances of the case. For the Financial Services Authority to require those individuals to obtain approval, they would need to meet one of the three conditions in subsections (5), (6) or (7). Either they will be performing functions that enable them to exercise a significant influence on the affairs of the authorised person, as set out in subsection (5), or they will need to meet one of the conditions in subsections (6) or (7), which relate to dealing with customers and their property respectively. If they do not meet any of those conditions, there will be no justification for requiring their approval, given that people who perform similar functions under different types of arrangement are not subject to approval requirements. Given that the question of directors is already covered, I hope that Opposition Members will withdraw amendment No. 285.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 286 and 287 try to address the second and third conditions. With regard to amendment No. 286, it seems to me that, if a person is dealing ``for'' a customer, he must also be dealing ``with'' a customer''. The point that subsection (6) tries to address is that the function will require the person to have contact with the customer, and in connection with the carrying on of a regulated activity. We are talking about salespersons, advisers and intermediaries, who are often the kind of people who are currently registered with the Personal Investment Authority.
<P>
Amendment No. 287 relates to the third condition, which is not dissimilar to the second in terms of the protection it seeks to provide. However, where the second condition is aimed at direct contact with the customer, the third is aimed at circumstances in which the employee of the authorised firm is dealing with his or her assets. I use the term ``dealing'' in a general sense. It might mean safeguarding, as amendment No. 287 suggests, but it might also include receiving money from a customer—whether directly or indirectly—and using it to buy shares. Equally, it might cover selling shares and passing the money back. Again, there is a link to the carrying on of regulated activities. Here, we are considering people such as traders, stockbrokers and fund managers, who are often members of the Securities and Futures Authority and the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation.
<P>
I hope that that explanation may prove helpful. To sum up, if they were to have any effect, amendments Nos. 286 and 287 would probably redraw the boundary between the two conditions. However, I do not believe that, when taken together, the amendments would materially alter the overall impact of the provisions contained in subsections (6) and (7). They would widen the second condition but correspondingly narrow the third. I shall illustrate that through reference to the example cited by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton). He said that the example of an investment fund manager illustrates the need to amend clause 56(6), so that ``dealing with customers'' is changed to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``dealing with or for customers''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>However, such people will be covered under clause 56(7). As I said, where one amendment would indeed widen somewhat the second condition, the other would correspondingly narrow the third.
<P>
I shall now explain Government amendments Nos. 337 and 338, which also deal with the second and third conditions. Those conditions seek to address situations in which a person is dealing with consumers or their assets when what he is doing is, in effect, performing a function that gives rise to an authorisation requirement for the firm.
<P>
Our concern was that, as drafted, the second and third conditions were too wide. On the basis of the clause's current drafting, the FSA would be able to require the approval of an employee of an insurance company who gives advice on general—that is, non-life—insurance policies. That is because although giving advice on, for example, travel insurance, would not constitute a regulated activity, under current plans the advice is none the less given in connection with the regulated activity of effecting contracts of insurance which is carried on by the firm. That would be undesirable because if the same advice were given by a general insurance broker it would not fall within the scope of those arrangements.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 337 and 338 therefore seek to restrict controlled functions to those that are substantially connected with regulated activities, and they will remove the anomaly by pointing the definition of controlled functions to those functions that are part and parcel of carrying on the regulated activity. That is an important clarification of the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 336 simply removes a redundant word, ``directly'', which was originally intended to reinforce the degree of connection with regulated activities. There is a difficulty with that word because it would seem to preclude situations in which a person dealt indirectly—for example, if a solicitor obtained investment advice on behalf of his client from an authorised person, the authorised person may not deal directly with the customer, although he was clearly giving the customer advice and should therefore be covered by the provisions.
<P>
Finally, amendments Nos. 339 and 340 are minor amendments, which will tidy up the clause's definition of the word ``arrangement''.
<P>
I commend the amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I want to pose a couple of questions about the Financial Secretary's response. On amendment No. 285, he gave us an assurance that, as things stand, non-executive directors will be covered. We are happy to give that assurance the benefit of the doubt. However, the matter is, once again, dealt with in an implicit manner. Should not the situation be made clear in the Bill's terminology?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): My understanding was that non-executive directors would be covered only when their role in a business fell within the terms of the territory that was being controlled. The clause's present drafting may involve an attempt to have one's cake and eat it—it seeks to differentiate between non-executive directors who fall within the category and those who do not. I understand the logic, but the proposal would be a nightmare—such a director would have to know, when he accepts such a role, whether he met the relevant requirements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. We shall not force the point in relation to amendment No. 285, but it raises questions that should be addressed in more detail.
<P>
Earlier, I asked about overall disincentives relating to the involvement of non-executive directors, and I gave various quotations from senior figures in the City. Perhaps the Financial Secretary should further consider whether the clause's provisions could be improved. However, I appreciate that he has taken on board some of our points.
<P>
I am less convinced by the Financial Secretary's reasoning about amendments Nos. 286 and 287. I fail to agree that the phrases ``with'' and ``or for'' have the same meaning. I was not convinced by his discussion about how the proposal would affect a fund manager who could not be said to be dealing with a client whom he or she had never seen, corresponded with directly or spoken to. Does not the proposal lay the clause open to being misinterpreted by clever lawyers, who might try to wheedle out the requirements for someone's approval? Despite his attempts to explain, I cannot see what damage would be done by elaborating on ``with'' by adding ``or for''. The amendment is supposed to be helpful, because it is open to interpretation. It would apply particularly to fund managers who managed pooled fund investments, and who were not directly responsible to the underlying unit holders, because it might only be the sales or marketing staff, or a client relationship director, who dealt directly with customers. Subsection (6) does, after all, cover those ``dealing directly with customers''.
<P>
I have worked in the City as a fund manager, albeit one more used to dealing directly with clients. I have sat with colleagues who could not be interpreted as dealing directly with underlying clients, customers, or unit holders, but they were, to all intents and purposes, dealing for them because they were handling their money. If something were to go wrong with the investment, or some mischief were to be perpetrated, it would be the responsibility of the fund manager acting on behalf of that underlying client, but not acting with him. That is not supposed to be a pedantic differentiation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making a helpful point. However, the case that he has described would be covered by subsection (7), rather than by subsection (6). In order to persuade me of the need for an amendment, he would need to provide examples that ought to be, but are not, covered by either subsection (6) or subsection (7). The case that he has mentioned is covered by the stipulation in subsection (7)—that of the person dealing with property of customers. That would apply in the case that he describes.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful for that. However, the amendment would enhance subsection (6). Moreover, a different interpretation could be put on the matter if the Minister were minded, which he is not, to accept amendment No. 287, which inserts the words ``safeguarding the''.
<P>
The debate draws a fine line, and covers a grey area, but we are trying to close any possible loopholes. It would be absolutely clear that ``dealing for'' encompassed everybody. With a little extra thought, one could come up with some examples that would fall outside the provisions of subsections (6) and (7), although I cannot do so off the top of my head. I do not understand why our amendment is being rejected for the sake of a two-letter word and a three-letter word. That is a sum total of five letters, which is more than we have in some of our amendments. The amendment would constitute an improvement.
<P>
I am still not clear as to who is covered in back office operations. The Minister has given us some examples of senior people: a head of settlements, a compliance officer, the money-laundering officer, and the office manager. However, definitions are still needed. A new settlement clerk or a nominee company clerk, whose role was merely to collate the paperwork and fill in the correct wording—a purely administrative function—could be encompassed by the provisions because he was dealing with, not dealing in, the property of the underlying client. If the provisions were interpreted in that way, many tens of thousands of back office administration staff could be included in the full rigours to be applied to approved persons in controlled areas. I do not take that to be the intention of consultation document 26. If it is, the job of the FSA will be greatly multiplied—to well beyond the 157,000 people that the self-regulatory organisations already have on their registered lists.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should like to raise another issue that we shall probably discuss during the stand part debate. As the FSA gives its approval to a member of staff joining the firm in the first place, why is that not sufficient to cover the member of staff if he or she is moved to parallel roles within the same firm? A new approval will have to be obtained, with all the administrative burden and time delay that that entails. A member of staff who has been deemed to be fit and proper and has done his or her job within a firm honestly and with great integrity will have to seek approval all over again merely because they are moving into what is technically a slightly different area. That is unnecessarily bureaucratic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): Is that not an illustration of the extent to which the Bill appears to be moving beyond the fit and proper test? Such a test should simply say that a person has been deemed suitable, and that as long as he does not move into the front office, he can reasonably be moved around within the back office function. The Bill gives the FSA an intrusive power to veto such transfers of responsibility between individuals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> That is absolutely right. I am sure, Mr. Atkinson, that you would not want me fully to respond to the point now, because it is a matter for the stand part debate. However, it is an important principle that underlines the fundamental weaknesses of clause 56, which are increasingly evident as the debate progresses. The clause is very powerful, and has been somewhat overlooked. Can the Minister address some of the underlying issues before we decide whether we shall press the last two amendments in the group?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The clause is certainly important, and it is right that we should spend a good chunk of time on it during today's debates.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised a couple of points about executive directors in the course of an exchange with the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight). The clause deliberately does not specify the different types of person to whom it may refer—whether that is an employee, agent, subcontractor or whoever. Equally, it does not refer to non-executive directors. However, the clause has certainly been framed so as to cover non-executive directors who are in the kind of position that it describes. My point is that non-executive directors are not in any special category in this respect, but where they are exercising a function of the kind that is described, they will be covered by the form of the clause. The problem with giving examples in a clause such as this is that it might cast doubt on the examples that have not been included. That is why we have not specified the kinds of people to whom the clause refers.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the potential danger of bringing into the clause's embrace lots of back-office people who would not be covered by the existing arrangements. That is not our intention. Indeed, Government amendments Nos. 337 and 338 change the wording of subsections (6) and (7) so that they refer to ``a manner substantially connected'' with the carrying on of the regulated activity. The intention of that is to clarify that someone in a purely administrative back-office role would not be covered, whereas someone in a more influential position, who was more substantially connected with the activity, would be covered.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about how the system will operate, which reminded me of a point made this morning by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell). I apologise for not responding to it earlier. It concerned when the FSA would clarify how it intends this to operate. I understand that it expects to provide an account of the responses to consultation paper 26 in the first quarter of next year, which would set that out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Clearly, the Financial Secretary has considered the matter for some time. I noticed some encouraging nods from him while I was speaking earlier, so at least he is aware of our concerns. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I shall introduce the debate by concentrating on two main areas that were touched on but which require further comment. The first is the degree to which clause 56 appears to take over the responsibilities of firms, and to allocate matters to the FSA that should more properly be the responsibility of the firms and the employer. That is strange, given the comments on page 20 of consultation paper 26, which remind us that an earlier Treasury document, ``Overview of Financial Regulatory Reform'', states that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Regulation of the financial services industry should be directed first and foremost at the level of the firms operating in the industry. As now, the organised firm will continue to be the entity on which rules are imposed by the FSA, and which is responsible for complying with those rules and for the consequences of not doing so.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The document then argues that that justifies the FSA regulating and authorising directors and other senior members of the firm. It could also be used to support the concept that once the FSA has authorised those senior members, the firm—its directors and senior officers—should then be responsible for ensuring that more junior middle management conforms to the rules and standards required in the Bill.
<P>
I contrast that with what appears to be happening in the Bill, particularly clause 56. The FSA is introducing itself directly into the regulation of middle management in attempting to assess not only whether someone is a fit and proper person by ensuring that he has no record of dishonesty or of breaking rules elsewhere but also in trying to assess whether people are fit for the jobs and activities at the micro level. That is not only undesirable, but probably unworkable. It would be better if the FSA concentrated on regulating the firm and ensuring that it introduces and adheres to strict internal arrangements to ensure that its more junior staff conform to those standards.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> In that context, does my right hon. Friend agree that if the FSA purports to give someone a seal of approval on grounds of quality or suitability there is a danger of misleading the public? The public would rightly look to the FSA to ensure that those who operate in the industry have probity and comply with the rules, but a seal of approval for quality might be dangerous. Many of us listen to Classic FM which often has financial advertisements, after which a beguiling voice may say, ``Megabucks Ltd. is regulated by the Personal Investment Authority''. That tends to provide confidence in Megabucks Ltd. Does my right hon. Friend agree that we should be careful not to let that be abused?

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I agree with my right hon. and learned Friend, as usual. We are in danger of giving firms spurious acceptability—a sort of kite mark—which could mislead the public into supposing that everything that a firm says, advises and sells is of a high standard, when that may not be so. It would be an error if the FSA took on an unrealistic burden of regulation in erroneously raising public expectation and then failed, thereby making itself vulnerable to a charge of misleading the market or the public. A more modest level of regulation is desirable, allowing firms to regulate the lower level of management, as I suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): The right hon. Gentleman's point sounds reasonable—that the firm as a whole should be regulated and then have responsibility to regulate its staff and senior members of the firm—until we examine some of the cases that have arisen recently. Many involved fairly senior members of staff being outside the control of more senior members of the firm. The most notable was Barings, where Leeson was totally out of control and caused the bankruptcy of that very old bank. Similarly, at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International senior management did not exert sufficient control and things went wrong because a maverick lower down played the game according to his own rules.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to be assuming that in such cases the FSA would have been able to trip up middle management or the junior employee and to discover and stop what was happening. These were transgressions of the rules, but the regulator—however well funded and staffed—is probably taking on an impossible task. As a working assumption, it is better to impose the obligations on more senior managers and to ensure that they have internal procedures to prevent the incidents to which the hon. Gentleman referred. That is in line with the passage from which I quoted.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Such is my first general proposition, and it leads to my second question. Is the FSA adequately resourced to undertake checks and investigations at the requisite level—not only into the overall fitness of the individual, but into his fitness for the specific task allocated by the firm?
<P>
I refer again to consultation document 26, which asserts that the FSA will have three months to determine an application. That is too long. One of the reasons why we pressed so hard to allow the FSA to grant temporary authorisations was precisely so that individuals would not face long waits. Someone being recruited by a firm—perhaps from abroad, so the individual is unknown to the FSA or even to one of its sister regulators in other countries such as the United States—might have to wait some weeks before an in-depth investigation is carried out to establish whether the individual is a fit and proper person. Meanwhile, days are ticking by: the individual cannot do his job and the firm might be vulnerable because the requisite task is not being undertaken.
<P>
When the Economic Secretary and the Financial Secretary were recently appointed as Ministers in the Treasury, it would have been absurd if they had had to pass through a regulatory check that might have stopped them taking up their important posts for a week or two.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> We did. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friends are suggesting that that would have been good, but we are being generous this afternoon and we recognise that they are fit and proper people—in the overall sense, at least. [Laughter.] We may have to modify that judgment in the course of our proceedings, but this afternoon they appear to us to be well-qualified people. It might, however, have taken some days for that to be established beyond doubt, and in the meantime the Treasury would have been rudderless—an intolerable situation.
<P>
Exactly the same applies to many City firms, which might urgently require a senior employee whom they have recruited to carry out an allocated task. In those circumstances, having to wait for up to three months is simply unacceptable. It is intended, of course, that routine applications be processed in a matter of days, but I wonder how many applications are routine. We are facing a delay of between a few days and three months.
<P>
Will the Minister provide further information on the total number of people whom he believes will be authorised under the clause? Is he confident that that could be done by FSA staff at their present level, and will costs rise as a result? Will he also shed more light on the time scales involved? Of course, there is still to be consultation on those matters. We have learned that we often have to wait many months before receiving feedback on consultation documents. However, the Minister has an opportunity to express at least his hopes in that direction. The health of the City and its associated industries elsewhere in the country will very much depend on the efficiency and effectiveness with which the FSA discharges its functions under the clause. So, the more the Minister can tell us, the more we shall be reassured.
<P>
So far, all the pointers in the notes on clauses and the consultation document are that more people will fall to be regulated. The existing regulators have an uneven set of procedures, which are not consistent with one another. I accept that there is some merit in bringing them together and obtaining consistency. If that consistency is at the higher level of regulation, however, there will, almost by definition, be more individuals and more authorisations to carry out. That will put more strain on an organisation that is known to be short of staff at some levels and to have lost expert staff over the past few months. This is an important matter, and my hon. Friends might want to dilate further on it. I would certainly like the Minister to respond to my two general questions.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): I strongly agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory). I shall graft my comments on to his and concentrate on one particular point—how the clause ties in with the Bill's general structure.
<P>
In our debates, we have drawn out the fact that 150,000 to 200,000 people in the City will have to be regulated and approved within the meaning of the clause. As my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells showed, about 10,000 people change jobs every week—certainly every month. There is constant movement, so this will be a very active area for the FSA.
<P>
Within a substantial firm, compliance officers will require tight control to ensure that those who carry out transactions are suitably approved, as required in subsections (1) and (2). What are the legal consequences of failure to obtain approval? I have not checked later in the Bill to see whether it would give rise to a criminal penalty, but I expect that it does. I have no problem with that. What, however, is the effect on enforceability? Let us suppose that someone takes a practical part in effecting an investment transaction for a customer or consumer. For some reason or other, he might not be an approved person when he does so. How will clause 56 tie in with clauses 17—the general prohibition clause—and 24, which deals with enforceability? The opening sentence of clause 24 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``An agreement made by a person (``the provider'') in the course of carrying on a regulated activity in contravention of the general prohibition is unenforceable against the other party (``the purchaser'').''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 56 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``An authorised person (``A'') must ensure that no person performs a controlled function under an arrangement entered into by A in relation to the carrying on by A of a regulated activity, unless the Authority approves that arrangement.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``An authorised person (``A'') must take reasonable care to ensure that no person performs a controlled function under an arrangement entered into by a contractor of A in relation to the carrying on by A of a regulated activity, unless the Authority approves that arrangement.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Every time I read that I am reminded of the complex and detailed argument that is likely to be advanced on the construction of these clauses when the enforceability of an investment contract is considered by the courts. The FSA and the Treasury should consider that now so that whatever happens under the Bill is at least the intention of the Government. If, to try to clarify my question, an investment transaction is carried out on behalf of a business that is itself authorised by an executive who, for one reason or another, is not authorised, would that be construed as a breach of the general prohibition in clause 17 with the unenforceability consequences that arise under clause 24?
<P>
I need not labour the point, but it would worry me considerably if that is the Government's intention. It might lead to a quite disproportionately adverse consequence for the business in question. I should like the Minister to answer that rather than to hazard too many answers myself, but I will just point out one aspect. Subsection (2) says that an authorised person ``must take reasonable care''. The concept of reasonable care and negligence ties in to some extent with those negligence aspects of clause 24 dealing with enforceability.
<P>
It worries me that something that was carelessness, albeit in a complex and fast-moving area, should enable a perfectly innocent transaction to be rendered unenforceable in circumstances where the court did not have the discretion to allow it to be enforced. Thus what the Committee and you, Mr. Atkinson, will recognise as one of my persistent anxieties about the Bill surfaces in this important clause. I should be grateful for careful clarification, first, of the Government's intention and, secondly, of their belief as to the practical effects of the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As I am sure the Committee will be aware, the doctrine and practice of the approved person approach was started as an overreaction to the Maxwell pension scandal. The Investment Management Regulatory Organisation was severely attacked and asked why, when all the regulatory machinery had been set up, it could let something as bad as that happen. The instant answer was that if everyone with anything to do with OPM—other people's money—was made subject to a regime of fit and proper approval, it would solve the problem or at least transfer the blame from the regulator to someone else.
<P>
Clause 56 tries to take what is already there and to add to it and widen it in two respects. First, it in turn is a reaction to regulatory upset of the Barings collapse and the problems with the Morgan Grenfell European fund, when there were problems getting at those thought to be guilty. Therefore, the provision has widened considerably and seeks to include a mezzanine or marzipan layer of management.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): Marzanine.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Indeed. Such a layer is described in consultation paper 26.
<P>
There is a great deal of illusion in relation to the big picture. Potentially, 200,000 people may be involved. The process of establishing whether they are fit and proper will, in reality, be little more than a formality or, should it be conducted genuinely by getting lots of character references and so on, will be completely impractical.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard) asked about Mr. Leeson, who would easily have obtained approval under the new regime, as he worked in the right areas and was qualified. The mere fact of getting approved will not stop someone being a crook or doing something downright irresponsible and evil.
<P>
Widening the provision raises several problems that will grow into matters of considerable significance. Some of those matters have been touched on already.
<P>
As has been said, the Bill has been framed to be helpful to the position of non-executives. However, there is a complete lack of clarity about whether a potential non-executive should be an approved person. Non-executives who want to protect their rears must check with the FSA whether it feels that they ought to be approved. Given the Bill's lack of clarity, I would do that to protect my position.
<P>
Getting approval every time that senior people move around and change their function is completely otiose. An individual who has practised in the industry for a long time will clearly have sufficient expertise to change senior functions: that is how businesses work.
<P>
Has the FSA considered how clause 56 will apply? I assume that it will apply to all the financial services activities not covered previously. Hordes of bankers and some aspects of the insurance industry were not covered under the old regime. The mezzanine layer and large chunks of the industry will be brought into the approved persons regime.
<P>
Earlier, I drew attention to an important matter. The matrix approach of the FSA effectively ignores the legal corporate structures. Chief executives of American, German or other overseas financial services groups who are based in New York, Frankfurt or Hong Kong and give instructions to the British-based workers reporting to them, had better get approval under the regime, even though they are not physically in this country.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that? Consultation paper 26 certainly suggests that that is the intent behind clause 56. Should that be correct, it will be a major anti-competitiveness issue, as chief executives of firms in New York or elsewhere will certainly not want to commit potential criminal offences by not getting approved or having to abide by British regulations with which they are not familiar.
<P>
I shall go back to the beginning. The more I examine the approved person concept, the more I question it, along the lines mentioned by the right hon. Member for Wells. Going back to first principles suggests that someone who handles other people's money ought to be approved. In many other walks of life, individuals handle huge amounts of other people's money. Every senior civil servant in the Treasury and hundreds of thousands of people working in local government handle huge amounts of taxpayers' money. Is it deemed appropriate that such people go through some approval mechanism? Not at all.
<P>
The other issue is transparency. The exposure and punishment of wrongdoers is a powerful regulatory tool and discipline. The greatest irony of the matter is, as members of the Committee know, that IMRO reported on the Maxwell pensions scandal, but initially its report was not published because proceedings against the Maxwell sons were pending. That was all long ago but the report was never published. How on earth are we sitting here creating an enormous bureaucratic machine if, when serious wrongdoing occurs and a report is commissioned and produced, the public are not even told who did wrong and what they did? It is a ridiculous system.
<P>
We are concerned about clause 56 and want to get in right in the context of the Bill. We have made our suggestions as well as the key point that remuneration should be excluded. However, I have to say that the Government may have created something that, at best, becomes little more than an illusion—a formality—and, at worst, will gum up the financial services industry if serious attempts are made to vet fit and proper in a way that will do it severe damage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> We heard there the voice of someone who has experience of some of those things and is well placed to form a judgment on the effect of the clause as drafted.
<P>
The clause, so far as I can tell, gives the FSA a veto on the appointment of directors, salesmen, corporate finance managers and other senior line management in subsections (5), (6) and (7). All that is set out in greater detail in pages 23 and 23 of consultation document 26.
<P>
The problem with the clause is that the tentacles of the FSA can reach right to the heart of decision making in any business by addressing and influencing staffing and remuneration, two issues usually considered the function of management. In that sense, it is highly intrusive and takes a great deal of justifying.
<P>
The Treasury acknowledges that. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells referred to it when he said that in consultation document 26 the Treasury stated, in its overview of financial regulatory reform:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is not the role of regulators to try to run regulated businesses.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
But it later continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The regulator clearly needs however to have some direct influence over individuals in positions of senior management responsibility.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are now discussing that issue. We think that it has gone too far. I shall not labour another point that I have made previously, but the problem is in part a reflection of a failure to add competitiveness to the four objectives in clause 2 of the Bill which we discussed at such length.
<P>
What should the Government do about that? We have tabled amendments, most of which have not found favour. Without repeating arguments that we have already had, I shall outline the core ways in which the clause could be improved. First, a ``fit and proper'' test should be put back at the heart of the clause. Instead of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``unless the Authority approves that arrangement''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
an expression such as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``unless the Authority believes him or her to be fit and proper to do so''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
should be used. Incidentally—I would value a response from the Minister on this—there is a relationship between subsections (1) and (8). Subsection (8) deals with passporting and exempts from the provisions foreigners coming to the UK on a passport who have been deemed fit and proper by their home state regulator. That means that a German coming into Britain on a passport can be moved around within a firm in the UK, without further interference or regulation from the FSA, whereas a British person working in the same firm cannot do so and would be subject to oversight by the FSA. That is partly a consequence of the passporting agreements, but the wording of subsection (8) clearly suggests that the draftsman had in mind a ``fit and proper'' test and was not intending to go beyond what was set out in subsection (1).
<P>
Another crucial issue is that we must reintroduce the test of reasonableness throughout the clause. It is contained in subsection (2):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``An authorised person . . . must take reasonable care''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but not in subsection (1), which states merely that the authorised person ``must ensure'', rather than
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must take reasonable steps to ensure''<P>
</UL></FONT>.
<P>
I ask the Government to look at that issue and to bring the test of reasonableness back into the heart of the clause, along with the ``fit and proper'' test.
<P>
My third point has already been debated and I shall not labour it. Provision must be made in the Bill for temporary interim appointments before authorisation has been obtained. It is not acceptable for the City to endure the situation that we discussed this morning. Fourthly, we need to establish in the clause the principle that the individual is being cleared, as has been discussed at length by my hon. Friends. We need to distinguish much more clearly between the job and the person, which we have not so far done. Once an individual has been shown to be an upright character who fulfils the test of being a fit and proper person, he should be able to move around within a firm without having to go back for further authorisation, unless he is moved from the back to the front office, as it were, to deal with customers. I am trying to draw a distinction between someone being capable of doing a good job and someone being honest and upright and in that sense appropriate for a job.
<P>
The FSA should not get in any way involved in the question of whether someone is capable of fulfilling a job, but under the clause, it would. To take a reductio ad absurdum example: let us imagine that the Archbishop of Canterbury, who is clearly a man of upright standing and great integrity, passed the necessary exams, got a job in a firm and was then moved to another job within the firm. He is clearly a fit and proper chap, but he would have to be referred to the FSA for clearance when moved from one job within the firm to another, even though everyone is agreed that he is a fit and proper person. That would be a nonsense. The example that I gave was a reductio ad absurdum, and it goes to show that the Bill can deal with many such problems by recourse to principles that are already well established in law.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall end by illustrating of some of the problems that putting such an enormous power of approval in the hands of the FSA might create. As I said earlier, the intrusiveness that the FSA is at liberty to exercise in the running of a company goes to the heart of the clause's difficulties. The FSA has an effective veto over many staff appointments—it can restrict who can be employed, what they can do when they are employed and whether they can move from one job to another. It would say, of course, that it does not want to exercise those powers in the generality of cases, but it does have them.
<P>
Those powers are normally considered to be the responsibility of directors. One might illustrate the intrusiveness of those powers by imagining a firm that is near insolvency. It might decide that it urgently needs to move one of its key staff from one back office area to another, but it might find that it did not get immediate permission to do so—some weeks or months might go by, during which time it might be forced into insolvency. For example, a clearing bank might be worried that it will not get its money back on a loan, and it might decide to tell a firm that it must change its staffing arrangements in order to survive, but the firm might none the less go under. At that point, the clearing bank might, under current law and the Companies Acts, find itself liable to the creditors because it had acquired the role of being a shadow director. There is a risk that we might allow the FSA to acquire the role of being a shadow director. I do not know whether that is possible, but the Government should give a serious response to my question. In particular, we need to know whether the FSA has received careful legal advice on this matter.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Does that mean that the FSA, as an approved person, would have to approve itself as a corporate director?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I cannot answer my hon. Friend's question, which is far too sophisticated for me. Clearly, that situation would be nonsensical.
<P>
I want to develop my argument further. This afternoon, I examined the criteria by which the status of shadow directorships are assessed by the courts. I got hold of ``Tolley's Company Law'', from which I want to read a couple of short passages. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in practice the most obvious situation in which a board becomes accustomed to follow the dictates of an outsider is one where there will be some penalty for non-compliance either against the directors personally, or against the company itself.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That might be relevant to a company that cannot move staff to try to avoid insolvency because it cannot get authorisation, although the relevant man or woman satisfies the relevant tests.
<P>
Similarly, a very important judgment was made in 1994. Mr. Justice Millett, who is now a Law Lord, said that the crucial element that is needed to assess whether a shadow directorship had been created involved
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a pattern of behaviour in which the board did not exercise any discretion or judgment of its own, but acted in accordance with the directions of others.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, that is at least part of the way towards a definition of a shadow directorship that the FSA should be concerned that it might eventually fulfil. Of course, the FSA will not be sueable because paragraph 19 to schedule 1 will grant it immunity from all such liability, although I am uncertain whether it is right to do so. If shadow directorship were proved, it would, in effect, become the only shadow director who is not liable for his actions. I should be interested to hear the Financial Secretary's response to that point.
<P>
Looking at the clause in perspective, the Government are going overboard in their effort to deal with a few high-profile cases, particularly Barings. This is a classic case of framing a heavy-handed clause to deal with a small number of cases, and thereby damaging the broader market. In giving evidence to the Joint Committee on Financial Services and Markets, chaired by Lord Burns, Alastair Ross Goobey, who is head of Britain's biggest pension fund, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I am concerned that there will inevitably be a tendency to err on the side of reducing the risk to the regulator at the expense of the regulated.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is exactly what the clause will do.
<P>
What can the Government do about it? I shall summarise the suggestions that I made earlier by saying that they should reintroduce a reasonableness test throughout; permit approved persons to move around within firms, certainly within back offices; and, above all, restore the fit and proper test to the heart of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I echo many of the points made by my right hon. and hon. Friends, but there are perhaps a few extra points that I can make. I should underline the fact that part of the problem in discussing the clause's inadequacies relates to the timing of the Bill and the consultation exercise. Consultation paper 26 was published as recently as the end of July, and the consultation period finished less than two weeks ago. We do not know the results of that exercise. The Government have given no interim indications of the responses; nor have they said how their thinking, or the FSA's thinking, is evolving. We in Committee are desperately scrabbling around, trying to scrutinise legislation that will become part of the Act, but we do not have a full story on which to base our deliberations.
<P>
I echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie), concerning the FSA's becoming a shadow director and taking over many roles that, until now, have been the duties and privileges of a firm's management. When the matter came to light, it rather took the financial services industry by surprise. When CP 26, which was published just before the summer recess, was written in headline form in the Financial Times, it received some alarming and negative responses. The Financial Times wrote in terms of individual directors and senior managers being personally liable and subject to fines, and of people having to be vetted by the authority before taking up their jobs. People such as Peter Vipond, a director of the British Bankers Association, appeared before the Burns committee and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury prayed in aid that association in support of the Bill yesterday. The tenor of the hon. Lady's comments yesterday does not concur with the tenor of Peter Vipond's comment in response to CP26. He said that the Government's intentions are becoming clear and that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It provides tremendous opportunity for regulators to start to second-guess the management and the code of conduct for senior managers set up an ``open-ended'' ability to interfere with the way companies were run.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He was right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain how he got to the point of believing that the FSA will be a shadow authority or that the lurid fears that have just been read out will arise from a provision that requires the FSA to be assured that someone is properly qualified for the job, is properly experienced and has integrity? Those are the essential tests that will be applied when issuing approval. How do we get to the magnified scaremongering that we are hearing so much about?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The hon. Gentleman has clearly not been listening to the debate. The potential powers of the FSA and the number of people over which it can now exercise those powers are greatly more powerful than at the moment. Simply to write off as lurid the comments of respectable members of the financial services community in the City whom he questioned before the Burns committee is not helpful to our debate. Those people have greater experience of the financial services industry over many years than he and I put together. To accuse them of scaremongering and using ``lurid'' language is patronising to the whole financial services industry. He and I know, and the Financial Secretary and Economic Secretary have been at pains to point out, the importance of that industry. The hon. Gentleman is not up to the mark.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, distinguished as the people to whom he referred are, they represented a minority of those responding to the Government's progress report on the acceptability of the provisions in part V? The Burns report states in paragraph 159:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``According to the Progress Report, `The need for the FSA to be equipped with a range of disciplinary powers was generally accepted by consultees'.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does that not confirm that the hon. Gentleman is talking about a minority of those who gave views to the joint committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> It does not. The hon. Gentleman's timing is wrong, because the progress report was produced well before CP26. The Burns committee did not have the facility to examine all the implications of giving approval as now laid down in CP26. The committee had finished its work before the consultation paper was produced. The Government's response document was produced well before July, when CP26 was produced, so the hon. Gentleman's timing is higgledy-piggledy. That was news at the end of July and it hit the City hard. Many experts in the City were taken by surprise. The hon. Gentleman has no grounds for suggesting that only a minority responded because there was not a large number of suggestions. If the hon. Gentleman was privy to the consultation findings, I should be interested to know and even more interested to know why the remainder of the Committee has not been privy to the consultation exercise that closed on 15 October. The hon. Gentleman must do a little better.
<P>
I am concerned about the blanket power that is being given because, whether the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford likes it or not, it goes well beyond a fit and proper test. It gives the FSA the ability to control firms by giving it power over whom the firm takes on to its books. It is clearly laid down in CP26 that the regulations will apply to a whole new mezzanine or marzipan—or whatever one wants to call it—layer of people who have not been covered in the past. It is crazy for approval to be dealt with at two levels. I am sure that all members of the Committee agree that the terms and conditions for initial approval should be closely scrutinised at the outset. However, it is absurd that on the second level, after a person has been deemed to have gained approval and been taken on by a firm, that when the firm wants to switch him or her to another role within the firm the entire process has to be gone through again. That grates somewhat with what the Prime Minister has led us to believe. He has indicated that he is in favour of the principle that regulation should not be imposed if the same objective can be reached in another way.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On that basis, would it not be more appropriate for the FSA to impose responsibility on the firm to ensure that its back office, its senior management and all the marzipan layers of its staff operate properly, while maintaining a reserve power to penalise individuals who fall short of the standard that is required by the FSA and the firms themselves?
<P>
It seems that the FSA does not have to provide full reasons as to why it is not giving approval and, in any case, it can move the goalposts. The terms of CP 26 can be changed at any time by the FSA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> That is purely indicative.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> It is indeed. Furthermore, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, the clause is not restricted in its territorial scope. For example, the FSA is apparently to be given the power to require approval for United States customer sales representatives in the US branches of a US bank merely because it happens to have an office in the UK. That is hardly an incentive for foreign firms to continue to do business in the UK financial services industry. It should not be the case that a person who has gained approval and taken reasonable care in the execution of his or her duties can be criminalised for taking that care.
<P>
I should like to ask the Minister a few questions about CP 26. Page 6 of the document refers to a breach
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``where the individual's standard of behaviour was below that which the FSA could reasonably expect''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What does that mean? The definitions of what the FSA should reasonably expect are goalposts to be shifted as and when it sees fit. On page 7 we are promised a cost-benefit analysis, which has not yet appeared. When are we to have it? My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire asked a similar question about the production of various rule books. Pages 22 and 23 refer to the problems involved in considering the roles of the managers—

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Can my hon. Friend enlighten me as to whether the cost-benefit analysis is to apply to the FSA, to firms in the industry or to both?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I would redirect that question to the Minister. I hope that it will be the latter—although the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford, judging from his earlier comments, may prefer it to be the former.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The only meaningful analysis would be based on the full compliance costs burden on the industry, and I hope that that is what we are going to get from the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I hope so, too. The ultimate indicator will be the underlying cost to the consumer, who will pick up the tab for all this while simultaneously being potentially exposed by not having somebody looking after his or her assets because of the administrative and bureaucratic technicalities that we have already discussed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I want to put it on the record that the full cost benefit analysis should not merely be of the cost of running a compliance department, but also of the opportunity cost of whatever a business might consider that it has forgone as a result of the need to obey the regulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I hope that we end up with consistent and meaningful cost benefit analysis figures.
<P>
Can the Financial Secretary give a progress report on the inclusion of proprietary traders, which is left open in the consultation document? I reiterate that page 25 of CP 26 referred to the requirement for the FSA to notify whether approval has been granted within 14 days of a takeover of a firm. That raises serious questions about the capability of firms to take over UK firms without being left with a bunch of duff, unlicensed staff on their books. Is there any facility within the terms—I cannot find them—for giving prior approval, in confidence, to a firm that is considering the takeover of or merger with a UK company? If not, there would be a real problem in terms of an effective takeover taking place. Page 33 of CP 26 shows that the Bill does not define which matters the FSA should take into account when determining fitness and propriety.
<P>
Clause 56, which is probably one of the most important clauses that we have debated, contains serious flaws. Labour Members have been impervious to taking up our concerns or to adopting any of the helpful though not hugely significant amendments. As the debate progressed, I increasingly felt that we had missed the opportunity to table more weighty and far-reaching amendments. We shall introduce such amendments on Report if the Government fail to take on board our concerns.
<P>
Ultimately, only one company involved in the financial services industry will be immune from all the fit and proper requirements for reasonable or proper behaviour, and, with a few senior exceptions, from outside influences on who they employ—the FSA itself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> In response to the hon. Members for East Worthing and Shoreham and for Chichester, we are not going overboard with this legislation. We are restoring confidence in the financial services industry, which is a task that must be addressed urgently. The industry has received some severe knocks—Barings, pensions mis-selling and Maxwell—and the existing patchwork, fragmented system of regulation has not been capable of restoring confidence, which is why the new arrangement in the Bill is necessary. The financial services industry has welcomed our approach, as confidence in the way it is regulated is in its interests. My hon. Friends referred to the reactions of those who gave evidence to the Burns committee, which has been misleadingly presented by Opposition Members. As a creature of statute, the FSA will be required to act reasonably in everything that it does.
<P>
I should like to defend the Front-Bench colleagues of the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham from his attack on the inadequacy of their amendments. They provided some useful opportunities for debate, and a number of the points that they made have been taken on board. I started to wonder about the direction in which the Opposition Front Bench was taking the Committee when the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs launched what sounded like an attack on the idea of having a dedicated regulatory regime for financial services. He said that those in the industry ought to be treated in the same way as people who deal with public money in local government and elsewhere. That was an interesting idea, although not, as far as I know, the policy of his party. Perhaps he would like to intervene, in order to elaborate on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> It is appropriate in a stand part debate to step back from the clause and to ask why it is there, how effective it will be and what is the logic behind it.
<P>
The simple logic is that people who handle other people's money should be subject to a regime that checks that they are fit and proper people. Why does the argument stand up that people handling other people's money in the private sector should be subject to this requirement, but that those in the public sector should not? What is the logic behind that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting question. It was my understanding that there was no difference between our parties on the need for a dedicated regulation regime for financial services. I presume that that is why the hon. Gentleman did not leave his party to vote against Second Reading of the Bill. He raises some fundamental and interesting questions, but it is generally recognised that there needs to be a good, robust regulatory regime for the financial services industry, in the interests of the industry as much as in the interests of its customers.
<P>
Clause 56 is a key clause, and we have had a number of debates about its subsections. I shall say a few words about the background for its inclusion in the Bill. First, the clause, in subsection (1), places an obligation on authorised persons not to allow a person to perform controlled functions on their behalf without the approval of the FSA. The intention is to require an authorised person to obtain the FSA's approval before it employs a person to carry out certain functions. The drafting is intended to catch a wider set of arrangements than a simple contract of employment.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells, in opening this debate, quoted from the Treasury overview of financial regulatory reform on page 20 of the consultation document CP26, about which we have heard a great deal during the last hour or so. I refer him to page 25, where there is a further quotation from the same Treasury document, which quite rightly makes the point that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The potential also exists for other employees, for example salespersons, to put the interests of consumers at risk. The existing rules and practices of the SROs extend regulation to employees in these positions. The Government intends to provide the same level of protection in the new legislation, recognising at the same time of course that the primary responsibility for ensuring that employees are competent and act properly must lie with management.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the basis on which this legislation has been drawn up. It is entirely consistent with the Treasury overview and with the approach that we have spelt out from the start. My hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford was right to say that one cannot simply assume that if one sorts out the people at the top of an organisation, one need not worry about anyone else. We can all think of numerous examples that demonstrate the rightness of that point.
<P>
Senior managers have responsibility for ensuring that the firms that they manage meet the high standards that we expect of firms operating in the financial services sector in the United Kingdom. That is entirely consistent with the thinking underlying the statutory duties being given to the FSA, especially the market confidence objective defined in clause 3, and the principle in section 2(3)(b) that the FSA should have specific regard to the responsibilities of those who manage the affairs of authorised persons. But they also have a role to play in the protection of consumers and in helping to reduce financial crime.
<P>
We should expect high standards among managers if the standards that we expect of the authorised persons themselves are to be met. There is nothing new in that. The various existing regulatory regimes have arrangements in place for vetting the senior management of firms. The Bill puts those arrangements on a consistent basis. Several points have been presented to the Committee, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford accurately put it, were rather lurid. In response, I should say that there is nothing fundamentally new in the proposals. What is different is that we are putting existing arrangements on a consistent and rational statutory basis.
<P>
It is not only senior managers who need to meet high standards—other people in firms can influence their behaviour. We are familiar with that and with the way in which over-eager pensions advisers, who were anxious to meet sales targets, encouraged thousands of people to switch from occupational to personal pensions, contrary to their best interests.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> How could the Minister possibly argue that there is nothing new when it is clear that the existing test is a fit and proper one and that the clause goes way beyond it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> There is still a fit and proper test in clause 58(1). I shall return in a moment to the points that the hon. Gentleman made in his speech.
<P>
Providing the FSA with powers to identify key posts within the carefully defined parameters set out in the clause will enable it to ensure that standards are maintained and that those who occupy relevant positions are fit to perform the functions for which they have been engaged. There is nothing fundamentally new in that, because, as I said, the existing regulators have arrangements for registering sales persons and traders among others.
<P>
It is important to note that there is a need for vetting because of requirements under various EC directives on investments, deposit taking and insurance. In the clause, we are building on the inconsistent patchwork of the existing regulators' powers. That is why the proposals do not represent as much of a shift from the current position as they might at first appear to do. Many in the banking and insurance industry—not just senior managers—are already subject to registration by virtue of their membership of the SROs in respect of the investment business that they carry on.
<P>
At the beginning of the debate, the right hon. Member for Wells asked whether I was satisfied that the FSA had enough people for the work that it was taking on, and he made a similar point in an earlier sitting. I am satisfied that that is the case. The FSA has 48 people working on the regulation of approved persons. We do not expect that number to change. The number of people covered will be broadly the same as that now regulated by the nine separate regulators which are being merged into the FSA. The total number of staff covered is about 150,000 to 200,000, including 157,000 who were registered by the SROs and 27,000 who were registered by the statutory regulators. There is considerable overlap between those figures, which the Bill will, of course, eliminate. The FSA and its constituent organisations have enough staff to cope with demand and should be able to cope with future applications, which we expect to run at about 2,000 per month.
<P>
The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire asked about the consequences of failure to obtain approval. The discipline for a firm in the circumstances that the right hon. and learned Gentleman described would arise under part XIII. There would not be a criminal offence. The employment of an unapproved person is not a breach of the general prohibition, but a disciplinary matter. So the unenforceability provisions of clause 24, to which the right hon. and learned Gentleman referred, do not apply.
<P>
Opposition Members raised the issue of the FSA and managers of the overseas staff of UK firms. As the home state regulator for UK firms, the FSA will be responsible for the global operations of the authorised person. That will require it to take an interest in the firm's activities in overseas jurisdictions. That means that in some circumstances the FSA may need to require certain overseas staff of UK firms to be subject to approval under part V, depending on the circumstances of each case. Equally, the FSA has received comments on CP26 about the position of overseas companies operating in the UK. It is looking at that area in the light of those comments. 
<P>
Vetting arrangements are becoming increasingly commonplace around the world. It was suggested that they were unique to the UK, but they feature in a number of EC directives on financial services, and regulators in the US are also pursuing similar policies.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham put a point to me that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs raised earlier. They asked why people who simply change from one job to another should need to go back to square one and seek approval all over again. The FSA wants a simpler procedure for new approvals once people have been vetted initially. That is one of the issues being dealt with on consultation. That will help to deal with their point.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chichester asked on a number of occasions for us to go back to a fit and proper test. I have already drawn his attention to clause 58(1), which makes it clear that the criterion that the FSA will use to grant an application for a person to be approved to perform a controlled function is whether he is a ``fit and proper person'' to do so.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The existing law puts the limit at the fit and proper test. The clause provides that that is a base line, on top of which it builds several other discretions that are exercisable by the FSA. I query those additions. May we look at the clause with a view to going back to a fit and proper test and replicating what is in existing law, which the Minister said was the intention and, indeed, largely the outcome of the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, I cannot do that because the requirements for different types of position will differ. The FSA will need to bear in mind what is being applied for when determining whether to approve an arrangement. That is right. There is nothing particularly novel or innovative about the proposal. The current arrangements also have that feature. The hon. Gentleman was also concerned that the FSA might become a shadow director of some companies. But if that were so—one of the lurid consequences that my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford referred to—it would have been the same for the existing regulator who currently has a statutory power to impose requirements on firms.
<P>
The FSA is not being given powers to run companies. The powers that it exercises under the terms of the Bill will be of a piece with the powers that have been exercised by regulators in the past. The FSA published CP26 setting out details of the people that it expects to require to be subject to these approval arrangements. A clear message in that document, with which I entirely agree, is that it is the responsibility of firms for their benefit, as well as that of their shareholders and customers, to ensure that they recruit the right people for the job.
<P>
The financial services industry supports both those objectives and the practical approach that has been followed to achieve them in this clause and throughout the Bill. The approach is consistent with the principle in clause 2(3)(c) that burdens and restrictions imposed by regulation should be proportionate to the benefits. In limiting the approval requirement to controlled functions, we are helping to ensure that the arrangements should not interfere with that principle. In cases where approval is required, the application process should be quick and smooth for most of the firms and individuals concerned.
<P>
I therefore commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful for the Financial Secretary's response to our questions. However, I remain unsatisfied with the clause. The hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford strayed in error when he alleged that Conservative Members were not interested in the regulation of junior members of staff. He concluded that the Bill will cover such people.
<P>
On the contrary, we want good, effective regulation. However, we believe that that is better done by an alternative approach which assesses such people in some respects but leaves the firms that employ them to assess their competence and fitness for office. After all, those firms have the most to lose if that process goes wrong.
<P>
Nick Leeson has been mentioned several times. I doubt whether any of the 48 people in the FSA or its constituent organisations would have spotted in advance how that gentleman played the market and how astute he was in covering up his errors and disguising the true nature of his activities.
<P>
In fact, Mr. Leeson would have passed the test. He was, by all accounts, a most competent trader and had done rather well in the past. Indeed, I speculate that had disaster occurred after he had been directly regulated, assessed and authorised by the FSA, the hue and cry would have arisen not against Barings' senior management—which was undoubtedly negligent—but the FSA. The FSA would have to admit that it had authorised Leeson in general terms and for the task to which he was assigned. It would then have to double the number of staff giving authorisation, erect huge new regulatory details and requirements, issue more forms and more checks and periodic assessments of staff. The FSA would have come under that pressure to no effect, as the money would not have been got back.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. However, a further conclusion may be drawn from his example. Under those circumstances, the FSA would have complete immunity under the regulations and would not have to give compensation to any of those who lost money as a consequence of its incompetence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend adds another dimension to the argument. I detect that he agrees with me.
<P>
The Financial Secretary responded to some of our concerns. However, we remain sufficiently dissatisfied with the clause to divide the Committee.

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 289, in page 26, line 38, at end insert `(``the applicant'')'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 291, in Clause 59, page 28, leave out line 11 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(b) the candidate; and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 292, in Clause 59, page 28, line 12, leave out `A's' and insert `the candidates'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> After the excitement of clause 56, these amendments are modest. Clause 57 deals with applications for approval and gives the FSA powers to specify the information that it requires for different types of approval and to require additional information.
<P>
Amendment No. 289 is a drafting amendment. Clause 57(3) and (4) use the term ``applicant'', but the term is not defined. The amendment would insert a definition in clause 57 (1). Amendments Nos. 291 and 292 are both drafting and correcting amendments. The term ``candidate'' is defined in clause 58(1) and there is no reason why it should not be used in clause 59(7)(b). The reference to ``A's services'' in the clause is an error: it should refer to the candidate's services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> This is an interesting group of amendments and we had an interesting discussion with parliamentary draftsmen about them. However, a definition of ``applicant'' for the purposes of subsections (3) and (4) is unnecessary. It is already clear from the clause who the applicant is. We considered the matter, but found no need to include a definition. Similarly, we do not believe that changing the definition of interested parties in clause 59(7) would make matters any clearer.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs said, the amendments deal with drafting points. We have taken advice in response to them and we are satisfied that the current drafting is adequate to meet our aims. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing our attention to these points and hope that he will be satisfied with the advice that we received from the draftsmen and will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> They are mainly drafting amendments, but amendments Nos. 291 and 292 amount to correcting amendments. Surely the reference in clause 59(7)(c) should be to the candidate's services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am sorry; are we talking about amendment No. 291?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> No, amendment No. 292: clause 59(7)(c) should refer not to A's, but to the candidate's services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> But the candidate is A, which is clear in clause 59(7)(b) which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the person in respect of whom the application is made (``A'')''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I fail to see the error feared by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The FSA will have to deal with these issues. There is surely a difference. Clause 59(7)(b) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the person in respect of whom the application is made (``A'')''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I take ``A'' to mean the applicant. ``Candidate'' would be the better, or more correct, word in subparagraph (c). However, these are not major issues. We are endeavouring to be helpful and to make the Bill clearer. If the Government wish to leave them less clear, so be it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I take it that for that reason the hon. Gentleman wishes to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Yes. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My remarks are merely about the timing by which the FSA has to have determined an application. In an earlier debate I asked the Minister to estimate for the Committee what proportion of applications should be dealt with within days and what proportion within weeks, and perhaps also to say whether he anticipated that many would take the full three months. It would be useful, following his remarks about the adequacy of the authority's resources and staffing, if he could provide a little more information about how promptly he expects the FSA to complete the necessary checks and investigations. That would be of interest to the market, especially in view of our frequent comments about the urgency with which many of these matters should be treated on the ground of market efficiency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Will the Minister say whether the reference in clause 58(2) after the word ``candidate'' to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any person who may perform a function on his behalf''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
means any person performing such a function on behalf of someone—for example, a candidate who is a director but does not have the relevant qualifications—may nevertheless be approved if the person performing the function on his behalf does have the necessary qualifications?

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am rather disappointed. We were dealing with amendment No. 290.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No. We are dealing with clause 58 stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I apologise, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
In answer to the right hon. Gentleman, I do not at present have data about the FSA's expectations of how long it will take to make the necessary checks and investigations, or about what proportion will be dealt with in differing times. We shall know more when the authority responds to the consultation that ended earlier this month.
<P>
The clause gives the authority three months, excluding any time when it is awaiting additional information that it has had to request, in which to assess an application for approval under this part of the Bill. In determining an application for approval, the clause requires the authority to be satisfied that a candidate is fit and proper to perform the controlled function or functions covered in the application.
<P>
In forming its view, the authority may take into account factors that it considers relevant. Clause 58(2) refers specifically to a number of them; they include taking account of whether a person performing a function on someone's behalf
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``has obtained relevant qualifications, has undergone, or is undergoing, training, or possesses a given level of competence''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
But those factors are not limiting. Other matters, such as whether a person has a criminal record, may also be taken into account: it is a matter for the FSA to determine. I expect that it would be relatively rare for the authority to reject an application completely, but if that does happen, the person will be able to refer the matter to the tribunal.
<P>
If the FSA decides that it needs additional information in order to reach a decision about an application, the time taken to obtain that information will not be taken into account when calculating the three months that the FSA is allowed. That should minimise the disruption to firms and individuals.
<P>
Three months is the maximum period during which an application may be determined. That period was selected to ensure that the FSA had adequate time to complete any inquiries that it may need to make, but it is not anticipated that general applications will take anywhere near that long. As I said, the FSA indicated that in routine cases it should take between a few days and a couple of weeks to grant an approval. It is consulting on whether the costs of delivering a faster approval service, at least for routine cases, would be justified. It said that it would seek to handle expeditiously any applications for which there was real urgency. It will seek to be helpful to those who submit applications.
<P>
In practice, the procedures are not very different from the arrangements that currently apply to all firms that are authorised under banking, insurance and investment regulatory frameworks, whether on a statutory or a contractual basis. The clause aims to iron out inconsistencies in the existing regimes and to spell out more clearly the tests that should be applied and the procedures that should be followed.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs raised a particular matter in this context. The reference to a person who performs a function on another's behalf could involve an authorised firm obtaining the FSA's approval to retain another firm as contractor. In that case, subsection (2), which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, makes it clear that the issue involves the fitness and propriety of the contractor's employees.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 58 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 59</center></H4>
<H4><center>Applications for approval: procedure and right to refer to Tribunal</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 290, in page 27, line 41, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) If no warning notice is given before the period of consideration the application shall be treated as granted.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause sets out the requirement on the FSA to give written notice of grounds for approval or refusal of approval. As we already know, clause 58 states that the FSA has three months in which to do so. However, the clause does not say what happens if the FSA gives neither approval nor refusal at the end of that three-month period. The amendment states that if the FSA says nothing at the end of three months, approval will be deemed to have been received.
<P>
If I may crave your indulgence, Mr. Atkinson, I should point out that the amendment would read better if it used the phrase, ``before the end of the period'', rather than ``before the period''. Both of those phrases refer, of course, to the three-month period.
<P>
The amendment deals with a situation that would otherwise involve a vacuum, and it gives the FSA an incentive to get a move on and to make up its mind within the three-month period about whether refusals or permissions should be issued.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> This is an interesting amendment. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for tabling it, and I hope that my response will be helpful. We need to consider what would happen if, for some reason, the FSA did not reach a decision during the three-month period. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the Bill as drafted does not explain what would happen. Under the regime for approving controllers over authorised persons in part XI of the Bill in clause 154(2), the consequences of the FSA's not objecting to acquisition of control during the specified period is that the application is taken to have been granted—that is the default assumption. It is easier to contemplate that situation arising in the case of controllers, who may be overseas, for example, and communications may be harder and more time consuming.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising this matter. I want to reflect on it further. We need to ensure that whatever we do in this context does not create opportunities for abuse and that our proposals are broadly consistent with the rest of the Bill. We must reflect before we decide what to do on this point, but I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising it. I would be grateful if he would withdraw the amendment so that on Report we can offer a Government view on how to deal with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am happy to withdraw the amendment on the basis of the Minister's undertaking. In the earlier stages of some regimes, when there were no time limits, there were many extraordinary cases of people who were left waiting for a year and more while the question of their ability to earn a living was resolved one way or the other. When the Government make up their mind, I hope that they will deal with the issue in the way that we propose. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> There is nothing especially controversial about the clause, but I want to ask the Minister for more information.
<P>
The clause deals with the withdrawal of approval. The explanatory notes state that approval might be withdrawn,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for example because the Authority had obtained new information which cast doubt over its initial assessment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister give examples of the new information and new circumstances that we are talking about? Where would that information come from? During initial scrutiny to assess the fitness and properness of individuals for initial approval—whether that took three days, three weeks or three months—one would expect the FSA to adopt several precautionary measures. That would presumably require checks on criminal records and previous employment.
<P>
I am mindful of the procedure for those of us who became members of the stock exchange in the old days, as one might refer to them. Then, one travelled to the 23rd floor of the stock exchange, although one hoped not to revisit it because that would usually mean that one was being hauled over the coals for something. In my day, one was made a member, having passed the requisite exams. One was interviewed for one's suitability, and one's name was posted on the board of the stock exchange for several weeks. During that time, further information from other members of the stock exchange or from people who chanced to pass the notice board might have come to light. In that case, one might not have secured approval to become a member of the stock exchange, with all the authority that one had in those days—the good old 1980s. One might not have achieved membership of the stock exchange and the authorisation that went with it. Is there such a procedure in the Bill? Can the fact that somebody is being scrutinised for approval be publicised so that people who might take issue with the process can produce that information? We are talking about a relatively tight timetable, so that could pose some difficulties.
<P>
Is there a time scale within which the withdrawal of approval measures could be implemented. In that case, if no further information was forthcoming within six months, a year or whatever, a different procedure would apply. I am not taking issue with the thrust of the clause, but will the Minister give further mechanical details of how the procedure is supposed to work?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall certainly aim to do that. The test that must be met before approval can be withdrawn is that the FSA considers that the person in respect of whom approval was given is not fit and proper to perform the function to which the approval relates. Withdrawal of approval does not imply criticism of the individual and is not intended as a punishment.
<P>
It is likely that power will be used in many cases in which the benefit of experience or hindsight reveals—perhaps after additional information has come to light—that someone to whom an approval relates is not competent to perform the relevant functions. For example, someone who is fit and proper to do a job in a small company may be less able to cope with an expanded operation following a merger or acquisition. A change in circumstances may be involved.
<P>
To the extent that the power is needed, it will be important. We do not envisage that it will often be necessary for the FSA to withdraw someone's approval altogether. Indeed, in most cases in which the FSA believes that it is inappropriate for someone to perform a controlled function, the parties concerned may submit a fresh application modifying the nature of the tasks performed by the employee so that a new approval may be given for that modified function. The power is important in relation to protecting consumers and maintaining confidence in the financial system as a whole.
<P>
I turn to a couple of direct matters raised by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham. The FSA will make initial checks, but other information may come to light, for example following investigation into apparently unconnected cases. One may envisage that that would shed light on an arrangement to be further investigated by the FSA.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about timing. No special time limits are involved, as the test is on-going. Procedures will follow the standard model to ensure that the process for withdrawal of approval is fair and transparent.
<P>
In exercising those powers, the FSA is required to give interested parties—the authorised person, the approved person and the employer of the approved person, provided that that is not the authorised person—a warning notice setting out its proposed action and the reasons for it. In addition, under clause 339(2), a copy of that notice will be given to any third party whom it identifies in a prejudicial way.
<P>
Those interested parties then have a period of 28 days in which to make representations to the FSA about its proposals. If the FSA decides to withdraw an approval after that process, it must issue a decision notice, which will trigger the right of any of the interested parties to refer the case to the financial services tribunal.
<P>
Committee Members will be familiar with those mechanisms following our discussion of other arrangements. We do not envisage that the power will be frequently used. However, it will be needed from time to time and, on those occasions, it will be important.

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification.

Clause 60 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 61</center></H4>
<H4><center>Conduct: statements and codes</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 305, in page 28, line 32, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 306, in page 28, line 34, leave out `if' and insert `when'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> These are probing amendments, designed to find out under what circumstances the authority will issue statements of principle. Is it envisaged that they will cover all approved persons? If so, why is that not a duty on the FSA, as it currently has complete discretion in such matters? Our amendment would meet that concern by inserting the clarifying word ``shall''.
<P>
In cases in which action is taken and a statement of principle issued, a code of conduct will be produced that may restrict the scope of the matter. I may not have studied the Bill or the explanatory notes enough. However, if would be helpful if the Minister would give us an idea of the circumstances in which the provision may be used.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The clause requires the FSA to produce a code of practice to underpin any statement of principle on the conduct of approved persons. The clause provides that such a code may specify descriptions of behaviour which complies with the statement of principle or does not comply with it, and factors which are to be taken into account in determining whether behaviour complies.
<P>
There is some sound thinking behind amendments Nos. 305 and 306. That is to say, it is important that if the FSA wishes to make use of the disciplinary powers available under part V of the Bill, an approved person must be clear about the circumstances in which they may be considered guilty of misconduct.
<P>
It seems unnecessary in practice to change the wording from ``may'' to ``shall''. The effect of clause 63(2)(a) is that the statement of principles and the code of, practice must have been issued and distributed, before the FSA could impose a penalty on an approved person or make a public statement about his conduct, except where the approved person has been knowingly concerned in the contravention by the authorised person in relation to some other part of the Bill. That is a case under clause 63(2)(b) to which the statement and code are not relevant.
<P>
If the statement and code had not been issued, disciplinary sanctions would not be available for relevant cases. Accordingly, there is no prospect of any approved person being unfairly punished if the statement and codes have not been published.
<P>
I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman some reassurance about what is already in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 293, in page 29, line 3, at end insert—
{**P8**}`(3A) If the code under subsection (2) specified descriptions of conduct within subsection (3)(a) it shall also specify descriptions of conduct within subsection 3(b).'.<P>

<P>
There is a slight error in the way the amendment has been written. It is my fault and not the Clerk's. The little ``a'' and the little ``b'' should be the other way around. I apologise and hope that it has not unnecessarily confused the Treasury or the Minister when preparing any briefing.
<P>
The thinking behind the amendment is that under the clause, if the FSA issues a statement of principle, it must also issue a code of practice. We are concerned that the code of practice specifies what behaviour would fall foul of the principles, but does not specify the sorts of conduct that should be expected from participants. It therefore fails to be of any real guidance. For instance, there is a principle that individuals must act with integrity in carrying out their controlled function. But the examples of wrong conduct include deliberately forging documents, deliberately overcharging customers and deliberately providing false or inaccurate information to the FSA. That is all fairly obvious.
<P>
No real guidance is given on the sorts of conduct that are expected of participants. The gap between the principle and the examples of the conduct is so immense that the examples simply state the obvious. The amendment therefore tries to require the FSA to describe conduct that complies with the statement of principle. That would be of real assistance to the market.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> As I have explained, the clause requires the FSA to produce a code of practice to underpin any statement of principle on the conduct of approved persons. Such a code may specify descriptions of behaviour that comply or do not comply with the statement of principle and what factors should be taken into account.
<P>
We understand that the purpose of amendment No. 293 is to ensure that a code produced by the FSA that contains descriptions of unacceptable behaviour should also contain descriptions of acceptable behaviour. The right hon. Gentleman has confirmed that that is the correct way to understand the amendment. It would provide safe harbours in the code for the purpose of giving people greater certainty about what is acceptable. We noted that the amendment was tabled with the (a) and (b) transposed. The right hon. Gentleman's confirmation does not alter what I want to say about it.
<P>
Certainly, I support the objective of ensuring the maximum possible clarity in the code of practice. However, in the end, we will be reliant on the good sense of the FSA to come up with the right solution. We do not want to hinder the FSA in its search for the best approach, which is why we framed the clause in this way.
<P>
The clause currently allows the FSA to frame the code in a way that will best achieve its purpose of ensuring that people have a good understanding of what is expected of them. In deciding which approach will best achieve that result, the FSA will, of course, have to consult on and have regard to representations on its proposed approach. In doing so, it will be guided by the objectives and principles in clause 2. That is how it should be.
<P>
As members of the Committee may know, the FSA has recently consulted on both draft statements of principle and a draft code of practice. It is currently considering the responses that it has received. The consultation version of the code sets out descriptions of conduct that does not comply with a statement of principle, rather than behaviour that does comply. That approach follows on from past regulatory practice and, the FSA believes, is the best way of giving individuals a clear indication of type of behaviour that is expected of them.
<P>
The FSA has explained in its consultation document why it thinks that that is the best approach—because it decided, as a matter of policy, that there would only be a breach of the code in the event that an individual either acted deliberately or his standard of behaviour was below what the FSA would reasonably expect from an individual carrying out that particular function. It will not, therefore, be possible to breach the code by accident, as it were. In that light, the FSA feels that there would be no gain from setting out behaviour that complies with the principle. But—
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> If the hon. Gentleman allows me, I will finish this point.
<P>
But, the FSA's current approach is not necessarily its final one. It has been consulting the industry and others on the best way forward. I understand that the FSA has received some useful comments on that point, which it is currently considering. If anything were to come out of this that required us to look again at the relevant provisions of the Bill, we would be prepared to do so, as we indicated in response to the conclusions of Lord Burns' committee.
<P>
However, we do not want the Bill to make it difficult—or even impossible—for the FSA to produce a code of practice that is easy for practitioners to use.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Minister clarify whether I have understood the argument correctly? She has moved on a couple of paragraphs from my point. I seek clarity on whether there could be a breach even when the person was unaware that a breach was taking place.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Perhaps I could finish what I was saying and return to the hon. Gentleman's point in a few seconds. I finished mid-sentence, with just one more sentence to read.
<P>
To recap, we do not want the Bill to make it difficult or impossible for the FSA to produce a code of practice that is easy for practitioners to use, or to force it to produce something excessively detailed. In that light, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment. I may have to respond later to the point raised by the hon. Member for Chichester.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Clause 62 provides that before issuing statements of principle and codes of practice, the FSA needs to follow the same consultation requirements as when exercising its general rule-making powers. Amendment No. 295 would make clear that a situation could exist where the authority wished to alter, not just issue, a statement and amendment No. 296 would require the publication in draft not only of the original statement of principle and code, but of the alterations to be made. Amendments Nos. 297 and 298 relate to the requirement that drafts or any alterations be brought to the attention of the public. Amendment No. 297 makes it a requirement to bring in the draft statement of principle and code to the attention of authorised persons, as well as the public. At present, the clause refers only to the public. Similarly, amendment No. 298 requires the FSA, if it alters or revokes a statement of code to give notice not only to the Treasury, but to all authorised persons and the public.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am grateful for amendments Nos. 295 and 296. We hope to table amendments that bring into close alignment the consultation procedures that the Bill imposes on the FSA in respect of codes and rules. Part of the effect of the amendments would be to bring the clause closer to clause 96, as that clause requires the FSA to consult any alteration or replacement of an extant code. I am grateful to Opposition Members for bringing it to the Committee's attention, but hope that, in the light of my remarks, they will withdraw the amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 297 is simply unnecessary. Clause 62 currently requires the FSA to bring drafts of proposed codes to the attention of the public. The amendment would add all authorised persons to the public—they are already part of the public. There is no point in spelling out particular groups of the public. Once we started doing that, we would never stop. The wider language, compared with similar provisions, is intended to take into account the fact that the FSA should be bringing the code to the attention of approved persons or potential approved persons.
<P>
On amendment No. 298, clause 62(9) requires the FSA to give written notice to the Treasury without delay if it alters or revokes a statement or code. That is part of the accountability framework for the FSA and fits well with the arrangements for the review of any anti-competitive effects of rules and measures adopted by the FSA. I take it that amendment No. 298 aims to ensure that all authorised persons and the public are aware of the code. I assure the hon. Gentleman that that is already provided for under clause 62(5). Members of the Committee will observe that by virtue of subsection (7), approved persons cannot be taken to have failed to comply with the code unless it has been made public. We therefore believe that amendment No. 298 is unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister for her comments. How does the FSA propose to bring the code to the attention of the public? What mechanisms will be in place—will it be on the net? The people who most need to know about such changes are authorised persons. If we are to accept the Minister's response to our proposed amendments, we should like to know the mechanism that the FSA proposes to use. I am pleased to note that the points that we raised in amendments Nos. 295 and 296 will be addressed subsequently. Subject to the questions that I have asked, we are happy to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> On the hon. Gentleman's final point, it is a matter for the FSA to consider in detail. It might publish both in hard copy and on the internet, but it is for the FSA to interpret properly the words ``to make public'' and to make sure that it is so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
