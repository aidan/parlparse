<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Winterton, for allowing us that break to refresh ourselves. The night is young.
<P>
I listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman's arguments that the investment trusts industry deserved special treatment. Once the hyperbole is penetrated, there is not much of a case--and it was not put in a convincing manner by Opposition Members. The amendment, which is sponsored by the Association of Investment Trust Companies, arose partly from anxieties about split capital. I know that in some detail because the association has written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>
I must draw attention to some comments made by the hon. Member for Daventry about a meeting that I am alleged to have had with the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds. My colleagues have checked this, as I met the director of the association briefly at a meeting that involved others, and did not discuss these subjects. I have not had any other meeting with the association. I am a little confused by the hon. Gentleman's statement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Economic Secretary will appreciate that my only knowledge of her dealings arises from my having been included in the correspondence that Mr. Warland has now sent her. Is she saying that the director did not raise these matters of substance with her? If she is, there may have been some genuine misunderstanding that I need not pursue as I was not party to it. Will she at least agree to consider the points and respond either tonight or a later occasion, perhaps by correspondence?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I am sure that he would not seek to mislead the Committee or to suggest that I was not conducting my affairs in a proper manner. I look forward to an opportunity to discuss matters with AUTIF in greater detail. I have had many meetings since my appointment as Economic Secretary; it is purely the pressure of my diary that has prevented me from meeting the association sooner. It was important to deal with the point.
<P>
We have been told that certain kinds of highly geared investment trusts will be disadvantaged by the abolition of payable tax credits to companies, because they will no longer be able to claim payments of tax credits where interest payments and management expenses exceed non-dividend income. No investor in these funds, however, would be able to obtain such relief through investing directly in underlying equities. This covers the point made by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford with some vigour; indeed, he became over-excited when making it. He said that this huge, sweeping change would affect individual savers. The Opposition amendment would have a much more direct effect on individual savers than clause 20.
<P>
I understand from its letter to the Chancellor that the main anxiety of the Association of Investment Trust Companies is about split capital investment trusts. Members should be clear that we are debating trusts that are companies. That can lead to some confusion, because people often associate trusts with organisations that have been established for some charitable purpose.
<P>
Split capital investment trusts are investment trusts in which there are different types of share. I am advised that they are designer products: I hope that my 12-year-old daughter does not hear about them, as I have spent much of the weekend trying to find items with designer labels. A split capital investment trust would probably be the end of it!
<P>
Typically, some investment trusts give rights to income, and some to capital growth. The structure of these funds is cleverly designed to take advantage of different shareholders' tax positions.
<P>
Income shares, like pension schemes, tend to be attractive to tax-exempt shareholders, and capital shares tend to be attractive to shareholders who are liable to pay tax, especially at the higher rate, and who benefit from capital gains thresholds and indexation.
<P>
Split capital trusts are therefore widely used by different types of shareholder for tax planning purposes. If we allowed them to continue to receive tax credits, it would benefit holders of income shares, such as pension schemes, and this would be a way of continuing to give pension schemes some of the benefit of tax credit payments by indirect means.
<P>
As Labour Members have consistently said throughout proceedings on the Bill, our purpose is to remove a distortion. To accept this amendment would be to allow a further distortion to continue within the system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I appreciate the way in which the Minister is trying to answer our detailed points. Will she reflect on the potential diversion of split capital trusts to assist pension funds? My hon. Friends and I are much concerned about the straightforward individual investor, usually of modest means. Will she undertake to think about retaining that exemption or relief for the personal investor, while blocking it, as she has in another context, for pension funds at large? I am not saying that that is what I want, but I would like to discuss its implications.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I do not believe that, in our three-hour discussion of the clause, Opposition members have made a case for doing that. In fact, they have reinforced my opposition to the amendment. As I promised the hon. Gentleman, I will go into detail on some of the specific points that he made.
<P>
Nothing proposed in the Bill will prevent companies from offsetting their allowable expenses against taxable income, such as the interest that they receive on bonds and gilts. Most investment trusts will be able to adjust their investment portfolios to increase their taxable income to obtain such relief. Most investment trusts, therefore, need not be adversely affected by our proposals. They will still have an advantage over most other types of investor, such as the individuals and pension funds that we were discussing earlier, who cannot get relief for the expenses of managing portfolios of shares that they hold directly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> We are all grateful for the Minister's assurance that investment trusts will still be able to offset their interest charge as a business expense.
<P>
The apparent need for the clause is to prevent pension funds from enjoying the dividend tax credit. Why does not the hon. Lady propose a system whereby pension funds investing in investment trust shares can no longer reclaim the dividend tax credit, just as when they invest directly in industrial shares?
<P>
Why is it necessary to have this discriminatory provision, which will reduce the return to shareholders in investment trusts, any more that it is necessary to reduce the returns to the shareholders of British Steel, ICI, or the other companies that my hon. Friends have mentioned? The clause does not seem necessary to protect the hon. Lady's intention--an intention that I do not share, but I do understand--to remove the dividend tax credit from pension funds.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman invites me to reply rather more widely than on the points made under the amendment, which I had hoped to do at the conclusion of my remarks. I note that more time and interest have been devoted to the debate on this clause, which was sponsored by the industry, than to clause 19, which we took on the Floor of the House, when the Chamber was empty for much of the night.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am sorry, I have given way several times and I wish to make some progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> On a point of Order, Mrs. Winterton. I do not wish to be accused of breaching the rules of advocacy in the House. My comments were not based on any connection with the industry, or on any communication with, or briefing from it, nor do I possess any investment trust shares. The hon. Lady's suggestion that my interventions have been motivated by some such interest are thoroughly without foundation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure the Committee will note the hon. Gentleman's remarks.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> We have had some hyperbole this evening, and before the hon. Gentleman came in I said that I was aware of the origins of the amendment. It had been raised with the Chancellor, so I suspect that the hon. Gentleman is being too sensitive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> No. I would like to make some progress. I wish to return to the substantive point made by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. He has made many points in the debate, and I am anxious to answer him.
<P>
The purpose of the clause is to remove the ability of a pension fund to obtain payment of a tax credit on UK dividends with effect from 2 July. It is part of a two-stage process under which payable tax credits will be removed from the tax system. Hon. Members are using the amendment to find another way of doing that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry spoke of the need for the tax system to be sensitive to its impact on collective investment vehicles. He referred to the tax treatment of authorised unit trusts, which already get relief from management expenses. I cannot understand why he should wish to extend that relief, especially in the light of his points about individual investors, who do not enjoy the same relief as trusts. Authorised unit trusts keep their management expenses relief. The change will prevent the payment of tax credits; therefore, trusts enjoy a better position than individual investors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Lady will appreciate the distinction between the amateurish activities of the individual investor--sometimes pursued with panache and even inspiration, which can lead to great success--and those personal shareholders, who are perhaps better advised and invest through a collective medium, thereby availing themselves of the benefits of collective management, and, in the case of investment trusts, of gearing and the diversification of portfolio. I am sure that she does not suggest that the small investor should incur the same professional costs, because those who are not small investors may choose between converting into a managed investment trust company or operating on their own account.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman confirms our reservations about a party that, over 18 years, governed for the few and not for the many. We shall introduce changes to the corporate taxation system so that everyone benefits from a sounder corporate tax structure.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry said that investment trusts can set excess management expenses only against excess franked investment income. Quite right. Those are the rules for everyone: only an excess can be used. Investment trusts are no different from anyone else, and should not have the special treatment suggested by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked how much authorised unit trusts and investment trusts would lose. The Inland Revenue press release issued on Budget day states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``other institutions and companies''
<P>
</UL></FONT>obtained payment of tax credits totalling about &#163;250 million in 1996-97. Inland Revenue officials tell me that they do not have sufficiently detailed disaggregated statistics to give a breakdown of the figures for AUTs, investment trusts and other companies. If the hon. Gentleman would like to write to the Revenue for further details I am sure that it will supply them.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked why equity investment should be discouraged. No suggestion has been made in our debates that equity investment would be discouraged. This is a Budget for the long-term good and growth of the economy: unit and investment trusts will still want to invest in equities, and people will still want to use those trusts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is it not absurd to suggest that the Budget will not encourage collective investment schemes to move out of UK equities? Clauses 19 and 20, which remove the tax credits and reliefs under section 242 of the Taxes Act 1988, will make it not viable for collective investment vehicles to have the same proportion of UK equities as previously. The Government are introducing a distortion, not removing one, from the collective investment sector.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I disagree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. He is merely anxious to spin out this section of the debate. This clause abolishes a minor tax relief, which has only a small impact on very few investment trusts.
<P>
I was pleased and amused to note that the hon. Member for Ashford recognises that privatisation shares were generally issued at a discount of their real value. I am sure my hon. Friends will return to that point in subsequent debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I may not be as expert on City matters as some of my colleagues, but is it not correct that a new issue of shares, whether it be for a privatisation or not, is always offered at a discount to clear the shares and to ensure that they are available to the widest possible range of investors?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's comments will be taken quite seriously in our justification of the windfall tax.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford spoke about the retention rather than the distribution of profits in relation to investment trusts. The Government want to promote the retention of profits in companies involved in trade and other business: we do not want to punish investment trusts, which, as the hon. Gentleman recognised, will still have substantial tax advantages over individuals who invest directly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Minister's argument does not make sense on its own terms. She has confirmed that &#163;250 million of tax will accrue to the Revenue from collective investment vehicles, but claims that there will be no disadvantage to those vehicles, which, she admits, are used by many relatively small personal investors. She cannot have it both ways: if that &#163;250 million is being taken away, those vehicles are being disadvantaged.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is stretching credulity a little far at the moment. We have been discussing this subject for some time and I have no intention of re-opening the argument why the abolition of tax credits is necessary, especially given that the Conservative Government were responsible for the first deduction in tax credits.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham talked about the effect on 3i plc and other investment trusts that specialise in venture capital. Those investment trusts finance smaller companies with a combination of debt and equity, so they generally have a fair amount of interest income--more than enough to absorb management expenses. I see no reason why the clause will disadvantage them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for giving way, as I am now in the firing line from Labour Members. Does not she realise that those large quoted venture capital investment trusts, be it 3i plc or the second largest select investment trust, must offer larger dividends than average in the investment trust sector because of the higher risk nature of the capital investment in which investors are invited to invest? That element will bear the impact of the proposals.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's point. As he is a new Member of Parliament, I shall not bore him by repeating the many speeches that I have made in previous Finance Bill Committees about venture capital and its role in helping to sponsor the development of small companies--a matter in which I have particular interest. It is--[Interruption.] I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman reacts so churlishly when I respond to his remarks. I thought that it was the job of Ministers to take on board the remarks make by others during debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I wonder whether the Economic Secretary has read the submission of the Confederation of British Industry. Paragraph 14 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``More generally on corporation tax reform, in the light of the abolition of tax credits and the potential re-emergence of the surplus ACT problem, the CBI would also welcome an early opportunity to engage in dialogue with the Government to identify the sort of CT regime which would best suit UK plc''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Can the hon. Lady give the CBI and the Committee a genuine assurance that the CBI and other organisations will be welcome to engage in a dialogue with her and her officials before the next Budget, so that an overall regime for corporation tax can be achieved that best suits the needs of the country?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am delighted that the hon. Member for Cotswold is coming round to our way of thinking. Some three or four years ago we said that there should be a wide-ranging review of the entire corporate tax structure. The hon. Gentleman should agree his script with the right hon. Member for Wells, who was today complaining that the Government spend too much time talking to big business. The CBI knows that it can have discussions with us at any time. Indeed, during the past seven days it has discussed matters with my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>
I wish now to take up the points made by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. I was becoming rather concerned about him because he was getting carried away with his hyperbole. He was indulging in typical Opposition scaremongering and suggesting wholly implausibly that clause 20 will lead to many bankruptcies. Quite frankly, I know that we have been discussing the clause for a long time, but pull the other one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Here we go again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I did not suggest that the clause would lead to lots of bankruptcies. I said seriously that, at the margin, it could make the difference between a company surviving and a company not surviving. The Economic Secretary's intention is to deprive companies that are not in the position to pay mainstream corporation tax of the opportunity to obtain interim relief for the advance corporation tax that they have paid. That is an unreasonable position in which to place companies that are loss-making, but which previously had some additional cash flow in the form of ACT relief, which the Minister now wishes to deprive them of. By definition, companies in a marginal cash-flow position may now be driven into bankruptcy, when they previously would not, which cannot be in the interests of the economy.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman saw fit to retrench from his earlier remarks. Frankly, companies in such a marginal position will have rather more to worry them than the hon. Gentleman's scaremongering. The Government will oppose the amendment; we accept clause 20 as it stands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I have given way to the hon. Genetleman on a number of occasions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> It is an important point. The hon. Lady is about to conclude her remarks, but she has still not answered the most fundamental question that I asked. What is the rationale for attacking section 242 in the first place? The hon. Lady cannot resume her place without giving the Committee a clear reason for attacking that section. She has not answered my earlier question about whether it is really necessary--and if so, why--to preserve the integrity of her abolition of dividend tax relief, to get rid of section 242. Earlier, I went through all the various--probably unintended --nefarious consequences that will flow from her decision to attack that section of the Taxes Act 1988.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> If the hon. Gentleman cares to read Hansard tomorrow, he will find that in our debate on the other amendments this afternoon, I specifically referred to the reason behind clause 20. I shall not take up the Committee's time by repeating myself.
<P>
The Government believe that clause 20 deals with a difficulty that would have been created because of loopholes being left open following the date of the Budget. The change is a minor one, notwithstanding some of the histrionics that we have witnessed this afternoon. Clause 20 is an essential part of the Finance Bill to get it into a shape that is in the best interests of business in this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As I am about to advise my hon. Friends to press the amendment to a Division, I should perhaps start on a note of consensus by acknowledging two facts. First, we are grateful to the Economic Secretary, if not for everything she said, or indeed, by accepting the arguments that she deployed, for the fact that given that these are serious and specific matters, she has made an effort to deal with them. Secondly, I concede that it is not this clause that is the main bugbear between us. What essentially divides the Committee is the interpretation of clause 19, which was discussed on the Floor of the House at not very much length because of the exigency of that process, and without the opportunity to deal in detail with each amendment. The clause flows from a political decision to withdraw the advance corporation tax relief from the majority of payable credits, which we regret and for which we believe there was no mandate.
<P>
Given that that decision has been made, clearly at some stage it will be necessary to have a wind-up procedure for the various losses. We debated that issue in an earlier amendment, which was also pressed to a Division, so I shall not re-rehearse it. However, there is a residual concern among Opposition Members. Although the Government have deployed arguments about not continuing the process for ever and that they are worried that the issue might roll on for a very long time, we have asked them to reconsider whether the measure is fair and reasonable in all the circusmtances.
<P>
I shall return to my specific amendment in a moment, but before doing so, I should say to the Economic Secretary that having praised her efforts to answer at more length than has perhaps characterised the Government during our exchanges, I found her answers more revealing than illuminating. I sensed a note of disapprobation in what she said about the cost of the measure.
<P>
I, too, have read the Budget press release and have seen the figure for other companies and institutions of &#163;250 million. I am surprised that there is no disaggregated figure. In responding to the Economic Secretary's invitation, I shall invite the Revenue to consider that further and to supply a figure in due course.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the only possible way to produce a figure for the total tax credits claimed by the sum of all unit trusts and investment trusts is to look through the Inland Revenue's files on the tax position of unit trusts and add up that figure, look at the tax position of investment trusts and add up that figure, and then to add one sum to the other? Surely, if the Economic Secretary has an aggregate figure for investment trusts and unit trusts, by definition, the figures for investment trusts as a group and for units trusts as a group must be available to her. It makes no sense to argue otherwise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I cannot fault my hon. Friend's methodology or his question, but I am sure that we shall be given the answer in due course, either by that method or another. We certainly intend to seek an answer.
<P>
Of course, I was not party to the meeting with the Chancellor and, indeed, have no interest in the narrow sense in any of these investment trust matters, but I am surprised that the emphasis was so strongly on split capital because that was not the import of the representations that I received from the Association of Investment Trust Companies. However, I appreciate that there might be differences of interpretation not least because of the speed of the discussions.
<P>
The Economic Secretary has failed to answer a specific question: if the problem was one of potential tax avoidance, would it not be possible to confine trust tax credits to the personal investor and bar pension funds from them? Perhaps she will reconsider that matter, although the tone of her response suggested that she would not.
<P>
As I have said, these exchanges have been revealing. They have revealed a philosophical distinction within the Committee. In essence, the Economic Secretary was saying that the Government will change the corporation tax system--they can take that decision, but I think that they have no mandate for this specific set of changes--and that there will be certain consequences, one of which will be that the relief available for the management expenses of investment trusts will become an anomaly and, therefore, will be removed. That relief has existed since time immemorial; it has been important for the promotion of investments and for the sorts of institution that, as we have sought to say, appeal not only to the well-founded investor, but very much to the contrary.
<P>
The Economic Secretary said that the relief was an anomaly, the Government see no justification for it and, therefore, it must go. However, our goals are to encourage long-term investment, the people's investment shared by as many participants as possible through, as my hon. Friends with great expertise have said, a collective investment vehicle.
<P>
There is no doubt that there are real problems for collective investment vehicles in that the Government's proposals reduce their attractiveness. They reduce their attractiveness to British investors, who might invest abroad, in property, in a speculative investment which they might live to regret or in bonds--there is a range of ways in which they could invest. They reduce their attractiveness to the smaller investors--the Aunt Agathas, who have been mentioned once or twice in this Committee.
<P>
The problems also reduce the attractiveness of investment trusts and the superstructure of management companies that they support to inward investment of whatever sort into the United Kingdom. Clearly, it is better for pension funds and others to be managed in the United Kingdom, and we must have the right sort of regime for that. Indeed, the purpose of open-ended investment companies--I know that they are outside the investment trust sector--was to produce a vehicle attractive to the overseas investor. That, together with the tax regime, was intended to attract investment to London.
<P>
The change cannot benefit investment trusts or unit trusts. We find it difficult to get the exact figures at the moment--I am surprised about that, but we will pursue the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> In my intervention on the Economic Secretary, I tried to make the point--I do not know whether my hon. Friend will agree--that the real nigger in the woodpile of the clause is the lack of consultation of those in the industry who know what they are talking about. Large investment flows will have to be altered as a result of the clause and the least that could have been done to benefit those flows, which particularly affect pensioners and small investors, would have been to have had some consultation about how the measure could better be brought about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend perceptively pinches my peroration from me, so I will not repeat it. The guts of the issue is that the Government have been sold a package to raise &#163;5 billion through a device that they believe will not hurt individuals. They believe that it is sufficiently obscure and difficult to pin down that nobody will notice what damage they are doing. It has not only general effects, but specific effects in that it tends to target vehicles that typically are those of smaller investors, who need to diversify a limited portfolio and who need help and encouragement to take their stake in the welfare of the country. I care not whether that effect is deliberate or accidental; I care that the measure is hurried and there has not been adequate consultation. I do not know whether the damage is intended or will simply happen despite the efforts of my hon. Friends, but I know that the Bill is not satisfactory. It will damage the interests of investors and, therefore, in the long term, those of Great Britain. We shall press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
Question put, That the amendment be made:--
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. I wonder if you would make representations to the leader of the Liberal Democratic party about the fact that none of its members are here--they could be considered part-timers on the Committee--and suggest that perhaps they might care to attend the Committee after dinner in future.

The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of the debate on the amendment proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Orders Nos. 68 and 89, That the clause stand part of the Bill:--
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.

Clause 20 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 21</center></H4>
<H4><center>Estates in administration: distributions to which s.233(1) applies</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The clause will bring about a necessary change to prevent beneficiaries of estates from reclaiming tax credits to which they would not be entitled if the distribution was received direct. The clause, in effect, amends the treatment of company distributions that do not carry a tax credit and which are received by the estate of a deceased person in the course of administration. It is needed to ensure that the beneficiaries are taxed on payments from the estate in the same way as if they had received the distribution directly. From Budget day, payments to beneficiaries of estates funded out of non-qualifying distributions will be treated as made under deduction of non-repayable tax at the lower rate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I should like to linger just long enough to get an assurance that executors handling the administration of an estate will not be put in an invidious position due to the changes. I refer particularly to the apparent absence of transitional arrangements. As the Economic Secretary helpfully outlined, the clause provides for amending the treatment of non-qualifying distributions received by the estate of a deceased person. A typical example of a non-qualifying distribution is bonus shares, which do not attract tax credits.
<P>
From Budget day, the payments to beneficiaries of such an estate, which are funded out of such distributions, will be treated as being made under deduction of non-repayable tax at the lower rate. That is clear, but what is not clear is the connection between payment out of the fund after Budget day and possible receipt by the fund in administration before Budget day. In the absence of a connection between the two--or, at least, guidance--to see how the payments flow through, executors could be put in a difficult position. Indeed, the tax authorities could claim disallowance of tax arrangements made after Budget day.
<P>
I shall take that illustration further. An estate, before 2 July, may have been receiving a number of incomes. In particular, a large or complex estate may have been receiving rental income, dividend income and interest on investments, some of which could be taxed at different rates and treated differently. Some of the income could be non-qualifying distributions of the sort to which I alluded--bonus shares for example.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The distributions received by the fund administration would normally be used to fund various distributions made out of the estate on to numerous beneficiaries under the terms of a will or suchlike. Such beneficiaries will typically have various tax status--some will be paying tax at a higher rate, some at standard rate, some at lower rate. It is important for them to know whether they can reclaim tax credits. If they are higher rate taxpayers, it does not matter. They do not have to receive back the tax credit--it will simply be set against their tax computation in due course as a credit. However, if they are lower rate taxpayers, it is important for them to know whether they will be able to receive the tax credits.
<P>
Along come the Labour Government, and from 1 July they change the law in respect of certain of these payments made out of the estate to beneficiaries--namely, the non-qualifying distributions. They are now to be treated as received by the beneficiaries as non-repayable tax. This is clearly an important change, and I understand the logic for it. I do not dispute it, and we shall not be voting against the clause. But the question is how are the payments out of the estate after Budget day to be linked to the earlier payments into the fund? There is no way in the clause of allocating elements in what I call the pot, which has received earlier payments into it, to the specific distributions to beneficiaries made out of it.
<P>
If they are dutiful and wish to pay minimum tax, executors may believe it right to allocate their distributions in such a way as to obtain the most favourable tax treatment. For example, they will not pay out funds to those beneficiaries paying tax at the lower rate if the tax cannot be recovered in the hands of those beneficiaries. Yet someone may claim that the payments they are making to this class of beneficiaries are not connected to the earlier receipt of non-qualifying distributions into the estate and administration before Budget day.
<P>
It is important for the hon. Lady to give some guidance to executors who are usually just doing their duty, so that someone will not say that they are tax planning in such a way as to minimise the tax liabilities on the estate, or for the benefit of the beneficiaries, but will instead try to match the funds into the estate and administration and out to the eventual beneficiaries to the detriment of the overall estate. This is important, and I was a little surprised that there is no provision in the clause for such transitional arrangements. As this affects people who are not acting commercially but are almost like trustees, I hope that the hon. Lady can give an assurance that they can make discretionary appropriations and distributions in accordance with good tax planning without feeling at risk from subsequent decisions by the Inland Revenue.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I wish to make only a brief contribution to the debate. I should like to quote from Accountancy Age and, in doing so, I declare an interest in that I write a column every few weeks for this illustrious magazine. The quote is from an article by Robert Maas, a well-respected tax expert. In making a general point that also applies to this clause, he says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In practive in recent years many government amendments to the bill have not been the result of second thoughts or the Revenue and Customs finding flaws in the wording.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Mr. Maas says that instead, they have been the result of representations made by representative bodies, and the Government's willingness to take account of those representations has become a central part of the process. There has been a telescoping of the time span between debating the Bill and its publication, so there has not been enough time for representative bodies to make their point.
<P>
I therefore ask the Government to say whether they have considered and responded to representations made by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. I must declare an interest since I am a member of that institute. I want to clarify whether the Government have responded to specific representations about clause 21(5) and its inconsistency with section 659 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. I would appreciate a response on that point.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am glad that the Opposition are not going to oppose this sensible tidying-up clause. The Government are aware of the difficulties that could, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and the right hon. Member for Wells pointed out, be created for executors. The right hon. Gentleman wanted clarification of executors' circumstances and I believe that the clause helps them because they know clearly where they stand.
<P>
Without the change, the Exchequer could repay tax that has never been paid. When a company makes a non-qualifying distribution it does not have to account for advance corporation tax. If that distribution is received by an estate, the executors could arrange for corresponding payments to be made to beneficiaries, which would be treated as paid under deduction of lower rate tax. That would be repayable to a non-taxpayer or an exempt institution. Thus the Exchequer would end up repaying tax that has not been paid to start with. Without the clause, the rules could be manipulated in such a way as to make it seem that tax has been paid to beneficiaries of an estate who have not paid tax in the first place. I am sure that Opposition Members would not want such a loophole to continue.
<P>
I should like to deal with the comments made by the right hon. Member for Wells about transitional arrangements. We have considered it seriously and it would be very unusual for an estate of a deceased person to receive such a distribution and for it to matter how the funds are allocated to beneficiaries. There are statutory ordering rules to ensure that payments are allocated in the most favourable way for tax purposes. I can therefore reassure the right hon. Gentelman that in such a case the personal representatives could allocate funds to produce the most favourable tax results for the estates.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 21 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 22</center></H4>
<H4><center>Lloyd's underwriters.</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> We have discussed the clause in some detail and, if I can manage to bring my memory up to date, it is an interesting clause that changes tax rules that apply to members of Lloyd's.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Will the hon Lady tell us when we discussed it in great detail?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am about to and I have a clear impression that some Opposition members are anxious not to reach certain clauses. I recognise that the Opposition face great pressures in preparing briefing and we may have created some difficulties for them.
<P>
To return to the clause, it make changes to the tax rules that apply to members of Lloyd's and the changes are consequential on the phasing out of payable tax credit and on the provisions in clause 24 which extend the circumstances in which distributions on trading assets are taxed as part of trading profits.
<P>
The insurance business of Lloyd's, as we all know following recent events, is carried out through syndicates which usually contain a mixture of individual and company members. The premiums that are received by Lloyd's syndicates are invested by the managing agents of syndicates in premium trust funds. Most of the investments held in premium trust funds are Government securities and only a very small proportion--a fraction of 1 per cent. as we understand it--are held in shares. To the extent that UK shares are involved, the dividends arising on them, and their associated tax credits, are included in the computation of trading profits. The syndicate managing agent is therefore able to claim payment of the tax credit.
<P>
The clause withdraws, with effect from 2 July, the entitlement to payable tax credit on shares that form part of the assets of a premium trust fund. That reflects the debate that we have been having on the withdrawal of payable tax credits from companies from 2 July 1997 and from individuals from 6 April 1999. The entitlement is to be withdrawn simultaneously from individuals and corporate members. The purpose of the provision is to avoid the administrative difficulties for managing agents that would arise if there were a disparity of treatment between individual and corporate members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> Will the Minister assure the Committee that the same regime will apply to insurance companies and that insurance companies that happen to hold shares in their premium trust funds will no longer be able to claim the tax credit, either? I am sure that she would agree that it would be wrong to create a distortion in the City between the insurance companies on the one hand and Lloyd's syndicates on the other.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is getting a little ahead of himself; I know that he is anxious to get through the business as quickly as possible, but we will come to that issue when we debate clause 23.
<P>
The insurance business of members of Lloyd's is also backed by assets that are held in ancillary trust funds. Dividends on shares in the ancillary trust funds of individual members are already included in the computation of trading profits. The clause provides for dividends on shares that are held by corporate members in ancillary trust funds, or otherwise employed in their business, also to be included in the trading profits of corporate members. The clause therefore ensures that all dividends received on shares that support the insurance business of Lloyd's members will be taxed as part of their trading profits. That will achieve for Lloyd's the results that clause 24 will achieve for other financial traders.
<P>
The practical effects of that rationalisation are not expected to be of great significance to Lloyd's members. Only a very small proportion of premium trust fund invesment is in shares, and corporate members do not, in practice, generally make use of ancillary trust funds. That is the reason behind the clause, which I commend to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am becoming rather alarmed by a number of things that Labour Members are saying. I agree with several of my hon. Friends that we are beginning to see an interesting pattern. It is presented in the guise of tidying up and removing a distortion; it is presented in the name of good housekeeping--for the many, as it is often described.
<P>
As we examine each of the clauses--when we are able to; the guillotine has consistently prevented us from reaching many of the clauses--we are discovering the reality: this is an ill-considered piece of legislation. It is discriminatory and, in some places, vindictive. It is often extremely careless. How well have the proposals in the Bill--and, indeed, in the clause--been thought through? How much genuine consultation has taken place? How many of the firms that we have cited again and again over the past few days repeat the words that reveal the picture I am trying to paint--that the Bill has been cobbled together hastily with no proper regard for the impact that it will have on many companies and on this country's investment prospects?
<P>
<H5>10 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I say all that because, in this clause, we have a perfect example of the shoddy, careless way in which the Government are proceeding. The clause is important because it addresses Lloyd's. If we consider it in detail, it is obvious that the Government have been considering this issue. It fits in with their pattern of changing the corporate tax structure and particularly with their pattern of finding a pot of gold and taking the money whenever they can.
<P>
The Government's claim is, as I have said, that this is a question of tidying up and of removing distortions. Let us pause for one moment to consider just what sort of a tidying-up operation Lloyd's will face and what distortions it will remove. That quickly poses the question of how much consultation has taken place with Lloyd's. I do not profess to be an expert in such matters and, like my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, I know that some issues are best left to technicians. I have, however, found myself in consultation today with a concerned and worried senior board of management at Lloyd's. Its members feel very strongly that they do not know what is happening. It has not yet become clear to them, in the discussions that they are having with the Inland Revenue, what the Bill's impact will be. It is a serious matter for the Government to have hastily pushed the Bill through and for us to find ourselves in Committee when one of the major financial service sectors does not understand the impact of the Government's proposals. It is not that the sector does not understand the Bill because it is short of advisers, because it is not. The problem is that the Inland Revenue itself is learning as it goes along. The Inland Revenue pointed out new implications to Lloyd's in conversations that took place as recently as last Friday. It will not be possible for Lloyd's to have a meeting with the Inland Revenue until Thursday of this week to learn of further implications. That means that we are discussing a measure whose impact is not understood by those who will be hit and plundered by the Government. It is quite probable that the Government themselves do not understand its impact.
<P>
On that note, I draw hon. Members' attention to the fact that, as in the discussion of foreign income dividends, we are dealing here with a hasty, ill-thought-through measure that is motivated by a desire to grab money. Yet, if we consider the Government's fine words, we discover that the Chief Secretary professed real concern for Lloyd's in a debate on financial services regulation in December 1995. He told us that he very much hoped that it would make a recovery and he wished it well. It is a funny way of wishing Lloyd's well to push legislation on it at breakneck speed without giving it time to make proper representations on its impact. Let us be clear about this: how could Lloyd's make proper representations on the Bill's impact when those who advise the Government have not quite made up their minds as to what it will be?
<P>
We are dealing with critical material, which reveals a crucial principle. I want to refer to the note of a discussion that I had about clause 22 this evening with a senior director at Lloyd's. Because the issue matters and because no one fully understands it, I will briefly read from a note. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Clause 22 removes the ability of managing agents of Lloyd's syndicates to obtain repayment of tax credits on dividend income from PTF assets. Clause 22 also brings into the charge to tax as trading profits the net dividends received by corporate members in their PTFs or other trust funds.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford raised a point about the relationship between Lloyd's and insurance companies, he was put down by the Economic Secretary for having such temerity--indeed stupidity--and was described as being a little in advance of himself. Perhaps the Economic Secretary may be excused for saying that, as she clearly had not read the explanatory brief that Lloyd's has produced now that it begins to understand the impact of the legislation. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Schedule 4, paragraph 30, page 78''--<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are not on schedule 4, we are discussing clause 22.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am referring to how the clause interrelates with schedule 4 and why my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford rightly drew attention to a gross discrimination that arises from the clause. It is necessary to refer to schedule 4 in order to understand that. I therefore crave your indulgence, Mrs. Winterton, if I briefly refer to schedule 4.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Only if it is specific to clause 22.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Indeed it is.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Schedule 4, paragraph 30, page 78 withdraws the ability of fund managers to obtain repayment of tax credits on dividend income received on special reserve fund investments of individual members.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> By contrast, because of the exemption in clause 24(6), non-life insurance companies will continue to receive dividends as franked investment income and suffer no further tax liability, albeit that they will in future be restricted in their use of losses to set against any surplus franked investment income. This applies to both invested premiums and other funds held by the company.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Currently Lloyd's syndicates hold relatively few equities as part of their premium trust funds, but in attempting more closely to align their investment with their insurance liabilities, equity investments may be increasingly attractive. The proposed treatment of franked investment income for all members of Lloyd's will therefore be disadvantageous compared with the treatment of insurance companies writing similar business.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That may come as a surprise to Labour Members, but I am not surprised because they have not had the chance to think through the consequences of the legislation. They have not bothered to think about the danger of proceeding with extraordinary haste, driving a coach and horses through corporate tax legislation. Yet the damage that we can begin to see in the wake of this precipitate haste is alarming.
<P>
I have had several conversations with representatives of Lloyd's today--and I immediately declare that I am not a member of Lloyd's and therefore have no reason to speak for it. I am speaking for it only because, if I do not, the Committee stage of the Bill will be completed without any representation being made. That reveals in spades the arrogance with which the Government have constructed the Budget.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> For the record, it occurred to me that, although accurate, what my hon. Friend said might have been misconstrued. I am sure that he was not suggesting that the reason why the matter had not been discussed was because every other member of the Committee--or every other member of any section of the Committee--was a member of Lloyd's. I assure my hon. Friend that if I were able to understand the subject--and I now understand it much better as a result of what he has said--I would be able to join in the debate because I, too, am not a member of Lloyd's.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for clarifying that point. Lloyd's is clearly saying that the proposals are ill-thought out and careless, and that the legislation has been put together dangerously fast. Lloyd's also does not understand why it has been singled out and is concerned that the Government do not realise its anger at being singled out. When my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford was put down by the Economic Secretary for his temerity in asking about discrimination between Lloyd's syndicates and insurance companies, the hon. Lady's response revealed that the Government have not had the opportunity to consider the Bill's entire consequences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My hon. Friend has virtually made my point. Did he notice the grave disparity between what the Economic Secretary said in her exchanges with my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford concerning the treatment of Lloyd's and other insurance companies, as amended in clause 24, and what my hon. Friend the Member for Whitney has informed the Committee about his representations from Lloyd's? The hon. Lady says that there will be no difference in treatment between Lloyd's and other insurance companies, but Lloyd's says that there is a disparity. Which is true? Has my hon. Friend been able , in his discussions with Lloyds, to discover the costs to the Lloyd's insurance business of this hasty measure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I regret to say that, because of the speed and haste with which the measure has been forced on Lloyd's, it has not been able to make those calculations. It is to discuss the matter with the Inland Revenue on Thursday, after which it hopes to have a better idea of the damage it will suffer as a consequence of the Bill. The hon. Lady may be able to give specific answers to our questions. Presumably, at some point the Government have computed the cost to Lloyd's as a result of such a punitive clause.
<P>
Lloyd's has made it clear that the proposed changes to premium trust funds and the special reserve fund are essential for its business. That business relates to security and stability. We have heard much from the Financial Secretary--who, sadly, is not with us this evening--about the need for certainty. She has waxed lyrical on many occasions about the Budget--[Interruption.] It is a pleasure to welcome her back to the Committee just as I am about to refer to something that she said in the Chamber, where she spoke of the need for certainty. Our concern is that the proposal demonstrates that the Budget creates uncertainty. Lloyd's has said that the proposed changes mean that premium trust funds and the special reserve fund, which are essential for security and stability in the Lloyd's market, are being targeted with the removal of tax credits, while other insurance companies are explicitly exempt from such proposals.
<P>
I shall explain those proposals because I think that members of the Committee will want some elucidation. Lloyd's is particularly concerned about the intention to abolish tax credits in respect of premium trust funds at Lloyd's. Those funds are held by managing agents and, crucially, are designed to ensure that claims can be settled effectively. Those funds, therefore, are invested to maximise the level of capital available for future claims and they are integral to the stability and certainty of the Lloyd's insurance market. We are talking not about housekeeping, correcting a distortion or tidying things up, but about fundamentally undermining the stability of Lloyd's business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am following my hon. Friend's argument with great interest. Is not he arguing that the funds are important not only to the names that take the risk, but to policyholders who want to receive swift settlement of claims if they are unfortunate enough to need to make those claims? The issue is important, therefore, for both sides of the Lloyd's market.
<P>
<H5>10.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Exactly. Lloyd's has been through a difficult period. I hope that the Government continue to wish it well as, indeed, the present Chief Secretary did in that earlier debate. I am, therefore, at something of a loss to understand why the Government are creating a potential wave of damage. Again, I can only think charitably: that the Government have not thought through with enough clarity and care the consequences of the clause.
<P>
We are not talking about putting a distortion right or about a matter of housekeeping; we are talking about a fundamental hit on Lloyd's. Why are tax credits being removed from its funds at the same time as ordinary insurance companies appear to be exempt from such changes? What is the rationale behind not allowing premium trust funds at Lloyd's to benefit from such exemptions?
<P>
I am again using the word ``rationale'', which we have heard so many times this evening. We are searching for a rationale but we are unable to find it. All we have are a Government who are desperately searching for money. [Laughter.] I am sorry that Labour Members find the matter funny. The Government are proposing a serious change for Lloyd's and it is a great shame that they take it so lightly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware of two other points? There is, as with so many matters that we have discussed, a domino effect of consequences on many institutions. The Government's proposal comes to Lloyd's at a time when the American reinsurance market is gobbling up much of the international business. That seriously threatens the future of Lloyd's as the centre of the world's insurance and recent mega mergers between insurance companies in the United States have compounded the problem.
<P>
To touch on a subject that we discussed on the previous clause, Lloyd's investment trusts--which have been a phenomenon of the past few years of limited liability--will also take a major hit from the other implications of the proposed changes to dividends. That will also undermine the capacity of Lloyd's to carry on the business in which it has been very successful for many centuries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman cannot intervene on an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodford:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham for his intervention. As my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford has been gripped by excitement, I shall give way to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. The Government should think carefully about the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham. Is it not the case that increasing competition for Lloyd's business--especially in the reinsurance market--derives from tax havens. The biggest source of new competition, which threatens the future of Lloyd's in many ways, is from Bermuda. Is it not the case that Bermudan insurance companies do not even need tax credits when they invest in premium trust funds, equity instruments and so on because they do not pay tax in the first place? They have a considerable tax advantage and the effect of the Economic Secretary's proposals as enshrined in the Bill will be to increase in relative terms the tax advantage that is enjoyed by the competitors of Lloyd's. She will further undermine an important British industry.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> We are searching for a rationale to explain why the Government are not allowing premium trust funds at Lloyd's to benefit from such exemptions. There may be another explanation. By distorting the market, the Government--who are so concerned to correct distortions--will then be justified in putting it right in next spring's Budget. They will go to the rest of the insurance market with cap in hand and take money from them as well. They will say, ``Now there is a distortion that we must put right.'' Will the Economic Secretary clarify how the clause will relate to the insurance market?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a difference in tax treatment between special reserves and general reserves and that the clause will hit special reserves? The relevant provisions were designed to benefit Lloyd's for a long time. Members can put only a small portion of their underwriting profits into these special reserves. They are placed there for a rainy day to build up the assets of Lloyd's, and without those special reserves Lloyd's would not have been able to reinsure into Equitas and would have gone bust. The country's balance of payments would have suffered considerably if the balance sheet of Lloyd's had not had such strength. We are now preparing to unravel the whole strength and stability of the Lloyd's market.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> My hon. Friend, as always, makes an important point. Of course, he is right.
<P>
There is equal concern at Lloyd's about proposals to alter the taxation status of the special reserve fund. The fund was created as a tax-free fund and only the proportion of the fund that is used to settle claims or which is paid back to Lloyd's members is taxed. The clause therefore treats the special reserve fund as if it were a pension fund. The Bill will deny managers of the trust fund any repayment of tax credit. Again, I refer members of the Committee to paragraph 30 of schedule 4.
<P>
I have a quotation from Lloyd's that sums up its view:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Once again, this fund is designed to add security and stability to the Lloyd's market, and Lloyd's would very much like to know the rationale behind these proposals, which indeed limit the level of capital available in the events of claims being made.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have asked time and again, on clause after clause, about the Bill's rationale, yet we are still searching for that rationale or philosophy. The Government are interfering--at best--little by little with this country's corporate tax system. Their Budget is motivated by a desire to find money to fund spending programmes. We disagree fundamentally with much of the Bill and the clause raises serious questions about discrimination, carelessness and the fact that the Government, who profess to want to talk to business, in fact do not listen to business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Committee will be grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Whitney for his revelations this evening.
<P>
The senior managers of the Lloyd's market have not yet had time to have sensible discussions with the Revenue or with Ministers about this hugely important clause or about the future of that vital part of the City of London. My hon. Friend crystallised the unease that many of us feel about the Bill. The clause is a perfect symbol of the reason why we feel so uneasy about the entire Bill.
<P>
New Members on both sides of the Committee are, for the first time, attending a Standing Committee and scrutinising a Bill in detail. The Opposition have said many times that we feel that there is inadequate time for proper scrutiny and--perhaps even more importantly--that the brief time between the Bill's publication and the Committee stage is disturbing. It prevents us from scrutinising the Bill properly and it prevents expert outside bodies from providing the input that they have traditionally given before the Finance Bill reaches Committee. That disturbs the Opposition; it should also disturb new Members on the Government Benches, many of whom are diligently getting on with their correspondence. One should not blame them for that; I dare say that in years past there was equivalent behaviour on the Conservative Benches. [Hon. Members: ``No, no.''] I was not here, but I stand corrected by my right hon. Friend and hon. Friends who have been here longer than I.
<P>
What is certainly different is that it is clearly not possible for outside bodies such as Lloyd's to influence the Finance Bill's detailed provisions as they did in the past. That is what we have learnt this evening, and it should worry not only those of us with philosophical reservations about the Budget, but those on the Government Benches who want to be responsible for competent legislation. It should disturb officials, too, because it will reflect well on no one--not on the House, the Treasury or the Revenue--if, six or nine months or two years down the line, we find that we passed a Finance Bill that was technically incompetent and that we did so because the Government did not allow expert outside bodies sufficient time to influence us.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Witney has uncovered the most glaring example yet of a clause that cannot be properly discussed or passed by the Committee because those who are most affected by it and know most about it have not been able to give the Revenue sensible input on the Bill or come to a sensible conclusion on it.
<P>
I was rendered uneasy, even before my hon. Friend's revelations, by the Economic Secretary's introduction. She skated rather blithely through the landscape, saying that premium trust funds do not invest must in equities and there are no figures on the clause's financial effect. On a previous clause, the hon. Lady gave a figure of &#163;250 million for the aggregate effect on unit trusts and investment trusts but then said that she could not disaggregate that figure, although--as my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford said--she must have reached her aggregate by adding together two disaggregated figures that she claimed not to have. We are entitled to be moderately sceptical about the Government's profession of ignorance about the financial effects of their proposals.
<P>
Even if equity investment by Lloyd's premium trust funds is so small that it is beneath the Revenue's notice, it remains undesirable that the Government should act without knowing the full financial effects of doing so. Who are the Government--or who are we, the Committee--to say that, in years to come, Lloyd's funds would not want to increase the amount that they invest in equities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I have just been reading the Bill with care and its effect will be to devalue immediately by 20 per cent. the special reserve funds held at Lloyd's. Given that the solvency statements of many members at Lloyd's are based on those special reserve funds, that would be extremely serious and could put a number of Lloyd's members into solvency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes a significant point. I was going to come to the overall effect on the Lloyd's market because hon. Members on both sides know that Lloyd's, having gone through an extremely difficult period--some of it self-inflicted--during the 1980s and early 1990s, now seems to be on an even keel and again able to play a significant part in generating foreign exchange and providing one of the pillars of the City of London's success, which is so important to the UK's overall economic health. If my hon. Friend's computations are correct, this slightly slapdash measure--which has not yet been properly discussed between the Revenue and practitioners at Lloyd's--will cause a serious and difficult problem. The least that the Economic Secretary should do this evening--even with imperfect information because her officials have not had those key discussions--is to give an assurance not just to the Committee but, more importantly, to Lloyd's and investors from around the world whose capital the Lloyd's market needs to continue to be successful. She should give assurance that the measure will not have the serious effects that my hon. Friend suggested and she should be able to do that with properly quantified figures.
<P>
<H5>10.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is not good enough to say that not many funds are invested in equities so it does not matter much. The Committee is entitled to a degree of accuracy in the figures and the full effects of the change on the Lloyd's market.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The matter needs clarifying. Special reserve funds are invested at the discretion of a member's Lloyd's underwriter, and while the proportion of funds invested in equities will vary considerably from one underwriter to another, some will undoubtedly have a heavy weighting in equities and they will be severely affected by the 20 per cent. drop in valuation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is a pertinent point. One of the reasons for the usual gap before a Finance Bill's Committee stage is to allow individual firms to examine their own position to see how they will be affected. I am sure that my hon. Friend is right and that different syndicates will be affected in radically different ways. Underwriters will not all have similar exposure and it is important that a provision such as clause 22 should not be implemented until the individual effect on underwriters is properly assessed.
<P>
At the very least, the hon. Lady should give some figures to reassure members and underwriters at Lloyd's as to the effect of the clause. If she cannot do so, the Government should remove the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that there is yet another anomaly in the anticipated treatment of Lloyd's? A Member who hold equities within a Lloyd's fund as part of his potential liability is now to lose the tax treatment that we are discussing. What is the difference between that and an individual who holds equities against a debt with a bank if the bank wishes to take a claim over the equities? If those equities are deemed to remain the property of the individual, he will not lose the preferential tax treatment concerning advance corporation tax and so on until it is phased out in 1999. Can my hon. Friend explain the anomaly between those two variations of the same situation? If Lloyd's is the outer casing, the individual's equities will be hammered.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for pointing out yet another distortion. As he said, there will be a two-year difference in the tax treatment of what may be identical holdings of equities. 
<P>
My final point is related to that. As we go through the Bill clause by clause, more and more distortions appear and more and more differences in the treatment of similar investments appear. One cannot avoid the assumption that the Bill has been assembled in such haste that new clauses have been added as various distortions occur to the Revenue. It is likely that it has not thought of all the distortions. As my hon. Friend the Member for Witney said, the Government will need to come back in March and clear up some of the remaining distortions by adding to the tax burden of various other forms of investment simply because they have not only damaged the pension fund and insurance sectors with the changes in the first Budget, but have created distortions that did not exist before.
<P>
I conclude by saying that the hon. Lady must either give reassurances to the Committee and the industry or reconsider the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> One of the advantages of the guillotine has been that the Committee has been able to examine some, although not enough, of the Bill's clauses in immense detail--[Laughter.] I say that genuinely. However, the Government's imposition of the guillotine motion also means that the Committee will not be able to examine vast chunks of the Bill, which I think is a thoroughly undemocratic and unparliamentary way of scrutinising legislation. Be that as it may--it is the Government's decision--where we have been able to examine clauses in huge detail, we have been able to show that they are absolutely riddled with inconsistencies and distortions. I have no doubt that if we had been able to examine other clauses in such detail, we would have found a similar number of distortions, inaccuracies and inadequacies.
<P>
We are discussing a serious matter, which concerns one of our most important financial institutions, and I ask the Economic Secretary a simple question: what consultation did she have with the industry before the Bill was published? The clause has far-reaching effects, some of which I described in my earlier interventions. The devaluation of the special reserve funds means that in some cases, at the margin, the solvency of Lloyd's members will now be put into question. What discussions did the Economic Secretary have with the Lloyd's authorities on how many members are now likely to be placed in that highly invidious position? The Lloyd's institution has been through a very difficult period. Cases of severe hardship have arisen among our constituents, about some of which I had a correspondence with the previous Government. If the Bill is to give rise to further hardship, it is incumbent on the present Government to have proper discussions. I hope that, in giving her reply, the Economic Secretary will be able to put a figure on what the measure will cost Lloyd's. As has been said so many times during our proceedings, the Government cannot take a substantial sum from an organisation or group of organisations without expecting there to be a significant effect--I have no doubt that that will be so in this case.
<P>
I shall conclude by mentioning the clause's longer-term effects. As I said when I intervened on my hon. Friend the Member for Witney, the structure of Lloyd's has been predicted, for many decades, on the basis that there were special reserves to meet a claim from one or more syndicates. The tax structure was predicated on the basis that a member could put a small proportion of his total underwriting profits into the special reserve fund. I make a distinction between the special reserve fund and the general reserve fund. The member could put, completely tax free, a small proportion of his income into the special reserve fund; it had to be left in the fund until it was needed to meet a claim or until the member resigned from Lloyd's. That was an exceptional arrangement for the purpose of meeting claims.
<P>
If Lloyd's balance sheet has not been formulated on the strength of the members' special reserve and general reserve funds, it would not have had the financial backing to reinsure into Equitas, which was a huge operation--probably the biggest that the City of London, let alone any insurance and reinsurance operation, ever undertook. If Lloyd's had not had that strength of assets behind it, that reinsurance operation would not have been possible and it would have gone bankrupt. It would have become insolvent and the Department of Trade and Industry would have had to issue an insolvency certificate--something to which the institution came perilously close two years ago.
<P>
The Economic Secretary needs to give us some vital answers: what will the clause cost Lloyd's, how many members are likely to be judged insolvent as a result, and what will be the effect on the combined strength of Lloyd's assets?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Did not Conservative Members get themselves into a fankle over that? There was some excitement at the beginning of our debate on the clause and it is perhaps understandable that the hon. Member for Witney should play to the Gallery, but much of what he said does not bear scrutiny. He began by making allegations about me in regard to the chairman of Lloyd's. They come as a great surprise to me--so much so that I shall instruct my officials, as soon as Hansard is available tomorrow, to make his remarks available to the chairman of Lloyd's so that we can clear up any difference of opinion or lack of communication on the matter. I have a serious fear that somebody may be impersonating me because that is the only possible reason for the hon. Gentleman's assertions--although they were made during the excitable part of his speech.
<P>
We have heard much about the costs of the clause. They are in fact negligible--we are talking about thousands, not millions, of pounds. As for members of Lloyd's who are liable to be made insolvent as a result, that does not merit the hon. Gentleman's consideration--I know that he has considerable experience in those matters. The hon. Member for Cotswold also went on at great length, as did some of his hon. Friends, about special reserve funds; they are not affected by the clause and credit remains payable to them until 1999, when it disappears for everyone. I therefore fail to see why they were getting certain items of their clothing into a twist. As for consultation with Lloyd's, the Government have a positive relationship with that institution. It has not pressurised us or Inland Revenue officials for a meeting prior to Thursday of this week. Indeed, as I understand it, the date of the meeting on Thursday was by mutual agreement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> It is not just I who am getting anxious about the clause. I shall quote from a letter from Erick Lamothe, the public affairs executive of the corporate communications department of Lloyd's, to my hon. Friend the Member for Witney. He says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The central query which Lloyd's has in regard to the proposed changes is simply that both the Premium Trust Funds and the Special Reserve Fund, which are essential to security and stability for the Lloyd's market are being targeted with the removal of tax credits, whilst other insurance companies are explicitly exempt from such proposals.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is totally at odds with what the hon. Lady just said. Would she therefore undertake to have discussions with the Lloyd's authority to try and resolve the quandary?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Discussions with Lloyd's are part of the normal rubric of government; we have discussions planned with Lloyd's in the near future. I would have thought that if the gentleman to whom the hon. Gentleman referred had truly been concerned about those matters, he would have raised that directly with the Government rather than going through an intermediary. Very few investments in Lloyd's premium trust funds are held in shares and very few companies make use of ancillary trust funds.
<P>
Opposition Members also exhibited some confusion about which clause they are talking about, because they have jumped about from clause 22 to clause 34. The hon. Member for Witney, when he craved your indulgence to discuss schedule 4, again talked about special reserve funds. They will remain tax free. Individual Lloyd's names with such investments will be treated like other individuals with investments in shares.
<P>
<H5>10.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Witney also said that the attack on premium trust funds could affect the stability of Lloyd's and damage policyholders' interests. That is not so. Most sterling assets in premium trust funds are Government securities. They are held in shares to only a very small extent. The hon. Gentleman has, on a number of occasions, referred to the problems of names. Both in Government and Opposition, we have been concerned about the difficulties that names have experienced. The hon. Members for Cotswold and for Witney claimed that it was unfair to remove payable tax credits from names who have placed profits in special reserve funds--again, that relates to clause 34, to which we shall come. At present, only a minority of names have new special reserve funds.
<P>
I believe that it was the hon. Member for Witney who said that it was not right to treat the special reserve fund as though it were a pension fund. Of course not, and that is not what we propose. The abolition of payable tax credits and the distortion that they create applies across the board. We are taking immediate action on pensions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Lady will appreciate that I have not participated in this discussion. However, as there is some doubt about the nature of the relationship between her and Lloyd's, and as she has mentioned a number of times that, in her view, the germane clause for much of this discussion is clause 34, will she undertake to the Committee to make inquiries in the morning, before we commence that discussion, to ensure that everybody is happy and to ascertain what is the situation? It would clearly be helpful to the Committee if those points could be clarified before we come to discuss that clause.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> When I said that I would be raising the remarks of the hon. Member for Witney first thing in the morning, I was referring to allegations about my relationship with the chairman of Lloyd's. That is something that I want to be cleared up, because the hon. Member for Witney suggested that I had behaved in a less than courteous manner to the chairman of Lloyds and that I acted in a high-handed manner--a suggestion that I find peculiar. I see that the hon. Member for Witney is now looking askance. Perhaps it was the excitement of certain people being in the Room that took him off on that tangent.
<P>
Although we have ranged widely in this debate, as I said at the beginning this is a storm in a teacup. We are witnessing synthetic ire on the part of Conservative Members and I urge the Committee to support clause 22.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 22 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 23</center></H4>
<H4><center>Insurance companies and friendly societies</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 50, in page 15, line 5, at beginning insert `(a)'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it may be convenient to take amendment No. 51, in page 15, line 6, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(b) The Treasury shall cause a report to be made on the impact of these provisions on the value of policies of insurance and notify individual policyholders of this impact.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This is a commendably brief clause. It is well-drafted, intelligible, and I hae no difficulty with it. Its function is to pave the way for the schedule, and I give notice to the Committee that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells will want to contribute in due course on matters connected with the schedule.
<P>
In that context, I must apologise to the Committee for proposing to spoil the symmetry of the clause by my amendment. Although it is not very long, the amendment would introduce a new element--the hon. Lady will be familiar, from the rather tight nature of the drafting of the financial resolutions, with how difficult it is to bring up such points within order, but we do our best. The amendment would enable us to introduce the concept of a report on insurance companies and their policyholders and the impact of the various provisions.
<P>
I do not speak censoriously, but the ever-helpful notes on clauses state, in a rather throwaway manner:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``These provisions merely reflect for insurers the general changes to the corporation tax system announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, including the proposal that payable tax credits will no longer be available to certain tax payers including pension providers with effect from Budget day|See Clauses 19 and 20 for the main changes.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It will not have escaped the Minister's notice that we have spent a great deal of time today debating clause 20 and that we debated clause 19 on the Floor of the House. In a sense, therefore, the insurance position is the second major disbeneficiary of the Chancellor's proposals.
<P>
As the Minister has already referred to the Inland Revenue notes that accompany the Budget, I shall cite them myself to show the scale of the changes. Of the total of &#163;5.25 billion of payable tax credits, the Revenue estimates that pension schemes account for &#163;2.5 billion--between 40 and 45 per cent. or just under half--and insurance companies for &#163;1.1 billion--about 20 per cent. Other institutions and charities account for about 10 per cent., foreign shareholders another 10 per cent. and individuals also about 10 per cent. I hope that those figures add up, but they give a broad indication of the relative weight of each sector.
<P>
When a company makes pension provisions for its employees, it can either administer the scheme itself through trustees or give the job to an insurance company. Our current debate is in relation to the insurance companies, because the majority of personal pensions are made available through insurance schemes.
<P>
The amendment is an attempt to obtain greater information and ensure that it is disseminated to policyholders. Throughout these changes, a characteristic pattern has emerged: the Chancellor has gone for the most opaque sort of tax change, which will be thought not to affect individual taxpayers immediately and which is difficult for lay people to understand--indeed, pretty difficult for experts. The changes are not presented in an intelligible way and it will be unclear for a while what the impact might be.
<P>
I have what used to be called a self-employed retirement annuity, which has been running for almost 25 years but is still open for contributions. I hold also one or two one-off premium policies or policies of insurance, as does my wife. However, we do not spend our life digging out those policies and ringing our broker for a valuation. When I last did that, it produced a most satisfactory result for the main policy, but one of the subsidiary policies appeared to have lost value. However, the latter was of such small import that it did not matter.
<P>
The insurance and pension industries are sometimes criticised for making it difficult for individuals who hold shares personally to obtain a valuation. Such people may look to the stock market for a valuation in order to be regularly apprised of the value of the assets represented by pension or insurance entitlements. In this case, we are talking about insurance entitlements. In the present circumstances, the quite exceptional changes induced by the Chancellor's ACT moves in the Budget require a greater degree of transparency.
<P>
The amendment therefore calls for two things. I do not necessarily wish to stick to the precise wording--it may not be perfect--but it asks for the Treasury to compile a report on the matter and for individual policy holders to be notified of the impact. If the Treasury were to arrange for that to happen, possibly through an independent agency or consultancy, and it were then to make the notification, the attraction is that it would not be the insurance company itself that appeared to be to stoking up concern among its policy holders--although it has an obligation to be truthful to them. It would be a direct and independent report on the impact on the individual policy holder.
<P>
It may not surprise the Committee that one of the functions of the report would be to expose the sort of damage done to pension or insurance entitlements, or collective investment vehicles and to the interests of the individual saver and policy or pension holder, a matter which causes us great concern. If the report were carried out independently, it would at last enable us to resolve the dispute among members of the Committee about the nature of the impact.
<P>
We have been told that, under the law of Bristol, South as we shall come to know it, the changes would benefit pensions and policy holders. I am sure that all Conservative Members consider that to be highly implausible. It is impracticable to take out more than &#163;5 billion from the various agencies now in receipt of payable credits without damaging the interests of the savers whose funds those credits represent. Therefore, the macro impact would be important. We must also consider the impacts on individual sectors and, ultimately, on individuals who may have set some store by the value of their own pension or insurance provision--as I suggested when getting out my own policies.
<P>
Among the impacts that have been suggested is, first, that on local authority pension funds. We still do not accept that that can necessarily be left to the next quinquennial valuation, a point to which I shall return in a moment. There is then the impact on funds that are closed when, effectively, they are operating like a charity and probably paying out obligations to beneficiaries who are the remaining retired employees. They have no access to external funds to top up their assets. How will they meet their continuing obligations? Will they have to scale them down and renege on those obligations? What will happen?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My hon. Friend mentioned the obligations on local authority pension funds. But there are several other public sectors in which there are defined benefit pension schemes to which the Government must contribute to ensure that the trustees of the pension schemes meet their obligation--for example, the police, doctors, firemen, civil servants, teachers and so on. I suspect that the contributions to those schemes over a period, as a result of the withdrawal of ACT credits under the Budget, will be massive. In fact, it could amount to a public sector pensions timebomb.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his observations. Characteristically, they amplify a point that I made earlier. On Second Reading, I said that there would be large repercussive effects even if there was not a formal fund. He will know in certain cases, as in that of teachers, although not the local authority, that there is a shadow fund, but no actual set of assets. In fairness to those with the shadow funds or with funds such as the civil service pension fund or the Members' pension fund, the actuary will look at what comparable contributions will buy in the private sector and will seek to match the contribution required to that applicable in the private sector. So the cost of everyone's pension will be ratcheted up.
<P>
<H5>11 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Before my hon. Friend's intervention, I was coming to another issue that concerns me--that of pension funds that are still open but with few new adherents. The British Coal pension fund--which may now have closed altogether--may be a good example: we know that it has gone from almost a million miners post-war to a now much smaller number, who are almost exclusively in the private sector. Rather like the pension fund that has formally closed, there is again an implosion, with large existing funds invested on the back of previous contributions, scant access to new contributions, and a reduction in value as well.
<P>
Alongside that--coming back rather more to the insurance side--are policies that individuals hold in addition. One group that I have flagged up--I am surprised that it has not entered more into public discussion of these matters--comprises people who have endowment protection polices, and otherwise, for their mortgage. Many of us have a pension mortgage. I think that I shall be all right with mine, despite not having traced the final valuation: it is one of the benefits of reaching one's mid-50s that one will not lose so much by this proposal. Some will have invested fairly early on; others will simply pay off their mortgage when the time comes, through this type of policy. I suspect that some will be unable to do so if the sums have been finely calculated to give them the best value from their contributions and they have not been gold-plated: they may then find themselves unable to meet their obligations.
<P>
I mention all those points because doubts still remain about the precise level of the impact. It may be 20 per cent. for a young man of 30, and somewhat lower for a person in his 50s. It seems that the average yardstick rate is something like an impact of 11 per cent. on income across the board. This is exactly the figure that I want the study to investigate and reach a conclusion about.
<P>
The next point is greatly important: irrespective of the type of pension fund or policy-insured pension held for the beneficiaries, the trustees, or administrators, of those funds have an obligation--I am not a lawyer but I am fairly sure that it is a fiduciary obligation in law--to act on behalf of their beneficiaries and take any action appropriate to new circumstances. I do not think it acceptable to say that this will all come out in the wash at the next actuarial revaluation, when people will say, ``Fancy that. We have been paid less money from our underlying assets because of the withdrawal of payable tax credits for three years, and now suddenly we find that we do not have enough to meet our obligations.'' If that situation occurred for me as a trustee--I used so to be, of a charity; hon. Members will remember that charities are being relieved from this obligation because it is thought to damage them--I would immediately want to know where I stood. I would call for an analysis and decide what I must do in terms of my disposition policy.
<P>
If our amendment commends itself to the Committee, we shall be both reminding trustees of their obligation to analyse the impact on their individual situation and the impact on their beneficiaries, and considering the national position--and, to some extent, giving them a yardstick to help inform their analysis.
<P>
Finally, I should like the Financial Secretary, in her response, to comment on some of the macro-impacts; these have been touched on but bear mentioning again. Clearly, whatever else these changes do, they make it relatively more attractive for an individual to return to the state scheme, SERPS, unless rebates are adjusted.
<P>
It is clear from the responses from the Treasury Bench that there is no proposal for any revision of SERPS rebates before the millenium. Yet that is an issue for trustees who have a duty to share the impact with their policy-holders or beneficiaries. If it is now relatively more attractive to be in the state reserve scheme, the trustees have a duty to advise those concerned, who should respond to that. If the Government are not prepared to offer greater rebates, more people may want to return to the state system. The matter is not as simple as turning a switch on or off and computing the number of people who are now in employment and will return to the state reserve scheme.
<P>
Another factor to consider is how the rebates work at the moment. In most cases, they are paid to the administrators or the pension scheme and are then invested on behalf of the beneficiaries. That applies to opted-out schemes and a company, whatever its pensions arrangements, might decide that the amount of pension earned by the rebate would make it worth while for its employees to return to SERPS, but to keep its scheme open as an additional, non-opted-out scheme to provide other benefits to secure the whole. The tranche of benefits between the basic state pension and the final level to be achieved would be a middle range and better value could achieved by returning to the state scheme.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that the Red Book contains no provision for extra individuals returning to the SERPS scheme and no expenditure provision for the extra payments that local authorities will have to make for their employees?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am aware of precisely the point that my hon. Friend has made. The Government have blithely assumed that none of those problems will arise--that there will be no impact or that any impact could not be quantified or would make no difference and, above all, that trustees would not need to take any notice. It is implausible that there can be no effects from the major structural change in the arrangement. The Government should analyse the matter, publish a report--
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I have listened to my hon. Friend with great pleasure. He has given a masterful summary of the impact of the Government's proposed changes to ACT and dividend tax. Will he say whether the same principle applies to the trustees of pension funds or companies with pension funds and to the Government? Both have a fiduciary responsibility. As he rightly said, trustees of pension funds have a fiduciary responsiblitiy to their beneficiaries to ensure that if an external event occurs--such as the proposed changes in the Bill--which will affect or undermine the anticipated value of schemes, measures should be taken to ensure that the actuarial solvency of the scheme is restored. Surely the Government have a fiduciary responsibility to make it clear to taxpayers what the impact of measures will be on a net basis, including feedback of the sort outlined by my hon. Friend, and to set out the net gain to the Exchequer. Much of the feedback, including that on SERPS and local authorities--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is a very long intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> --has not been included and the Government are in default of that fundamental fiduciary responsibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have considerable sympathy with my hon. Friend's points and hope that the Economic Secretary will consider a reply.
<P>
We know that there will be an impact, but we do not know how great it will be because we have not been told. We and our advisers can, to the best of our ability, try to compute some of the impacts, but I strongly agree with my hon. Friend's point that trustees should look at the impact on individual cases. It is also important that insurance companies should do so, both in discharging their responsibility to administer the fund and in the interests of their policy holders.
<P>
We need to know a great deal more, above all because there may be shocks at the national level from the feedback that my hon. Friend has described. We may not make as much money from the changes as is thought because it may be necessary to increase SERPs rebates, or people may return to SERPs, which would affect current expenditure. There are other reasons. Individuals need to know more, too, so that they are not shocked to find that what they thought was reasonable provision is inadequate for their long-term plans.
<P>
We need more independent information, not drawn from the cut and thrust of political debate or compiled to make a political point. It should be independently found out and shared with the electorate. It is characteristic of this whole sorry business that the Chancellor thought that he had found an easy target and that no one would understand the impact of it. Out of ignorance or disinclination, he has not dealt with the matter on a basis of openness. We are not prepared to allow that to continue and that is why the amendment calls for a report that will make the situation properly clear to the nation and policy holders.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am glad to have heard from the hon. Gentleman because I would otherwise have had no idea what was the point of the amendment. The idea that a general report on the effect of our proposals would be so worth while that it should be sent to all policy holders is frankly ludicrous. It would be a waste of time and money. It would involve substantial costs for insurance companies, which would have to supply information about all policy holders who were to receive the report. From the perspective of another of my current interests, that would provided yet another opportunity for certain companies to get off the hook on pension mis-selling. If the Conservatives had only shown so much interest in pension mis-selling, the Government might not have to address the serious issues that I have to deal with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sure that the hon. Lady is an expert on pension mis-selling. Would not she agree that if there has been a mis-selling problem, it should not be compounded by mis-selling the new arrangements that will result from Government changes to the beneficiaries and holders of insurance policies? That is what the amendment is about.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> It should not be compounded by scaremongering by Conservative Members. People who were mis-sold pensions have been through enough.
<P>
The amendment would result in a waste of time and money. It would cost a considerable amount and the cost to the insurers would probably be greater than any possible effect that the clause will have on the value of policies. There is no way in which the Treasury can evaluate the possible effects on our provisions on a policy-holder-by-policy-holder basis. Those effects depend on individual charateristics of policies and the tax situation of the relevant insurer, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman appreciates. It would require the talents of Mystic Meg to guess at such things as an insurance company's future policy on bonus declarations, if, by ``value'', the amendment means the amount that the policy will eventually pay out.
<P>
<H5>11.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I cannot accept the amendments, but I want to comment on some of the arguments of the hon. Member for Daventry. He said that trustees cannot wait for the next actuarial valuation of pension funds. Frankly, however, waiting for the actuarial valuation is the natural thing to do. All sorts of changes affect the comparative value of pension funds assets and liabilities, and they are all brought together in the periodic actuarial valuation. That is why such valuations take place regularly. It is not sensible to try to isolate one change midway through the relevant period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I want to elicit some information from the Economic Secretary. Is she advising the trustees of individual schemes--whether in the public or the private sector--not to take any action until the regular actuarial valuation takes place? If so, that should be made clear.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Actuarial valuations for pension funds take place all the time--they do not take place according to a timetable. The hon. Gentleman has more sense than to suggest that his question can be answered with a simple yes or no reply. I suspect that the late hour is beginning to get to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is the hon. Lady saying that if the trustees of a pension fund are aware that something may be devaluing those pension funds by a given amount, they should take no action until the formal valuation by the actuaries is completed, even though they know that there has been a dramatic fall in the values as a result of Government action? Should those trustees take no action?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Individual pension funds base their decisions according to individual circumstances. The hon. Gentleman's suggestion that there is a need for panic in relation to actuarial valuations is, frankly, unfounded. I must take him back to some of the scaremongering that he and his hon. Friends created in the wake of the Budget, when actuaries had to restate their position because it was said that they had failed to take into account the impact on a company's value of corporation tax reductions or the effect of allowing companies to retain a higher proportion of dividends.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry referred to endowment policies and to pension mortgages. He said that people with endowment mortgages might not make enough money to pay them off. There is a misconception in his argument. Under an endowment mortgage arrangement, an ordinary life assurance policy is taken out to provide the funds to pay off the mortgage loan. The investment return that underlies those policies has never been exempt from tax--tax credits are not normally payable on the relevant dividends. The Bill's proposals on tax credits will not have a significant effect on the amounts that are paid out on endowment mortgage policies.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about pension mortgages. I have never thought that it was a good idea to link pension schemes with a mortgage because pension schemes are designed to provide an income in old age rather than to pay off mortgage debts. However, people who choose that high-risk option--and they are perfectly free to do so--are unlikely to be seriously disadvantaged. If they need to pay off their mortgage in the near future, most or all of the necessary value will have already accumulated in the pension policy. In the longer term they--and anyone else with a personal pension--will share in the long-term benefits that the Budget is designed to bring to the economy. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury made that point when we discussed the matter on the Floor of the House.
<P>
I have had discussions with my colleagues in the Department of Social Security about SERPS--we keep that matter at the front of our mind. The contracting-out rebate for SERPS is determined by the Government Actuary, who sets the base rate according to several actuarial assumptions, including an assessment of long-term rates of return on pension-fund investments. It may be too early to judge the long-run effect on those returns of the Budget's proposals. As I said, the Budget is aimed at the long term. Nevertheless, we are considering asking the Government Actuary to review the actuarial assumptions underlining the contracting-out rebates.
<P>
As for the entitlement to have pension business tax credits paid--which forms part of the more general points relating to schedule 3 that were raised by the hon. Member for Daventry--insured pension provision is being treated in the same way as uninsured pension schemes. I see no need to go over last week's debate on clause 19 which was taken on the Floor of House.
<P>
I am concerned by the alarmist suggestion of Conservative Members that personal pension policyholders--that beats saying the Leith police--who are close to retirement are likely to have 20 per cent. of their pension entitlement wiped out overnight. That is clearly nonsense. The change has not affected dividends paid prior to Budget day and, in any event, those people should be protected by the fact that many personal pension funds switch out of equities and into gilts as the date for retirement comes closer. Indeed, that prudent advice has always been given to people with such pension schemes. Even pension schemes that do not do that will not have suffered because the market reaction to the Budget has been positive and therefore the overall investment position has remained favourable.
<P>
The abolition of payable tax credits will, in general, feed through to final pensions payable, which is why the change has been introduced. It is important to recognise that pension funds make up and develop their assets in relation to how the economy and companies in particular perform. The aim of the Budget is to ensure long-term stability. The proposals in the schedule and changes to tax credits will not affect the amounts paid for policies mentioned by hon. Members.
<P>
The other changes made by the schedule are mainly technical and consequential on changes elsewhere in the Bill. They might have some small effect on the tax bills of insurance companies. The main effect, however, will be on proprietary companies where it will probably be swamped by the benefit of the 2 per cent. cut in corporation tax which we discussed earlier.
<P>
In considering the amendments and the schedule, it is important to take into account the Government's long-term decisions. We are moving from short-term boom and bust which will benefit the economy in the long term. I cannot, therefore, accept the amendments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As the Economic Secretary said, the hour is late, although I am not sure what inference she expected us to draw from that comment. The inference I draw is that there is no need to reply at great length because she has spilled the beans in a number of extremely interesting comments. She conceded--I think for the first time--that the abolition of payable tax credits will eventually feed through to final pensions payable. Those are her words, and that is exactly what we have been arguing since Budget day.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> But of course they will feed through. That is our main point. In making the companies of this country more secure and more capable of growth, we will certainly be able to improve the position of pensioners.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is precisely the matter of debate between us.
<P>
The Economic Secretary's second interesting revelation was perhaps given under a degree of pressure. She mentioned the interaction of SERPs and private pensions, and responded to the questions put by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford about the fiduciary duty of trustees and the importance of actuaries considering those matters. She said that she might think about whether the Government Actuary should reconsider the rebates. That would be a welcome achievement of the amendment.
<P>
I feel strongly that the nature of the changes is sufficiently material to require all persons responsible for pension provision and, indeed, policies of insurance invested in a more general way that take advantage of the tax credit to examine their position. That is not something that we can do in Committee. I form no immediate inferences about that process, but all those involved should consider their position. That is the main purpose of the amendment.
<P>
At one point the Economic Secretary claimed that I said that personal pension policyholders--at this hour in the evening I can still pronounce that correctly--were likely to lose 20 per cent. of the value of their pensions just before retirement. She put up that Aunt Sally only to knock it down, but I have no recollection of saying it, nor do I intend to. Indeed, I specifically referred to my own age when I said that people in their 50s were less likely to be affected by the measure for precisely the reason that the hon. Lady gave--that they already had large numbers of dividends and tax credits rolled up in their pension funds--than younger people. The amendment's purpose is to examine those factors to determine how they apply and how people should react to them. We strongly believe that the measures pose a problem for most pension providers. I have sympathy with the hon. Lady's point that the Government would find it difficult to prescribe every case, although I am sure that they could produce some exemplary cases, if only to advise trustees as to their options.
<P>
When the Government want to impart good news, however, they are prepared to find a way of sharing it with the nation. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells has already mentioned the pocket Budget, which cost the taxpayer &#163;50,000. That report managed to give the public the impression that the changes in corporation tax were wholly beneficial--the hon. Lady clearly agrees with that--and did not mention the annoying and troubling issue of advanced corporation tax and its impact on pension funds and insurance. I am sure that that was an understandable omission, but it is one that devalues the currency of the matter.
<P>
In conclusion, I say to the Economic Secretary that I am prepared to take my stand on the facts. I have no interest--nor does any Conservative Member--in scaremongering. If pension fund managers are allowed to analyse the impacts and to take appropriate and remedial action--even if they have to remove a proportion of their assets from UK equities and invest them abroad or in other assets unsavaged by these tax changes--they should be able to do so and, at the end of the day, we shall know the overall impact. As my hon. Friends and I have said on several occasions, to introduce these changes hastily and in hugger-mugger fashion, without levelling with the British people including those who are entitled to expect a pension in the future, seems to be the wrong attitude. We want transparency on this issue, which deserves a proper report and, in that spirit, we urge the Government to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I refrained from making a contribution on the clause until I heard the Economic Secretary's comments. My hon. Friend puts his finger on the problem; the hon. Lady said that over a period of time, through the annual contributions, the changes in ACT credits would considerably affect insured pension schemes.
<P>
I want to draw attention to the so-called notional pension schemes in the public sector. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry chastised me for exaggeration when I said that there was a public pensions time bomb. There was a public pensions time bomb long before the changes in the Budget, which merely exaggerated its effects.
<P>
<H5>11.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have, in the so-called notional schemes, an unfunded pension. I wrote an entire paper on the matter, which my party adopted a few weeks before the election, but the issue was too complicated to explain in the three weeks running up to the election. [Laughter.] Labour Members may well scoff, but they are about to enact virtually everything that I proposed in my paper.
<P>
There is a problem not only with the state pension but with the notional pension schemes. Each year, every Government Department has to make further pension provision for the different classes of worker within it. Each year, the Home Office, for example, has to make greater provision for the police and fire brigade pension schemes, and the clause will, of course, exaggerate that problem.
<P>
Why does every Department have to make ever bigger provision for its pension schemes? Because of demography and inflation. People now live longer and, in some cases, the number of workers who pay into pension schemes is declining. In the 1970s and, to a lesser extent, the 1980s, inflation corrected the performance of investment funds, so the pension fund trustees did not have to demand ever bigger contributions from the Government. That is, no longer the case now that we have an economic situation in which, thankfully, growth outstrips inflation.
<P>
When the Government make their monumental change and move cash accounting to an accruals basis, each Department's contribution to the pension funds will be perfectly clear. We shall find over a period of time that the Government have an ever bigger problem with the notional pension funds and not just with the state pension fund, which, mercifully, they are beginning to tackle through funded pensions.
<P>
Local authority associations have already told us--my local authority is similar to many other in the country--that they will have to make up an additional &#163;2 million a year just because of the provisions in the clause and the Budget. We have already heard that the Government are capping local authorities. If authorities are capped, they will be unable to get more money from the Government or to raise additional money from the council tax. They will, therefore, have to cut services to meet the extra costs of the ACT credit withdrawal for which the clause provides.
<P>
Yet again, we are dealing with a clause that is relatively benign on the surface--until we start digging, that is. I should like the Government to think carefully about the public pensions time bomb to discover where the unfunded basis of all the public service notional pension funds will go in the next five to 10 years. If they do their figures carefully, they will come up with quite a shock for each departmental budget.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I do not wish to delay the Committee, particularly since we have already had a full exposition of the clause. It is important to make it clear that the changes are intended to stop the payment of tax credits on dividends that relate to the pension business of insurance companies. For individual policyholders, that relates to personal pensions. The clause makes the Bill more coherent and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 23 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Insurance Companies and Friendly Societies</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Third schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> This is a long and complex schedule of six pages. In different circumstances I would say a great deal about it because it is important and should not go unscrutinised by the Committee. However, we are running seriously short of time for the scrutiny not only of this schedule but of a number of clauses, so I shall be relatively brief. I do not want that fact to be interpreted as my assenting to the schedule in any way.
<P>
There is a serious problem for the Committee in that the paragraphs of the schedule are written in an almost impenetrable way that is clean contrary to all the assurances we received before the election about the intentions of the then Opposition. They said that they wanted to make legislation accessible to the taxpayer and that they would publish a draft Budget. They say that that does not apply to this Budget because it is not a real Budget, but the bill is 100 pages long and contains some enormous tax-raising measures so we are disappointed that all that has been ignored.
<P>
That has not gone unnoticed by outside commentators. In particular, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, which we have quoted before and which refers in its commentary specifically to the schedule, said in its conclusion:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We reiterate that it is unsatisfactory when complex, far reaching laws are written and enacted in great haste with virtually no debate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could have been written specifically about the schedule. One has only to look at the phraseology to see that. Paragraph 3(2) substitutes for existing provisions the following:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(1A) Paragraph 2 of Schedule F shall not have effect for the purposes of subsection (1)(a) or (b) above, but this subsection shall not apply in relation to distributions in respect of which an insurance company is entitled to a tax credit under section 441A.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not clear what is being referred to. As it is a minimum requirement, one would have thought that section 441A would be described so that cross-referencing to elsewhere in the Taxes Act 1988 would have been easier. The influence of the tax law rewrite team, which we know to be deliberating at the moment, is not apparent. That is a serious omission which makes it difficult for Conservative Members--who are, on the whole, laymen--to discover whether there are defects in the schedule.
<P>
We rely heavily on advice from outsiders and they have said, in the quote to which I have just alluded and elsewhere, that they have not had time to go through the matter. We are affecting the tax affairs of hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of our fellow citizens--the schedule will remove the entitlement of insurance companies to tax credits on the pensions side of their business. In other words, it aligns pensions business with free-standing pension funds. I call that parity of damage: the fact that the same is being done to insurance companies as was done to pension funds does not mean that any less damage is being caused.
<P>
Friendly societies will also be affected. Old Labour used to have close associations with them. In the old days we heard a lot from old Labour about the importance of friendly societies and the need not just to help and defend them and look after their interests, but to draw their ordinary members into matters affecting them so that they were entitled to see what was being done in their name. The old co-operative principle was that people were entitled to know such things. For that reason, Labour Members should take a slightly more alert and continuing interest in this huge tax levy on friendly societies as well as on ordinary insurance companies.
<P>
I should like the Economic Secretary, who will reply to this all-too-brief debate, to estimate the reduction in income for insurance companies and friendly societies. What proportion of the additional revenue, as listed in the Red Book, that will accrue to the Government will come from that source? We know from the Red Book that revenue from the abolition of tax credits will build to &#163;5.4 billion a year by 1999. What proportion is taken by the measures in schedule 3? What will be the impact on policy holders in those companies?
<P>
The Economic Secretary has said several times that she is against scaremongering. On occasion, she has accused us of it, but we do not accept that. The defence against scaremongering is information being given to the Committee and passed to those affected. I should like the Economic Secretary to turn her mind again to the imperative of allowing individual policy holders, contributors, members and potential pension beneficiaries to know what is being done in the schedule. Friendly society insurance companies communicate regularly with those people so the Government should take the opportunity to require and to pay for the information to be sent to the relevant individuals--in the spirit of openness that the Government have endorsed.
<P>
<H5>11.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We referred earlier--and my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry touched on it again a few moments ago--to the infamous pocket budget which cost &#163;50,000 and put up a giant smokescreen. It did not refer to ACT or tax credit abolition but was dressed up as change to encourage companies to invest. We have blown away the smoke and we know who the victims are. Now is the time to inform them of what exactly has been done, not by republishing the pocket budget and spending another &#163;50,000. We should spend perhaps an equivalent sum of money--the pocket budget should be paid for by the Labour party since it is propagandist--to publish real information in the spirit of the right to know and of openness of Government information.
<P>
The Government are contemplating a right to know Bill. We heard a lot about it when they were in opposition but it seems to have been postponed. In advance of that, however, let the Government practise what they preach and inform people about what is happening as a result of the schedule to the hundreds of thousands of people who have been taxed and damaged. If those people have not been damaged, the law of Bristol, South is valid, and people are truly grateful to be taxed and to have &#163;5 billion a year taken off them, the Government should be enthusiastic about writing them a letter--perhaps like sending a Christmas card. It could start, ``I am very happy to inform you that you are going to see a sharp increase in taxation''.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does my right hon. Friend believe that the mother of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry will be queuing up to pay extra tax on her pension fund contributions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I foolishly omitted to consult my hon. Friend's mother on that point, but I know that she would look forward to receiving some information about it because she is unwilling to rely entirely on her son. He may be rather partial as a potential beneficiary in the very long term. Information should come from the Government and should be factual in nature.
<P>
If the Government claim that the measures are good for contributors and members of pension funds who will not need to be compensated, why are they making provision to compensate charities? That is a useful analogy. A friendly society could be seen in some respects as comparable to a charity. Some closed pension funds are very like charities because they have huge numbers of beneficiaries--those drawing pension benefits--and almost no existing contributors. The British Coal pension fund is an example. It has no prospect of making up any deficiency of its income from employer contributions, but it has millions of existing pensioners. In that sense it is, as I say, analogous to a charity.
<P>
The Government have agreed over a period of seven years--starting in two years' time--to compensate charities, so the principle is admitted that a reduction of benefits is involved. The same must be true of those who will be hit by schedule 3. That makes it all the more important for the Government to come clean about what they have done in the schedule, to write and inform them impartially, and to rectify the damage that they have done thus far in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The purpose behind the clause is to remove the credit that is available to insurance companies and friendly societies, which is fine and follows on from everything else in the Budget. It will also rationalise, however, the rules that relate to those companies, and is meant to include all distributions that those companies receive in calculating the profit or loss that is made from their life assurance business.
<P>
The Treasury notes on the schedule state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There were a number of inconsistencies in the various rules which were scattered around a number of sections of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. Now all distributions are to be included in all circumstances''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is important. The notes continue:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This is consistent with the treatment to be applied to other financial concerns as a result of clause 24.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
According to the Association of British Insurers, that is most unfair and is not consistent with clause 24. Schedule 3 provides for the inclusion of distributions from their own subsidiaries--their group income, in effect--which does not appear to be fair. That is certainly not the case in clause 24. Will the Economic Secretary respond to that when she replies to the debate on the schedule?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am delighted to learn from the recycled speeches that we have heard this evening that the right hon. Member for Wells is as committed to recycling as I am.
<P>
I shall recycle the point that we have made repeatedly throughout the Bill's proceedings: our proposals on tax credit are specifically designed to remove a distortion from the tax system. We are particularly anxious to ensure that we create a climate of long-term growth and investment. In that way, those who participate in pension funds and other forms of saving and investment will benefit, along with those to be affected by the proposals elsewhere in the Bill to move them from welfare to work.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman rehearsed again the arguments that we heard from the hon. Member for Daventry, about publishing documents to go to every householder. Frankly, householders are much more interested in seeing a secure future for themselves and their children than coping with the inadequacies of the Opposition's arguments.
<P>
I had some sympathy with the beginning of the right hon. Gentleman's speech, concerning the impenetrable nature of parts of schedule 3 and other parts of the Bill. But we have been in government for fewer than three months--the right hon. Gentleman was part of a Government who had been around for 18 years, but at no point did they do anything to clarify the language of such legislation. I can recall drawing the previous Government's attention to the impenetrability of the 1995 Pensions Bill in this very Room. Its language made it exclusive--ordinary people could not understand it without the help of advisers. It will take time for us to undo the indolence of Opposition Members over the past 18 years in improving the structure of legislation.
<P>
Schedule 3 makes several changes to the tax rules for life insurance companies that are consequential on changes that are made elsewhere. They will lose their entitlement to have tax credits on their pension business paid to them, a move that mirrors the change to pension funds in clause 19, which the House of Commons debated last Wednesday. Then, the point was made repeatedly that the Government recognised that we had to take hard decisions. The hard decisions on the abolition of tax credits, however, were made for a specific reason: to remove the distortion. In a sense, the previous Government had already recognised that distortion when they sought to reduce the level of tax credits, but at that time they did not redirect the money that was saved into cutting corporation tax, for example. They merely used it to fill a hole in the public sector borrowing requirement.
<P>
Other changes in the schedule affect the way that dividends are taken into account when life insurers calculate the profits that they make from the different types of business that they conduct. I shall not rehearse again all the arguments about tax credits and pension funds. I will say, however, that we do not need any lectures from Conservative Members on the co-operative movement. Indeed, a number of us continue to be members of the co-operative movement; we could probably start a competition as to how many remember their co-op share number, which is something that has come to the fore again.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman referred to friendly societies. The considerations are the same for life companies and for friendly societies which conduct that sort of business. There is one point in the schedule that I should like to stress. Paragraph 12 makes it clear that friendly societies which get payments of tax credits relating to their exempt life assurance business will continue to do so until 6th April 1999. But if a pension society writes pension business, as some do, they will be in the same position as all other pension providers.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman suggested that I might like to mention charities. As we shall have ample opportunity to discuss the impact of the Bill on charities when we reach the relevant clauses, I shall continue my remarks in relation to the main points contained in the schedule.
<P>
A number of provisions simplify and rationalise the way in which dividends are taken into account when a life assurance company computes the trading profits it makes from various parts of its business. Up to now, those provisions have grown up in piecemeal form--hugger-mugger seems to be the expression, although I had never heard it in my life until tonight; it is obviously a term that has not penetrated the depths of central Lanarkshire. The provisions contained a number of anomalies when one was compared with another. Sometimes those arose because tax credits could be paid, as in pension business, so when making necessary changes we decided to clarify the entire area. The effect of these changes on a company's tax bill will vary according to the types of business a company writes, and in most cases we think that the overall effect will be negligible.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman asked a specific question about the costs of schedule 3. The main cost for the insurers relates to the loss of payable tax credits on pension business. We have discussed that on a number of occasions in this debate. I think that he is aware that the cost is &#163;1.1 billion. The cost of other measures is likely to be extremely small and is referred to fully in the Budget day press release.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned group income from subscription.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Subsidiaries.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Subsidiaries I am sorry, my tongue is beginning to stick to the roof of my mouth. We recognise that life offices have to operate through subsidiaries in some areas for regulatory reasons. That is so that there is no regulatory requirement that they should hold the shares in their operating subsidiaries in a long-term business fund. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.

Schedule 3 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 24</center></H4>
<H4><center>Taxation of dealers in respect of distributions etc.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 15, line 12, leave out `received' and insert `receivable'.
<P>
I tabled the amendment in response to outside representations with the intention of improving the Bill. It is possible that there is a mistake and that ``received'' should read ``receivable''--in other words, operating on an accruals rather than cash-received basis. I shall listen to the Financial Secretary's response and I shall not press the amendment to a Division, as there is no point in making a bad Bill worse by passing an inappropriate amendment. However, it seems that the treatment should be accorded on an accruals basis--``receivable'' could be a more appropriate word than ``received''.

<P>

<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Dawn Primarolo):</B> I shall comment briefly on the what the right hon. Member for Wells has said on this narrow amendment. I assure him that the amendment is unnecessary. It was always our intention that distributions in the scope of the clause should be taxed on an accruals basis where that is how they are dealt with in the commerical accounts. We consider that the clause already achieves that objective.
<P>
Last week, the Inland Revenue wrote to the London Investment Banking Association to confirm that point. I am happy to repeat that assurance and put it on the record. I hope that that deals with the right hon. Gentleman's concern.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
I shall not press the amendment to a Division. I tabled it in a fit of enthusiasm and only two people ever understood it. I have forgotten what it means and my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry is looking elsewhere, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The clause is meant to deal with anomalies that arise when companies rapidly transact shares. There are circumstances in which companies will hold shares for a little longer. It seems inequitable that, if a company holds shares for six months, they should be taxed in the same way as a short-term holder's shares. Will the Government consider introducing a minimum holding period--perhaps, three months--beyond which the provisions of clause 24 would not apply?
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I do not know whether I can just let this clause go by because one or two points about it seriously concern me. I did not succeed in getting many answers to my questions from the Economic Secretary who has just left the Room, so I hope that I do better with the Financial Secretary.
<P>
Before I rose to speak, I had some trepidation as to whether I should do so at all because, of course, the provision affects the interests of dealers in shares. As I have already declared, I advise NatWest Markets, which is undoubtedly a dealer in shares. I have no idea to what extent the clause will impact on NatWest Markets. However, the clause will impact on the generality of dealers in shares. I shall say something that will not be in the interests of professional share dealers, but which is nevertheless worth saying.
<P>
I understand that the object of the clause is to deal with a quite well-known tax arbitrage. Dealers in shares are charged corporation tax on the net amount of the sales minus the cost of the shares, in so far as they realise a capital gain. In so far as they receive an income in dividends, they, as incorporated bodies, do not pay tax on that income; they simply receive the dividend minus the 20 per cent. advance corporation tax. In effect, in so far as their income is derived from dividends rather than capital gains, they effectively pay tax at 20 per cent. rather than 31 per cent. Naturally, instead of realising capital gains in the normal way, there must be a considerable temptation to buy shares cum dividend, sell them ex dividend and take profit in the form of a dividend with a lower tax rate. If the Financial Secretary wants to deal with that matter under the clause, I have some sympathy with her intentions--I might lose a few friends in the City for saying so--and I would not necessarily seek to frustrate them. However, I am much concerned about the method that she has adopted in addressing the anomaly.
<P>
If I am misreading the clause, I hope that the Financial Secretary will intervene in the interests of saving time. As I understand it, the clause will simply mean that dividends will be double taxed. In effect, the 80 per cent. of dividends after the deduction of advance corporation tax will be fully taxed at 31 per cent. with no credit given for the 20 per cent. tax paid. As a result, the Financial Secretary is moving from one anomaly, whereby which dividends are undertaxed, to another, whereby they are overtaxed. That seems both anomalous and irrational.
<P>
The clause might undermine the position of share dealers in this country because it will not affect offshore dealers in United Kingdom shares. Therefore, all such companies will have an interest in moving to the continent or some other jurisdiction to conduct their business so as to continue with an advantageous arrangement. Under most continental jurisdictions--I think that this is right; the Financial Secretary will correct me if I am wrong--they will receive a full credit for the tax deduction at source. If that is the case, the Government will have produced something anomalous which will undermine the relative competitiveness of share dealing in this country. That cannot be in the interests of the City.
<P>
If the Financial Secretary looks at subsection (4), she will see that a similar anomaly may well be created in dealing in overseas shares. Most overseas shares under double taxation agreements are subject to withholding of tax in the country of origin of a dividend of up to 15 per cent. At least, the limit is normally 15 per cent.; I am sure that the Financial Secretary can cite me cases where it is not, but that will not alter my argument.
<P>
It seems to me that a similar anomaly will be created for dealing in overseas shares. Whereas at present, under a double taxation agreement the dealer in overseas shares will receive a full credit for 15 per cent., once the clause is in effect--that is, again, if I read the matter correctly--all that the dealer will be able to do is to expense his 15 per cent. All that he will receive is a tax credit of 31 per cent. of the 15 per cent. Again, he will be disadvantaged as compared with the present arrangements and--this is the important economic point--disadvantaged in relation to dealers in overseas shares located in other jurisdictions.
<P>
Can it be that the Financial Secretary really wanted to create that situation? Have I properly understood her purpose? I may not have done, in which case I shall be happy to withdraw my remarks. If I have understood her purpose, what is the reason behind it? Why did she decide to replace one anomaly with another that is potentially damaging to share dealing in this country? That is an important, if simple, question, to which the Committee needs an answer.
<P>
If the Financial Secretary did not intend that outcome, will she now consider the matter and tell me whether those perverse consequences will flow from the Bill as drafted, and whether she will consider some amendments so as to prevent them? If she would like to hear them, I have one or two simple suggestions in mind as to how she could remove the tax arbitrage that the clause addresses without producing the perverse effects that I have described. However, I may have misunderstood the position, and there is clearly no point in my volunteering such suggestions if they are irrelevant.
<P>
The clause should not pass without scrutiny, and I hope that we will recieve clear answers from the Financial Secretary on those points.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The clause is the first in an important series of measures to stem tax leakage through avoidance schemes and exploitation of loopholes. We aim to ensure that everyone--individuals and companies--pays their proper share of tax. If they do not do so, by means of contrived tax planning devices or avoidance schemes, that places an unfair burden on the majority.
<P>
The proposals in the clause will end the system that allowed the creation of tax losses even when traders were not out of pocket. In five years, that change will bring &#163;500 million to the Exchequer. The Chancellor has already announced that if we find that the new rules are being sidestepped by attempts to treat shares that are really trading assets as investments--for example, by moving them to a non-trading associate--we will take action in the next Finance Bill to block such schemes.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton raised the question of introducing a minimum period of three months. That would drive a coach and horses through the provision and undermine precisely our attempt to tackle the problem with preference share dealing. Therefore, we are not prepared to consider what he suggests.
<P>
<B>Mr Woodward:</B> I wonder whether the hon. Lady can inform the Committee on the extent of the negotiations that the Government had with the London Investment Banking Association in drawing up the clause. As she may know, that association is concerned that the clause has been put together without proper consideration and it is keen for the measure to be delayed while proper consultations take place. The association is particularly worried because it believes that the clause has not taken into account that the dividends received by investment banks have already been subject to tax. Will the Financial Secretary clarify that point?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am aware of the arguments advanced by the hon. Gentleman, but this is an anti-avoidance measure and consultation does not normally take place on such measures, which are intended to defend the Revenue. Had we left the matter untouched, we would continue to lose revenue. One of the points that the Revenue made was the same as that raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton on double taxation and whether or not dividends will now be double taxed.
<P>
It is not true that there will now be double taxation. The ACT accounted for when dividends are paid is, as its name suggests, an advance payment of the payer's own corporation tax liability. It is not payment on account of the recipient's own liability to tax. For the great majority of investors in companies who do not have a tax liability on dividends, the imputation system will continue to do its work in mitigating double taxation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford referred to non-United Kingdom share dealers. It is true that in some cases, double taxation agreements allow shareholders who are not resident in the UK to claim payment of part of the tax credit. We cannot simply override those arrangements, but the changes in 1999 mean that such payments will stop then, as they will for everyone else, and so the value will become negligible.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I think that the hon. Lady started by saying that there would be no double taxation and then a moment ago said that there were safeguards that militated against double taxation. Clearly, if the company cannot claim the tax credit and is then charged mainstream corporation tax on the whole of the balance of the dividend, there must be double taxation. The hon. Lady cannot deny that.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The purpose of the clause is to remove the ability for traders to create a loss when there is not a true loss, and then claim taxation relief on it. The clause will prevent the claiming of a relief that was not intended for preferential shareholders or market makers who can access reliefs. That is at the heart of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> When the hon. Lady talks about creating a loss, does she mean the ploy to which I referred of buying a share cum dividend and selling it ex-dividend? If so, her characterisation is inappropriate. That is not creating a loss. Clearly, if one buys a share cum dividend, it carries a higher price because it includes the right to enjoy the dividend. That is not creating an artificial loss. I accept entirely that it is artificial to tax a share dealer's profits that derive from dividends at a lower effective rate than those profits that derive from capital gains. I have already ceded that point to the hon. Lady, but she does not seem to have recognised that. If she wants to meet that anomaly, why does she not simply tax share dealers on their net income, so that the taxpayer is allowed to net off the 20 per cent. ACT that has already been paid? She could then tax the resulting profits, whether from capital gains or dividends, at the same rate of tax--in this cas the corporation tax of 31 per cent. Would not that be much easier, much more straightforward and prevent any anomalies?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The clause brings the dividend into the corporation. To illustrate that I shall use the market maker example. He buys a share for 104 with the dividend about to be paid; the dividend is paid and moved away from corporation tax. He then has a share worth 100; he sells it at a loss of four and claims that loss, even though he made a profit with the dividend. The clause includes the dividend for corporation tax purposes, which seems appropriate because of the profit involved. The amount that dealers bring into commercial calculations of profit is the dividend received; that is the right amount to tax, and allowing companies to set tax credits against corporation tax ignores the basic fact that that is not tax deducted from a gross amount of income that represents a payment of a tax liability for the recipient. We are therefore ensuring that our relief is not used when no trading loss has occurred. It is a straightforward and simple measure that will bring &#163;500 million into the Exchequer over five years. I therefore hope that the Committee will support the clause.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall be brief because the hour is late. I can see nothing immediately objectionable in the clause. The arguments set out in the notes on clauses seem fairly clear and I simply seek two assurances: first, that the clause is, as it appears to be from the notes on clauses, a simplification measure because there will be no need for section 732 to apply to distributions received as a result of transactions in UK shares as they will be treated as part of the trading profit; secondly, I have not noticed any representations made to the Opposition on the matter--can the Financial Secretary confirm that she has had no adverse representations from any interests which she wishes to share? Subject to that confirmation, we do not wish to delay the Committee further on the matter.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I can confirm that the measure is indeed a simplification and that we have not received any written representations on the matter.
