The clause attempts to offer additional flexibility in the allocations
process. That in itself is no bad thing, but we have concerns that the
powers in the clause could produce perverse outcomes if misused. Those
concerns are shared by the Chartered Institute of Housing, which
emphasised that local authorities must be accountable to their
communities<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“and that
communities must be representative—otherwise authorities that
don’t want to accept certain people will be able to exclude
them”,<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>and it went on to talk
about the powers of the Secretary of State. Amendment 223 would ensure
that the Secretary of State could bring forward regulations only after

entire category of people from eligibility for social housing, there
needs to be appropriate due process.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000022">&#160;</a>

The measure, however, is not localist—it is centralising, and

examples of the type of scenario envisaged by that phrase, so that we
could better understand why it is necessary. The Secretary of State
making those decisions, which will have such a local impact, ought to
speak to councils, housing associations, charities and other interested
bodies, as well as tenants. We do not see why the amendment should not
become part of the Bill. At this stage, it is just a probing amendment,

                           </strong> It is good to get going again
this morning, Mr Bayley. I do not know if it is a reassurance to the
hon. Lady if I say that clause 122, which she seeks to amend, is
actually part of the Housing Act 1996. She will see that most of the
clause is in inverted commas. Proposed new section 160ZA(8) is an
unchanged transposition of the existing legislation. For what we hoped
was the sake of clarity, rather than inserting stray words here and
there in a provision that would otherwise be extremely difficult to
comprehend, we have completely reproduced the section in the Bill, with
various amendments incorporated. The clause leaves the provisions
completely unchanged. I think that I am correct in saying that the way
that those provisions have been used before is that the Secretary of
State, particularly in relation to foreign nationals, makes a general
statement or proposition about
eligibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the hon. Lady says, this is a probing amendment, and she wants to know
what the provisions are about; one would have to go back and speak to
those who drafted the 1996 legislation. However, its provisions have
certainly survived unscathed after 13 years of Labour Government
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000026">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 223
would impose a 12-week consultation period, but that is good
administrative practice in any case, and it seems unnecessarily
cumbersome to impose something on top of a process that appears to have
worked without significant protests, side effects or, indeed, ill
effects. It would seem sensible not to encumber the Bill with a
statutory consultation period when such consultation is exactly what
happens.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000027">&#160;</a>

quite understand that the hon. Lady wants to find out what the
provisions are about. They are about maintaining the existing statutory
provision, which will, on occasion, require the Secretary of State to
take a decision about eligibility. That might relate to, say, changes
in immigration law, our international obligations or other matters of
that scale and type. If the Secretary of State had to take such a
decision, it would be normal administrative practice for there to be
such a consultation period, so I hope that the hon. Lady will not press
her amendment to a Division.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000028">&#160;</a>

hoping that the Minister would fill in some of the gaps for the benefit
of the Committee. In a brief stand part debate, I will come back to one
of the points that the Minister raised. However, will he tell the

1996? I am curious to know exactly how well used they

infrequently—at the outset of the scheme, and from time to time

precise number, but I can assure the hon. Lady that there have been
very infrequent changes to the broad eligibility criteria. We are
talking about whether somebody without British nationality or migration
visa status can be considered by a local authority for inclusion on the

entirely sensible. As I said, changes to immigration rules or our

regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000031">&#160;</a>

legislation introduced by the Labour Government, but that is not to say
that we do not think that it should be amended.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000036">&#160;</a>

stands, an applicant might never receive the letter, but they would
none the less be treated as if they had been informed. It does not seem
fair that an applicant will be treated as if they have been informed,
even though they might never have received the letter. We all know that
a lot of letters—millions—go missing in the post, and we
will have spoken to constituents in our surgeries who claim that they
have not received an important letter, so it is a little bizarre to
state in legislation that even if the letter is not received, it will
be considered as having been. I am sure that we have all had people in
our surgeries saying, “Sorry guv, the letter didn’t
arrive,” and there clearly needs to be protection against that
sort of abuse, but we are trying to strengthen the protections for the
applicant while not giving carte blanche to someone who, not liking the
content of a letter, pretends not to have received it. The amendment

applicant would be told, verbally, during the first point of contact
that a copy was available for collection at the authority’s
office and, although this is not in the amendment, a time scale should
perhaps be given, to avoid
confusion.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000037">&#160;</a>

amendment is a sensible minor change to the clause, and it would reduce
any potential for confusion, particularly as many of the people
concerned are vulnerable or have a range of other difficulties, and the
non-receipt of a letter might not be their No. 1 priority. They might
not even have taken it in that that was how things would happen. We
need to reinforce the advice given to applicants at an early
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000038">&#160;</a>

scary provision; it rolls forward an existing provision. The amendment,
which in effect says that local authorities should use their best
endeavours to inform an applicant of whether they have been successful,
is really a matter of good administrative practice, and might well be
expected of local authorities as a matter of
course.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000039">&#160;</a>

soon find ways of letting that be known. We just need to have regard to
the fact that an applicant with a serious intention of getting their
name on the waiting list who has in some way been overlooked, or has
had a written notification that they have been taken seriously gone

choice-based letting schemes, in which the length of time that people
have been registered is a material factor, so if there is a delay
because an individual who ought to have been registered is not, and
there has been uncertainty as to whether they have been on the list,
that could affect their prospects of being allocated a house. Is it
really fair to not accept an amendment that simply says that what the
Minister wants—good practice—must happen? We all know
that many authorities do not, as the Minister suggests they should,
make every endeavour to ensure that individuals are provided with the
information they need, and we all know that letters sometimes go

that many of us will have constituents who are in subsisting
relationships. I can think of at least three in my constituency, and I
do not have a particularly large ethnic minority population. They are
in relationships and may have a child, but one party’s
immigration status is unresolved. It would be helpful to clear up the
position of the partner with the child, to whom the local authority
might have some duty, or who should rightly benefit from an allocation.
It would appear from that subsection that that family unit might be
debarred from having a home allocated. I would welcome reassurance that
that is not the case.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000050">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister also clarify the position of the person whose partner applies
under subsection (6)(b) and is refused, not on the grounds of
qualification? Would it be possible for the partner to appeal against
the decision, under subsection (11)? I might have misinterpreted that,
but there seems to be some confusion and I would welcome clarification.
For the benefit of the Clerks, I think that there is a point of
correction

                           </strong> I thank the hon. Lady for her questions. Overall,
clause 122 is designed to give local authorities the power to decide
who should go on their waiting lists, rather than having a national
rule that says that anybody and everybody can unless the Secretary of
State says not. She rightly asked me several questions about who will
be excluded in any case. We are giving local authorities discretion to
include, but the Bill gives the Secretary of State powers rolled
forward from previous times to say, “Notwithstanding your
discretion, there are some types of people to whom you cannot allocate
homes.” She asked me to say something about the specifics in two
different cases, I think. I will deal first with the case of parents
who are excluded from consideration due, for instance, to their
immigration status, and who have no recourse to public
funds.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000052">&#160;</a>

clear. I was discussing an example in which one of the parents is not
eligible under the clause. For instance, one might be a British
national and have a child, but their partner might not be, and the
partner’s immigration status might be questionable under
subsections (2) and (4) of the proposed new section. The
example involves a mix in the partnership, not parents who both have no

common for households that have brought a member from abroad whose
recourse to public funds is restricted to be denied access to public
resources because of that, even though one or both parents may be
British citizens who are entitled to public housing and the pupil
premium. I am in correspondence with the Secretary of State for
Education about that, as it appears that in circumstances in which one
parent in a household is subject to restrictions on access to public
funds there may be a block on the application of the pupil premium.
That would be very unfortunate for households in areas where there is a
real need for additional resource because of financial
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000066">&#160;</a>

Friend the Member for Plymouth, Moor View that the Minister reflects on

entitled to be considered for the allocation of public housing, to be
denied it because of the presence in the household of someone who might
have arrived recently and was subject to restrictions on access to
public funds, or other immigration restrictions. Those complex cases
could create the difficulties, so I urge the Minister to reflect

restrictions, but re-examine whether they are drawn in the right place,
we shall of course take a look at the matter, although I do not give an
undertaking that doing so will bring a certain result. However, I

are perhaps becoming a little repetitive, but there are far too many
Henry VIII centralising clauses in the Bill. Under the clause, proposed
new section 166A will be inserted into the Housing Act 1996, subsection
(8) of which will give the Secretary of State the power to specify
factors that local authorities<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000073">&#160;</a>

Ministers believe the Secretary of State will rule out of
consideration? There has been a bit of a theme this morning about what
the Secretary of State can rule in or out.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000074">&#160;</a>

the Minister envisage the power being used? How prescriptive will the
Secretary of State be about the discretion of local authorities? If the

prescriptive, why is the power needed at

opportunity to explain the situation. Essentially, clause 123 allows
local authorities to set their own allocation schemes. It is necessary
to give the Secretary of State a backstop provision because, as the
right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich said, we know that all
local authorities do not always proceed in the best way possible. We
consulted on that during the recent consultation period, when there was
a clear majority in favour of retaining the current reasonable

new section 166A of the 1996 Act differs from the existing section 167
in one main respect. Section 167 allows local authorities to give no
preference to those guilty of unacceptable behaviour; by inverting
that, it is possible that somebody guilty of unacceptable behaviour may
be excluded from the list. The wording is unnecessary and it would be
inconsistent to retain that power. It is unnecessary because we are
giving local authorities greater flexibility to decide who should be in

are removing the power for local authorities to take behaviour into
account when determining eligibility. That said, it is still

                           </strong> The clause sets out the groups to be given
reasonable preference, which includes those in unsuitable, unsanitary
or overcrowded housing. It would be helpful to know how many people
living in such conditions are in homes managed by registered social
providers or the local authority if we are to understand the pressures
in the allocation system that affect
stock.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000082">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">How
is the clause likely to be interpreted when Army families return from
Germany in the not-too-distant future? The Department for Communities
and Local Government does not seem particularly worried about that
additional demand because its answer to a recent question that I tabled
was that it was a matter for local authorities. Will the Minister
explain which categories such families will fall into? A large number
of people—perhaps tens of thousands—may need to be housed
when those service personnel are brought home. Defence Estates, by its
own admission, does not have the capacity to house them all. There has
been talk of using RAF Kinloss, but those premises are largely for
single people, not families, many of which are now based in Germany. I
do not think that the Navy will suggest using some of its
decommissioned frigates as
accommodation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">How
will the local connection be decided in such cases? Could local
authorities use subsection (5)(c) of the proposed new section to
exclude families from accommodation in their area? We know that
Aldershot is already under pressure as a result of the changed ruling
on the Gurkhas and, quite reasonably, a large number of those returning
Army families will also feel that their local connection is with that
garrison
town.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000084">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is scope for the local connection to be misused or, worse, abused. What
would happen if, as we have seen in some parts of England, local people
wanted to keep a local area for one ethnic group or another and the
council supported that view? I suspect that that would be a worst-case
scenario—nobody would want that to happen—but it is not
beyond the realms of possibility. What protections are in place to
prevent such action, which could damage community
cohesion?<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000085">&#160;</a>

                           </div>protection and privacy? Clearly, we have a well-informed public these
days who want access to everything, and there might be circumstances in
which local authorities are put in a difficult position. For example,
allegations made against an applicant by a third party might be
relevant to their application, but the local authority clearly could
not pass them on. Given the constraints around data, how will the
applicant be able to compare their progress through the allocation
process with that of others awaiting assistance? We have all heard
people saying, “So-and-so down the road has been given an
allocation and their case isn’t as good as mine.” I am
not sure how this part of the Bill will resolve that, other than by
perhaps presenting further problems for local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000086">&#160;</a>

Chartered Institute of Housing feels that the system is cumbersome and
lacking transparency? How will the Minister address its concern that
the scheme could generate high levels of demand for internal moves,
which could pose problems for landlords in high-demand areas? The CIH
has also described another possible problem: springboard tenancies,
under which tenants get a home through the register and instantly seek
a transfer to try to get a better property. That may not be the intent
of the clause—indeed, it might not be what the clause will
allow—but given that that concern has been raised by a fairly
reputable body, I would welcome the Minister’s clarification on
whether he and his officials think that that is a
possibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000087">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As with the preceding clause, the majority of the
wording is in quotation marks because it is a reprinting of the
existing legislation. As I tried to explain before—I am sorry
that I was not very eloquent—the measure is exactly the same
except that one provision is missing: the one relating to what we might
characterise as antisocial behaviour. Everything that appears in the
Bill is simply carrying forward existing legislation. That is not to
say that the hon. Lady has not raised some perfectly sensible points,
but I do not want her to form the impression that we have somehow
smuggled in a whole new set of new provisions that are untested and
untried. I do not think anything here will give rise to anything new,
although I accept that the current system is not capable of making
everybody happy, because we are dealing with a quantity that is in
short supply and under pressure.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000088">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
asked a sensible question about the position of returning service
families. There is a circular of statutory guidance on giving
additional priority to those in medical and welfare categories, and I
know that my local authority’s allocation scheme reflects that.
I have no doubt that that will continue to be the case. If a situation
were to develop in the way in which the hon. Lady has outlined, I am
sure that local authorities would consider it part of their role to
reflect that in their allocation systems.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000089">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
asked about data transfer and transparency, but because we are
restating an existing provision, everything is as it is now—we
are not introducing any new requirement that might lead to the leakage
of data. I agree that plenty of people who apply unsuccessfully for
houses believe that there is dirty work at the crossroads by the
council, by applicants or—dare I say it—by people who do
not have visas. Those are all difficult

we want a really open and transparent allocation scheme so that anybody
can see what a particular council’s scheme is, and can
understand why they have been included or excluded and whether it is
appropriate for them to appeal. The Chartered Institute of Housing may
feel that the system is cumbersome—I understand that point of
view—but it has been cumbersome for about 15 years. I have not
seen any specific proposals from the institute about
how it might be streamlined, but I suggest to the
Committee that this existing provision—we consulted and found
overwhelming support for continuing with it—should quite
properly be included in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000091">&#160;</a>

carry-over. I am delighted to see that the respondents to the
consultation thought that, by and large, the system was not broken and
did not need to be changed, and that it has worked over the years. It
is clearly not perfect, and if we could come up with an option to
improve it, we would like to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000092">&#160;</a>

Government to talk to the Ministry of Defence and work with those local
authorities that could see quite a significant influx to ensure that
the situation does not suddenly land on their doorsteps with the result
that they have to invoke measures in the Bill to enable them to exclude
people from the allocation process at the last minute. Frankly, it
would go down like a lead balloon with the wider public if they thought
that service families were being excluded.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000093">&#160;</a>

not. We have made it extremely clear that we put the welfare of our
armed forces at the top of our agenda. Indeed, a debate took place on
exactly that point earlier this week. I repeat that there is a circular
of statutory guidance to local authorities on giving additional

a significant problem. We are not necessarily discussing people who are
medical or welfare cases; we are discussing families returning from
Germany, and it is not appropriate to put them all up at RAF Kinloss.
They will all claim a local connection, which might well be to some of
the garrison towns, such as Colchester and Aldershot—and perhaps
parts of Plymouth—and that could put quite a burden on the local
authority. The Minister talks about the circular, but the written
answer that I received from his Department in the past couple of weeks
basically said, “It’s not our responsibility; it’s
local government’s responsibility.” There is a problem
brewing. He is quite right that the clause has been carried over, but
it could be misused. It might be a good idea to get together with local
authorities and the MOD at an early stage so that the nature of the
problem is fully

                           </strong> Let me start with new clause 13, which would sit
in the homelessness part of the Bill and would bring all the measures
and procedures adopted by local authorities under housing options, or
similar schemes, within the statutory homelessness framework as per
part VII of the Housing Act 1996. The new clause comes with the strong
support of the homelessness charity Shelter, whose chief executive,
Campbell Robb, gave oral evidence to the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000115">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
the present system, a person approaching the council for assistance is
required to have a formal interview that offers advice on housing
options. That is required for not only people who are seeking to be
assessed as homeless, but those who want to bid for social housing
through the authority’s choice-based letting scheme. As such,
the first contact with the local authority from which a homeless
applicant wants to seek help is not regulated or covered by any
statutory minimum standards. According to figures released by the
Minister’s Department in “Homelessness Prevention and
Relief: England 2009-10” more than 165,000 households were
assisted by housing options services outside the statutory homelessness
framework in that year, which is four times the number of acceptances
and 85% more than the number of homelessness decisions made within the
statutory framework. In effect, 165,000 people were not covered by any
minimum standard.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000116">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have heard
from the Minister and Labour Members that standards vary greatly across
local authorities. As local authorities’ responsibilities
increase and they are able to vary the way in which they deliver
services, it will be more important than ever to guarantee certain
statutory minimum standards. If there is a need to track a
family’s income to decide its ongoing
suitability for a home, as the Bill proposes, it is
also extremely important that interviews and data received are managed
consistently.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Basing
housing options within the statutory framework would still give local
authorities the freedom to tackle housing issues as they see fit. It
would, however, guarantee a basic level of support for vulnerable
people, who can often be intimidated by the complexity of housing
legislation and may be unaware of their rights. New clause 13 would
require an authority to assess the housing needs of the applicant with
a view to targeting its advice towards those specific needs. The
authority would be required to set out its advice and any offers of
assistance in writing, which would include any housing options that had
been identified as appropriate for the applicant. The new clause makes
it clear that the applicant would not be under any obligation to adopt
a specific housing option or to accept a private tenancy arranged by
the authority as an alternative to the authority being required to
complete its inquiries into the applicant’s homelessness. It
would require that when an authority arranges for an offer of private
tenancy to be made to an applicant during a housing options process,
the authority must ensure that the tenancy is of at least 12
months’ duration and that the applicant is clearly informed that
he or she is not bound to accept the offer. If he or she does accept,
the authority will be under no duty to complete its inquiries or to
decide on his or her homelessness application.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000118">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The provision
would not be onerous for a local authority, although I acknowledge that
there might be some concerns about a slight increase in the
bureaucratic burden that it could create. However, the best authorities
do some of this work already.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000119">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. He and I

                        <p class="tabbed">The Bill
significantly weakens the rights of homeless people and those at risk
of homelessness. I am interested to know what principal
objections—if any—the Minister has to greater statutory
protection for people approaching their local authority for assistance.
Did he consider such an option during the drafting of the Bill? If so,
why did such a provision not make it, because I have no doubt that
Shelter and other bodies would have lobbied pretty hard and spoken to
officials? New clause 13 would be a welcome addition to the Bill, so I
hope that the Committee will support it when we press it to a
Division.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000122">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
226 would place in the Bill a requirement that properties should be
affordable to the applicant. Depending on what the Minister believes
are the statutory implications of “suitability”, this
will be a probing amendment. We do not want an applicant to be placed
in difficulty because they have been allocated unaffordable private
rental sector accommodation, or for that accommodation to make them
heavily reliant on state support in the form of housing benefit. It is
important that an allocation is affordable for someone with average
earnings who does not have recourse to housing benefit but may be
prescribed by the Secretary of State as eligible for housing. Will the
Minister confirm whether the definition of “suitability”
will reflect the applicant’s entitlement to local housing
allowance? Will it take into account the income of the applicant and
their ability to afford the accommodation? If not, is it not
appropriate to amend the Bill to ensure that accommodation is
affordable?<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000124">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Not
all local housing authorities spend a great deal of time with housing
applicants working out whether they can manage their rent in advance of
taking on a tenancy. Support and advice of the type mentioned by the
hon. Member for St Austell and Newquay often does not happen early
enough or in a way that makes it effective. Support and advice often
kicks in only when a tenant starts to get into serious arrears. If
affordability were a criteria, it would be clear that detailed early
work would need to be undertaken, which could happen if a statutory
duty were placed on local authorities as set out in new clause 13. If
the Government wish to press ahead with the affordable rent model, such
work will have to be done for the new tenancies in any case so that
there  is a benchmark by which to decide whether a
person’s income had risen above a certain level before they are
moved on.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 227
would remove the change under the Bill to section 193(7AA) of the 1996
Act that would allow local authorities to discharge their homelessness
duty by placing an applicant with priority into the private rented
sector in any circumstances with or without the consent of the
applicant. At present, 7% of homeless applicants with priority are
placed in the private rented sector, and we accept that in certain
restricted cases that is a suitable way forward, subject to agreement
with the applicant. Local authorities make use of that ability, but
when the Government propose to strip away the rights of applicants who
have no right to refuse whatever they are offered, irrespective of its
suitability, we must oppose the plans to weaken the rights and
protections afforded to people accepted as unintentionally homeless.
People who find themselves homeless—that can happen for a range
of reasons, although it would not be a good use of the
Committee’s time to run through them—are extremely
vulnerable.<a class="bkMark" name="11030357000126">&#160;</a>
