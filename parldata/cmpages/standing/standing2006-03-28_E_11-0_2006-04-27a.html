<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000249"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> Good morning, Mr. Chope. I hope that you are rested

after the exciting events of yesterday and that we can now get back to

work on this important Bill.</div>

<a name="06042738000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause deals with the

publication of proposals to make the alterations to schools provided

for under clause 17, which we debated on Tuesday. Clause 18 requires a

local education authority to publish its proposals in a prescribed

manner, but permits it to do so for any maintained school. It allows

the LEA to make alterations not only for community schools, which is

fair enough&#151;after all, community schools are run by

LEAs&#151;but for voluntary or foundation schools. With the

amendment, I seek to find out what might happen.</div>

<a name="06042738000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that a local

education authority should be able to publish proposals only for

community schools, and not for voluntary or foundation schools. I hope

that the Minister will reassure me that she does not envisage LEAs

muscling in to make alterations to voluntary or foundation schools. I

cannot believe that that is her intention, but it would be useful to

hear her views on the matter. For instance, if the governing body of a

voluntary or foundation school requires or does not require the

enlargement of its premises, or if the governing body wants to add 16

to 18-year-olds to the school&#146;s admissions, or if the school

already has a sixth form and does want to lose it, the decisions on all

such changes and similarly vital matters should rest with the governing

body of the school. Because an overwhelming proportion of

schools&#151;as much as63 per cent., as my hon. Friend the

Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) has 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column449" />Column number: 449</div>said&#151;are community schools I see no merit in LEAs, which have

quite enough work to do with their own schools, trying to make

alterations to others.</div>

<a name="06042738000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would limit

LEAs&#146; scope to order a change to community schools only.

According to my reading of the clause&#151;the Minister will correct

me if I am wrong&#151;unless the amendments are accepted the LEA

could cut off the sixth form of a voluntary school, order a voluntary

school to stop providing for children with special needs, or order such

a school to start making such provision. I cannot believe that that is

the Minister&#146;s intention. There is no point in voluntary or

foundation schools having governing bodies if, in practice, such vital

decisions are taken out of their

hands.</div><a name="06042738000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall speak

briefly to amendment No. 384, which deals with an important point. We

support the concept of foundation schools: we hope they are successful

and that we have more of them. I wish the Minister well in that

endeavour. Unfortunately, the concept is nothing like the policy that

the Prime Minister declared in the White Paper. His policy, which bears

repetition because we share it, that all maintained schools should be

&#147;independent state schools&#148;. That is my vision also. I

believe that there are still far too many apron strings tying

foundation schools to local authority diktats. Even more apron strings

tie them to diktats from the Department for Education and Skills. None

the less, foundation schools are a step in the right

direction&#151;one on which we can build when we take

power.</div> <a name="06042738000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">It follows

that if a local authority, perhaps a rather progressive one, can see

the benefit to children&#146;s education of having all the maintained

schools in its area given the independence offered by foundation

status, it should be free to make a proposal under clause 9 that all

its schools should become foundation schools. I have spoken to my hon.

Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), who reminded me that

Kent, for example, ensured that all its schools were grant

maintained&#151;</div><a name="06042738000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042738000250"></a><b class="B">Jonathan

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000251"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> Well, if it is wrong, I bow to local knowledge, but

certainly a very large number of schools in Kent were grant

maintained.</div><a name="06042738000023"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000253"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> The hon. Gentleman shakes his head. I can only

repeat the information that was given to me only last night by my hon.

Friend the Member for Canterbury. It is probably very likely that that

authority had success in persuading schools to become grant maintained.

What the hon. Gentleman says does not defeat the point that I was

making. I was only trying to adduce an example to show that a local

authority may well want all its schools to become foundation schools.

The Bill should provide for that to happen, which is why I tabled

amendment No.

384.</div><a name="06042738000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042738000254"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): My hon.

Friend made very worthwhile points in moving his

<div class="Column"><a name="Column450" />Column number: 450</div><a name="06042738000026"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000255"></a>Jonathan

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000256"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to take a

feet.</div><a name="06042738000028"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000257"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Thank you, Mr. Chope. My hon. Friend&#146;s

amendments reflect the Government vision originally set out in the

White Paper. Paragraph 2.5 of the White Paper

states:</div><a name="06042738000198"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We

will encourage all primary and secondary schools to be self-governing

and to acquire a

Trust.&#148;</div><a name="06042738000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments

therefore reflect the Government&#146;s

intention.</div><a name="06042738000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall

talk about the clause more generally, if I may, and make a short stand

part contribution to the debate. The document entitled &#147;A Short

Guide to the Education and Inspections Bill 2006&#148; states on page

4:</div><a name="06042738000199"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Local

authorities will also have extended powers (under clause 18) to propose

the enlargement of the premises, the addition or discontinuance of SEN

provision or the addition of a sixth form to any foundation, foundation

special or voluntary

school.&#148;</div><a name="06042738000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is set out

in clause 18(2)(b). It would be helpful if the Minister explained why

she believes that it is necessary to give those extra powers to local

authorities in relation to foundation schools and voluntary schools.

The powers are benign, but apart from the power to propose

discontinuing SEN provision&#151;we dealt with that issue through an

amendment to an earlier clause&#151;the powers relate to expansion

and creation. I note that there are no powers to force foundation or

voluntary schools to take extra pupils, only powers to expand premises.

However, it would be helpful to know why the Minister believes that the

powers are

needed.</div><a name="06042738000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (2)

is about alterations to schools that local authorities can propose. As

one would expect, they have more powers in relation to community

schools than in relation to foundation schools. The details of the

powers are set out in the draft regulations circulated by the Minister.

Regulation 5(3) of the draft School Organisation (Prescribed

Alterations to Maintained Schools) (England) Regulations 2006

states:</div><a name="06042738000200"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In the

case of voluntary, foundation or foundation special schools, a local

education authority may only propose one or more of the alterations set

out in section

18(2)(b)(i)-(iii).&#148;</div><a name="06042738000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,

it then states in square brackets and in

italics:</div><a name="06042738000201"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;<i class="I">We

intend eventually to set those out in more detail in a new part of

schedule 4</i>&#148;.</div><a name="06042738000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">My

concern is not that the regulations circulated for guidance purposes

only are not complete. That is perfectly understandable. My concern is

whether the Government intend to insert into schedule 4 to the

regulations details that give local authorities more power&#151;for

example, to expand premises&#151;than they have over community

schools, which are already dealt with in part 1 of schedule 4. Can the

Minister provide reassurance that there is no such

intention?</div><a name="06042738000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">While we

are talking about the regulations relating to clause 18, will the

Minister explain why the governing body of a foundation or community

school or a community special school does not have the power to expand

its premises under part 3 of schedule 2 tothe regulations?

Similarly, under schedule 4, a local 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column451" />Column number: 451</div>education authority appears not to be able to publish proposals to

enlarge the premises of community special schools, although it can

propose an expansion in the number of pupils at such schools. That

seems to be rather an odd difference.</div>

<a name="06042738000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, paragraph 11 of

schedule 2 to the regulations lists a series of changes of category

that a foundation or voluntary school can propose, including changing

from a community school to a voluntary school. That does not make

sense, because the provision does not relate to community schools; it

relates to foundation schools. How can a foundation school move from

being a community school to a voluntary school? Is that simply a

drafting error or is it an issue on which we need to expand

further?</div><a name="06042738000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042738000258"></a><b class="B">Annette

Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): I want to make a

few brief comments. Not surprisingly, I do not agree with the general

thrust of the amendments. We consider the local authority to be the

body with the strategic view and, as such, it should be the one to

publish proposals. We might not agree with those proposals, but if the

Government&#146;s vision is truly that the local education authority

should have a strengthened commissioning role, it is essential that the

publication of proposals be in the local authority&#146;s

hands.</div> <a name="06042738000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">On clause

18(4), and following logically from the arguments that we made on

clause 17, we want the possibility of a return to community school

status, as well.</div>

<a name="06042738000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 18(2) merits discussion

and explanation. I have difficulty with the idea that the local

authority is always bad. It might not always be good, but it is not

always bad. A really good local authority, in playing its strategic

role, is there to help out even grant-maintained schools&#151;as

happened in my local area when things went pear-shaped&#151;because

it operates on behalf of the whole community. Problems occur in all

types of school, and when the chips are down it is usually the local

authority that has the expertise to help.</div>

<a name="06042738000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister is aware that I

have a tricky case in my constituency, in which replacement buildings

have not been provided following a fire that happened more than six

years ago. The school has now become a foundation school. Will she say

whether there is or should be a process to deal with the rare

circumstances of an out-and-out conflict between a school and a local

authority? Unlike the Conservatives, I do not envisage such

circumstances arising frequently, but I think that they can occur

rarely. Perhaps we should tease out whether we need a regulation to

cover exceptional circumstances.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000259"></a>The

Minister for Schools (Jacqui Smith):</b> As we have heard,

amendments Nos. 340 and 341 are designed to prevent a local authority

from making proposals for alterations to foundation and voluntary

schools. However, our proposals for some expanded abilities for local

authorities are made in the context that we have discussed under

earlier clauses&#151;a new framework for school organisation,

involving, as the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette

Brooke) rightly recognises, a significant new strategic role for the

local 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column452" />Column number: 452</div>authority as the commissioner of provision and the champion of parents.

That is the rationale for the proposals in this clause.</div>

<a name="06042738000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under current legislation,

although a local authority can propose the closure of any maintained

school, it cannot make other sorts of proposal in respect of voluntary

schools and can propose only the expansion of foundation schools. We

think that in order to discharge its responsibilities properly, a local

authority should be able to propose alterations relating to expansion

and to special educational needs and sixth-from provision in respect of

all maintained schools in its area.</div>

<a name="06042738000216"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15

am</div><a name="06042738000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot

provide all the reassurances that the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr.

Leigh) seeks, but I can reassure him about the removal of a sixth

form&#151;an issue that he raised. The changes that a local authority

can make are limited to the addition to a school of a sixth form. It

could not publish proposals to remove a sixth form from a foundation or

voluntary school.</div> <a name="06042738000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked whether the

section in italics in the illustrative regulations implied that we

wanted to go further in schedule 4. I can reassure him that have no

intention of going further than what is spelled out in those

illustrative regulations.</div>

<a name="06042738000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 18(2)(b) will ensure

that a local authority can propose changes that extend choice for

parents and that the necessary provision is available in the area. It

is precisely because we envisage that more schools will be

self-governing foundation or voluntary aided schools that we need to

reconsider local authorities&#146; powersso that they can

operate their strategic role appropriately&#151;not running schools

or making day-to-day decisions, but being responsible, as champions of

pupils and parents in their area, for ensuring and extending parent

choice.</div>

<a name="06042738000046"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000260"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> Is the Minister reassuring the Committee that local

authorities will not have a hands-on role in voluntary aided schools? I

think that that is what sheis trying to say. If local

authorities are to be commissioners rather than providers of services,

what sort of decisions or initiatives does she envisage that they might

make in respect of voluntary aided

schools?</div><a name="06042738000047"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000261"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> I was just spelling that out. As the clause makes

clear, the role of commissioner implies that authorities will be able

to publish proposals for particular provision that is necessary to

deliver choice for parents and pupils. That is why we are proposing

that local authorities, particularly those with many foundation

schools, should be able to propose, for example, the addition of a

sixth form&#151;not its removal, as I assured the hon.

Gentleman&#151;or of an SEN unit to work alongside schools in the

area to reassure people that there is sufficient specialist SEN

provision. Those are the sorts of proposal that the clause

covers.</div><a name="06042738000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions

will not allow a local authority to impose such changes. As clause 19

and the illustrative regulations make clear, the local authority will

have to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column453" />Column number: 453</div>consult interested parties, including the school, and publish its

proposals, giving an opportunity for objections or comments. If a

foundation of voluntary school does not agree with the proposal, clause

21(5) provides that the school&#146;s governing body or trustees can

require that those proposals be referred to the

adjudicator.</div>

<a name="06042738000049"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000262"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I listened carefully to the Minister&#146;s

response to my hon. Friend&#146;s intervention. Will she explain why

subsection (2)(b)(ii) gives local authorities the power to discontinue

SEN provision in a school? I understand why they might want the power

to establish it, but why the power to discontinue? That is the only

negative and destructive power in the clause, and I am slightly

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000263"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> As we were discussing the other day when we talked

about the local authorities&#146; role of ensuring sufficient and

appropriate provision, it might be appropriate to reorganise SEN

provision in an area and to close one unit in order to make provision

elsewhere. As the hon. Gentleman said, only in those circumstances will

a local authority be able to open and close such

provision.</div><a name="06042738000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our

proposals strike a reasonable balance between allowing the authority to

propose changes in order to improve the supply of school places, and

providing for the schools themselves to ensure that decisions are taken

by the adjudicator if there is a disagreement. I hope that the hon.

Member for Gainsborough feels sufficiently reassured that the balance

is reasonable and will therefore withdraw the amendment.</div>

<a name="06042738000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">In amendment No. 384 the hon.

Gentleman argues that local authorities should be able to propose that

all their schools become foundation schools, which would give the local

authority a significant power. At the same time, however, he argues

that we ought to limit the powers that we give to local authorities. I

think that he intended the proposal to apply only to community schools,

but as drafted it would include voluntary schools&#151;faith schools,

for example. I do not think that the governing bodies of voluntary

schools would welcome local authorities having the power to turn them

all into foundation schools against their will.</div>

<a name="06042738000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">More importantly, the

principled argument that we have made throughout is that the decision

on whether to change status from a community school to a foundation

school, or whether to acquire a trust, should be taken in the first

instance by the governing bodies of the schools themselves. Such a

change is not something that could be imposed by a local authority on

all its schools. I hate to tar the hon. Gentleman with this charge, but

he is making a very centralising proposition. I know that he would not

want that, so I hope that he will not press that

amendment.</div><a name="06042738000054"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000264"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I am happy to withdraw the amendment, because I am

reassured by the Minister&#146;s assurance that there is no question

of a local authority being able to step in to remove a sixth form,

which is where I suspect there would probably be most controversy. I

take her point about amendment No. 384. I wanted to probe the

Government&#146;s thinking, but clearly I do not want to give local

authorities the power to interfere with the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column454" />Column number: 454</div>status of voluntary aided schools. In fact, that amendment would not be

a centralising measure as such, because the local authority would be

surrendering its power if all the schools in an area became foundation

schools. However, I take her

point.</div><a name="06042738000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">We shall try to

accept the right hon. Lady&#146;s assurance that the clause is not a

centralising measure, because that would be unfortunate. I am prepared

to accept her word that it is benign, particularly in relation to

foundation schools, and that it is designed only to allow local

authorities to make suggestions for SEN provision, for example. On that

basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000267"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> It is good to serve on the Committee under your

chairmanship, Mr. Chope. Seeing you in the Chair reminds me of the

Queen&#146;s eightieth birthday&#151;you share all her dignity, but

not her age.</div> <a name="06042738000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

clause relates to the procedures by which prescribed alterations to

schools published under clause 18 are made. The amendment would require

that, where the regulations under subsections (1) and (2) confer

functions on local authorities or allow them or the Secretary of State

to refer proposals to the adjudicator, they will exercise those

functions</div><a name="06042738000202"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;with a view to

encouraging all primary and secondary schools to be self-governing and

to acquire a trust or

foundation.&#148;</div><a name="06042738000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

our previous sitting, the Minister said, rightly, that some would like

to place an obligation on local authorities for all schools in their

area to become self-governing. She said that every school should

instead be encouraged to do so. I said that the Prime Minister and the

Minister once took the view that all schools should be encouraged to

adopt the new freedoms and independence in question. I quoted the White

Paper, which

says:</div><a name="06042738000203"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At the

heart of this new vision are Trust schools ... We will encourage

all primary and secondary schools to be self-governing and to acquire a

Trust.&#148;</div><a name="06042738000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I then put it to

the Minister that she might have changed her mind and bowed to pressure

from the hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor), who is a formidable

figure. He and others made a powerfulcase that the spirit of

the White Paper, with its encouragement of all schools to acquire a

trust, would not necessarily be efficacious. He thought that it would

be better for some schools not to follow the route set out in the White

Paper.</div> <a name="06042738000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tabled the

amendments with the intention of reinforcing the Minister&#146;s

position and injecting a little more steel into her backbone, so that

she can see off the challenges from the hon. Gentleman and others. He

is the acceptable face of the rebels&#151;the tame rebel&#151;but

there are others who will be altogether harder to see off and more

intransigent in their determination to frustrate the intentions behind

the White Paper and the Bill. We want to help the Minister, as we have

throughout the Bill&#146;s progress. The amendments would make the

proposals in the White Paper a reality by making it easier for schools

to follow the route it envisaged.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column456" />Column number: 456</div><a name="06042738000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would also ensure

that the adjudicator would make decisions on prescribed alterations to

schools with a view to their becoming self-governing. A

&#147;self-governing&#148; school is defined in amendment No. 207

as a foundation or voluntary school, a foundation special school or an

academy. New clause 15 would take further the duty to work with a view

to schools becoming self-governing by applying it to all functions of

the local education authority under part 2 of the Bill.</div>

<a name="06042738000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments go to the very

heart of the Bill. Do we envisage a future in which all schools will be

self-governing? In our previous sitting, the Minister confirmed that

she still believes it right to encourage that. Replying to my

intervention, she

said:</div><a name="06042738000204"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I have

not changed my mind. I am making a distinction between compulsion and

flexibility and enabling. The legislation is all about allowing schools

to move in the direction that we believe to be the most effective,

which is spelled out in the White Paper.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official

Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 25 April 2006; c.

442.]</div><a name="06042738000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">She clearly wants all

schools to become self-governing. She envisages not the future that the

hon. Member for Bury, North wants, but one in which all schools take on

the new freedoms available to them, to the benefit of the children who

attend

them.</div><a name="06042738000217"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

am</div><a name="06042738000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are all in

this business to try to deliver the best education possible for as many

children as possible, to build on good practice and to create effective

schools. We should make it clear through the debate on the amendments

that that is where we all want to be. Is it the destination to which we

are all travelling? It certainly is not where other Members of the

governing party who are not on the Committee want us to go. We will not

ask why, as that would be indiscreet and, perhaps,

impolite&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Well, they are here in the form

of the Liberal Democrats, who speak for them on this Committee, and who

will doubtless make their comments about the amendments in due

course.</div> <a name="06042738000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those people

have a perfectly reasonable point to make. They take a different view

on education, the nature of school government and, I guess, the White

Paper. That is fair enough; let us have that debate, but let us be

clear where the Government stand on it. I want to be sure that they

have not bowed, that there is absolute certainty about their

intentions, and that they remain true to the spirit of the White Paper

and of Lord Adonis, who has been a powerful figure in education for the

Government. More than that, he has been a powerful exponent of many of

the virtues in the White Paper that are given force in the Bill, and

which we support.</div> <a name="06042738000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

recommend to the Committee a book by Andrew Adonis and Stephen Pollard,

called &#147;A Class Act&#148;. It talks about the myth of

Britain&#146;s classless society and goes into education matters in

some detail, including the subject of grammar schools, which we will no

doubt discuss later in our considerations. Lord Adonis is a powerful

advocate of grammar schools as a way to enable greater social mobility.

However, let us not digress. Indeed, I am sure that you will not allow

me to do so, Mr. Chope.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column457" />Column number: 457</div><a name="06042738000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us consider the background

to the amendments. In a letter to no less a person than the Chairman of

the Select Committee&#151;the man who saved John Clare&#146;s

cottage for the nation; I do not make light of that&#151;the

Secretary of State

wrote:</div><a name="06042738000205"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Enabling

schools to benefit from a trust is at the heart of our

proposals.&#148;</div><a name="06042738000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">She went on

to say that the amendments would create a duty to encourage all schools

to become self-governing. In his monthly press conference, on 11

October, the Prime Minister

said:</div><a name="06042738000206"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;By the

end of this third

term,&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06042738000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">linguistically

he is not at his best

here&#151;</div><a name="06042738000207"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I want

every school that wants to be able to

be&#148;</div><a name="06042738000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">one to

become</div><a name="06042738000208"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an independent,

non fee-paying state school, with the freedom to innovate and develop

in the way it wants and the way the parents of the school want, subject

to certain common

standards.&#148;</div><a name="06042738000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

the introduction to the White Paper, the Prime Minister

says:</div><a name="06042738000209"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our aim

is the creation of a system of independent non-fee paying state

schools. It will be for schools to decide whether they wish to acquire

a Trust&#151;similar to those that support Academies&#151;or become

a self-governing foundation school. But it will be easy for them to do

so, without unnecessary bureaucratic interference. And they will do so

in a system of fair admissions, fair funding and clear

accountability.&#148;</div><a name="06042738000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

principle of trust schools is at the heart of the Government&#146;s

agenda. It was what drove the White Paper, and is at the core of the

Bill. The White Paper

says:</div><a name="06042738000210"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At the

heart of this new vision are Trust schools...We will encourage all

primary and secondary schools to be self-governing and to acquire a

Trust.&#148;</div><a name="06042738000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is precisely

what we say in these amendments. We have become committed to the

principles of the White Paper because we think that they are right.

What works is what matters. That degree of self-government, in which

schools have proper control of their affairs, and the greater diversity

and choice that it will produce will be beneficial. It will produce an

education system that delivers more for more children.</div>

<a name="06042738000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to align ourselves with

the Schools Minister, the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister

inasmuch as they agree with that vision. We could be churlish and say

that we got there first, but we are all in the same place, so let us be

nothing less than generous about that. On that basis, it would be

almost inconceivable for the Minister to reject the amendments in my

name and those of my hon. Friends. They give life to the principles

that I have outlined and repeat the pledges that the Prime Minister and

others made in the White Paper.</div>

<a name="06042738000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">By the time the Select

Committee considered the matter, however, the Government had begun to

backtrack. As I said, they were subject to pressure. I do not need to

tell you, Mr. Chope, that parliamentary arithmetic had a part to play

in that. The Government did not expect my right hon. Friend the Leader

of the Opposition and my hon. Friends the shadow Secretary of State and

the shadow Minister for Schools to provide the principled opposition

that they did; they thought that the Opposition might deceive them and

not support the Bill. As we know, however, Mr. Chope, that is not the

kind of Opposition that the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column458" />Column number: 458</div>Conservatives represent. We are absolutely principled in our

determination to do our best for the children of this country and we

would never let petty squabbles, short-term gains and a miserable

pyrrhic victory obscure that vision. We were therefore there to back

the Government. But, uncertain, they felt that they had to bend in the

direction of those with a rather less clear view of the virtues of the

White Paper and everything that it can do.</div>

<a name="06042738000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Select Committee report

said:</div> <a name="06042738000211"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

Secretary of State has told us that there will be no incentives

offered, or pressure exerted, to encourage schools to become Trust

schools. The decision to become a Trust will be for individual schools.

We welcome these assurances. That being the case, the Schools

Commissioner is likely to perform a much less executive role in

relation to Trust schools than the White Paper

suggests.&#148;</div><a name="06042738000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">That view was

not, however, shared by the whole Select Committee. A minority report

welcoming trust schools was submitted by some of its members, who are

also on this Committee. I pay tribute to their work on the Select

Committee and to their courage in producing a minority report. The

report

said:</div><a name="06042738000212"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We

support the development of Trust schools, with their greater autonomy

and the external support that a trust would bring. This autonomy should

include full ownership of assets. Independence must mean full

independence if it is to have impact and real value. We believe that as

the Trust is a new category of school it should be a duty to promote

it. We also believe that the Government should leave open the option of

a requirement for schools to become Trusts or independent of the local

authority in some

form.&#148;</div><a name="06042738000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

minority report, the White Paper and the Opposition are clear: we want

to encourage all schools to become trust schools, although I say no

more than encourage. Contrary to what the Minister quite naughtily

suggested at our previous sitting, this isnot about the

difference between obligation and encouragement, and we should not

oblige schools to do things that are not in their interests and which

their governors and the local community do not want. This is about how

actively we encourage schools&#151;that is the real difference

between us. The White Paper was clear about that, but the Bill is less

so; the Prime Minister and Lord Adonis were clear about it, but

Ministers are now rather less so. I appreciate that Ministers are in a

difficult position, but I want to be helpful and guide them in the

direction in which I know they want to

travel.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000268"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> I should like to tease out exactly what

encouragement means. Does it mean thatthe Conservative party

would give favourable consideration to bids for grants if it was in

government? As we have suggested, schools have been encouraged to take

the academy route. Would trust foundations be encouraged in the same

fashion?</div>

<a name="06042738000089"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000269"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The critical determinant is what is best for the

local school and the children who attend it, and that would apply

whether or not it was a trust school. There should not be a policy of

discriminating in favour of a type of school that did not meet the

interests of local parents and children. I do not think that the

Minister or the Opposition would want to go down that road. We should

not in any way propose that there should be favourable treatment

outside of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column459" />Column number: 459</div>the criteria of what is best for the local community, the children and

the school. I am rooted to that principle.</div>

<a name="06042738000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to me that the issue

is the vision in particular localities. If it becomes the view in a

locality that such an aim is desirable, much would be done to encourage

it. If, however, it is absolutely clear in some localities that people

do not want that to happen, it will not happen or will, at least, be

difficult to achieve. We have indicated throughout our

proceedings&#151;I will not go over them, as that would be

tedious&#151;points at which the local authority could obstruct,

obscure, obfuscate or deter.</div>

<a name="06042738000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is our worry that some local

authorities will not seize the initiative and welcome the Bill with

open arms but, indeed, will do their best to frustrate it and the

Government&#146;s ambitions. We need a balance, but I am sure that

the balance lies in encouraging schools to go down the trust school

route because we believe that that would be beneficial.</div>

<a name="06042738000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are the Government willing to

back their own instincts? Do they want to move to a freer education

market? Is the White Paper a bluff, appealing over the heads of Labour

MPs to middle-class voters without offering real change, or will the

Government be frightened into making concessions because of opposition

from their own MPs? We believe that the Government should have the

courage of their convictions. It is important that the Bill should

become law in a form that is likely to bring about the original

objectives. That is why we have tabled the amendments.

</div><a name="06042738000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments make

the position crystal clear. In amendment No. 206 we suggest that we

effectively encourage local authorities to deliver the vision described

in the White Paper, which I have reinforced in this short debate. Our

additions to clause 19 would enable us to achieve what the Government

hope and want to achieve. New clause 15 goes a little further, as I

have said, but it is in much the same vein.</div>

<a name="06042738000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Government will

accept the amendments. I do not think that there is any doubt that they

should. It would be a healthy sign that the Committee is coming to

terms with the consensus that has developed, which my hon. Friend the

Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has spoken about before. It

would also, I think, reaffirm the Government&#146;s position and make

it clear whether they will be absolutely certain about where they want

to go. </div><a name="06042738000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

has an opportunity to see off her critics. It is an important chance to

reassure parents, communities, teachers and governors outside this

place, who will be hanging on her every word and waiting to see what

she will do about our amendments. If she were to accept them, any doubt

about commitment and intent could be dispelled. I hope that the

amendments will be accepted in that spirit and I am delighted to move

them in my name and that of my hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000274"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> No role at all, is the simple answer

tothat simple question. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I missed that

sedentary comment from the Minister, but I am sure it was very

revealing.</div>

<a name="06042738000102"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042738000275"></a><b class="B">Jonathan

Shaw</b> (Chatham and Aylesford) (Lab): It was something about

barking.</div><a name="06042738000103"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000276"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> The Minister should be aware what the Prime

Minister himself said, which bears repeating, again and again, that

eventually he wanted all maintained schools to be &#147;independent

state schools&#148;. What did he mean by that? I take it to refer to

schools that are still funded completely by the state, that is, the

taxpayer&#151;we all accept that&#151;and which therefore are free,

but otherwise manage their own affairs, free from overruling or

overriding by the local authority or the Department for Education and

Skills, or both. Those schools would be as free as the independent

schools are in all respects: the organisation of the school, future

policies, curriculum and examinations, staffing levels, salary

levels&#151;always within the money allocated&#151;disciplinary

procedures, budgetary procedures and outside-school-hours provision.

They would have all that freedom as in independent schools, within the

requirements laid down by the Charity Commission and subject to Ofsted

inspection.</div> <a name="06042738000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is

presumably what the Prime Minister wants, and I am sorry if the

Minister thinks that he is barking. That is the Prime Minister&#146;s

dream. It is also, I suspect, the dream of many people who work in the

maintained sector&#151;the teachers who run the schools, and who are

desperately anxious to be able to get on with their own jobs. They are

the experts. They want to be free from the Department&#146;s

interference, free from endless structural changes and free from

endless diktats on the curriculum. They just want to get on with the

job of teaching and running their own

schools.</div><a name="06042738000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">If schools

were given that freedom it would be the single greatest impetus not

just to diversity in the maintained sector but to an increase in

standards, and it would transform education in this country. I very

much hope that when there is a Conservative Government again we will

move towards giving maximum freedom to all schools in the maintained

sector.</div><a name="06042738000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under my

proposals maintained schools would effectively become independent

schools, although they would be funded by the state and would be

entirely free at the point of delivery in every respect. They would be 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column461" />Column number: 461</div>subject to the constraints of the Charity Commission, Ofsted and a firm

of auditors. All I ask is that all state schools be treated similarly.

State schools do not need local and national politicians interfering in

them; they do not need us, in this room, to tell them what they should

do or how they should teach. We do not do that in many other aspects of

our national life, in which people get on with running complex

organisations,and do so extremely well. No one doubts, I

think, that the independent sector works perfectly well. That comment

may, of course, prompt someone to jump up and say, &#147;It is not

surprising, because they are better funded than maintained

schools,&#148; but it is not just a question of funding. It is a

question of freedom and diversity. That is what the independent sector

provides and that is the vision that I have for the maintained

sector.</div><a name="06042738000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Teachers are

professional people and highly trained, whether in independent or state

schools. Let us start to treat them as professionals. I noticed that a

Labour Member of Parliament appeared on &#147;Newsnight&#148;

yesterday and said that we should not worry about the reception given

to the Secretary of State for Health yesterday, because it is spring,

it happened at the seaside, and Ministers are always barracked at NUT

conferences, nurses conferences and so on. Why do those health and

education service professionals feel so aggrieved? It is because of the

endless changes imposed on them. They simply want to get on with their

job. They are professional people and I believe that we can trust

them.</div><a name="06042738000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">None of this

apparently barking policy is new: it has been implemented before. A

Conservative Government introduced grant-maintained schools. That term

means simply that those schools were maintained by the state through an

annual grant, whose size depended on the number and ages of the

children in the school. It was a fairly simple and easy-to-understand

system, in which the money followed the pupil. It is immaterial whether

we once again use the term &#147;grant-maintained&#148;. I used

that term in new clause 19 because there is a precedent for it and it

worked in many areas. However, we need not use it in future; we could

call them anything. We could call them foundation schools or trust

schools, but the essence of my proposal is that they should have

freedom and independence equivalent to that of grant-maintained

schools&#151;that is the vital point&#151;and that, effectively,

all schools should therefore have those freedoms.</div>

<a name="06042738000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that the

grant-maintained schools that the Conservatives set up proved

conclusively the great benefits to be gained, both for standards and

for the effective use of money, through such freedom and independence.

I know that grant-maintained schools are controversial and it is

claimed that they received beneficial funding in comparison with other

schools. We could solve that problem by making all schools effectively

grant-maintained schools. Then they would all be funded on the same

basis.</div> <a name="06042738000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I propose that

the time has come for all state schools in England and, I hope, Wales,

Scotland and Northern Ireland, to become the equivalent of

grant-maintained schools. We could of course have a period of

preparation for those schools, of two or three years or whatever we

liked, under this Bill or a future Bill. However, eventually all

primary and secondary state 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column462" />Column number: 462</div>schools would automatically be self-managing, equivalent to the old

grant-maintained

system.</div><a name="06042738000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042738000277"></a><b class="B">Ms

Angela C. Smith</b> (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab): Is the

hon. Gentleman announcing policy this morning? Is he saying that a

future Conservative Government would force all schools to become trust

schools and that he would introduce

selection?</div><a name="06042738000112"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000278"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> No. I am not in a position to announce policy. I am

only a Back Bencher. One of the advantages of being a Back Bencher is

that one is entitled to put before the House ideas that may be novel

but may eventually become policy&#151;who knows? I am in the happy

position of being about to celebrate my 24th year in the House, and 22

years of that time have been spent on the Back Benches. No doubt one

reason I spent so many years on those Benches is that I keep producing

these novel ideas, but that has not held me back so far, and I shall go

on doing it. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I missed that comment, but I am

sure that it was flattering.</div>

<a name="06042738000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">We could also organise matters,

as we did previously, so that the schools would automatically be given

charitable status. It would not be necessary for every one to apply

separately to the charity commissioners. For instance, the schools

would be so-called exempt charities. Grant-maintained schools had that

status, which also applies to Oxbridge colleges. They must submit

audited accounts, as a company does, to a funding agency. At their

height, grant-maintained schools represented one fifth of the state

secondary sector and some 500 to 600 primary schools. They ranged in

size from a primary school with 19 pupils to Great Barr in Birmingham,

which had 2,500 pupils until the abolition of grant-maintained schools

under the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. This has happened

before and could happen

again.</div><a name="06042738000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Education

Reform Act 1988 made provision for ballots. Its provisions and those of

the Education Act 1993 were consolidated in the Education Act 1996,

which laid down the following procedure, under which a school might

become grant-maintained. Each year, the governing bodies of schools

were obliged to consider whether to hold a ballot of parents on whether

to seek GM status, unless a ballot had been held in the previous school

year. They were required to ballot parents if a written request to do

so had been received from the parents of at least 20 per cent. of the

pupils registered at the school and no ballot had been held in the

previous 12 months. A second ballot of parents had to be held if less

than 50 per cent. of those eligible to vote did so, and the results of

the second ballot were final.</div>

<a name="06042738000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary of State for

Education and Employment could invalidate a ballot and order a further

one if irregularities were detected. If a simple majority of parents

voted in favour of becoming grant-maintained, the governing body had to

publish proposals for the acquisition of GM status within four months

of the ballot, and those had to be approved by the Secretary of State.

Once a school&#146;s proposals were accepted, a new governing body

was incorporated, and took over the running of the school from the

previous one on a specified date.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column463" />Column number: 463</div><a name="06042738000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has all been done

before&#151;there were provisions for it&#151;so we can work out

how it might be done in future. However, we have to develop a procedure

by which the overwhelming majority of schools acquire that status. No

doubt the Minister will claim that this is a centralising measure, and

that we are trying to impose one vision on all schools. Far from it;

the opposite is the case. Because schools would, effectively, be able

to teach whatever curriculum they wanted and employ whatever staff they

wanted&#151;hire, fire, select and deselect&#151;there would be

enormous diversity. We would not need to have all this debate about

grammar schools or non-grammar schools. Some schools would be selective

and some would not.</div>

<a name="06042738000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The response to my argument is

always that that is wrong; schools would want to cherry-pick and so on.

However, every school would eventually find its own level. I can never

understand those who oppose independence in schools. They imagine that

there will suddenly be an enormous, revolutionary

change.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000280"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> No, I want to finish this important point. Most

people who run schools are fairly conservative. They do not want rapid

change. One of their reasons for not liking what has gone on in the

past 30 or40 years is that they believe that changes have

been imposed on them. If we had the courage of our convictions, and

allowed schools to do what they wanted, change would be slow and

incremental and head teachers would gradually respond to what parents

wanted locally. Most schools would stay very much as they are; most

comprehensive schools, for instance, would remain comprehensive. It is

true that they would want to respond to parents, and many parents want

a traditional type of education. Others do not necessarily want that.

Some people want faith schools; others do not. Some want uniforms;

others do not. Some want traditional education; others want progressive

education. Change would be slow.</div>

<a name="06042738000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">If only this Committee had the

courage to stop interfering and to let the professionals get on with

it, there would not be chaos or an enormous revolution in our schools,

there would be gradual, incremental change for the better and schools

would be able to respond to what parents

wanted.</div>

<a name="06042738000121"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000281"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> I am curious to know what the hon. Gentleman

meant when he said that all schools would find their own

level.</div><a name="06042738000122"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000282"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I meant that schools respond to the situation in

which they find themselves&#151;to what parents want, and to what

they can and should do. That is what life is about, and surely it is

what we all do. We provide a service, whether in the public or the

private sector, and, depending on our skill or professionalism, people

choose whether to use it. Parents are in that

situation.</div><a name="06042738000219"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

am</div><a name="06042738000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once schools

were free to manage, it would become apparent to parents which school

they should send their children to. I agree that most would usually

want 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column464" />Column number: 464</div>to send their child to the nearest school. There would not be a

revolutionary change. The education system of the early 1950s would not

suddenly be replicated, and hundreds of new grammar schools would not

freeze out the existing comprehensive schools. Some comprehensive

schools might, it is true, want to select more pupils on the basis of

ability, but not all would do so, and I do not think that comprehensive

schools would suddenly become grammar schools. Others may disagree with

my view, but we should at least have the courage of our convictions and

allow people the freedom that they surely deserve.</div>

<a name="06042738000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">If my amendments were accepted,

it would follow that the education departments of county councils,

metropolitan boroughs and unitary authorities, which we refer to as

local education authorities, would no longer be needed. Even the

Department for Education and Skills would have a lot less to do. The

independent state schools would be funded according to a precise,

easily understood formula, and their funding would be paid to them,

probably termly, by a funding agency set up precisely for that purpose.

That agency would in turn be paid directly by the Treasury.</div>

<a name="06042738000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">With a simple and sensible

funding formula, little bureaucracy would be needed. As to the

Department, I am sorry that there are officials present, as I am sure

that they do a worthwhile job, but I guess that they could be equally

well employed elsewhere in Whitehall, because the role of the

Department would be very small indeed. Perhaps only about 100 people

would be needed altogether to be involved in policy.</div>

<a name="06042738000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">My new clauses and various

amendments tabled by my hon. Friends and me all point in the same

direction. It is time for the education system to come of age. It is

time to let schools off the hook of excessive bureaucracy and

regulations. It is time we really had&#151;not eventually, but

now&#151;independent state schools.</div>

<a name="06042738000127"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000283"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> Well, I am sure that the local councillors in the

hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency will be delighted to hear his

views about the role of the local authority. I can hear the printing

press whirring now, as leaflets containing his quoted remarks are

prepared for the local elections. His vision for education would remove

any tier of local accountability and any local priority-setting role.

It would prevent any kind of flexible funding involving different

Departments, which makes possible the joint funding of work that can

contribute to projects such as &#147;Every Child Matters&#148;.

Needless to say, the Liberal Democrats oppose the amendments and new

clauses.</div> <a name="06042738000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendments tabled by the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings

(Mr. Hayes) make it clear yet again that the Conservatives believe

community schools to be inferior to other schools. However, they have

not proved that, and we have rehearsed the arguments many times in

previous sittings, so I shall not cover them again. We shall oppose the

amendments.</div>

<a name="06042738000129"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000284"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings

commented on the make-up of the Committee&#151;which, on the Labour

Benches, is made up of splendid and committed individuals. At least 10

of the Labour Members who voted against the Bill 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column465" />Column number: 465</div>were given the opportunity to serve on the Committee, and refused. I

could characterise the Opposition amendments as being of the &#147;We

are from the Conservative party and we are here to help you&#148;

type. That is not a phrase that would ring convincingly in

anyone&#146;s ears. One clear thread of intention runs through all

the amendments&#151;the desire to impose a particular form of

governance on all schools. That desire manifests itself in slightly

different ways, but it is fundamentally the imposition of one model in

a context in which we have consistently argued that the way forward is

for schools, governing bodies and communities to have autonomy in

decision

making.</div><a name="06042738000130"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000285"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Will the right hon. Lady explain what is meant in

paragraph 2.5 on page 25 of the White Paper, which says:</div>

<a name="06042738000213"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We will encourage all

primary and secondary schools to be self-governing and to acquire a

Trust&#148;?</div><a name="06042738000131"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000286"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> We will, for example, appoint a schools

commissioner who will provide support and advice to schools that want

to go down that particular route, who will work with those who might

want to provide that sort of external support for schools, and who will

help with the documentation. That is precisely the sort of practical

encouragement and support that I want there to be, but that is

fundamentally different from imposing a particular

model.</div><a name="06042738000132"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000287"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The right hon. Lady must be clear: the White Paper

says, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton

reminded her:</div>

<a name="06042738000214"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We will encourage all

primary and secondary schools to be

self-governing&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06042738000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">not

some, not a half or a quarter, but all. That is my hon. Friend&#146;s

point, and the Minister failed to answer

it.</div><a name="06042738000134"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000288"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> Well, no, actually; the hon. Member for Bognor

Regis and Littlehampton was asking me what &#147;encourage&#148;

meant, and I explained. We are clear that self-government is an option

for all primary and secondary schools; support and advice will be

available for any that choose to take that route.</div>

<a name="06042738000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The most extreme of the

amendments are those tabled by the hon. Member for Gainsborough. As he

spelled out in his apocalyptic vision, his amendments would effectively

require all schools to become grant-maintained and to be outside the

local authority framework. I have to say that I think there is no place

for those amendments, or for that approach, either in the Bill or in

the Government&#146;s attitude to

education.</div><a name="06042738000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,

there is a group of amendments that do not go to the same lengths as

those tabled by the hon. Member for Gainsborough, but that nevertheless

seek to fetter the actions of a whole range of actors in the field of

school organisation by requiring them to exercise their functions with

regard to a particular view. I have some sympathy with the sentiment

expressed by the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings, but I

cannot agree with him on the inflexibility that the amendments would

introduce in all

circumstances.</div><a name="06042738000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">To take

the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Gainsborough first, they

would, as I suggested, effectively herald a return to an even more

extreme 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column466" />Column number: 466</div>version of grant-maintained status for schools, as they would require

the Secretary of State to make, by affirmative procedure, regulations

requiring all maintained schools to become independent charitable

trusts. The amendments would not leave that decision in the hands of

the individual governing body, and that was not the case even for the

failed GM policy. That goes against everything that our schools White

Paper stands for: putting parents and the needs of their children at

the heart of the school system; ensuring greater diversity of

provision, not central direction; and tailoring education to the needs

of individual

children.</div><a name="06042738000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Crucially,

the whole system must be set in a framework of local accountability and

determination. We want to ensure that all children are treated fairly

under that framework, which must be designed to combat social

disadvantage, not perpetuate it. None of my hon. Friends believes in a

school system&#151;or a society&#151;where people &#147;find

their level&#148;. We believe in a system that promotes opportunities

for everybody and ensures that every child is able to fulfil their

potential, as was set out in clause 1. We do not accept the status

quo&#151;the hon. Gentleman seems to imply that he does&#151;in

which where one gets to in life depends on where one starts. That is a

fundamental difference in the values that inform our decision

making.</div><a name="06042738000139"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000289"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> What proportion of the education budget is siphoned

off by the DFES and local authorities before it reaches

pupils?</div><a name="06042738000140"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000290"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> With respect to local authorities, a considerably

larger proportion is delegated to schools than was in 1997, because of

how we have reformed the funding

regime.</div><a name="06042738000141"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000291"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> But does the Minister agree that part of the

reserved portion of the budget that local authorities hold is often for

very important projects, such as preventing exclusions, and providing

cross-borough music facilities, special schools and transport

arrangements? It is spent on all sorts of things that other schools may

benefit

from.</div><a name="06042738000142"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000292"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> I agree with the hon. Lady that those are carefully

defined functions that it is appropriate for local authorities to carry

out.</div><a name="06042738000143"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000293"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> If I were to say that the DFES and LEAs siphoned

off up to 40 per cent. of the total education budget before it reached

pupils, would the Minister recognise that figure? If not, will she tell

us her figure?

</div><a name="06042738000144"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000294"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> That is not a figure that I recognise. Delegation

from local authorities to schools has increased from about 77 per cent.

in 1997 to well over 85 per cent., if not over 90 per cent.,

now.</div> <a name="06042738000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">What are the

other significant differences between the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

proposition and that in the Bill? First, he proposes a once-and-for-all

shift to what is, in effect, grant-maintained school status. We have

made it clear that there may need to be flexibility in the form of a

mechanism allowing schools to change their status and consider whether

trust status continues to provide what they want. We have therefore

built into the Bill 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column467" />Column number: 467</div>provisions to allow a governing body to remove a trust if there are

concerns about its performance. Once again, we have flexibility and

decision making for a governing body versus an irreversible and

inflexible model.</div>

<a name="06042738000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the hon. Gentleman

made it completely clear that, under his model, all schools should be

able to return to a system of selection. As I have identified on

numerous occasions, that is the absolute antithesis of his argument

that parents should be able to choose the schools that are appropriate

for them. Under that system, schools would choose pupils, not the other

way round.</div> <a name="06042738000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,

the hon. Gentleman acknowledged perfectly openly that, under his

proposals, GM status is part of a deliberate attempt to break up the

local family of schools by encouraging them to opt out of local

authorities; indeed, it would completely destroy the education function

of local authorities. As we know, GM schools were directly funded and

given additional capital and recurrent funding, in contrast to other

schools. Indeed, they were given about the only capital funding that

was around at the time&#151;talk about a bribe.</div>

<a name="06042738000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman talked

almost in passing about the national funding agency that would need to

be formed. There was a funding agency to direct funding to

grant-maintained schools under the previous regime. It is fundamentally

wrong to suggest that setting up a large national bureaucracy to fund

every school in the country would not provide more jobs for DFES

officials. That proposition goes against everything for which the

Opposition have argued, particularly at the last election. It would

lead to a large new national bureaucracy&#151;that is what the hon.

Gentleman is arguing for.</div>

<a name="06042738000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government are clear that

trust schools will remain within the local authority-maintained sector

and be funded by the local authority on the same basis as other

schools. As we have repeatedly made clear, no school will be forced to

acquire a trust, although the option to do so will be available to all

schools. It will be for each individual school to make that decision

according to its specific needs and local circumstances. Our Bill and

our approach are permissive and enabling, unlike the prescriptive

approach taken by Opposition Members.</div>

<a name="06042738000150"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000295"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I am not sure how the Minister can describe

encouragement as prescriptive. Our amendments are wedded to the

principles in the White Paper. What sort of future does she envisage?

Does she, like the White Paper, envisage all schools following the

proposed path? Will half of schools do that, or a

quarter?</div>

<a name="06042738000151"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000296"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> In fact, I was just coming to what I might call the

mainstream Opposition amendments. I have to say that I feel marginally

warmer towards them than I do towards those of the hon. Member for

Gainsborough. An interesting tussle is going on over Conservative

policy, and it will be interesting to see what emerges at the end of

the process. Will Conservative Members flip in one direction or flop in

another during that policy formation process? I

suspect 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column468" />Column number: 468</div>that their leader will wait to hear what other people have to say to him

before he makes up his

mind.</div>

<a name="06042738000220"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

am</div><a name="06042738000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.

206 and 207 and new clause 15 are not damaging in the same way as are

those of the hon. Member for Gainsborough, but they are unnecessary.

They attempt to force a particular model on to local education

authorities, the schools adjudicator and the Secretary of State, and

effectively to second guess a school&#146;s decision.</div>

<a name="06042738000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can appreciate the sentiment

behind the amendments, which, to a certain extent, is consistent with

the objectives that we have spelt out and that the hon. Gentleman

highlighted today. In our view, however, the way in which they seek to

impose those models in all circumstances would work contrary to the

policy of giving schools the freedom to decide for themselves how they

wish to develop in order to meet the needs of pupils, parents and the

wider

community.</div><a name="06042738000154"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000297"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> Will the Minister confirm that the proportion of

the total education funding held back by central Government is higher

than that which might be retained for the local authorities&#146;

functions that we have just

described?</div><a name="06042738000155"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000298"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> No, I will not confirm those figures. The hon. Lady

is right; I have made that argument, particularly in relation to local

government. This Government, however, have put in the hands of schools

and governing bodies more resources and powers to enable them to make

the decisions that matter for their pupils and communities.</div>

<a name="06042738000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our proposals will provide

freedom and fairness for all schools, and sharp accountability for

results. We do not want to fetter their autonomy and interfere with

their procedural rules. That is why the amendments tabled by the hon.

Member for Gainsborough, which seek to impose directly a particular

model, and the more mainstream proposals from the hon. Member for South

Holland and The Deepings, which would require bodies other than the

governing body to attempt to second guess, and&#151;I must

say&#151;in some cases, frustrate the wishes of an individual school,

go against the spirit of the Bill and the White Paper. That is why I

shall resist

them.</div><a name="06042738000157"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000299"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I invited the right hon. Lady to affirm her support

for the principle of trust schools and to repeat the assurances given

by the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State when they introduced

the White Paper anticipating this legislation. I did that with

amendments that say simply that encouragement to that end should be

part of the Bill. I do not regard encouragement as prescriptive or

dogmatic, but as entirely in the spirit that underpinned the

Bill&#146;s intentions. I am surprised therefore that she has not

embraced the amendments with the enthusiasm that I

anticipated.</div> <a name="06042738000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Minister is right: there is a difference of nuance between the opinions

of Committee members, for which we make no apology. The Conservative

party is 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column469" />Column number: 469</div>an open-minded, plural party. We are an Opposition in the process of

developing our ideas on this subject, and it is absolutely right that

my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough should have the opportunity

to express another view&#151;a different model. We are pleased that

he is serving alongside us on this Committee and proud of his

contribution here and to the House. It would be healthy to explore the

key points that he made about the virtues of giving schools freedom and

the benefit that that brings to teachers and governors.</div>

<a name="06042738000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Teachers and head teachers are

among the most creative people in our society and the more we constrain

them, the less we get from them. My hon. Friend is right about that.

Successive Governments have probably taken too little account of that

creativity, and the constant changes to and imposition of targets,

regulations and schemes have done teachers no favours. I want their

creativity to flower for the benefit of our children, and I want a

Conservative Government who recognise that and who re-elevate the role

of educators and enable them to exercise the kind of freedoms described

by my hon. Friend.</div><a name="06042738000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendments, however, are moderate. Indeed, one might say that they are

framed in a way in which the Government would find irresistible. Well,

resist them they have; they are so fearful of their critics on the left

of the Labour party and of those even further to the left in the

Liberal Democrats, that they are timid about their own ambitions. We

are not timid about those ambitions, but proud and certain about what

we want to achieve for the benefit of our country&#146;s

children.</div> <a name="06042738000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me be

clear: the only reason why we support these kinds of measures and the

freedoms that lie at the heart of the Bill, about which we have spoken

today, is because they will be beneficial. They will deliver a better

education for our children. For that reason and because the issue is so

important, I intend to press amendment No. 206 to a Division to test

the Committee and the Government&#146;s resolve and toshow

where the Conservative party&#151;a principled Opposition, defending

the interests of the children of this

country&#151;stands.</div><a name="06042738000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042738000323"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> The amendments relate to the process of becoming

a trust school. During earlier sittings, the hon. Member for Bury,

North questioned whetherthe outgoing governing body would

always be best placed to make a decision if its school had failed in

its duty. Although I have sympathy with his views, Ishall not

attempt to deal with them in discussingthe amendments; I

shall take it as read that the Government intend that such bodies

should make the decision, and merely try to strengthen the majority

required.</div> <a name="06042738000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">A

two-thirds majority is known as a super-majority. For many businesses,

a super-majority is common practice when the board of directors is

asked to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column471" />Column number: 471</div>consider any major constitutional change. In fact, when a board of

directors is asked to deal with any special resolutions, such as

changing the company&#146;s name, a 75 per cent. majority is normally

required; a two-thirds majority is probably rather lenient for the case

that I am discussing.</div>

<a name="06042738000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The change proposed is serious;

it is not as if people would be voting for a new coffee machine in the

staff lounge. A simple majority would not do for business and it should

not do for schools. All the community will need to have confidence in

any decisions and merely arguing for a majority of those present on the

governing body, rather than a two-thirds majority of the whole

governing body, does not seem adequate. Such a majority would not be

used in the charity or business sectors.</div>

<a name="06042738000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 155 is intended

to ensure that schools consult their feeder schools prior to taking any

vote, not afterwards. I am sure that Committee members will agree that

feeder schools have a vested interest in any decision taken by the

schools that they feed. They have a right to be consulted and for their

views to be taken into account by the governing body when it makes a

decision.</div><a name="06042738000195"></a>
