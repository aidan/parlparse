<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000250"></a>The
Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs (Mr.
Pat McFadden):</b> We have made fairly brisk progress so far.
Let us see what today holds for us.</div>
<a name="08061968000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we
adjourned the other day, we were in the midst of discussing part 3 and
had completed our debates on clause 45. Part 3 offers a new range of
options to regulators as alternatives to criminal prosecution in order
to ensure compliance. One important option, set out in clause 46, is
the stop notice.</div>
<a name="08061968000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The stop
notice would apply to situations in which there was an ongoing
dangerous activity&#151;for example, the leak of hazardous material
on to land or water or in a factory. In such situations, the regulator
would have to do exactly what it says on the tin and say stop. A stop
notice would prohibit a business from carrying on the activity
specified in the notice, and the notice would remain in place until the
person had taken the steps specified in it.</div>
<a name="08061968000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsections
(4) to (6) give the grounds for issuing a stop notice. They state that
the notice may be issued only if the activity</div>
<a name="08061968000209"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is causing, or
presents a significant risk of causing, serious harm to...human
health...the environment...including the health of
animals&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08061968000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">or
the &#147;financial interests of consumers&#148;. The regulator
must also &#147;reasonably&#148; believe that the activity as
carried on by the business</div>
<a name="08061968000210"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;involves or is
likely to involve the commission of a relevant
offence&#148;.</div><a name="08061968000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions are important because they also allow the regulator to
impose a notice when an offence has already been committed and if an
offence is likely to happen. The Government believe that in certain
circumstances a regulator should be able to issue a stop notice to
prevent an offence from occurring if there is a risk to the public or
the environment. Indeed, it would seem odd to instruct regulators to
sit back and wait if they believed that that could
happen.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div><a name="08061968000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (7)
ensures that the steps specified to be taken in the notice must be
limited to compliance steps. Given the sometimes onerous nature of stop
notices we feel that it would be inappropriate to allow regulators to
include broader steps in the notice.</div>
<a name="08061968000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061968000251"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Prisk</b> (Hertford and Stortford) (Con): I do not
profess to be an expert on non-criminal sanctions, but will
the Minister clarify whether the cases identified in
subsection (4) mirror those of the stop notices currently
available in law? The subsection has three specific provisions, and I
want to be sure that there is no significant variance from established
cases.</div>
<a name="08061968000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000252"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I am happy to confirm that.</div>
<a name="08061968000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
approaching the end of my remarks. I now conclude. Stop notices will be
an important part of the regulator&#146;s toolbox and will provide
important protection for the public. Alongside the fixed and variable
monetary penalties that we have already discussed, they have an
important function.</div>
<a name="08061968000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000253"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I thought when the Minister began his speech that
he was going to say it was a &#147;Prisk&#148; process, but it
seems that we have made brisk progress. After that fourth-form attempt
at humour, I shall move swiftly on.</div>
<a name="08061968000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stop notices
have considerable merit. The Minister rightly spoke of instances when
immediate action is required and urgency is the essence. We have been
assured that the cases are the same as under established stop notices.
In principle, we have no problems with the use of the sanctions in
those circumstances, although we will have questions about procedure
when we discuss clause
47.</div><a name="08061968000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061968000254"></a><b class="B">Lorely
Burt</b> (Solihull) (LD): Welcome back to the Chair,
Mr. Chope, to what may be the last day of our
considerations.</div>
<a name="08061968000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">On behalf of
the National Consumer Council, I want the Minister to explore the
nature of stop notices. The council is concerned that the test that the
regulators must prove before issuing a stop notice is too high and
that</div>
<a name="08061968000211"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a significant
risk of causing...serious
harm&#148;</div><a name="08061968000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
perhaps too high a barrier. I understand the grave importance to any
business of having a stop notice issued against it. However, if an
activity could be described as having a harmful consequence but not
necessarily falling into a serious category, I am worried about how
much leeway an individual inspector might have before issuing the stop
notice.</div><a name="08061968000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000255"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> In some ways, the hon. Lady has answered her own
question. As she rightly pointed out, subsection (4)(b) states that
there is a case
when</div><a name="08061968000212"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
regulator reasonably believes that the activity as carried on by that
person is causing, or presents a significant risk of causing, serious
harm&#148;.</div><a name="08061968000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision is onerous in some ways, but we are talking about serious and
significant harm. The hon. Lady asked for an example. Hazardous
material or toxic substances could be leaking on to land or into the
environment, and of course that is serious. A stop 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div>notice being issued in those circumstances could mean that the business
closes down completely until the problem is sorted out. If someone is
wielding a power that can cause a business to close down, it is right
that the threshold at which that happens should be high. That is why,
in some ways, the threshold is higher for stop notices than for some
other penalties under the
Bill.</div><a name="08061968000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stop
notices will not be an everyday occurrence when a breach might have
happened. I use the word subjectively&#151;the breach could be minor,
or it could be fixed with restorative action by the person or business
concerned. There could be breaches of regulations that are not in
themselves a danger to human health or the environment, so there could
be another sanction in such circumstances. However, given the
seriousness&#151;I intend no pun&#151;of stop notices, the use of
the words &#147;significant&#148; and &#147;serious&#148;
probably set the bar at the right
level.</div><a name="08061968000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000256"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 43, in
clause 47, page 23, line 32, leave
out &#145;14&#146; and insert
&#145;7&#146;.</div><a name="08061968000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000257"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 51, in clause 47, page 23, line 32, leave out
&#145;within&#146; and insert</div>
<a name="08061989000001"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;as quickly as possible and no
later
than&#146;.</div><a name="08061968000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000258"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> The amendment would change the current provision
whereby a completion notice is issued within 14 days to within seven
days of such an application. As we learnt in the debate on clause 46,
stop notices are often used in urgent circumstances. The Minister
referred to a possible chemical leak or something of that nature, and
urgency is clearly at the heart of this form of sanction. Equally, it
is often the case&#151;in fact almost invariably&#151;that
compliance is evident. It is visible to the inspector and is usually
fairly straightforward. In most circumstances, when one asks someone to
stop doing something, it is reasonably straightforward to identify
quickly that that has happened. Given that fact, 14 days seems a long
period in which to issue a completion certificate. As I said, in most
cases, it is fairly evident whether the activity has ceased.</div>
<a name="08061968000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
situation is one of harm&#151;the usual circumstances in which the
stop notice is used&#151;it is in the specific interests of the
regulator to ensure that action is prompt as well. Therefore, there is
a strong case for saying that 14 days is a very long period. That is
why I think that seven days will be sufficient for the regulator to
issue a completion certificate. Most cases involve attending a site,
seeing that the activity or potential harm has been ceased, and thus
being able to identify that
directly.</div><a name="08061968000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
realise that there may be one or two incidents in which the regulator
is not able to manage a particular series of incidents. However, those
would be the exception. It is important that we send out the message
that stop notices are for urgent issues and for ceasing specific
activities. The regulator, therefore, should be able to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>issue the certificates in a similarly prompt manner. I hope the Minister
will respond positively to an amendment that improves this part of the
Bill.</div><a name="08061968000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000259"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> Our amendment No. 51 is very much in the same spirit
as the Conservative amendment No. 43. The difference is that our
amendment acknowledges that there may be occasions when 14 days are
necessary. Any arbitrary line that one draws will always have a problem
one way or another. What is important about our amendment is that it
emphasises the importance and urgency of making the decision as quickly
as possible, and no later than 14 days. It keeps the 14-day deadline,
but&#151;like the Conservative amendment&#151;it seeks to inject a
note of urgency.</div>
<a name="08061968000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Closing a
company for any period of time can be seriously harmful to its future.
We wish to see those few words added to the clause so that no one can
be under any illusion that it is very urgent&#151;just as urgent as
the issuing of the stop notice itself&#151;to issue the other
certificate as quickly as possible once there is
compliance.</div><a name="08061968000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000260"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I have a significant degree of sympathy with the
points that have been made. The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford
said earlier in our proceedings that time is money, and he is right
about that. Time is money for businesses and there should not be undue
delay in responding to a request for a completion certificate to be
issued. We are talking about a situation in which a person on whom a
stop notice has been served may apply for a completion certificate and
the regulator must decide whether to issue one within 14 days. The
clause requires the regulator to issue a completion certificate once
they are satisfied that the business has taken the steps specified in
the stop notice. That allows the business to carry on its activity as
before, with the problem having been rectified. I would expect that to
happen as soon as is practical for the regulator. It is important that
the Committee understands that 14 days is a maximum. The clause says
&#147;within 14 days&#148;, so 14 days will not be the
norm.</div><a name="08061968000227"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="08061968000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
procedure in clause 47(2)(e) allows a business to request a certificate
from a regulator confirming its compliance. It is a safeguard intended
to ensure the ongoing monitoring of the operation of the stop notice.
The amendments suggest either a seven-day limit, or the insertion of
extra words to ensure that 14 days is seen as a maximum. Although I
understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point&#151;he is right to say
that time is money&#151;we believe that on some occasions it could
cause difficulties. A seven-day limit might not always provide the
regulator with sufficient time to assess fully whether a business has
complied with the notice.</div>
<a name="08061968000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
continue with the example that I used in relation to clause 46. A
business might, for one reason or another, have been releasing some
kind of toxic substance into the land. It could then have had a stop
notice imposed on it for the leaking pipe that was emitting the waste,
and the regulator might need to test whether the toxins had returned to
an acceptable level, below which there was no danger to public health.
In such a case, the regulator might have to wait for test results to be
returned from a lab before it could confidently say that the business
was complying. It might also have to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 85</div>contact a third party that might be involved, and ensure that that third
party did not continue to suffer the harm that the original instance
had caused to it.</div>
<a name="08061968000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
believe that such situations should be allowed to carry on for ever.
There has to be a limit, which is why there is a limit in the Bill. A
maximum limit of 14 days strikes the right balance between
providing a safeguard for business, where time is money, and allowing
regulators sufficient time to assess whether the business has
complied.</div>
<a name="08061968000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
51 accepts the 14-day limit but seeks to add extra words. I have
sympathy with that, but I do not feel that those extra words are needed
to stress that 14 days is a maximum. The clause says &#147;within
14 days&#148;. Perhaps I can offer additional comfort to
the hon. Member for Solihull, as I am happy to confirm that we will
amend the guide to the Bill so that it states explicitly that 14 days
is a maximum period, and that in practice we expect certificates to be
issued as soon as possible within that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000261"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I understand the toxicology issues, and the
Minister has made important statements today that have not been made
before. Clearly, there will be certain circumstances in which those
toxicology studies will not be available for some time beyond 14 days.
Can the Minister tell us, and those who might be affected by the
legislation, what will happen in those
circumstances?</div>
<a name="08061968000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000262"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> As I said, the process cannot be limitless as
that would place the business in an unfair situation. A judgment must
be made and we feel that 14 days strikes the right balance
between allowing the regulator to do whatever tests are necessary, and
not putting the business under a cloud of uncertainty or even a
continuing state of closure. This is a judgment about how one strikes
that balance. The hon. Gentleman feels that seven days is right, but we
feel that 14 would cover more situations and that is our
judgment.</div><a name="08061968000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000263"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> This is a helpful debate. Presumably&#151;to
continue with the example we have been using&#151;there would be no
prohibition on the subsequent issuing by the regulatory authority in
question of a stop notice, in the event of a subsequent leakage. Would
there be an opportunity, therefore, if for example a delayed toxicology
study were to be presented at 21 days, for the authority to issue a
stop notice at that
point?</div><a name="08061968000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000264"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> A stop notice could be issued twice, but as I
have said it is an onerous sanction and not something that either the
regulator or the business would want to go through repeatedly. The
purpose of including an onerous option of that kind in the
regulator&#146;s toolkit is precisely to deal with those urgent and
serious situations that we have discussed under clause 46, so the hon.
Gentleman makes a fair point in saying that the process could be
repeated, but we are trying to frame the stop notice procedure in such
a way that problems will be dealt with by issuing one notice, dealing
with the problem and moving on. That is the right way to tackle such a
problem.</div><a name="08061968000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000265"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> It is an extremely helpful debate. I am not quite
sure why, but when the issue came up in the other place Ministers
seemed either unable or unwilling to utter the words that the Minister
has just said: that he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>sees the period as a maximum and that there is an expectation that the
completion certificate will be issued well within that period. There is
a dilemma, in the sense that I suspect that, if a need was seen for a
late toxicology study to force a second stop notice, most businesses
affected would regard it as much more onerous, because of the need to
stop and restart a process that had been begun. I think therefore that
there is a problem with
that.</div><a name="08061968000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am partly comforted by the Minister&#146;s assurance&#151;which I
know will partly be coloured by later guidance to be issued by
Ministers. We have clarified something that was not clear from the
deliberations in the other place and made some welcome progress for
businesses that have been concerned about the provision, several of
which have contacted me directly. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08061968000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000270"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 56, in
clause 48, page 24, line 15, at

appeal.&#146;.</div><a name="08061968000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would improve the current wording of subsection (1) of the
clause, which is about compensation in relation to stop notices.
Subsection (1)
states:</div><a name="08061968000213"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Provision
under section 46 conferring power on a regulator to serve a stop notice
on a person must include provision for the regulator to compensate the

notice.&#148;</div><a name="08061968000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to insert at the end of that subsection the phrase, &#147;and
any subsequent
appeal&#148;.</div><a name="08061968000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision is designed principally to enable small businesses in
particular to appeal without fear that they will not be able to recover
costs simply because they wanted to challenge the notice in the first
place. The Minister agreed in previous debates that no one in the
relevant circumstances should be deterred from making representations
or appealing&#151;knowing that they would then be out of pocket. It
is an important principle, and the Minister agreed to it in a previous
debate. I do not want to make this a long debate, so I simply ask the
Minister whether he now accepts that principle, and if so, whether he
will accept the amendment. It is fair that there should be no
circumstances in which someone who wishes to make an appeal is deterred
by the fact that they will be out of pocket as a
result.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000271"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I am happy to confirm our earlier exchange about
accepting the principle that the hon. Gentleman outlined. I can also
give him the good news that the amendment is unnecessary because the
situation that he is talking about is covered. As he rightly said, the
clause includes provision for the regulator to compensate a person for
losses suffered as a result of the service of the notice. That would
include any period during an appeal when the notice was still in force.
I understand the sentiments behind what the hon. Gentleman is trying to
do in the amendment, but the clause requires the regulator to put in
place a scheme to compensate a person for a loss suffered as a result
of the service of the notice. I am happy to confirm that that would
include ongoing losses suffered during an appeal when the notice was
still in force. The amendment would therefore add nothing to the
arrangements covered in the
Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000272"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I am fascinated. At least two lawyers from
different organisations told me that there was a significant omission
in the Bill and that it was important to have a provision to deal with
that. In response to their comments, I felt that it was important to
table the amendment. However, if the Minister is happy to confirm
firmly on the record that there is a provision in the law, we have
scored a goal without even starting the game. I am very happy if that
is the case, not least because the Minister&#146;s words are now
firmly on the record. Although I suspect that we would all like the
opportunity to divide the Committee to ensure that the issue is dealt
with, there is no need. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<a name="08061968000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000273"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Clause 50 takes us on to a slightly different
issue from that of stop notices, which we have been discussing so far
this morning. It comes at the issue of regulatory compliance from a
slightly different angle. The clauses and amendments that we have
discussed so far have dealt with the options available to a regulator
to ensure compliance, and stop notices are part of that. Clause 50,
however, offers an option to the regulated, rather than just the
regulator.</div>
<a name="08061968000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
enables a Minister to make an order allowing a regulator to accept
enforcement undertakings offered by a person or business subject to
regulation. An enforcement undertaking is an undertaking or promise by
a person or business to take certain actions. It is not something that
can be imposed by the regulator, but an option that is available to a
business that is found to be in contravention of the regulations. The
clause takes forward a key recommendation of the review by Professor
Richard Macrory and allows businesses to volunteer action to put right
any harm that has been done.</div>
<a name="08061968000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
subsection (1), the regulator may accept enforcement undertakings only
when it has reasonable grounds for suspecting that an act or omission
by a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div>person constitutes a relevant offence. In practice, that is likely to
mean that the business is offering undertakings during an investigation
for an offence. Subsection (3) outlines the type of action that an
undertaking must cover,
which</div><a name="08061968000214"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must
be...action to secure that the offence does not continue or
recur...action to secure that the position is, so far as possible,
restored to what it would have been if the offence had not been
committed...action (including the payment of a sum of money) to
benefit any person affected by the offence, or...action of a
prescribed
description.&#148;</div><a name="08061968000228"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="08061968000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000274"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> Can the Minister confirm that, while the test of
reasonableness is clearly set out in subsection (1), the principle of
reasonableness would also be incorporated in the case of an action of
securing a position that is to restore what would have been, had the
offence not been
committed?</div><a name="08061968000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000275"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The regulator will have to judge, after an
enforcement undertaking has been offered and if it has been accepted,
that it has been complied with. The regulator must make a judgment. As
I said, subsection (3) sets out the types of things that we are talking
about. Subsection (4) provides that if an enforcement undertaking is
accepted, the person may not be prosecuted for the offence, or have a
fixed monetary penalty or discretionary requirement imposed on them,
unless they fail or are deemed to have failed to comply with the
undertakings.</div><a name="08061968000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are saying that if a business, in the course of such an investigation,
says, &#147;These are the actions that we wish to take in order to
put this matter right&#148;, and it has come forward in such a way,
it should benefit from doing so. There should be an incentive to do so,
rather than its being placed in a situation where the option is
available but if the business exercises it, it gets no benefit, because
it is equally liable to all the other penalties that we have been
talking
about.</div><a name="08061968000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is in a situation where there is compliance, but&#151;a significant
but&#151;where a person fails to comply with their undertaking, the
regulator will be able to prosecute the person for the original offence
or impose a fixed monetary penalty or discretionary requirement.
Subsection (5) enables the Minister to include further provision in the
order, such as the procedure for entering into the enforcement
undertaking, publication of the details, certification by the regulator
that that has been complied with, and so
on.</div><a name="08061968000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is not a right of appeal against the enforcement undertaking itself,
given that that is something volunteered by the person and not imposed
on them by the regulator. We believe in allowing enforcement
undertakings. We can envisage a reputable, well-intentioned business
coming forward to exercise that option. The lack of compliance may be
completely inadvertent. It may be that it did not know that it was not
compliant, but it is something that it is more than happy to put right.
That could be an important option available. It is something that was
encouraged by Professor Macrory and is another important addition to
the
Bill.</div><a name="08061968000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
52</h4><a name="08061968000010"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Monetary
penalties</div><a name="08061968000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="08061968000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000276"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I rise because clause 52 relates to a debate
that we had earlier. The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford asked
about discounts, to which the clause relates. It might be helpful to
the Committee if I outline what is covered
here.</div><a name="08061968000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
52 deals with the enforcement of monetary penalties. The clause allows
the order made by the Minister under this part of the Bill to make
provision for discounts for early payment of a monetary penalty and for
the payment of interest as a financial penalty for late payment of the
original penalty. However, the total amount of any late payment must
not exceed the total amount of the penalty imposed&#151;there is a
limit on that.</div>
<a name="08061968000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hesitate to
use the parking fine analogy because the situations that these clauses
deal with are significantly more important and on a greater scale, but
the principle of early payment in such situations is one that we are
all familiar with from that context. The Government believe that early
payment discounts can be a helpful incentive to encourage businesses to
comply promptly with fixed monetary penalties. Late payment penalties
could provide a useful enforcement tool for regulators. We had a
discussion the other day about the Companies House precedent and the
potential for penalties for late filing. The Government also believe
that if financial penalties are to be effective, there needs to be an
enforcement process. Subsection (2) provides for the enforcement of
unpaid penalties and any interest or late payment charges through the
civil courts. It allows the order to create a more streamlined process
accompanied by treating the penalty as if it were payable under a court
order. In practice, that would mean that the regulator could skip the
initial stages of registering a claim for the unpaid sum in the courts
and then proceed more swiftly to enforcement action. The principle is
one that we are familiar with: incentives to pay early and penalties
for paying late.</div>
<a name="08061968000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000277"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I do not have a huge objection to the idea of early
payment discounts, but the discount should not be so deep that it skews
the system, such that many small businesses feel they should just pay
up and move on. The danger is that the system would start to become
imbalanced. The Minister has indicated previously, however, that
businesses would not be at any disadvantage financially should they
seek to challenge or make objections. My principal concern is to ensure
that if someone wishes to challenge and question what has happened,
they are able to do so and are not at any financial
disadvantage.</div>
<a name="08061968000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000278"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I absolutely understand the point that the hon.
Gentleman is making and I agree with him about not being at a
disadvantage if one pursues the processes that are outlined in the
Bill. We had an exchange on this subject a few moments ago. He was keen
to say to me that I had clarified what had not been clear in the Lords.
I should make it clear that this is not a new change in the Bill; it is
how the tribunal system 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div>will work under section 29 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act
2007, which created first-tier tribunals. The tribunal has the power to

costs of and incidental
to&#148;</div><a name="08061968000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">any
proceedings before it. That covers the point that the hon. Gentleman is
making but it is not an addition to the Bill; it is actually already in
place in that Act, which created the tribunals to which the appeals
will be made.</div>

<a name="08061968000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000280"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> It is important to pause on clause 54 because
much reference was made during our debates here, but also in the other
place, to the judicial protections for people who are subject to the
regulations. Clause 54 requires that appeals under part 3 of the Bill
must be heard by either the first-tier tribunal or another statutory
tribunal specified by the Minister in the order made under that part.
An appeal to such tribunals provides an important safeguard for
businesses against the misuse of the civil sanctions. These tribunals
are independent, impartial and highly qualified to review a
regulator&#146;s sanctioning decision.</div>
<a name="08061968000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Professor
Macrory, to whom I have referred a lot, found in his report a number of
advantages in routing appeals against the new sanctions to a
specialist, expert tribunal, rather than to the courts. First, that
will allow the criminal courts to concentrate on those issues that
warrant prosecution rather than adjudicating on civil appeals.
Secondly, tribunals can comprise members with legal and specialist
expertise in the subject matter before the tribunal, thereby providing
the tribunal on some occasions with a fuller understanding of the
regulatory issues. In another part of my work, I am the Minister for
employment relations, and have contact with the employment tribunals,
where the role of these wing members, as they are sometimes referred
to, or expert members, is often highly valuable. Regulatory cases could
be concentrated through one tribunal under the first-tier tribunals
heading as well, enabling expertise to be built up over time. For
example, in the cases of regulatory non-compliance in magistrates
courts, they make up less than 1 per cent. of all the cases, so it is
difficult to provide specific training to magistrates and legal
advisers for a field of law that, in percentage terms, is a small part
of their work. This gives us the capacity to build up over time
significant concentrated
expertise.</div><a name="08061968000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have talked about small businesses, and it is also the case that
tribunals rather than courts may often encourage small businesses to
exercise their rights of appeal without the need for expensive legal
representation. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div>As I said, our preferred venue for such appeals is the first tier of a
tribunal, which is created by the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act
2007. The first-tier tribunal will be launched later this year, and
most existing tribunal jurisdictions, such as the transport tribunal,
the information tribunal and the gambling appeals tribunal, will
eventually transfer across to become part of this. These jurisdictions
will be grouped together to form different chambers, and it is expected
that a regulatory chamber will hear appeals against sanctions for
regulatory non-compliance.</div>
<a name="08061968000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most of the
detail concerning composition, functions, procedures and powers and so
on is contained in the 2007 Act rather than in this Bill, but I want to
make it clear to the Committee that this is the vehicle that we see as
dealing with appeals. The tribunal will have legal members who are
professionally qualified in appropriate fields, and other experts. The
composition of a tribunal for a particular field will be determined
partly by statutory orders to be made by the Lord Chancellor,
specifying qualifications and numbers, and partly by the senior
president of tribunals and other judicial leaders. I should stress that
regulators and their sponsoring Departments will not have any influence
in such matters: the independence of the tribunal panel is further
guaranteed by section (1) of the 2007 Act, which extends the
courts&#146; statutory guarantee of independence under the
Constitutional Reform Act 2005 to the
tribunals.</div><a name="08061968000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an exception to all this in clause 54 (1)(b), which says that the
appeal could be held
by</div><a name="08061968000216"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;another
tribunal created under an
enactment.&#148;</div><a name="08061968000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is to take account of the fact that a number of statutory tribunals
will not be transferring. The employment tribunals are a good example
of that. They currently hear, for example, some health and safety
appeals, so that is covered by subsection (1)(b). However, they have
similar characteristics and safeguards to the first-tier
tribunal.</div><a name="08061968000229"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="08061968000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2) makes it clear that statutory tribunals only, not ordinary courts
of law, can be specified. However, they have similar characteristics
and safeguards to a first-tier tribunal. Subsection (3)(a) allows the
Minister, when setting out the power, to make provision for the
suspension of the effect of a fixed penalty or other requirement during
an appeal. A person could apply for a stop notice to be suspended
pending the result of an appeal. If that application is unsuccessful,
the notice will remain in force during the appeal. However, should the
person appeal, the effect of the stop notice can be automatically
suspended until the result is known.</div>
<a name="08061968000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(3)(b) enables the Minister to make provision about the powers of the
tribunal. Examples of those powers are set out in subsection (4), which
details that the tribunal may</div>
<a name="08061968000217"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;withdraw the
requirement or notice...confirm the requirement or
notice...take such steps as the regulator could take in relation
to the
act&#148;</div><a name="08061968000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">or</div>
<a name="08061968000218"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;remit the
decision...to the
regulator&#148;.</div><a name="08061968000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill is not prescriptive about the powers of the tribunal, because a
tribunal may have existing powers. Detailed rules governing the
exercise of the powers will be provided in the tribunal procedural
rules that will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div>made under existing provisions of other Acts&#151;I have mentioned the
Act that establishes such
things.</div><a name="08061968000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is an important part of the machinery. We have talked a lot in
our debates on this part of the Bill about the different enforcement
options available to regulators, such as fixed monetary penalties,
variable monetary penalties, stop notices, restoration acts,
restoration notices and so on. The rights of appeal that we are talking
about to deal with the problem of judge and jury being one are set out
in the clause.</div>
<a name="08061968000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
is helpful in assuring members of the Committee that the measure is a
robust and important part of the enforcement
mechanism.</div>
<a name="08061968000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000281"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for those remarks. As
he said, we have rehearsed the arguments as to whether the measure
provides a sufficient protection as an appeal process in the absence of
the ability of someone whom we might call the accused to refer their
concerns to an ordinary court of law, so I do not propose to go over
them
again.</div><a name="08061968000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause permits appeals to be heard either by the first-tier tribunals,
which the Minister explained at some length, although I still have a
question. Subsection (1)(b also permits another statutory tribunal that
Ministers can specify. The Minister alluded to the fact that there is
some expectation that employment tribunals may participate, not least
because they handle health and safety at work cases.</div>
<a name="08061968000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two
separate but important questions. How significant a role does the
Minister envisage for non-first-tier tribunals, which are alluded to in
subsection (1)(b)? What estimate has his Department made of the costs
of the appeals process and what budget has been put to one side for the
first year, say, after the measure is
launched?</div><a name="08061968000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000282"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s first question
relates to the proportion of cases dealt with by first-tier or other
tribunals. The answer is that it depends on the jurisdiction. As I
said, one of the advantages to business, regulators and everyone
concerned is that hearing appeals through a tribunal can concentrate
experience and work of that nature over time and build up expertise.
However, when the jurisdiction is not dealt with by the first-tier
tribunal but by an employment tribunal, the latter would deal with the
process. Given that this is enabling legislation covering a significant
degree of enactments, it is difficult for me to give the hon. Gentleman
the percentages of first-tier and other tribunals. The answer to the
question is that it will depend on the jurisdiction and the issue at
heart; health and safety, for example, might be dealt with by other
tribunals, other issues that we have talked about might not.</div>
<a name="08061968000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I may have to
return to the hon. Gentleman with the answer to his question about the
budgets that have been set aside. On costs, this is one of the parts of
the Bill that I was referring to when I mentioned the impact assessment
the other day. This part of the Bill is expected to give rise to the
most significant savings to business. If memory serves me right, the
savings on costs to business will be up to &#163;80 million. In terms
of the budget set aside to do the work, the answer may be shared
between my Department and the Ministry of Justice, which is the lead
Department for tribunals. I will come back to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div>the hon. Gentleman on that, or write to him. I would prefer to do that
rather than to give him a figure for the budget right now.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000283"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The clause touches on an issue alluded to by my
hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North the other day, so I thought
that it might be worth setting out what we hope to achieve in the
provision. My hon. Friend pointed out that the Procurator Fiscal
Service and the Lord Advocate decide on prosecution matters in
Scotland. The clause recognises that. It
states:</div><a name="08061968000219"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
Minister of the Crown must obtain the consent of the Lord Advocate
before making an order under this Part in relation to an offence in
Scotland.&#148;</div><a name="08061968000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two issues involved: the legal issue and the devolution issue. I
will deal with devolution first. Clause 56 is
clear:</div><a name="08061968000220"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
order under this Part may not, except for consequential purposes, make
any provision which would be within the legislative competence of the
Scottish Parliament if it were contained in an Act of that
Parliament.&#148;</div><a name="08061968000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are familiar with the concepts of devolved and reserved
matters.</div>
<a name="08061968000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 58
requires that a Minister proposing to make an order affecting the
prosecution of any offence in Scotland must obtain the agreement of the
Lord Advocate. The Lord Advocate is responsible for prosecution in
Scotland and should therefore consent to the proposed changes. Giving
regulators civil sanction powers would remove that decision from the
Lord Advocate, so we thought that it was absolutely right to put the
provision into the
Bill.</div><a name="08061968000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2) requires a Minister proposing to make an order affecting the powers
of a regulator that is a local authority in Scotland to consult
Scottish
Ministers.</div><a name="08061968000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061968000284"></a><b class="B">Ann
McKechin</b> (Glasgow, North) (Lab): Where a local authority
in Scotland becomes the primary authority for a company that operates
in other parts of the United Kingdom, what would be the procedure if
the primary authority wanted to enforce action in some other part of
the United Kingdom? Would the relevant Minister still be required to
take the authority of the Lord Advocate or a Minister of the Scottish
Executive, who have no function outwith Scotland? Will my hon. Friend
clarify the
position?</div><a name="08061968000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000285"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> It is important to note the difference between
subsections (1) and (2). Subsection (1) concerns the Lord Advocate and
action in Scotland; subsection (2) concerns the powers of local
authorities as regulators. The situation to which my hon. Friend refers
already exists in some cases under the home authority principle. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div>My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West is not with us this morning,
but my understanding is that Dundee city council is a home authority
that has four operations that operate throughout the UK. That situation
is already provided for.</div>
<a name="08061968000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
subsection (2), if a Minister proposes to make an order that affects
the power of a regulator that is a local authority in Scotland, he
would be required to consult Scottish Ministers, because they obviously
have an interest in the function of local authorities in Scotland. For
the avoidance of doubt, subsection (3) defines the term &#147;local
authority in Scotland&#148;. We have set out the application of the
Bill in terms of both reserved and devolved functions, but in this
clause we also set out important procedural matters that respect the
position of the Lord Advocate in
Scotland.</div><a name="08061968000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000286"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> We have heard a significant amount about
consultation in the debate, and it is an important part of the
requirements of the Bill. The clause relates to other clauses that we
have discussed or will come on to. Subsection (1)
states:</div><a name="08061968000221"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Before
making an order under this Part the relevant authority must consult the
following...the regulator to which the order relates...such
organisations as appear to the relevant authority to be representative
of persons substantially affected by the
proposals&#148;.</div><a name="08061968000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
could be a business group, which may represent a number of small
businesses or other such persons. It is important that consultation is
part of the machinery for which we are legislating, and there is a
broad definition under subsections (1)(a) to (c) of who should be
consulted. That will rightly ensure a high level of public scrutiny of
the decision to award a regulator new sanctioning powers.</div>
<a name="08061968000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there are
substantial changes to any part of the proposals as a result of the
consultation exercise, subsection (2) requires the Minister
to undertake further consultation on the revised proposals, as he
considers
appropriate.</div><a name="08061968000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000287"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> Clause 60 is important and the process of
consultation is essential if sanctions are to work as part of the Bill.
Subsections (1)(c) and (2) are particularly important in the context of
consumers. Quite understandably, we have discussed the principal
relationships between regulator and regulatee, but it is important to
recognise a third significant group&#151;consumers. The Minister is
nodding.</div>
<a name="08061968000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
extremely important to ensure that the interests of consumer
organisations, such as the National Consumer Council or the Consumers
Association&#151;better known as Which?&#151;are included in the
process as those organisations do an excellent job of representing
consumers&#146; interests. They represent the interests of many of
our constituents, so it is extremely important that the measure is not
simply confined to a narrow relationship between 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 95</div>the regulator and regulated&#151;I think that is probably better
English than regulatee; it is important that the provision goes further
than that. We welcome that addition to the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000288"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The clause extends the existing powers of the
Minister to create criminal offences in secondary legislation under the
powers to create alternative civil sanctions in this part of the Bill.
It is important that clause 62 is read alongside the list of enactments
in schedule 7. Subsection (4) limits the scope of the clause to the
secondary legislation that can be made under the list of enactments in
schedule 7. That means, for example, that a Minister creating, amending
or consolidating criminal offences in secondary legislation made under
one of those listed enactments may also provide for the offence to be
sanctioned using the fixed monetary
penalty.</div><a name="08061968000230"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="08061968000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Taken
with clauses 36 to 38, and schedules 5 and 6, the clause will ensure
that all relevant offences, whether created in primary or secondary
legislation, can be dealt with through a civil sanction. That is
important because it helps to ensure consistency across a particular
regulatory regime.</div>
<a name="08061968000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
allows Ministers to confer only those powers in part 3. All the
substantive restrictions will apply when the extended powers are
used&#151;for example, in relation to devolution.</div>
<a name="08061968000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before making
an order, the Minister must be satisfied that a regulator will exercise
the powers in a manner that is in line with the principles of good
regulation&#151;the Committee will probably not want me to list them
again. That is provided for in clause 66, to which we will come
shortly.</div>
<a name="08061968000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 62(3)
provides that any order made under an enactment in schedule 7 giving
the regulator access to the new civil sanctions will be subject to the
affirmative procedure. That matches the parliamentary procedure for
orders made under clause 36.</div>
<a name="08061968000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
intended to ensure that the option that we are creating to use civil

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000289"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The clause is about guidance, and again the
provisions are important. We are significantly changing the range of
options available to regulators and the use of civil sanctions, and it
is important that there is proper guidance on that.</div>
<a name="08061968000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
says that where the power to impose a civil sanction is conferred on a
regulator</div>
<a name="08061968000222"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the provision
conferring the power must secure the results in subsection
(2).&#148;</div><a name="08061968000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
means that the regulator must publish guidance about its use of the
sanction, that the guidance must contain the relevant information and
that the regulator must revise it where appropriate, consult such
persons as the provision may specify and have regard to the guidance or
revised guidance in exercising its function.</div>
<a name="08061968000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">On what we
might call the penalty guidance, subsections (3) to (5) set out the
specific requirements that the guidance must meet in relation to fixed
penalties, discretionary requirements and stop notices. For example,
regulators will be required to include details of how the penalties
will be imposed and of those matters likely to be taken into
consideration in determining the level of a variable monetary
penalty.</div>
<a name="08061968000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
talked about the powers and the need for consultation in putting
together an order to confer them, but guidance on how those powers are
to operate in practice is an equally important part of the regime, and
that is covered in clause 63.</div>
<a name="08061968000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000290"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> As the Minister said, clauses 63 and 64&#151;I am
looking principally at clause 63&#151;refer to what should be in the
guidance. I have two brief questions for the Minister. First, when
would the guidance be published? It is always important for businesses
to understand that. Secondly, how is it to be made accessible to
affected persons? The provisions will affect a wide section of the
business community, so it is important to understand how the Government
intend to ensure that business is properly informed in a timely
way.</div>
<a name="08061968000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000291"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question about when the guidance will be published is that we have
codes on such things. Our intention would be to publish guidance 12
weeks before the proposals came into effect. That should give people
adequate warning of what is
involved.</div><a name="08061968000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
generally, the hon. Gentleman is right to say that guidance is
important. Sometimes businesses pay outside consultants to help them to
comply with regulation or a change introduced by the Government.
Obviously, we recognise that that happens, but we do not want
businesses to do it unless they have to, so we put significant effort
into improving
guidance.</div><a name="08061968000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me give an example. The Government have put significant effort into
improving the &#147;Employing people&#148; pages of the Business
Link website. They are a very good guide for businesses so that they do
not have to spend what are sometimes significant sums asking people how
they should comply with the law when that information could be made
available for free and, we hope, in an accessible and user-friendly way
by the Government. The hon. Gentleman is therefore right to stress the
importance of guidance, and we do put effort into improving it. We
envisage such guidance being available on a regulator&#146;s website,
so that a business in that field 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div>could check what was expected of it. That is right and fair, and that is
what we hope that regulators would do under this
provision.</div><a name="08061968000172"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

65</h4><a name="08061968000016"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Publication
of enforcement
action</div><a name="08061968000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Bill.</div><a name="08061968000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061968000292"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): It is a pleasure to serve
under your firm but fair direction of our proceedings, Mr.
Chope. I have some questions for my hon. Friend the Minister. The
clause relates to the publication of information on enforcement action
in respect of the new civil sanctions. What is the purpose behind the
clause? It strikes me that it is one of two things. One possible
explanation is that it constitutes a name-and-shame policy for people
on whom civil sanctions are imposed. The second explanation is that it
is about accountability: people who impose the new civil sanctions have
to account for how many they have imposed and whether they are
collecting moneys efficiently, so that there is information on which
the public can judge them. To me, the second explanation is far more
satisfactory.</div><a name="08061968000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason why I thought that the first explanation might apply is that
this morning I woke up to the news that from today the Border and
Immigration Agency will, under a naming-and-shaming policy, publish the
names of employers who employ illegal immigrants. It therefore occurred
to me that the Minister might say that that is his purpose in this
case.</div><a name="08061968000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
important point about the second purpose&#151;collecting the
information and knowing whether the system is effective&#151;is that
under subsection (2) some information has to be published, but it is
partial. The information that a civil sanction has been imposed should
be collected, but not necessarily the information that the matter has
come to a successful conclusion. Under subsection (2)(b), for some of
the fixed monetary penalty cases, it will be reported that the
penalties have been paid, but that will not necessarily happen for all
of them. That is my reading of the provision. It is therefore possible
that we would never know the true extent of the power and whether it
was successful. I conclude that we might never know its effectiveness
if we were thinking back to the time when magistrates courts were
imposing many fines but apparently not collecting them successfully.
The collection rate was appalling. That fact would be very important
for public interest in whether the sanctions were any use. However,
because of the way in which the clause is drawn, I do not think that we
would have that
information.</div><a name="08061968000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision also seems incomplete because of subsection (3), which states
that if there is a successful appeal against a civil sanction, that
information does not have to be collected and reported. If one is
asking about the effectiveness of the overall system, one has to ask
why that is, because it is a relevant fact that in many 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div>cases there would be a successful appeal against the civil sanction. We
would want to know that fact, and it should be published, because it
would lead to questions being asked about the alacrity with which civil
sanctions were being imposed but overturned on appeal. It would be
important to have that information; it should not be
excluded.</div><a name="08061968000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(4) is the most worrying of all. It says that the information need not
be collected and
published</div><a name="08061968000223"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where
the relevant authority considers that it would be inappropriate to do
so.&#148;</div>
<a name="08061968000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">That sounds as though a
local authority, as a regulator, could decide not to collect
information because it was inappropriate to do so or to collect some
information about some cases but not others, which would lead to an
undermining of the use of the statistical evidence. That seems to hole
the entire clause below the waterline. I looked at the explanatory
notes for guidance, but found that they muddied the waters even further
instead of solving the problem.</div>
<a name="08061968000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 170
reminds us that the reports may not need to list certain cases.
&#147;Certain cases&#148; suggest that it is one or two and not the
whole lot, but the clause is so broadly drawn that the regulator could
decide that all the cases were inappropriate to be publicised. The
clause says that cases need not be
listed</div><a name="08061968000224"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where
the Minister thinks it inappropriate for such cases to be publicised,
for example, for data protection
reasons.&#148;</div><a name="08061968000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I am right and the purpose is to compile statistical information, data
protection would not apply because we would not be disclosing
information about individual cases.</div>
<a name="08061968000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why do the
explanatory notes mention the Minister? The Bill says that the
&#147;relevant authority&#148; makes the decision. Either the Bill
or the explanatory notes is wrong. The Minister needs to tell us the
purpose of the clause&#151;he was about to rise to do so before I
interrupted him, so I apologise for that&#151;and whether he is
satisfied that the Bill has been drawn sufficiently carefully on this
occasion.</div>
<a name="08061968000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000293"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for
asking me that series of questions, which will allow me to elucidate on
the rationale behind the clause. Hopefully, I can give him some
answers. He asked several questions, including whether the purpose of
the clause was accountability or letting the public know who had
contravened. It is a bit of both. It is right that regulators, who are
being given a significant new sweep of powers under this part of the
Bill, publish information about how they are exercising those powers.
That is a good in itself. As to naming and shaming, there can also be a
public interest in knowing whether an organisation has contravened and
has reached the end of the process. We can go back to the example of a
business releasing toxic waste into the environment. I do not know why
the public should not know about a business that has been found guilty
of such an offence, has received a civil sanction&#151;it may have
appealed but has not been successful&#151;and has reached the end of
the process.</div>
<a name="08061968000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend then asked, why exempt those on appeal? That issue has arisen in
other Bills as well. Is it in the public interest to know when charges
have been levied but the person has not been found guilty in the end?
There is a reputational issue at stake for business. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div>We have talked about appeal processes in the context of the Bill. The
regulator may impose a civil penalty, but the penalty gets overturned
on appeal because the regulator was wrong. In those circumstances, is
it fair for the business to be named in the report? In the end, when
the process has been completed, the business has not been found guilty
of anything. Therefore, subsection (3) is
fair.</div><a name="08061968000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000294"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I guessed that my hon. Friend might say that it
was a bit of both, but does he not think that that is confusing? If
there were lots of civil sanctions being imposed and they were all
being overturned on appeal, there would be a cause for public concern.
If the Bill exempts publication of information about cases because they
were successfully appealed, we would not know about that
concern.</div><a name="08061968000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000295"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> My concern is with reputational fairness for the
business. I do not think that saying that it is a bit of both is a bad
thing. There is a perfectly fair dual purpose to publishing
information. It will show those looking at the regulator how the
regulator is using the new suite of powers, and it will serve the
public interest to know about those who have contravened the
regulations. That can be fair, provided it has reached the end of the
process.</div><a name="08061968000231"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="08061968000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point that my hon. Friend is making is, in a sense, a generic one. It
has been raised in other situations. My Department has sometimes been
asked, &#147;Shouldn&#146;t those accused of something be named on
some list, even if it isn&#146;t proven?&#148; I am not sure that
that is fair. Subsection (3) is intended to deal with that
situation.</div>
<a name="08061968000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend&#146;s final question concerns subsection (4) and
the
phrase,</div><a name="08061968000225"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where
the relevant authority considers that it would be inappropriate to do
so&#148;.</div><a name="08061968000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should make it clear that the relevant authority and the Minister are
the same thing under that provision. The relevant authority will not be
the regulator. Subsection (4) will allow the Minister to exempt certain
cases from the publicity requirement, and is intended to capture cases
that may have data protection implications or other grounds for
exemption.</div>
<a name="08061968000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must be
careful how I put that. What other grounds might there be for exemption
from the requirement to publish information about enforcement action?
The regulated person or business may be in a particularly sensitive
area. It may be that if information about the address of the premises
came into the public domain, it could be a danger to those working
there. I know that we can think of examples where that might be the
case. There are some among the population who object fiercely to some
business activities, research activities and so on, so it is prudent to
give the Minister the power to say in those circumstances, &#147;We
don&#146;t want that information released, because we could be
putting someone at risk by publishing
it.&#148;</div><a name="08061968000193"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000296"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I apologise for missing the fact that the relevant
authority is the Minister; my hon. Friend is quite right. In the kind
of case that he described, it is perfectly understandable that a
Minister might want to direct that such information should not be
published&#151;certainly information such as people&#146;s names,
addresses 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div>and so on. Does my hon. Friend agree that that would happen in
exceptional situations rather than simply inappropriate ones? Will he
reflect that &#147;inappropriate&#148; is quite a wide test for the
power, and that something such as &#147;exceptional
circumstances&#148; would be more narrowly
focused?</div><a name="08061968000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000297"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> We could have a discussion about
&#147;exceptional&#148; and &#147;inappropriate&#148;. We agree
that regulators should not be exempted from the duty for frivolous
reasons. &#147;Exceptional circumstances&#148; might take it too
far. It could cause a regulator difficulties in cases where strong data
protection reasons exist for not disclosing enforcement action but the
case is not seen as exceptional. We could argue about the specific
term, but on data protection grounds and grounds of safety for those
involved in the enterprise, we think that the provision in subsection
(4) is a prudent part of the Bill&#146;s information release
function.</div><a name="08061968000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000298"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> This has been a useful debate. The hon. Member for
Stafford rightly raised questions, which the Minister has delicately
answered, about inappropriateness. I do not wish to stretch it too far,
but does the Minister agree that although it might be helpful if the
word &#147;inappropriate&#148; remained in the Bill, it would also
be helpful if it were understood that it is the Government&#146;s
expectation that the matter would not be regarded as
routine?</div><a name="08061968000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000299"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000300"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 45, in
clause 66, page 32, line 6, at
end add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2) Where the
regulator is a local authority or authorities, prior to the provision
being made the relevant authority shall consult the LBRO as to whether
the authority or authorities are fully compliant with the said
principles and will continue to act in accordance with those
principles.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(3) Notwithstanding
subsection (2), the relevant authority may proceed to make the
provision in subsection (1) with the condition that the LBRO is
satisfied that any authority that is not fully compliant will become
fully compliant within one year of the provision being
made.&#146;.</div><a name="08061968000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000301"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss new
clause 3&#151;<i class="I">Duty to secure observance of Code of
Practice&#151;</i></div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;Where any
local authority has been granted powers under Part 3 of this Act, the
LBRO shall have the duty or reviewing and, if appropriate, certifying
every three years whether local authorities are compliant with the
provisions of any Code issued under Section 22 of the Legislative and
Regulatory Reform Act
2006.&#146;.</div><a name="08061968000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000302"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I want the new clause to be regarded as a distinct
element. If the Minister embraces both proposals warmly, the matter
will be resolved, but if not, we may 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div>wish to press them to a Division. It would be appropriate to hear his
response, but we might wish to deal with new clause 3
separately.</div><a name="08061968000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 45 would insert two subsections into the clause. It relates to
local authorities, and it would reinforce the need for all regulators
to be fully compliant with the Hampton principles. We have debated
them, so I shall not rehearse them now. The amendment stems, as does
new clause 3, from worries that have been expressed by business. I am
particularly grateful to the British Retail Consortium for bringing the
issue to my attention. It is worried that this part of the Bill does
not explicitly state roots in the Hampton principles, and it wants
consistency in the compliance of regulations with those principles. It
says that not only when regulators begin their process should they be
seen to be compliant, but that there should be a process by which that
is made consistent throughout their
operation.</div><a name="08061968000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would provide the Government with a compromise. It would
allow the powers to proceed as the clause envisages, even if some
authorities are not currently compliant. It would give the Local Better
Regulation Office a role to ensure that such authorities become
compliant in a year. It would make sure of the opportunity to achieve
Hampton compliance. We can all think of local authorities that may
achieve that at a particular point, but we believe in the principles
and want the whole system to be skewed towards ensuring that the
maximum number of authorities are compliant, and thus able to
participate.</div><a name="08061968000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 3 would ensure that other regulators who can use the
administrative penalties are also consistently compliant with the
Hampton principles. As the Minister 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>knows, the Macrory report was clear that the use of administrative
penalties should only be for regulators who are consistently compliant.
As drafted, the Bill does not seem to secure ongoing compliance. It
requires an assessment prior to the first allocation of the powers, but
not thereafter. It may well be that with the vast range of resources
behind him, the hon. Gentleman can identify the fact that such a
provision is embedded in another part of the Bill. Unless he can show
that a consistent compliance provision exists, the new clause would
strengthen the Bill&#146;s Hampton credentials. Consistency is just
as important as being compliant at the beginning, so if I may I shall
move the amendment and new clause
3.</div><a name="08061968000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000303"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We shall come to new clause 3 formally later,
but we can debate the two provisions together
now.</div><a name="08061968000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061968000304"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I agree with the sentiment behind the new clause. So
many companies will feel frustration if they are encumbered with a
local authority that is not working within the spirit and the law of
the Hampton principles. The new clause would give the LBRO auditing
powers to see that local authorities comply with the Hampton principles
and the ability to certify them as compliant every three years. I
should be grateful if the Minister would elucidate on whether such
matters are catered for elsewhere in the Bill or whether the proposal
would introduce something new that would be
helpful.</div><a name="08061968000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It
