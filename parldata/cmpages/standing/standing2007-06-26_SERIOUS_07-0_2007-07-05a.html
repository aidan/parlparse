has somewhat the same
effect.</div>
					<a name="07070544000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I begin, may I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and
Kenilworth on becoming an Opposition Whip? I happened once to be a
Government Whip, and it was the nastiest job I&#146;ve ever
had.</div>
					<a name="07070544000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07070544000211"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): I wish to put it on record,
Mr. Bercow, that my right hon. and learned&#151;and,
indeed, noble&#151;Friend was one of the most outstanding Government
Whips; his record in the Whips Office was exemplary for collective
responsibility and discipline in the parliamentary party. That,
however, is enough of a diversion.</div>
					<a name="07070544000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070544000212"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I was the worst Whip there has ever been, and I had
great contempt for those who did what I told them to do&#151;but
enough of that. None the less, I congratulate my hon. Friend on his
promotion; I am pleased for him, and he deserves it.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 228</div>
					<a name="07070544000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">You will remember,
Mr. Bercow, that I have been busily expressing my opinion at
some length on many clauses. Although I have relatively little
knowledge of the prevention of fraud or of the data exchanging
provisions, I nevertheless smell a rat when I see one. It is plain that
the powers being taken under part 3 are extensive, as they include
substantial provisions on information exchange. I acknowledge that the
objective&#151;to prevent fraud within Government
Departments&#151;is entirely benign, but as I have said before on
many occasions, all power, once given, is abused. It is therefore right
that the Committee and the House should look carefully at what is
proposed.</div>
					<a name="07070544000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
moment, the clause deals exclusively with executive decisions, namely,
arrangements for the exchange of information between designated
organisations; but no provision has been made for the parliamentary
supervision of that process. Amendment No. 154 would make provision for
a scheme to be laid before Parliament for its approval, so Parliament
would at least have the opportunity to consider the scheme of which the
Government conceive, and it would have the opportunity also to approve
or disapprove the same.</div>
					<a name="07070544000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest that the amendment
offers a sensible way forward&#151;indeed, so sensible is it that
that the Government have tabled new clause 11, backed by new clause 12.
It is always churlish not to welcome an erring sinner when he returns
to the flock. I would have some difficulty should the hon. Member for
Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) seek to do so, but
although it is likely it has not happened yet. The Minister has shown a
desire to follow the kind of thinking that I have outlined, and I
welcome his attempt. However, it is not
sufficient.</div>
					<a name="07070544000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07070544000213"></a>
							<b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): The one point I draw to
the attention of my right hon. and learned Friend is that new clause 12
is an Opposition amendment. I understand that it has not yet been
accepted by the Government, but I look forward with great interest to
the Minister&#146;s response to the debate. New clause 12 highlights
the need for oversight and scrutiny, which will be dealt with in more
detail in due course.</div>
					<a name="07070544000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070544000214"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I apologise to my hon. Friend. No doubt he will wish
to speak to new clause 12. I was focusing on Government new clause
11.</div>
					<a name="07070544000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">My scheme
contemplates the laying of a code before Parliament, to be approved by
affirmative resolution. There quite a lot of precedents: the most
important, to my knowledge, is the PACE code made under the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984. That code is perhaps more far reaching in
its consequences than the code of practice on disclosure, as it
regulates the actions of police forces right across the board, but
although the PACE code is of greater moment, the code of practice on
disclosure is important. The Government recognise that by saying that
the code of practice should be published. The difference between the
Government&#146;s position and mine is that under the Government new
clause, although the code is laid before Parliament, is not the subject
of a necessary debate, far less a vote in Parliament.</div>
					<a name="07070544000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">One has to ask: other than
making the terms known, what is the point of laying a code before
Parliament 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column229" />Column number: 229</div>unless Parliament has a very obvious opportunity to debate it? In
theory, it is always possible to bring matters before Parliament by way
of Adjournment debates and motions on this and that. The great
advantage of my proposal is that the code has to be debated because it
cannot become effective without the affirmative resolution of both
Houses.</div>
					<a name="07070544000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that,
on reflection, the Government will conclude that although my amendment
omits things that they would like to see&#151;and I am not saying
that the language that I have used should be set in
concrete&#151;there is merit in the concept of a code being published
and subjected to Parliamentary debate and vote and thus scrutiny. If
the Government were to accept that, and it is little more than what
they are doing, I would be content. We are dealing with parliamentary
sovereignty, and that is a matter the Prime Minister makes a great song
and dance about and tells us what a convert he is&#151;I must say the
mind boggles at that considering what a control freak he has been for
the past&#151;I am sorry, Mr. Bercow! Remembering your
previous injunction, may I come in your
direction?</div>
					<a name="07070544000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I was
saying, as the Government are committed to transparency and
parliamentary sovereignty, I look forward to hearing that there will be
a sudden manifestation of that and that my new clause will be
accepted.</div>
					<a name="07070544000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070544000215"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I welcome you to the Chair again,
Mr. Bercow. I echo the comments made by my right hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham in
congratulating our hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. I
hope that he enjoys his new responsibilities and challenges, and I hope
that I will not need to be kept in order by him on too many
occasions.</div>
					<a name="07070544000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
pleasure to follow on from my right hon. and learned Friend, given the
way he expressed his concern about this provision. We are now talking
about part 3 of the Bill, which deals with data sharing and data
mining&#151;</div>
					<a name="07070544000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070544000216"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department
(Mr. Vernon Coaker):
						</b> I am sure that the hon.
Gentleman meant to say data sharing and data
matching.</div>
					<a name="07070544000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070544000217"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I am being picked up early in the
morning, but I know that data matching can also be construed as data
mining. I hope that the Minister will assure us that it is the matching
rather than the mining activity that we are debating, given that that
is clearly a matter of concern, rightly expressed by various people
outside the House.</div>
					<a name="07070544000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
comments will be wide ranging and extended. I make them in the full
knowledge of their likely impact on the likelihood of a stand part
debate. It is appropriate to do that to understand the context of the
clause and how the amendments sit within it, so that we can better
appreciate the appropriateness or otherwise of the amendments in the
group.</div>
					<a name="07070544000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">In large
measure, the provisions contained in clause 63 and the next few clauses
relate to the need to combat fraud. It is important to note that a
report for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div>Association of Chief Police Officers economic crime portfolio, published
in February, estimated that all types of fraud cost the United Kingdom
economy at least &#163;14 billion, and that</div>
					<a name="07070544000166"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it would be surprising if the
&#145;true total&#146; was not much larger than
this.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070544000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The report
estimates that in 2005 &#163;2.75 billion was lost through fraud
against private individuals, and says that a conservative estimate of
national public sector fraud losses is &#163;6.4 billion, but the
total could be much higher given that that figure excludes tax
fraud.</div>
					<a name="07070544000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
are right to consider appropriate mechanisms to crack down on fraud,
given its scale and the impact on the economy and on individuals that
those figures indicate. Sharing information on fraud is an obvious part
of that effort. This debate is about how that should be done and what
protections must be maintained to ensure that such information is not
misused, misapplied, or used in a manner other than that which is
contemplated by the Government. We must reassure those inside and
outside the House who are concerned about the use of personal data that
we will ensure that there is no creeping extension of powers without
proper consideration on how and why we share and analyse such
data.</div>
					<a name="07070544000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Information
sharing to prevent fraud has been happening for some time in the
private sector. The most obvious example of how that works is the
Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance Scheme&#151;the United
Kingdom&#146;s fraud prevention service. CIFAS is an independent,
not-for-profit company limited by guarantee that allows its members to
exchange information on applications, accounts and insurance claims
that have been made, or are being used, fraudulently. CIFAS comprises
some 260 organisations, spanning asset finance, insurance, banking,
retail and the telecoms sector. I mention it specifically because it
has been given as an example of an organisation to which it might be
appropriate to extend the powers set out in clause 63&#151;one with
which the Government or public authorities might wish to share
information.</div>
					<a name="07070544000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Against
the backdrop of a private sector that includes CIFAS and other
organisations that make it possible to share information to combat
fraud, and given that somebody intent on defrauding his bank, phone
company or insurance company might also seek to defraud the Government,
it is appropriate that the Government consider how similar approaches
could be applied in the public sector. However, there are significant
risks involved in widening the ambit of data sharing to the public
sector. The Law Society has two principal concerns about the proposals.
It says,</div>
					<a name="07070544000167"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Much
existing data is of poor quality. If poor quality data is more widely
shared across the public and private sectors then inefficiencies will
be created. More worryingly, records may be flagged with a suspicion of
fraud or inappropriate and intrusive fraud investigations initiated. We
are concerned about the sharing of information by the private sector
with public sector bodies which may expose individuals to the risk of
unacceptable consequences in their private lives, not on the basis of
proven criminality but instead based on mere
suspicion.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070544000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law
Society has highlighted the potential for misuse caused by the
wide-ranging nature of the clause. According to subsection (2)(a), the
information that may be provided may be &#147;information of any
kind&#148;.</div>
				
					<a name="07070544000184"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div>
					<a name="07070544000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
might say, in response to the debate, that the clause is restricted by
compliance with the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div>Data Protection Act 1998. However, there are issues about how that
applies and whether it is made clear when someone is providing
information to a public authority that such information could indeed be
shared with third parties for the potential investigation of unlawful
activities. If that is made clear and someone provides information to a
public authority in such circumstances and it is stated that it would
be shared with other bodies, the Data Protection Act would have been
complied with. While the provision gives some protection, it does not
necessarily go all the
way.</div>
					<a name="07070544000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07070544000218"></a>
							<b class="B">Kali
Mountford</b> (Colne Valley) (Lab): I am listening carefully
to the hon. Gentleman, but is there not a problem with the balance
between the protection of the individual that he is concerned about,
and the protection of the general public, who I am concerned about?
They might be worried that the amount of fraud growing in our society
and impinging on their rights to be protected may mean that they will
not be so protected if we go down the route referred to by the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
					<a name="07070544000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070544000219"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> The hon. Lady is being premature and a little
harsh by suggesting that I am siding solely with the individual and not
taking account of the wider implications of fraud prevention. That is
why, at the outset of the debate, I talked about setting the context
and framework. I acknowledged that data sharing already operates within
the private sector and protects individuals. It ensures that fraudsters
cannot operate with impunity. The hon. Lady and I are making the same
point about a question of balance and proportionality. I hope that,
when I develop some points in further detail, she will recognise that
I, too, am talking about understanding the provisions fully and
ensuring that they contain an appropriate balance and reasonableness
that counter the hon. Lady&#146;s rightful point about the need to
ensure that we take a robust approach to fraud. We must also ensure
that they do not have a wider application other than fraud prevention,
and that they can be enforced and ring-fenced. I am not denigrating her
comments. Indeed, we probably share a lot of common thought and it is
the question of balance that we need to understand
fully.</div>
					<a name="07070544000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Minister replies, I hope he can explain to the Committee in detail how
the Government envisage the operation of the data sharing scheme, so
that we can understand it properly. We want to put in context what is
envisaged to see whether the provisions reflect that intention and
aspiration or whether they would go further than might be appropriate
or necessary to achieve the Government&#146;s aims. Is it intended to
follow something akin to the CIFAS model, whereby members, having
satisfied themselves in accordance with the CIFAS code that a fraud has
been committed, can flag up the details of a potential fraud so that
other members are aware of such incidents? Or is a much broader sharing
of information envisaged, and not limited to the entry of specific
incidents that can then require further investigation?</div>
					<a name="07070544000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the CIFAS model, and at
meetings CIFAS has made it clear to me that the aim is to flag up
something for further inquiry rather than to have a watch list that
would be of concern given its impact on an individual in such
circumstances. Let us contrast 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div>that with informing its members of a potential issue
that requires further and detailed examination and analysis to confirm
the robustness and the relevance of the information to the particular
consideration with which the person might be confronted. In any event
and because of the breadth of the current drafting, I believe that
further safeguards are
required.</div>

							<a name="07070544000221"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> My hon. Friend illustrates the importance of
having a clear understanding of what we are talking about. For
instance, CIFAS has a limited number of fields that are focused on
measuring the nature of the fraud. They allow certain information to be
used by CIFAS members to facilitate follow-up and further inquiries
when someone has been flagged up as having committed a potential fraud.
A CIFAS member has to be satisfied that a fraud has been committed on
the balance of probabilities and on the basis of certain tests that
comply with the code. The robustness of the code, and ensuring that it
is complied with, are therefore important in ensuring that the code
does what it says. There has been discussion about whether CIFAS might
need to extend the number of
fields.</div>

relate to remarks by other hon. Members.</div>
					<a name="07070544000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point that I was making was
that it might be necessary to expand the number of database fields in
which CIFAS currently operates. That might be entirely appropriate,
fair and reasonable to the operation of the envisaged scheme. There is
a lot of detail on the approach and the application of the scheme that
is not currently before us. I hope that the Minister will therefore
give at least some explanation of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 233</div>intentions behind the provisions, because that would assist the
Committee in assessing the clause and the related amendments.</div>
					<a name="07070544000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased that the
Government have introduced new clause 11, which provides for a code of
practice to govern the sharing of information by public authorities as
members of a specified anti-fraud organisation. The amendment raises at
least three important questions. First, who will monitor compliance?
The Minister will be aware that there was a debate in the other place
on the need to ensure that the Information Commissioner would have
clear authority to conduct investigations to assess compliance with the
clauses in this part of the Bill that concern sharing and matching of
data. That is reflected in the drafting of new clause 12, which the
Opposition have
tabled.</div>
					<a name="07070544000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are to have comfort that the clause as amended by new clause 11 will
provide protection, we have to know that there will be a mechanism to
monitor compliance and apply sanctions in the event of breach. The
issue is too serious to leave to chance. The Information Commissioner
has made it abundantly clear on a number of occasions that he believes
the best solution is to put a specific and express power in the Bill.
In his letter to the Minister dated 15 June 2007, which the Minister
kindly made available to Committee members, he
said:</div>
					<a name="07070544000168"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I am
content that the new code of practice will give me access to audit and
inspect information-sharing done under the new powers. As you know I
would have preferred something on the face of the legislation about
this. However, I am satisfied that an acceptable outcome can be reached
through a provision in the code of
practice.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070544000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we sit here today, however, how can we be content as a Committee? We do
not have the information and detail to assess whether the Information
Commissioner is correct. I have the utmost respect for him and for his
role as a champion and safeguard. It is clear from his comments that he
has concerns. Questions remain because we do not know the detail of the
code of practice and because of other points that I will come on
to.</div>
					<a name="07070544000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not
debating the details of the code of practice today. Under Government
new clause 11, Parliament will have no scope to review, scrutinise or
assess the reasonableness of the code, on which a huge amount of
reliance is placed. That is not an acceptable situation, which is why
the amendment tabled by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham is so important. It would provide the
additional protection of consideration and approval of the code by
Parliament.</div>
					<a name="07070544000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point concerns the status and effectiveness of the code. Subsection (3)
of Government new clause 11 states merely:</div>
					<a name="07070544000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A public authority must
have regard to the
code&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07070544000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">It does not say
that a public authority must comply with the code. The Information
Commissioner might be given rights in the code of practice, but, given
that the public authority will need only to have regard to the code,
what teeth, in the form of sanctions, will the commissioner actually
have?</div>
					<a name="07070544000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070544000228"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I draw the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention to
the Data Protection Act. As he is aware, it contains a number of
sections dealing with the enforcement 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div>powers that are available to the Information Commissioner, to ensure
that the requirements of the Act are properly
fulfilled.</div>
					<a name="07070544000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070544000229"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for
highlighting that. I want to be clear that the language in the Bill
refers to compliance and that the Information Commissioner will have
the ability to go in and inspect of his own volition, not only if a
complaint is made to him. The Minister has met the commissioner and
Members of the other place, who made the point that it was appropriate
for the commissioner to have that right. I know that the Minister was
exploring that possibility, but Government new clause 11 falls short of
it. I note the comments in the commissioner&#146;s letter on the
subject.</div>
					<a name="07070544000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070544000230"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point, but I
point out that the Information Commissioner is able to investigate such
matters of his own volition, or following a request, under the Data
Protection Act.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070544000231"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I know that the issue of whether the rights
and responsibilities of the Information Commissioner include the
ability to undertake actions of his own volition has been a topic of
debate. I am aware that the Minister&#146;s colleague, Baroness
Scotland, said in the other place that she believed that such rights
exist. Questions about that were raised in the other place and in
discussions with the commissioner, however. I therefore think that it
would be appropriate to dispel any doubts by including in the Bill the
specific provision envisaged in new clause 12. That is why we have
sought to continue the debate, which started in the other place, about
the necessity of such a measure.</div>
					<a name="07070544000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s response. We need to ensure that we have robust
protection and that the Information Commissioner has the authority to
investigate potential breaches of the Bill in the context of the Data
Protection Act. We need assurance that if there are breaches, the
Information Commissioner will be able to discover them and ensure
compliance.</div>

am</div>
					<a name="07070544000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also note the
comments of the Audit Commission, which said that it would welcome the
involvement of the Information Commissioner in relation to other
aspects of the Bill, including data matching. That is
welcome.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070544000232"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I was just trying to find the relevant bit of the
Data Protection Act, under which the Information Commissioner can act
of his own volition. I refer the hon. Gentleman to section 43(1)(b),
which deals with what the commissioner may do if
he</div>
					<a name="07070544000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reasonably requires
any information for the purpose of determining whether the data
controller has complied or is complying with the data protection
principles&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07070544000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
point of difference is that we believe that the Data Protection Act
already allows the Information Commissioner to act of his own volition,
should he believe that the principles contained in the Act are being
broken.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 235</div>
					<a name="07070544000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070544000233"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> The Minister makes a valid point in relation
to the Act, but a subtle distinction can be drawn from this discussion,
because although the Information Commissioner is able to request the
information, it is then a matter of whether he can go into the premises
or inspect the books and records of the person to ensure that they are
complying. That is the distinction drawn between the Information
Commissioner&#146;s ability to request information of his own
volition and his ability to go in or make unannounced visits to be able
to ensure compliance, which is slightly broader than the terms of the
Act allow. However, that is one reason why there has been an ongoing
debate about this aspect of the legislation and why there is still
concern about the robustness of the protections afforded. That concern
is highlighted particularly when we consider the extension of the
relevant rights and powers in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07070544000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">My third point
relates to how proposed new clause 11 would work in practice. How many
specified anti-fraud organisations would there be? What criteria would
be applied in deciding whether a particular organisation is suitable
for public bodies to share information with it? What scrutiny would be
applied to the decisions made by the Government in choosing particular
anti-fraud organisations? What reviews would be undertaken to ensure
that such anti-fraud organisations remain appropriate? Why have the
Government also not chosen to specify anti-fraud organisations by
order&#151;they have left more general phraseology in the
Bill&#151;so that there could be clarity and certainty about whom we
are talking about?</div>
					<a name="07070544000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have highlighted, it has been suggested that CIFAS may be an
appropriate body with which the Government may wish to share
information to combat fraud. There is no doubt that CIFAS is a
long-standing, well-respected organisation. I pay tribute to its work,
but if it or any similar organisation is considered an appropriate
body, a number of practical and legal issues need to be properly
considered, whether in the context of the code or the provisions in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07070544000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the Minister
confirm that an organisation chosen as a specified anti-fraud
organisation would not, in essence, be subsumed within the state? CIFAS
is a private organisation owned by its individual members. As a
consequence of any extension of the data sharing that CIFAS operates,
its members who own it would ultimately have to consider carefully what
it would mean if the Government became a very large member of that
organisation. I would not wish to see a creeping mechanism, whereby
existing private sector bodies that already share information for the
purposes of combating fraud are suddenly subsumed and become another
part of the state. That would be an unfortunate and unintended
consequence of the proposals that we are debating today.</div>
					<a name="07070544000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also the issue of how
indemnities and insurance would apply. As I understand it, at the
moment the individual members of CIFAS give an indemnity to it and to
its other members to deal with any potential liability that may result
from information that is flagged up by CIFAS. For example, if it can
subsequently be shown that information that was incorrect and
potentially defamatory was put on to the CIFAS system and shared, a
legal action may result.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div>
					<a name="07070544000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously it is not in the
general nature of Government or the state to give indemnities.
Therefore, I would appreciate it if the Minister could confirm whether
this issue of indemnities has been given consideration in the context
of how data sharing would apply, so that, for example, non-governmental
members of the relevant organisation would have some sort of remedy or
right of action if they are subsequently subject to legal proceedings
as a consequence of having relied on information provided by the
Government. We need to know how the system would operate in
practice.</div>
					<a name="07070544000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am aware
that insurance does operate in this area and that that may be an
appropriate mechanism for dealing with this potential problem, but I
should appreciate it if the Minister would give some further background
on this issue.</div>
					<a name="07070544000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
have already highlighted in my previous comments, compliance with the
CIFAS code is an essential element of ensuring the robustness of the
whole approach to combating fraud. One of the mechanisms that makes the
CIFAS database work is the ability to ensure that its members comply
with its code by providing and sharing data. That provision of
information is a key aspect of CIFAS; a member cannot simply join CIFAS
and then just take information without also giving information. In
other words, it is a two-way process, and there is also an audit
mechanism to ensure that information is
shared.</div>
					<a name="07070544000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government were to join an organisation such as CIFAS, becoming a
significant member, what practical measures could be taken to ensure
that public sector bodies comply with codes of practice, given that
such codes may well be very significant in their scale and nature?
Returning to the point about corporate governance that I have
previously highlighted, I believe that compliance with these codes of
practice is essential to ensure both protection for the public and that
the system operates effectively in its intended purpose of combating
fraud.</div>
					<a name="07070544000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another key
aspect of this issue is training, to ensure, first, that accurate data
are put on any database and shared with private sector bodies and,
secondly, that people know how to interpret information that is put on
or flagged up on a database. It is vital that we do not take the
approach of creating lists that are, in some way, watch lists, so that
those lists, either because incorrect information is added to them or
information is interpreted in an appropriate way, then have a
significant impact on the ability of an individual to obtain services
from the private sector and to obtain assistance, support and welfare
benefits from the public sector. Therefore, what assurance can the
Government give that the necessary support and training will exist to
ensure that such a problem will not
happen?</div>
					<a name="07070544000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">A separate
point is access. Who, within Government, would have access to the CIFAS
database? Would access be limited to certain designated officers, whose
responsibility it is to combat fraud? I ask that question because I
understand that in the existing systems, organisations and arrangements
for data sharing within the private sector the access to any individual
database would normally be limited to certain members of senior
management and certain key individuals, and that such access is not
generally made available. Again, I am seeking the Minister&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div>reassurance as to how the measure is intended to operate in practice,
and whether it is the Government&#146;s intention that data sharing
will be restricted to relevant individuals, and that the information
will not be used for purposes other than fraud
detection.</div>
					<a name="07070544000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
also a wider point to be made about article 8 of the European
convention on human rights. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has
noted that</div>
					<a name="07070544000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the power of
public authorities to share information with anti-fraud organisations
is drafted in terms too general to satisfy the requirement in Article 8
ECHR that interferences with the right to respect for private life be
sufficiently foreseeable. Unless the law enabling the sharing of
information indicates with sufficient clarity the scope and conditions
of exercise of the power of disclosure, any interference with the right
to respect for private life will not be in accordance with the law and
will therefore be in breach of Article
8.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070544000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the Government have tabled various amendments, and I should be grateful
if the Minister would confirm that he is satisfied that the Joint
Committee&#146;s concerns have been addressed, and that the
Government feel that the provisions comply with the
convention.</div>
					<a name="07070544000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sorry to have detained the Committee at length on the clause and
amendments. The issue is serious and significant, and it requires
detailed scrutiny and examination to ensure that we do not create a
measure that goes further than intended. I hope that the Minister will
respond favourably to a number of the points that have been made and
set out the Government&#146;s intention in further detail, and say
how the concerns expressed both inside and outside the House will be
dealt with by other
means.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): I know the premium that you
place on brevity, Mr. Bercow, so I shall not detain the
Committee for longer than necessary or go over the same ground as the
hon. Member for
Hornchurch.</div>
					<a name="07070544000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Colne Valley made a useful intervention about the balance
that needs to be struck between consideration for the rights of the
individual and the collective rights of society, which has been a theme
of our deliberations during the past couple of weeks. There is more
scope for satisfying both sides of the equation on this measure than on
parts of the Bill that we have debated.</div>
					<a name="07070544000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all begin
with the assumption that we should tackle fraud&#151;it is a criminal
activity, it inconveniences individuals and it costs the public purse a
considerable amount of money. The question is how to tackle fraud in
such a way as to ensure that individuals are protected as they would
wish. In that regard, it is sometimes difficult to strike the perfect
balance, because an individual may give his or her details to a state
agency for a specific and limited purpose, and they would not want
those details to be more widely shared. However, they might then go to
another state agency and express frustration that their details have
not been passed on, and complain that the state was inefficient because
it did not process their details to make their life more convenient.
People&#146;s expectations can be conflicting, and it is difficult
for us legislators to satisfy competing and overlapping
demands.</div>
					<a name="07070544000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
scope for progress on the matter because we have started from the point
that we all want to reduce 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div>and combat fraud. The Liberal Democrats welcome new clause 11, which we
regard as a useful additional safeguard.</div>
					<a name="07070544000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the hon. Member for
Hornchurch spoke about the Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance System and
organisations of that type. CIFAS&#146;s work is extremely valuable
and offers good value for money to its member organisations because of
the costs of belonging and the benefits. My concern, not necessarily
with CIFAS but with other organisations undertaking similar work, is
that it is difficult for an individual turned down for a loan, mortgage
or some other service to work out why they have been
rejected.</div>
					<a name="07070544000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
appears to be a secret blacklist, although every organisation says,
&#147;No, it&#146;s nothing to do with us; it&#146;s not
something that we&#146;ve done,&#148; when one is trying to find
out whether someone who lived previously at one&#146;s address failed
to pay their council tax in full, or whatever it is. It is hard for
people to get to the bottom of why they are on some sort of list
denying them access to services, loans and so on that other people can
access with greater ease. There are genuine issues about protecting the
individual. It is not just namby-pamby liberal sentiment&#151;I do
not find anything namby-pamby liberal sentiment, but I know that other
Committee members take a harsher view of my instincts&#151;it is
about taking a harder-edged approach to the
matter.</div>

appear to be contrary to the second and third principles of the Data

that</div>

Minister&#146;s response. He mentioned that bodies must have regard
to the code, but asked who would monitor compliance. In addition, I
should be interested to know what provision will be made to identify
and police violations of the code. If we require organisations to have
regard to it but have no measures or means to test whether they are
doing so&#151;or, better still, are complying with it&#151;the code
will have no teeth.</div>
					<a name="07070544000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall be cautious in my second point, because it will come up in
connection with the amendments to schedule 7that I have tabled, and I
suspect, Mr. Bercow, that you would rather it were discussed
at that point. The Bill says that the code should be reviewed
&#147;from time to time&#148; only. I shall say no more at this
stage, but my proposed amendments to schedule 7 would set a time scale
on an otherwise extremely vague and unspecific undertaking. I should be
interested, either now or when we debate schedule 7, to hear the
Minister&#146;s thoughts about whether a time scale is appropriate
and could be added to toughen up the application of the
provisions.</div>
					<a name="07070544000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final
point that I want to raise with regard to new clause 11 is what ability
Parliament will have under the new clause to scrutinise the making of
the code for data sharing and whether we as elected representatives of
the people will have input into that process. Although I welcome new
clause 11, and the generally constructive approach that the Government
have taken to part 3, some reassurance on this matter would be helpful
to the
Committee.</div>

							<a name="07070544000237"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Good morning to you, Mr. Bercow, and to
all the Committee. It is nice to see the sun shining in for a change. I
start by congratulating the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth on his
promotion. It is very richly deserved, if I might say so. Just before
his Whip gets up, can I say that I would advise him to take more notice
of the way in which the hon. Member for Reigate operates as a Whip than
the way in which his right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham operates. Indeed, if he wants further
promotion, I suggest that he take that on
board.</div>
					<a name="07070544000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070544000238"></a>Mr.
Blunt:
						</b> I should point out that the lecture on loyalty read
by my right hon. and learned Friend to the parliamentary Conservative
party while in government has gone down in
history.</div>
					<a name="07070544000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070544000239"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I will leave it at that.</div>
					<a name="07070544000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to make a general
point before making some formal comments. I appreciate what the hon.
Member for Taunton has just said and the spirit in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div>which the hon. Member for Hornchurch approached the debate. We have
tried to listen throughout the progress of the Bill, and have made a
number of amendments. Clearly, there are still differences and matters
on which we do not agree, but the Government have tried to amend the
legislation as it has progressed to take account of concerns voiced
both in Parliament and outside, and to strengthen the Bill
further.</div>
					<a name="07070544000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take the
point made by hon. Members that the important thing is the balance that
we establish between personal privacy and the right to that privacy
and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley pointed out earlier,
how we ensure that we prevent and detect fraud. As my hon. Friend
rightly pointed out, it is an important and difficult balance to
strike, but an extremely necessary
one.</div>
					<a name="07070544000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Taunton and my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley pointed out
that sometimes our constituents do not ask us about how we defend the
privacy of individuals, but instead say that they cannot believe that
information is not being shared that would lead to the prevention and
detection of fraud and would be of benefit to us all. Although it is
difficult, my hon. Friend was right to remind us, as other hon. Members
accepted, that in striking that balance we must remember the rights of
those who are victims of fraud, which we all are if, for example,
somebody is defrauding the benefits or tax credit system, or any other
type of Government Department activity.</div>
					<a name="07070544000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have tried in interventions
to answer some of the points that the hon. Members for Hornchurch and
for Taunton made. One of the crucial points concerns the Information
Commissioner being able to investigate problems if he feels that there
is one. Without repeating myself, I believe that the Data Protection
Act gives the Information Commissioner the opportunity to do that. The
hon. Member for Hornchurch asked about compliance. I point out to him
that it is not in the interests of data controllers who have registered
to refuse to comply with an enforcement notice or an information notice
if they wish to satisfy the Information Commissioner that they are
complying with the Act. Failure to comply with an enforcement order or
an information notice is an offence under section 47 of the Data
Protection Act, which gives the Information Commissioner the teeth to
enforce it. The hon. Gentleman also asked whether the Information
Commissioner can apply for a warrant to enter premises. Yes, he has the
power to do so if he has reasonable grounds for suspecting
contravention of the principles of the Data Protection Act.</div>
					<a name="07070544000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman asked
whether we expect there to be more than one specified anti-fraud
organisation and the answer is yes. CIFAS may be used as the model for
a specified anti-fraud organisation, but there could be others. I and
other hon. Members have met representatives of Experian, which is also
very interested in being involved, as Baroness Scotland made clear in
the other
place.</div>
					<a name="07070544000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also asked about the threshold that has to be met for
the sharing of information in the CIFAS model: it is met when the
reporting organisation believes that there would be sufficient evidence
to report 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 241</div>the matter to the police. Another body may choose a different threshold,
but that would be a matter for the code to consider.</div>
					<a name="07070544000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman asked about
the problems of data quality when sharing information. All data sharing
must comply with the Data Protection Act, the fourth principle of which
is
that</div>
					<a name="07070544000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Personal
data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to
date.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070544000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is thus a
requirement to try to overcome some of the problems of quality to which
the hon. Gentleman
referred.</div>
					<a name="07070544000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Information Commissioner can enforce sanctions and penalties if public
authorities breach the code. If members do not comply with
CIFAS&#146; rules they can be made to leave the organisation. If we
specify an anti-fraud organisation and its members do not conform to
what is required of them, it can be unspecified. An organisation is
required to ensure that it meets the standard that we expect it to
meet.</div>
					<a name="07070544000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the issue of
being subsumed, it is important to remind the Committee that no public
authority will be compelled to be part of or to share their information
with a specified anti-fraud organisation. It will be a matter for them
to decide whether it is appropriate and helpful for them to do
so.</div>
					<a name="07070544000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070544000240"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> My point was about a specified anti-fraud
organisation in the private sector that is run by its members. If
public authorities become members of such an organisation, they could
form the majority of its membership and have the ability to influence
the direction of that specified body and its compliance with the rules.
That is why I expressed concern about corporate governance. We should
ensure that the powers, rights and rules in the code of practice of an
existing private sector body that undertakes this work could not,
through a takeover of its shares or its membership, be subverted as
consequence of the expanded membership, taking into account that that
might include public
authorities.</div>
					<a name="07070544000187"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div>
					<a name="07070544000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070544000241"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> That is a fair point. We would not want a
specified anti-fraud organisation to be subverted in any way. It would
be required to act in an appropriate, proportionate and proper manner,
whoever its members were.</div>
					<a name="07070544000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked about training. Again, CIFAS will train the relevant
staff and all new members will be trained to use the database
appropriately and safely. He also asked who would have access to the
database. He was right to point out that a specified person or persons
will be the link between private sector bodies and CIFAS. We are
considering what should be included in the code of practice to see how
it would work when the number of people who can be a part of such
schemes has been extended. As I say, it is important always to remember
that we need to set up an organisational structure that has at its
heart the prevention and detection of fraud, and we need to consider
how that can be done
appropriately.</div>
					<a name="07070544000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
compliance with the ECHR, specifically with article 8, we believe that
the production of a code of practice will achieve the legal certainty
that is sought.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div>
					<a name="07070544000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Taunton
asked how people would know what information was being kept on
them&#151;for example, whether they had been refused credit. Under
section 7 of the Data Protection Act, the subject has rights of access
for any data held, and under section 14 of that Act people have the
right to apply to a court if data are inaccurate, and the court can
order that the information be changed, rectified or
destroyed.</div>
					<a name="07070544000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think
that I have answered most of the specific questions. I turn now to the
amendment and the new clauses. I was grateful to hear the comments of
the Committee about Government new clause 11; we listened to what was
being said and decided to introduce what, essentially, is a code of
practice, although there may be still be disagreements between us on
how it is to be implemented.</div>
					<a name="07070544000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
154 would prevent any data sharing, as provided for in clause 63, until
a code of practice governing the sharing of information had been
published. It would also require a draft of the code of practice to be
laid before Parliament and to be approved by a resolution of both
Houses before it could be published. I wrote to members of the
Committee on 27 June enclosing a copy of the code of practice amendment
that now forms Government new clause 11. The new clause requires the
Secretary of State to produce a code of practice covering the
disclosure of information by public authorities through specified
anti-fraud organisations. Any public authority data sharing through a
specified organisation must have regard to the code. The new clause
also contains provisions to require the Secretary of State to lay the
code and any alterations to it before Parliament, and to consult the
Information Commissioner and any specified anti-fraud organisations on
the code&#146;s content.</div>
					<a name="07070544000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the assumption that the new
clause is accepted, I believe that requirement in the first part of the
amendment&#151;proposed new subsection (1A)&#151;would be met. I
assure the Committee that data sharing will not take place unless a
code is in place. I therefore suggest that there is no need for a
further amendment to require the code of practice to be published
before disclosure of data takes place.</div>
					<a name="07070544000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the second part of
the amendment, proposed new subsection (1B). The Information
Commissioner&#151;the independent regulator and guardian of the Data
Protection Act&#151;has said he is content with the provisions of new
clause 11. Indeed, the hon. Member for Hornchurch mentioned the letter
that I shared with the Committee. The Information Commissioner will
have to be consulted on the code&#146;s operation, and I question
whether it is necessary or right for Parliament also to be asked to
approve it. Such a course would, I suggest, tend to undermine the
authority of the commissioner, whose very purpose is to promote the
following of good practice by data controllers, and in particular to
perform his functions so as to promote the observance of the
requirements of the Data Protection Act
1998.</div>
					<a name="07070544000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Information
Commissioner answers to Parliament, and can report to the House if he
is unhappy with the way in which the powers are being used. We can rely
on the Information Commissioner to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div>ensure that the code of practice is fit for purpose. A copy of the code
and any alterations to it will be laid before Parliament.</div>
					<a name="07070544000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 11 requires the
Secretary of State to prepare a code of practice to which all public
authorities sharing information with a specified anti-fraud
organisation must have regard. Before I go into the details of the
provisions, I want to explain the background. On 18 April, while the
Bill was being considered in the other place, I met Richard Thomas, the
Information Commissioner, with Baroness Anelay and Lord Lucas of
Crudwell and Dingwall to discuss its data matching and sharing
provisions. During that meeting, the Information Commissioner intimated
that he would expect to see a code of practice in place, with the data
sharing provisions set out in clause 63. There was already a
requirement in the Bill for a code for the data matching provisions set
out in schedule 7.</div>
					<a name="07070544000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seemed anomalous to the Government that there should be a code of
practice for one set of circumstances and not for the other. I
therefore undertook to bring forward an appropriate amendment and new
clause 11 is the result. The new clause focuses mainly on the central
point that it requires the Secretary of State to prepare a code of
practice for public authorities sharing information as members of a
specified anti-fraud organisation. It will apply to public authorities
whether or not they are using the gateway provided by clause 63.
Thereafter, it sets out a number of conditions relating to the code.
First, when preparing or changing it, the Secretary of State must
consult the Information Commissioner, any specified anti-fraud
organisation and any other persons as the Secretary of State sees fit
to consult. Secondly, public authorities sharing information through a
specified anti-fraud organisation will have to have regard to the code.
Thirdly, the code must be laid before both Houses of Parliament and
published.</div>
					<a name="07070544000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause provides an additional safeguard for the disclosure of
information by public authorities to a specified anti-fraud
organisation. The purpose of clause 63 is to assist in the prevention
of fraud. However, at the same time we are keen that the arrangements
should retain public confidence, and the code of practice and adherence
to it are important parts of the process. I hope that the Committee
will support the new clause.</div>
					<a name="07070544000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Arundel and
South Downs (Nick Herbert) tabled a new clause 12, which would amend
the Data Protection Act to give the Information Commissioner the power
to assess of his own volition any data processing under sections 63 to
67 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. The amendment
would affect both the data sharing and the data matching provisions of
the Bill, and we believe that it is unnecessary in both
respects.</div>
					<a name="07070544000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wrote to
members of the Committee on 27 June enclosing a copy of the letter from
the Information Commissioner. That confirmed his
contentedness&#151;is that the right word? I am always nervous with
you and vocabulary, Mr. Bercow&#151;his contentment with
the proposed amendment, while expressing a preference for, but not an
insistence on, a legislative basis for access to audit and inspection.
The Government do not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 244</div>think that it is appropriate or necessary to make additional statutory
provision for the Information Commissioner. As I have said, the Data
Protection Act already provides him with robust and extensive powers,
and I have tried to cover those without going through all of them
again.</div>
					<a name="07070544000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 11
takes account of the issues that were raised in the other place and
outside&#151;hence the requirement for a new code of conduct to be
published&#151;and I hope that the Committee will see its way to
supporting it. However, for the reasons that I have given, I ask it to
resist new clause 12 and amendment No. 154.</div>
					<a name="07070544000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070544000242"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I welcome the fact that, in new clause 11, the
Government have made some movement in the direction that I have
suggested. However, I do not think that it is sufficient; they have not
moved far enough. My reservations can conveniently be summarised as
follows.</div>
					<a name="07070544000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
although the code is to be published and laid before Parliament, the
new clause does not provide an inevitable opportunity for Parliament to
debate it. In reality Parliament will not debate it, save in the
margins of another debate. There will certainly be no necessary debate
as is envisaged in my amendment. The code will be laid before
Parliament, but that will be the extent of parliamentary
involvement.</div>
					<a name="07070544000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point overlaps with the first. A vote in Parliament will not be a
necessary precondition of the code coming into operation. In a matter
of such importance, Parliament should have the opportunity not only to
debate but to vote on the coming into operation of the
code.</div>
					<a name="07070544000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070544000243"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> I wonder whether I can draw on the right hon. and
learned Gentleman&#146;s experience. I understood that the Minister
gave the Committee reassurance on the matter of the code not being
introduced in advance. The right hon. and learned Gentleman seems to
think that there are still loopholes or grounds for
concern.</div>
					<a name="07070544000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070544000244"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> No; I think we may be at slight cross-purposes. I
hope that I have not misled the Committee. My understanding is that, as
the Minister said, data sharing will not come into operation until the
code has been published. That is to say, publication will be a
necessary precondition of the operation of the new scheme. My point is
slightly different: it is that Parliament should have the opportunity
to approve the code by an affirmative resolution before the scheme
comes into operation. There is a fundamental difference. The Minister
says that the publication of a code, which is an Executive action, will
be a sufficient precondition. My position is that the vote of
Parliament should be a necessary precondition.</div>
					<a name="07070544000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have summarised
the position fairly; I do not want to be unfair to the Minister. In the
end, it comes down to a person&#146;s view on the relationship
between Parliament and the Executive. The Minister is proposing an
Executive action. His position has moved&#151;it would be churlish
not to acknowledge that&#151;but the safeguards, as far they exist,
are primarily Executive, not parliamentary. He made the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 245</div>perfectly fair point that the Information
Commissioner reports to the House of Commons, which is true, but the
House will not have an automatic opportunity to debate a motion
incorporating the commissioner&#146;s critique of the
code.</div>
					<a name="07070544000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
come back to where we often are. The Government are asserting the need
of Executive control and I am asserting the need of parliamentary
control. The matter is one for the Committee. I shall not press the
amendment to a Division, because the Whips have left and we are short
in numbers, but that does not mean that I shall not return to the
matter on Report.</div>
					<a name="07070544000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ultimately, I stand for the
sovereignty of Parliament. The Prime Minister is making a great deal of
the fact that he does too, and we shall each make our own judgment on
the plausibility of that statement. The clause provides an opportunity
to show that they mean what they say, and they are manifestly failing
to do so. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						</b> It would be convenient if we could finish this
matter, so I shall be as brief as
possible.</div>
					<a name="07070544000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
may ask the purpose of the amendment, but it is perhaps more important
than they have spotted because it goes to the freedom of the press. I
hasten to say that in my previous incarnation as a Minister I have
suffered from the press, and I am no greater liker of them even though
my wife was a journalist and I worked with the press for many years as
a libel lawyer. Notwithstanding the fact that I do not like the press,
I recognise that a free press is an essential ingredient in a
democratic society and that one has to put up with an awful lot of
nonsense in the recognition of that principle. Part of the safeguard
that one has from the operation of a free press is the number of leaks
that they receive from within Government organisations and the
publication of those leaks. Those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div>who have been or who are in government frequently dislike leaks.
However, leaks sometimes serve a very important purpose.</div>
					<a name="07070544000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Incidentally, let me say in
parenthesis that when Departments start leaking, it normally points to
low morale and, very often, poor ministerial leadership, which is
something that the Home Office under the former Home Secretary might
reflect upon. We will not go into that because I can see that you are
getting to your feet, Mr. Bercow. I have a curious habit of
irritating you; I am so sorry.</div>
					<a name="07070544000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have to recognise that leaks
are important to safeguard liberty. It is against that background that
one must look at clause 64(1)(b)(ii) because it makes it wholly plain
that in the situation in which a journalist is in receipt of a leak
from within the designated public authority and then publishes that
leak, that journalist will be committing an offence. The punishments
that may be visited on that journalist are not slight.  Clause
65(1)(b) states that the journalist may on conviction be
subject</div>
					<a name="07070544000176"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to imprisonment
for a term not exceeding two years or to a fine or to
both.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070544000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Incidentally, the
fine is unlimited. Therefore, in principle, the journalist can be
exposed to an unlimited fine and sentenced to up to two years in
prison.</div>
					<a name="07070544000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will say that there is safeguard in  clause 65(2), which states
that the prosecution can only take place with the authority of the
named individual, such as the Director of Revenue and Custom
Prosecutions or the Director of Public Prosecutions. I personally do
not find that a satisfactory safeguard, not least of all because both
the DPP and the Director of Revenue and Custom Prosecutions in their
collective position might well have an interest.</div>
					<a name="07070544000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">That then takes one to what
could be the nature of the leak. Anybody who knows anything about
Government can see that any type of leak is possible, but they
certainly include the following: the fact that the Departments are
grossly incompetent; that the systems are wholly haywire; that
individuals are corrupt; and that policies are wholly mistaken or not
working.</div>
					<a name="07070544000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us look
at the Child Support Agency. Its incompetence and failures might well
feature in a leak. Is it really to be said that the press should not be
able to report such matters from a leak? Let us stand back and say,
&#147;We have a problem here because of the confidential nature of
the information.&#148; There is a public interest here in not
rendering criminal the journalist who publishes the leaked information,
which may well be in the wider public interest. Where then is the
protection?</div>
					<a name="07070544000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
already said that the prosecutions have to be made with the authority
of the named individuals. The only defence that is provided for is in
subsection(4). It
states:</div>
					<a name="07070544000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to
prove that the person reasonably
believed&#151;</div>
					<a name="07070544000178"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
that the disclosure was lawful;
or</div>
					<a name="07070544000179"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) that the
information had already and lawfully been made available to the
public.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 247</div>
					<a name="07070544000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The latter does not
arise in the case of leaks because leaks, by definition&#151;or at
least usually&#151;are of unpublished material. It is very difficult
to see how a leak can be described as lawful when in fact the process
of leaking is said to be an offence. Therefore, the truth is, as I
understand it, that there is no defence available to the journalist who
publishes a leak. Is that really what the Committee wants to do? I
rather question that. It is in that spirit that I have moved my
amendment. I think that it is a matter of some
importance.</div>

						<b class="B">James
Brokenshire:</b> I wish to speak briefly in support of the amendment.
My right hon. and learned Friend raises an important issue on which I
hope the Minister will respond and give some clarification. In
particular, he highlighted the issue of whether the disclosure was
lawful. I hope that the Minister might be able to give some indication
of whether, for example, provisions relating to whistleblowing might be
such that they make the disclosure of such information lawful pursuant
to provisions in other statutes, and to give us some other
background.</div>

talks about protected information. In subsection (5), we discover that
the definition of protected information is drawn somewhat widely and
can be extended even further inasmuch as in subsection (5)(b) it
includes</div>
					<a name="07070544000181"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any specified
information disclosed by a specified public

cover. If the Secretary of State can then expand it by order, we need

							<a name="07070544000249"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I am afraid that I will have to resist amendment
No. 155. Clause 64 introduces an offence for certain further
disclosures of protected information, such as taxpayer information.
Clause 64(1)(b)(ii) ensures that if a person receives information from
a public authority, directly or indirectly, that information remains
protected by the offence of wrongful disclosure. As the right hon. and
learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham pointed out, there is a
defence in clause 64(4) that somebody believed that it was lawful to
disclose the information.</div>
					<a name="07070544000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the end, the point that I
hope will reassure the right hon. and learned Gentleman is that it will
be a matter for the prosecuting authorities to decide whether it would
be in the public interest to prosecute 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div>somebody who has disclosed that information. Otherwise, we are saying
that people can disclose information on the basis that they believe
that it is good journalism and that in their opinion sensitive personal
information could be disclosed and put in the public arena in an
inappropriate way.</div>
					<a name="07070544000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 155 would remove
an essential part of the protection that the clause provides for
information being shared. It would mean that if a person made an
unlawful disclosure of the information they would not be caught by the
criminal offence because they were not the original recipient of the
information but instead received it indirectly. That would create a
loophole in the Bill that I do not think that the Committee would wish
to see, so I ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07070544000250"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I am not in the least bit satisfied by the reply. It
is plain to me that the provision does catch leaking. The only defence
for anything offered by the Minister to the potential leaker is that a
person who might have an interest in preventing the leak will be the
person responsible for deciding whether or not there should be a
prosecution. I have never heard of a shallower defence than that. The
point that my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch made about
enlarging the class of information that could be caught is extremely
sound. We shall not divide the Committee on the amendment, mainly
because there are only two of us&#151;three, if the Liberal Democrat
voted with us, as I hope he would&#151;to vote for it. I hope that
the House will revisit the matter on Report and so I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the amendment.</div>
