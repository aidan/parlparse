<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I draw your attention to a slight change to the Chairman's provisional selection of amendments. The lead amendment in the fourth group of amendments to clause 6 will be amendment No. 128, not Government amendment No. 76. The reason for that is that, in the Bill, amendment No. 128 would precede the Government amendment. That is the only change of which I have been notified.
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Preparation of education development plans</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): I beg to move amendment No. 129, in page 4, line 12, after `regulations'. insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) In drawing up its Education Development Plan, the LEA shall ensure that the Plan does not reduce the proportion of the budget which is delegated to schools.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Some elements in this part of the Bill give the official Opposition real concern, particularly the increased powers of the Secretary of State and the excessively bureaucratic planning processes. I hope that the Committee can consider today clauses 6, 7 and 8, draw out some of the implications of those clauses, seek some understanding of why the Minister believes that those extra powers and processes are necessary and, more importantly, discover what constraints there will be on the use of those powers.
<P>
Clause 6 introduces the concept of education development plans. I have told the Committee more than once that we believe that the proposed planning process is misguided because it will take responsibility from schools, vesting in local education authorities responsibilities that properly rest on heads, governors and the professional staff of schools.
<P>
Amendment No. 129 goes immediately to the bottom line of that process--from the viewpoint of the schools. The amendment requires that, in drawing up its education development plan, a local education authority should ensure that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Plan does not reduce the proportion of the budget which is delegated to schools''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To put it mildly, that is a modest restraint on the impact of education development plans and a modest constraint on the LEA.
<P>
The amendment does not even say that LEAs should see reduced expenditure year by year because, if the Government deliver on their pledge to increase total expenditure on education, LEAs will benefit proportionately from that increase. However, LEAs would not see their budgets grow faster than the schools' budgets for their areas. It is a modest constraint on the extra expenditure implied by many of the Bill's provisions at local education authority level.
<P>
Even if the Government do not like the wording of the amendment, I hope that they be able to accept it in principle. It is important for schools because it would give them the assurance that extra money for education would go to them and not be spent on bureaucracy between them and the Treasury.
<P>
The Minister for School Standards and I attended a conference for grant-maintained heads, when he made it clear to the conference--I can give the sense of his remarks, even if I cannot quote his exact words--that his objective was to raise the standard of delegation and authority in all schools to the standards already achieved by grant-maintained schools. In other words, he saw the process of delegation established by the grant-maintained sector as a benchmark for all schools in the maintained sector.
<P>
I welcome that, and I hope that the Minister will accept the principle of the amendment as an earnest of his good intention to deliver on the sentiments that he expressed to grant-maintained heads--not only to those schools that will become former grant-maintained schools, but to all LEA-maintained schools.
<P>
As well as the amendment giving an important assurance to schools, it would send a message to those responsible for managing local education authorities. Anyone who reads The Times Educational Supplement must have been struck over the past few months by the increase in the number of advertisements for vacancies for special advisers within the LEA sector. Increases in the education budget should not be used to boost the advertising revenues of Mr. Murdoch. They should be destined to improve the amount of money going into schools. The amendment would reassure schools that they will receive the money and it would impose a discipline on the growth of LEAs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): If a group of schools wanted the local education authority to take on several functions, surely the amendment would exclude them from doing that. If the money cannot be increased, that will prohibit the flexibility between schools and the LEA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> With great respect to the hon. Gentleman, that would not happen. If a school wants to use its delegated budget either to buy services from the LEA or services of another collective sort, it is free to do so. The important point is who makes the decision: the LEA or the school governors and heads? We believe that it should be the school governors and heads. I hope that the Minister will accept the sense of the amendment as an assurance to schools and a discipline on the growth of LEA bureaucracy, which is essential.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May </B>(Maidenhead): I support the amendment not only for reasons set out by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), but because of an issue that I raised in our first sitting. Considerable concern has been expressed about how much of their budget local education authorities have been delegating to schools. As I said at the time, evidence has been collected by the Council for Better Teaching showing that the proportion of money delegated to schools seemed to be more than it was because of the way in which LEAs were topslicing their education budgets.
<P>
The Minister accepted that argument and a provision concerning a better definition of delegated budgets and overall budgets appears later in the Bill. Given the problems experienced by schools with local education authorities, it is important that they are given the comfort that the amendment would provide and that they know that the introduction of education development plans will not be a method by which LEAs can play around with the figures of delegated budgets. It is important that schools receive that degree of comfort, so that they know that the introduction of the measures will not adversely affect the sums of money that the LEAs are delegating to schools and can act accordingly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): I wish to respond in part to the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis). A principle purpose of the amendment is to give comfort to schools, particularly those that are currently grant maintained and have so far managed to achieve much greater value for money in the purchase of services--one of the biggest arguments for grant-maintained status. The amendment would impose discipline on LEAs to provide good value services and would attract schools to buy their collective services; that would be a positive step.
<P>
I know of schools that, since becoming grant maintained, have seen improvements in value for money--it would be tragic if that were lost. In some instances, those schools have been quoted figures of tens of thousands of pounds for a service that they could have obtained free of charge if there were competitive tendering. The amendment would protect all those disciplines, so I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> I shall ask the Committee to reject amendment No. 129. Nevertheless, the Government do not disagree with much of what Conservative members of the Committee have said about ensuring that as much money as possible is passed on to schools rather than being held centrally by the LEA.
<P>
We believe that the prime responsibility for raising standards must rest with individual schools and classroom teachers. Schools and teachers can be helped by a supportive LEA to raise standards, but the prime responsibility must be at school level. That means that, wherever possible, money must be delegated down to individual schools.
<P>
I take this opportunity to confirm what I said in the speech to which the right hon. Member for Charnwood referred. We want there to be as much delegation as possible. Whether, as may well be the case, that is based on the model that currently applies to grant-maintained schools, or whether there is a slight variation, we endorse the principle of delegation.
<P>
We are not content with the current situation, in which there is a large variation between LEAs. Bournemouth, for example, delegates 85 per cent. of the potential schools budget, whereas Dudley delegates 96.3 per cent.--I congratulate Dudley on that. Such variation causes concern. We must ask why Bournemouth education authority needs to hold back from the schools 15 per cent. of its potential schools budget. We need to be wary and cautious about the situation.
<P>
Clause 44, which we shall come to later--I am afraid that this is how the Bill is constructed--deals specifically with the scheme for local management. We must ensure that, under that clause, limits and restrictions are put on any LEA hold-back on services.
<P>
We shall provide the Committee with details of our broad principles when we consider clause 44, and we shall make it clear which services we believe are appropriately held and discharged by LEAs, such as the responsibility for the statementing of children with special needs, which, it is generally agreed, is not appropriately done at school level. It will be clear and transparent which issues we believe are more appropriately dealt with by LEAs; the rest will be delegated to individual schools. When we consider clause 44, we shall address specifically the issue of hold-back for the administration of discharging services.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Angela Browning </B>(Tiverton and Honiton): The amendment deals specifically with the costs that will inevitably fall on LEAs in drawing up and administering EDPs.The clause raises the question of who will bear the cost of the plan, and whether that cost will have to be met through efficiency savings within the LEA's portion of the education budget.
<P>
Does the Minister accept that the amendment would protect the schools? It would ensure that the cost was borne by the LEA; the LEA could not pass it on to schools by reducing the amount of money that is delegated to them.
<P>
If the Minister is advising the Committee not to accept the amendment, he is saying that it is correct for the on-costs of the EDP, which he is asking LEAs to provide, ultimately to fall on the budget delegated to schools. I hear what he says about later parts of the Bill, but it would be helpful to know whether the Minister had in mind where the cost would fall when the clause was drafted: on LEAs or on schools?
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The hon. Lady raises two issues. The first is that of the costs of drawing up an education development plan; that begs the second, which involves the nature of the plan.
<P>
We will not embark on a huge bureaucratic paper chase; the compiling of education development plans by local education authorities will be tight and focused. All that we will be looking for is a statement about the targets that the local education authority will set itself, the agreed targets for individual schools, in particular at the end of primary and of statutory schooling, and the LEA's improvement programme. That is all that the Secretary of State will need statutorily to approve. Frankly, most authorities should be providing that already. We believe that local education authorities have a strategic role; they should therefore bear the low cost that will arise from drawing up an education development plan.
<P>
The amendment is terribly modest. It talks about not reducing the proportion of the budget which is delegated to individual schools; we should be doing far better than that, we should be increasing it. We want to go far further.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Our amendment does not go far enough.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Exactly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I wonder whether the Minister is intimating that he would be willing to table an amendment that would go further and write that principle into the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> When we reach clause 44, the hon. Gentleman will discover our proposals for a new regime for local management. That just shows that we have many more exciting sittings to come. We shall consider clauses 77 and 44--[Interruption.] Many weeks of excitement lie ahead for the Committee; I am sure that we are all looking forward to those signposts on the way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his response. As the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) observed from a sedentary position, the Bill is like a Russian doll; gratification is delayed at every sitting of the Committee. We look forward to clause 44 and to the Minister demonstrating during our discussion of it that he is prepared to be more ambitious in holding back the costs of LEAs than is the amendment. We will endorse and warmly welcome such a provision when we reach clause 44. On the basis of the assurance that tougher things are to come, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Amendment No. 70 follows directly from what the Minister said in response to the previous amendment. He agreed with what I had said: that the prime responsibility for raising standards rests on schools and teachers in the classroom. That proposition does not divide us; that is the only basis on which we can achieve the relentless rise in standards which we all want.
<P>
The Minister went on to say that he intended during our discussion of clause 44 to specify the functions that he thought should properly be focused at LEA level. We look forward keenly, not just to the reduction in the proportion of the schools budget held back at LEA level, which was the focus of the previous debate, but to hearing from the Government what they consider to be the function and focus of LEA activity. That is one of the great unanswered questions following the Green Paper and the Bill's publication--[Interruption.] I shall give way to the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Dr. Turner) if he wants to intervene. It was not a Green Paper--it had a green cover, but it was a White Paper. It could be easily confused. It was especially easy to be confused because the contents were so unclear, particularly on the central question of the LEA's role.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 70 is to probe the Government on what exactly they envisage to be the LEA's role. In particular, what is the function of the education development plan within the context of that role? In response to the previous debate, the Minister hinted that, when we deal with clause 44, he will say that the LEA will have a relatively limited range of specific executive functions, one of which would be the administration of the statementing system. As is made clear in amendment No. 70, I am prepared to accept that; there is force in what the Minister says.
<P>
Surely the question that the Minister must answer--given that he has hinted that he will define the LEA's function as being limited and controlled--is what is the purpose of defining the development plan that the LEA is responsible for introducing as broadly as in clause 6?
<P>
Clause 6 states that an education development plan should be ``a statement of proposals'', focused on two objectives: ``raising standards'' and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``improving the performance of such schools''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are all in favour of those two propositions, but that does not link with the narrow definition of what the Minister envisages to be the LEA's function.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath has tabled amendments because of the lack of clarity in the Government's thinking. They say that a broad, ambitious improvement in standards should be sought under education development plans, but what is the connection mechanism between what is set out in that plan and what happens in the school? That is another sympton of the Government's muddled thinking.
<P>
Is the LEA to be the apex--to use the Government's word--of a system that is connected in detail to what happens in the classroom? That is the opposite of what the Minister implies when he says that the key to improving standards is to focus responsibility on the classroom. Or does he envisage the LEA as being focused on a limited range of specific objectives?
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 70 is to pick up what the Minister says is his policy--that is, to focus responsibility on the classroom--and to define the plan as setting out the LEA's intentions for the discharge of a limited range of responsibilities. The amendment lists those limited responsibilities as: dealing with the statementing process, to which the Minister has referred; dealing with cases in which there is clear evidence that a school is failing; and dealing with the exclusions. I am prepared to accept that, under the present system, the LEA should discharge those three responsibilities.
<P>
If I were the Secretary of State, I would want the LEA to draw up a plan on how it would discharge the functions for which it is responsible. My concern is that the Secretary of State is expecting the LEA to produce a plan that does not focus on the functions for which it is responsible, which the Minister says are limited, but a plan that expresses a set of aspirations on many matters for which the LEA is not directly responsible, as is made clear in the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Bath. In my view that should not be so, which is why I oppose those amendments, even though he has put his finger on one of the flaws in the Government's thinking. There is no connection mechanism to allow the LEA to deliver the broad, ambitious objectives implied in clause 6.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I am delighted by the way in which the right hon. Gentleman is saving the Committee's time--I will have to say far less when I speak to my amendment. Is he aware that the Government have had some thoughts on the matter? For example, page 26 of the White Paper proposes a far greater connection mechanism than the Bill appears to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Professor Barber said on another occasion at another of those conferences at which I was present--I was not on the platform--that there is a conflict between the White Paper and the Bill. The Bill amends the position of the White Paper in that it moves slightly in the direction of local responsibility. I welcome that. However, I seek a clear statement from the Government on whether we want LEAs with a limited, specific range of functions, the discharge of which they would be required to plan. Or do we see LEAs as the apex of a system with far greater general responsibility for interfering in schools--a measure that the hon. Gentleman for Bath, but not I, would welcome?
<P>
Amendment No. 71 would allow individual governing bodies to introduce the private sector into the delivery of a broad range of school services. I tabled it to probe the Government's true intentions. When Professor Barber announced the Government's proposals for failing schools at an education conference in Bradford, which the hon. Member for Bath and I attended, he stated that he would in some circumstances welcome bids from the private sector--I think that he named Proctor and Gamble--to act as potential managers in regard to education action zones. Teachers, the head teacher and, in an education action zone, companies such as Proctor and Gamble, would be employed as private managers of schools delivering a service. I would be interested to know whether the Government are prepared to contemplate that measure; if they are, I would be delighted to welcome the Minister's thinking on it. I would be interested to hear how widely my enthusiasm is shared by his own Back Benchers.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 71 is simply to ask the Minister why, if he, like Professor Barber, is prepared to contemplate the possibility that Proctor and Gamble may be better able to deliver a school service in a particular school than the present LEA function, we have to wait until the school has failed and is part of an education action zone where there is an acknowledged problem before that freedom can be exercised? Why cannot a set of governors, on the say-so of the Secretary of State and supported by parents, exercise the freedom in one or two areas that Professor Barber thinks should be available if they think that that would be in the interests of the children? It is a probing amendment and I look forward with great interest to the Minister's response.
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 72 deals with two important issues that are of day-to-day concern in the delivery of a school service in many localities in this country: first, sixth-form provision and secondly, the pattern of mixed-sex or single-sex teaching or classes. Those are important questions of choice. The purpose of amendment No. 72 is to establish that, as part of an EDP, an LEA should not plan changes in the arrangements for single-sex or mixed-sex provision or for sixth-form provision in an area without the consent and support of the governing bodies of the schools directly concerned. I think that that is important and I hope that the Minister will assure us that the Government endorse that proposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Despite the assertion of the right hon. Member for Charnwood that he and my hon. Friend the Member for Bath have opposing views on the issue, I believe that our parties are close together on it. While the Minister and, I understand, the Prime Minister and the inspector of schools wish to get rid of LEAs, we want to clarify the role of LEAs and of schools and, where schools and LEAs have common duties, to ensure that that is clearly stated.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We agree with the right hon. Member for Charnwood that an element of clarity is missing. Until we know the Government's thinking on the future role of LEAs and on the regulations covering educational development plans, we shall be in the dark. We were promised by the Minister very early on--the right hon. Member for Charnwood will remember that it was the set part of his opening speech--that he would make clear what regulations were to be included and what LEAs would have to put in their educational development plans. I shall not repeat what the right hon. Gentleman said. Perhaps the Minister can give us the assurances that was seeking.
<P>
I shall now speak to amendment No. 87. We want two additional mandatory requirements to be included in educational development plans. First, the plans should include a statutory duty to require pupil participation, under article 12 of the United Nations convention on the rights of the child. We are talking about raising standards in our schools, but the children themselves should be at the centre of that debate.
<P>
Every school should allow and encourage young people to have a say in what happens in their schools. At present, it is entirely at the discretion of the head teacher or the governors whether the children have any say. My experience is that if children are included in school councils or year-group councils, and are allowed a say on anti-bullying policies and other matters, they respond tremendously well. We are talking about raising standards, so I hope that the Government will allow schools and LEAs to include that in their plans.
<P>
The second paragraph of amendment No. 87 deals with excluded children and looked-after children. One of the major issues facing schools today, particularly schools in the more difficult areas, is what happens to excluded children. The correlation between the level of juvenile crime and the number of children excluded from school is great. Last year, 12,500 children were permanently excluded from school, and many of them were inadequately provided for by the LEAs.
<P>
Although LEAs have a duty to ensure that children permanently excluded from school are provided for, we have all seen that duty being poorly carried out. It is important that the development plans should mean something. They should impose a duty on LEAs to consult schools and parents, so that everyone is fully aware of the support needed by excluded children. It is not good enough simply to exclude them: it is incredibly important to do something positive to return them to society. An inclusive education system is needed, and my hon. Friend the Member for Bath and I are desperately trying to achieve it, in the Bill and elsewhere.
<P>
The other group of children consists of looked-after children. There is still a discrepancy in some authorities between the functions of LEAs and social services departments; they need to get their act together to support those children. It cannot be left to the vagaries of social services departments or education departments as to whether those plans are carried out properly. Amendment No. 87 seeks to ensure that the child is at the heart of matters--that excluded children and looked-after children are properly provided for, and that children have a say in the organisation of their schools.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I should like to comment briefly on amendment No. 70 and to pick up on what the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough said on amendment No. 87, especially his comments about excluded children.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood rightly set out the issue at the heart of the clause--the role of the LEA. He was echoed by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, and I add my voice to what has been said. Yet again, as members of the Committee, we would have found it much easier if the Government had clarified their thinking before we had to consider their proposals--some of the speeches and amendments would not have been necessary.
<P>
I support amendment No. 70, tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood, which deals with excluded children. The Select Committee on Education and Employment, of which I am a member, is currently studying the subject of disaffected children. We have heard some interesting evidence; yesterday we were told what provision voluntary sector bodies and others considered appropriate for such children.
<P>
I support the wording of amendment No. 70 rather than that of amendment No. 87. There has been much debate on the right way in which to provide an education for disaffected children and children who have been excluded from school. The debate has focused on whether alternative education needs to be provided or whether people should work with disaffected children to enable them to go back into mainstream education. The Select Committee has heard strong evidence from both sides of the argument, and we shall consider the issue carefully. Some groups have worked successfully outside mainstream education, whereas others, as we heard yesterday, have been successful in getting children back into mainstream education.
<P>
The wording of amendment No. 70 is preferable to that of amendment No. 87, as it puts the emphasis on ensuring that proper provision is made, but does not specify the nature of that provision. The issue is important and should be flagged up on the face of the Bill, so that the commitment to ensure provision is not lost behind vague words. I hope that the Government approach the amendment constructively.
<P>
Amendment No. 70 also mentions children with special educational needs. Now that we have seen the Government's White Paper on excellence--[Hon. Members: ``Green.'') Green--thank you. The documents are issued in multicoloured covers, so it is sometimes difficult to tell whether they are Green Papers or White Papers.
<P>
Since the White Paper was published, we have heard parents' concerns about future provision for children with special educational needs. My constituents--like those, I am sure, of other hon. Members--are asking what rights parents of children with special educational needs will have in the future. They are concerned because of what the Government have said about the possible reduction in provision for statemented children.

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Estelle Morris):</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way. I confirm what I said not only when I gave evidence to the Select Committee about the Green Paper on special needs, but in debates more recently, as it needs to be put on the record. The Government have no proposals to reduce or remove the existing legal protection enjoyed by parents of children with special needs. A balance must be struck; we want to ensure that there is good provision for all children, whether or not they are statemented, and that the considerable money in the budget is spent in the best possible way.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary of State for that. As I was about to say, I pressed her on that point when she gave evidence to the Select Committee. However, she also told the Select Committee that, although the legal backing for children with special educational needs would be retained, the Government would try to pursuade parents that statements were not needed--we shall have to see how that pans out.
<P>
I hope that the Government will accept the need to insert a specific reference to ensure that proper provision is made for children with special educational needs, in the light of the commitment given by the Under-Secretary in her evidence to the Select Committee and in our debate. The amendment endorses what the Government say is their commitment; it should be included in the Bill to give parents satisfaction and comfort about the Bill's operation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn: </B>(Guildford): I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) for reminding us that there are a range of approaches to dealing with excluded children. Different answers are appropriate in different situations. It is also worth pointing out that failed strategies can be turned around and schools can be made more successful.
<P>
In particular, there is a continuing role for residential accommodation. On Monday, the Minister and I will meet the principal of Wey House, a school in my constituency that is an outstanding example of a residential school for children with emotional difficulties that has turned itself round during the past two or so years through a new approach--a highly imaginative programme devised by its head.
<P>
I want an assurance from the Minister that his Department will not interfere too much when a local education authority realises that it has a problem with such schools and tries to adopt new solutions. The local education authority and the school should be given the scope to proceed with what they think is the right way forward. That may involve a change of approach and trying out new ideas. There is great concern that the dead hand of bureaucracy will limit the initiative of schools. I want an assurance from the Minister that the Department will allow local authorities and schools to retain as much initiative and scope as possible.
<P>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead, I am reassured to hear the Under-Secretary's explanation of the legal position of parents. However, she has implied in the past that those who are not statemented will be given better provision thorugh the use of the money currently spent within the SEN budget on transportation and assessment. I think that she estimated that money at &#163;500 million a year. The implication is that savings from introducing a more efficient system and assessment process will provide a great deal of extra money to be spent on those who are not statemented but have special educational needs.
<P>
Does the Under-Secretary realise that, judging by the experience of Surrey, the amount spent on transportation is by far the greater part of that component of the SEN budget? If there are any savings to be made on that--we believe that there may be in our county--they are surely needed to cope with the cuts being imposed on the county council by the Government.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for letting me intervene. May I just clarify something? I would not want people who read the record of the Committee to be misled. If my memory serves me correctly, I gave the Select Committee a rough outline of how the money in the SEN budget was spent. I did identify the amount spent on transportation. However, I have always made it clear that the money that I want spent on children is that currently tied up in the bureaucracy of the statementing process. I have never suggested that I want to switch money from the transportation budget. I want money to be spent on children, not on bureaucracy. Given the comments made by the right hon. Member for Charnwood, I am sure that that will find favour with him.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary, but that highlights a real problem for her. She bandied about the figure of &#163;500 million--a large proportion of which I think she will find is devoted to transportation costs, not to the costs of processing appeals or assessments of statemented children. The amount of money that will be available for the group--I agree with the hon. Lady that it is a very important group--of children who do not have a legal statement, but have needs, will have to come from elsewhere. That is why LEAs are concerned that the needs of statemented children may to some extent be sacrificed so that the equally genuine needs of those who do not have a legal statement can also be met within the inevitable spending constraints. I look forward to further comments from the Minister on that point.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): As this is my first opportunity of addressing the Committee, I wonder if, as well as addressing the detail of the amendment, I may say a little about why I do not think the clause should be amended. Having served on an LEA for 20 years, latterly as the chairman, I am all too aware that LEAs can be part of the problem if they do not recognise their true function. The beauty of the clause is that it makes clear the primary function of an LEA. The Government believe that LEAs exist to ensure that all children get a better education and that educational standards rise, year after year, within the area of their responsibility. It is obvious to anyone who has served in an LEA over a period that management by primary legislation is not important; what is important is that one recognises what issues--of the month, the year, sometimes the decade--should be given attention so that the LEA can ensure that best practice is applied in all of its schools.
<P>
One of the problems with the amendments--I was reassured to hear the word ``probing'' used to describe them--is that it would be entirely wrong if we tried to pin down in primary legislation anything other than what I regard as a mission statement for the LEA. Just as, in the commercial world, a business needs to identify its function and, from time to time, question its activity to see if it is compatible with that raison d'etre, an LEA needs to be brought firmly back to ground by being helped to realise that its purpose is to raise standards.
<P>
In the last four years that I spend in my LEA, the huge amount of bureaucracy in regard to special educational needs--the amount of money and of officer time that was being spent on shuffling paper--was a key issue. We consulted and talked to the schools about ways in which, by reducing bureaucracy, more money from the budget could be spent in the schools. That required co-operation from the schools. It also required them to recognise that there would occasionally have to be some rough justice in the dishing out of the money. Schools had to trust one another's judgment of the need for special educational provision, not through legislation, appeal processes and bureaucracy, but through the teacher in the classroom using his or her common sense to recognise that a child needs aid, and through a flexible administration ensuring that that aid could be delivered the following week, not after six months had elapsed.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> And longer.
<P>
<B>Dr. Turner:</B> Or longer--six months was the target. I saw examples of three and four years of argument and bureaucratic legal process. We must not remove a parent's right to that legal redress, but we must ensure that a larger proportion of the money is spent on children in the classroom and on the help that they receive. That was a problem over the past few years, but we do not want the solution written into primary legislation.
<P>
It is a matter of management and we should not manage our schools by legislation. The Bill should certainly give the Secretary of State the power to check that the LEAs are doing their work and that they recognise their responsibility to deliver money into the classrooms. However, we in London cannot tell schools in Norfolk, for example, how they should be managing their schools and by what mechanism.
<P>
I accept the argument of the right hon. Member for Charnwood that Ministers intend to see what has gone into the plans after consultation, and that is important. It will be a novel experience. However, I hope that the Committee recognises that the issues that concern us today will not concern us in two or three years' time. Progress will be made. New problems will be presented and there will be new opportunities to be grasped.
<P>
Primary legislation must ensure that mechanisms exist to tackle future problems. I hope that what LEAs cover in their development plans in four years' time is not the same as the issues that we are discussing today. For example, I hope that some of the problems in early-years education that we are debating today will have been solved by then. Much less detail will be required because we would have met the need for early-years education. Who knows what problems will arise in four years' time? It is Parliament's responsibility to pass primary legislation that ensures flexibility so that we do not have to keep returning to Parliament to legislate on details.

<P>

<B>Mrs. May:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman clarify his point about those issues that will change, given that the amendment refers to special educational needs? He talked about the changes to early-years education that would, in effect, change the later requirements for special educational needs. I hope that he is not suggesting that all problems will be solved by early-years education, such as the requirements of children with disabilities who have special educational needs.
<P>
<B>Dr. Turner:</B> I may not have expressed myself clearly enough. I was talking about early-years education and not relating it to what I have to say about special educational needs.
<P>
The Government will be giving guidance to LEAs through the circular. We will pay careful attention to the transitory period during which class sizes are reduced and nursery education for three and four-year-olds is introduced. Over the next four years, we will be seeking to change dramatically the standards of education. I want to ensure that we are not frozen with legislation on issues that will not be the issues of the future and therefore not those that LEAs will need to address. The Secretary of State must be given flexibility, through the circular, to change the details of what he can request from LEAs from year to year without having to change primary legislation to enable that to take place.
<P>
Conservative Members have correctly identified many of the key issues of the day. If we said that certain issues must be covered in the development plan to be produced in the near future, I should expect that, after consultation, the Government would have little difficulty in saying that such issues will indeed be part of what LEAs will be discussing with them. The way to achieve our aim is to ensure that flexibility is written into the Bill, so that the Secretary of State can deal with the relevant problems.
<P>
In dealing with the problem of raising standards, LEAs will need to deal with weak schools, as the amendment makes clear. That will be insufficient, however. We will not raise standards by looking at what is worst--we must also look at how things could be done better. Some of the best schools in Norfolk could do better in parts of the curriculum or certain departments.
<P>
If the planning process is aimed simply at dealing with the small minority of schools considered to have special weaknesses, LEAs will not raise standards properly. Of course we must deal with weak schools--but not only with weak schools. The amendments refer specifically to excluded children. The Bill makes it clear that we are discussing children, whether or not they are in school.
<P>
There is no difference of principle between Members of the Committee. Much of the detail to which hon. Members have referred is good meat for debate within an LEA. More specifically, I know several schools that have considered market testing. Some of them have had their fingers burnt and have quickly returned to the LEA for their services. Schools have the power to do that now. I saw that happening, so I am sure that it was legal; there was no question of illegality.
<P>
I have no concerns--nor have the Government--about proper co-operation between the private and the public sectors. We do not want to be dogmatic or doctrinaire about that. The prime objective is raising standards, and there is a place for both private and public resources to be used to best advantage. Schools have the power to do that already, so there is no need to accept the amendment.
<P>
Why on earth are Opposition Members trying to muddle raising standards with some of the detailed work that an LEA must do separately? I should be horrified as the chairman of an education committee if the detailed work that must be done on school structures--for example, that which must rightly be done on sixth forms--were muddled with development planning. Over the past few years, I have dealt with many rural schools that have sought to establish sixth forms. That should be an entirely separate exercise from development planning. Such work must be done and there must be consultation, but, bluntly, there will not always be agreement. However, it would be inappropriate to tie that work to education development plans, as the amendment would do.
<P>
It is important that we focus on the main purpose of the LEA--raising standards and promoting improvements in schools. We must ensure the proposal does not involve an over-bureaucratic planning process, which ties down in primary legislation the details to be addressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I have listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman's comments. Does he not agree that the Government must lay down certain principles, either in the Bill or, at least, in regulation or guidance? At the moment, whether children with severe special education needs, often associated with physical or sensory impairments, can access their neighbouring school depends on the local authority and, frankly, on the school's head and governors.
<P>
As a point of principle, Liberal Democrats believe that every child should have the right, wherever possible, to access their local school, irrespective of their disability or statement of special educational needs. The Under-Secretary said that she would deal with this matter at an appropriate time. However, we wanted it to be the LEA's duty--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that he is making an intervention, not a speech.
<P>
<B>Dr. Turner:</B> I think that I have said enough. A host of interesting matters remains to be debated. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough failed to separate the issues. Yes, probe away--but, for goodness sake, we should not accept the amendment. It would be a disastrous power. Primary legislation is not a suitable vehicle to accommodate current thinking on such matters.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I shall not detain the Committee, except to remind Ministers and the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk that at page 28 in the White Paper--it has a green cover--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The pages are white.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I thank the Minister for telling me that the pages are white.
<P>
At page 28, the White Paper sets out the LEA role in making school improvements. It includes specific checklists, one of which is to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``monitor parental and local concerns''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``An EDP should be drawn up taking account of the LEA's wider responsibilities, for example for school places planning, local management schemes and SEN provision''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, when the Government produced the White Paper, they saw the education development plan--it can be accepted or rejected by the Secretary of State--embracing and enshrining their policies on special educational needs. The same principle would, of course, apply to exclusions.
<P>
I realise that we shall be talking about appeals against exclusions later in the Bill, but I wish to speak about the LEA function under the EDP to monitor parental and local concerns. Members on both sides will know that many parental concerns focus on SEN provision and exclusion--not only for the particular children concerned, but for the parents of the other children in a class with a problem relating to SEN or exclusions. If the Minister does not support the amendments, it would help if we knew why the reference to SEN in respect of the EDPs was dropped between the publication of the White Paper and the drafting of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It is probably appropriate that I should first answer the hon. Lady's question. I am sure that educational development plans will address the concerns of parents with children with special educational needs, or of parents who may be concerned about the impact of children with special educational needs being put into particular placements. The point of EDPs is that they should cover all children, and not identify particular groups of children. We believe that all children can be encouraged to improve. That distinction has been clearly made in this morning's debate. We do not want to identify particular groups of children; we want to raise standards across the board.
<P>
To achieve those improvements, local education authorities will want discrete strategies on the needs of particular groups of children--for example, under-achievement by boys or difficulties with children with special educational needs. Those matters will need to be dealt with as part of a general school improvement programme. As my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk pointed out, it is important that people should realise that EDPs are about all children, not just little groups of children. LEAs should recognise that, under clause 5, they have a duty to promote high standards for all children, not just particular groups of children.
<P>
It is not only weak or failing schools that need to raise their sights. One of the great problems in the school system is the 40 to 50 per cent. of schools that are coasting along and doing all right, but which could be pushed to do a lot better. If we are to achieve a real sea change in the standards being achieved by our children, that large group of schools--40 to 50 per cent.--needs to be pushed and challenged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister is entirely right to say that we need to stimulate what I tend to call Beta plus schools. However, I refer him to the point that he made in response to the previous debate. He said that the prime responsibility for raising standards rests with the classroom teacher and with schools. Does he consider the responsibility for stimulating Beta plus schools to rest with the LEA or with the people working in the schools? He gave me one answer during the previous debate and is now giving me a different and conflicting answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I do not think that I am. To clarify what I am saying for the right hon. Gentleman: the way in which the education development plan will work is that it will be for the local education authority to challenge Leafy Lane high school to improve. The LEA will need to engage in discussion with the school and agree targets for it.
<P>
We are not prepared to stand to one side and let schools coast; they need to be challenged, to be put on the spot and to improve their standards. Delivering that improvement will be the responsibility of the school and the classroom teacher. There is clearly something wrong if schools are simply coasting and are not able to raise their current standards.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way again; I do not want to delay the Committee on this point. If the LEA is to make a focused, well-informed, well-structured intervention in the affairs of Leafy Lane high school, it must have the necessary range of knowledge and expertise. That would mean the LEA taking responsibility for the delivery of something that is properly the responsibility of the professionals working in the school. The Government must decide whether delivering improvements in Leafy Lane high school is the responsibility of the LEA or of the professional teachers working in that school. It cannot be both; it must be one or the other.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Let us take an example; let us say that Park View high school, a couple of miles from Leafy Lane, and with a similar intake, is an A-starred high school which is doing exceptionally well. It is the local education authority's job to go to Leafy Lane and say, ``Why don't you look at Park View? It has a similar intake, but is getting A-starred results. You're failing to achieve those levels, and we believe that you can achieve them.'' The local authority can challenge individual schools--but not without providing support and demonstrating why it is doing so; it will have to be able to show that Park View is achieving better standards with a similar intake. That is the correct role for a local education authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I read in the White Paper that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``standards rise fastest where schools themselves take responsibility for their own improvement.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is the Minister now saying that standards rise fastest where LEAs themselves take responsibility for improvement in their schools?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I will say it again, to make it clear to the hon. Gentleman. Responsibility rests with the school and the individual classroom teacher. If the LEA were simply to say to Leafy Lane high school, which was not reaching an acceptable level, ``You can do better.'', Leafy Lane high school would reply, ``We don't think we can.'' Instead, the local education authority can say, ``Look at what Park View is doing.'' The local education authority should promote good practice and show schools what can be achieved. In the end, it will be for Leafy Lane high school to say, ``Yes, if Park View high school can achieve those standards, there is no reason why we cannot.'' It will always be for the school to agree to the targets proposed by the LEA, but it will be for the LEA to challenge the school to do better and to get it to sign up to those improved standards.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I entirely agree with all that the Minister has said about the different roles of the LEA and individual schools. However, I must say in passing that the constant reference to poor old Leafy Lane high school brings a new meaning to naming and shaming.
<P>
Does not the Minister agree that this debate is highlighting the confusion, which all members of the Committee share, about the Government's lack of willingness to be absolutely clear about the distinctive roles of the LEA and schools? I remind him that the White Paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If we are to hold LEAs to account for their performance, we owe it to them to ensure that they have a clear job description.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, I think that the Minister will accept that it is a great pity that, subsequently in August in the framework paper, the Government concluded:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We do not propose to set out a full job description in the Bill, because in general LEA functions, duties and powers are already adequately covered by legislation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government's shift in position is causing much confusion, especially among Opposition Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It should not cause confusion. We have made it clear that the White Paper has green tinges, which might explain why it had a green cover. We have, through the White Paper, listened to what people have said; as a result, the Bill reflects their comments. I know that LEAs want a job description. They have legal powers; they will have a clear and precise duty under clause 5 and, therefore, there is no need to provide them with a job description. Under the Bill, the prime duty of LEAs will be to promote high standards. That is what we want them to do; it is their prime responsibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I apologise for intervening again. The Minister's description of the sequence of events is not entirely correct. He said that listening to the consultations on the Green Paper led the Government to think that there was no need to determine a clear role for LEAs; yet, having reached that conclusion, the Government's framework document invited various people to suggest what that role might be. So there continues to be confusion about the Government's position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> There is a difference. A listed job description for LEAs would be prescriptive and would not give LEAs the flexibility that they need, especially that needed to meet their responsibility under clause 5. That is the simple reason. To list 12 functions--part of the job description of LEAs--would be prescriptive, inflexible and simply not the best way forward. As LEAs see how the proposal develops, they are not being as critical as they were a few months ago about the fact that the Bill contains no specific job description for them. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Bath mentions, from a sedentary position, the chairman of the Local Government Association. It is interesting to note that, although Bournemouth has the worst record of delegating budgets to schools, the next authority above it on the list is Newham, which he also chairs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister said that, under clause 44, the Government would specify LEA functions to control their costs, which I welcomed. He now says that it is undesirable to specify LEA functions. The record will show that he promised to do that in the previous debate, but he now denies that that is desirable--which is the Government's policy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> There are two different issues: the job description and the list in the White Paper, which is not the same as the functions or services that LEAs will provide. When we debate clause 44, we shall specifically say which services are more appropriately dealt with by the LEA, as opposed to being delegated to individual schools. Whether the service is the statementing of children, home-to-school transport or whatever, it will be specified under clause 44 and in the new scheme for delegation of budgets to schools.
<P>
There is a clear distinction--with which I think members of the Commitee would agree--between the services and functions, and the duties and responsibilities of an LEA; duties and responsibilities may well have formed part of the job description in the White Paper.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 72 involves single-sex schools and sixth forms. Reorganisation proposals will not be part of the education development plan; they will be specifically excluded from it. Any education development plan that attempted to introduce school reorganisation proposals would therefore not be approved by the Secretary of State. We shall have the opportunity to debate reorganisation proposals in more detail on clause 25.
<P>
Amendment No. 71 deals with private sector involvement. As my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk said, we do not have a dogmatic approach to the matter and are simply looking for people who can do the job well. If that is the LEA, fine; if it is someone else, that is also fine. We intend to put children's interests first. If the private sector can fulfil that responsibility, it will be given the opportunity to do so. I do not know whether it will be Procter and Gamble--I also do not know whether the company's shares have shot up as a result of the comments of the right hon. Member for Charnwood. Nord Anglia made a lot of money as a result of Professor Barber's speech; we all checked to see who had bought shares in the company the day before it was made, but unfortunately we did not find any interesting names.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Can the Minister confirm that, while Nord Anglia already does so, Procter and Gamble has apparently expressed an interest in employing teachers to deliver a maintained school service, obviously on a contract? If that is the confirmed Government view--as I said, it is an interesting idea that we should welcome--why should it be available only to an educational action zone and why should a school have to fail before it can be tried?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I think that the right hon. Member will find that education action zones will involve more than failing schools. We want a real mix of schools involved; I am keen that a beacon school, which can demonstrate good practice, be involved. Also, when we discuss LEAs' powers of intervention later in the Bill, the right hon. Gentleman will see that the Secretary of State will have the power to bring together different functions and to commission another agency to carry them out. The Bill states clearly that that can also be the private sector. So there is scope to extend the practice beyond the education action zone, but in reality the wide range of private sector organisations that can do the sort of work required do not currently exist. 
<P>
The education action zones therefore provide the opportunity, on a phased basis, for the private sector to be involved; we can oversee how they do the work, they can get a good track record on provision and, if there is an expansion into other areas of education, private sector organisations will be in a position to participate. We are talking about 20 to 25 schools in each zone and 20 to 25 zones, so a few hundred schools will be involved and we will be able to see whether the private sector is in a position to deliver the sort of quality of education that we want. It will of course be underpinned by the LEA's continuing statutory duty to ensure the education of children in their area. We are not handing things over to the private sector; we are saying that the development of high-quality education is not the exclusive preserve of LEAs. If there are other people who can provide good standards of education, we will be happy to consider applications and approaches from them.
<P>
On amendment No. 87, I take the point about involving young people. Quite separately, we have set up a working group, in which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is involved, to look at active citizenship among young people. We feel that that is the appropriate way forward, rather than through the provisions in amendment No. 87.
<P>
In the light of those comments, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for several of the things he said in his response. There remains a difference between us on the function of an EDP and the desirability of the planning process, particularly in the context of what we have described as Leafy Lane high school. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We have had a wide-ranging debate on a wide range of amendments. We now move on to more targeted amendments that will no doubt generate a more targeted debate.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`without undue variation by sex or race'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> As you rightly said, Mr. Gale, the amendments are specific. They would ensure that in raising standards in schools, no groups in the community are left behind, especially those who may be disadvantaged because of their race or gender. I am sure that members of the Committee will recall the Ofsted report that was published in 1996, entitled ``Recent Research on the Achievements of Ethnic Minority Pupils''. It was the first authoritative national survey since the Swann report of 1985.
<P>
Ofsted's report provides the basis of the amendments. Its findings were authoritative and unchallenged. Indeed, they were accepted by the previous Government with considerable alacrity and the then Secretary of State almost immediately arranged to have published a 10-point action plan to raise the achievement levels of ethnic minority pupils. That led to the establishment of a ministerial advisory group on the matter, which I am delighted the present Government have maintained.
<P>
It is worth reflecting on the final remarks made by HMCI about the report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``One of the clearest findings of this review is that if ethnic diversity is ignored, if differences in educational achievement and experience are not examined, then considerable injustice will be sanctioned and enormous potential wasted.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I notice that the Under-Secretary is nodding; I am sure that members of the Committee also agree with those remarks.
<P>
The point of the amendments is to ensure that no potential is wasted. No attempt to raise standards will work if some groups, whether defined by race or gender, remain unaffected by them. The Ofsted report showed clearly that, on the whole, ethnic minority pupils are currently disadvantaged under our education system in various ways, especially Afro-Caribbean pupils whose standards of attainment seem to be well below other groups. Sadly, the report also showed that racial harassment continues in our schools as it does in wider society. It stated that some teachers, despite the best of intentions, continue to stereotype pupils on the basis of race.
<P>
The report made it clear that, through properly targeted activity, it is possible to raise standards in all groups including those who might be affected because of gender or race. I am sure that we are well aware of individual projects that have raised standards.
<P>
We know that the Minister is anxious to do something about under-achievement because of gender. On 5 January, he issued a press release under the heading ``Byers Outlines Coordinated Action to Tackle Boys' Underachievement''. The amendments make clear our anxiety to ensure that no group will fail to benefit from LEA education development plans or, in the case of amendment No. 101, education action zones.
<P>
The Government's response may be to claim that they have made clear their intention to act on matters relating to gender. They may say that, because they are continuing the work on race initiated by the previous Government, there is no need to include in the Bill the wording in the amendments. They may even suggest that the wording is inappropriate.
<P>
I ask the Under-Secretary to be aware, when she comes to respond, of the wording contained in the Ofsted inspection framework. She will find--I am sure that she has checked this--that the wording in the amendment is precisely the same as that in the Ofsted inspection framework. When LEAs are inspected, regard must be given to these very specific words. It is absolutely appropriate that the duty on the LEA should be described in the same words as are in the LEA inspection framework, so that the requirements on the LEA are parallel to those on the inspection of the LEA.
<P>
There is widespread support for those words to be included in the Bill from such important and influential groups as the Local Government Association, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, the 1990 Trust, the Runnymede Trust and the Commission for Racial Equality. Given that, I hope that the Under-Secretary will accept the amendments.
<P>
<B>Helen Jones </B>(Warrington, North): I shall try to keep my comments brief, as the amendments are specific. Labour Members have great sympathy with what the hon. Member for Bath is trying to achieve, but, as he suspected, we are unhappy with the wording of the amendments and would like the opportunity to consider the matter further.
<P>
I am sure that all members of the Committee would agree that ethnic minority pupils should have the same opportunities to profit from their education as everyone else has. We do not dispute the findings of the Ofsted report that many ethnic minority pupils are inherently disadvantaged and that there is much stereotyping of pupils in the education system. We also agree that under-achievement by boys needs to be tackled. We expect the educational development plans to deal with those problems as an important part of raising standards.
<P>
Conservative Members have criticised Labour Members for picking at technical flaws in amendments. As a nitpicking lawyer, I have to revert to type and say that the words in a Bill mean what they say and not what we would like them to say. We must be careful to get the wording right. As drafted, grammatically and legally, the amendment might prevent us from doing what the hon. Gentleman wants us to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Is the hon. Lady saying that the wording in the Ofsted framework for the inspection of schools is incorrect? Is she aware of what the Minister said in his press release on 5th January? He stated that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a co-ordinated approach to tackle the underachievement of boys|will include|a requirement that each local education authority in drawing up its Education Development Plan addresses the issues of boys' underachievement''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Helen Jones:</B> We are not quarrelling with Ofsted's words, but with their placing, and the difference in wording of primary legislation and advisory notes and so on.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the clause was amended, it would state that EDPs should set out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``proposals by the authority for developing their provision of education for children in their area, without undue variation by sex or race''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hate to cast aspersions on my former profession, but that could be construed as relating to variations in the provision of education rather than variations in the aims of EDPs. My great fear is that it could disallow the sort of positive proposals about which we are most concerned.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath is quite right to say that we must take account of that diversity and ensure that action is targeted where it is most needed. The amendment could prevent us from doing that. I fear also that drawing up the clause in that way would create a fundamental conflict, because an authority could equalise standards by lowering them. That is not what we want. I am sure that the hon. Member for Bath agrees that we should raise standards. We accept what the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve with the amendment, but we need to consider the precise wording.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way and I promise not to intervene again. If, on behalf of her Front Bench, the hon. Lady would give, me an assurance, we would not need to waste our time debating the precise wording. I am anxious for the Bill to contain the specific requirement that the EDPs deal with the question of race and gender. I do not wish to take up any more of the Committee's time, but I need to be assured that that is what she means.
<P>
<B>Helen Jones:</B> We want to consider the precise wording and we need to decide whether such a provision would be better placed in secondary legislation. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts our good intentions and will allow us to consider the matter further. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary may decide that we can return to the matter on Report. We are not opposed to what the hon. Member for Bath is trying to achieve, but we have grave doubts about the method by which he is trying to achieve it.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I am not prepared to accept the amendment, but I accept the principle entirely. I do not disagree with anything said by the hon. Member for Bath.
<P>
We are intent on raising standards for every child, which means specifically addressing those groups of young people where under-achievement is rife. Unless we address the needs and issues surrounding specific groups of people, we shall not enable individuals within the group to progress.
<P>
The best example of success is the improvement in girls' achievement levels over the past 10 to 15 years. Twenty years ago, we would have been debating the under-achievement of girls. Now, in almost every subject and at every age, the performance of girls has improved. I tend to think that the performance of boys has not fallen back; it simply has not progressed because people dealt with girls' needs and took action to raise their standards.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Bath accepts that our vision for the education service would enable every child's standard to be raised. It is true that certain individuals, because of gender or race, or because of where they happen to live, are far more likely to fail in society than to achieve. Indeed, unless we can do something to help those groups of children to realise their potential, so society can benefit from their skills, the Government's education policy would not be successful.
<P>
I shall do as much as I can to reassure the hon. Gentleman that in several different forums we are trying to ensure that the needs of those groups are specifically met.
<P>
I accept that there are problems with the wording of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones) referred to taking action that was designed to support those groups of children. I assure the hon. Member for Bath that we shall deal with the matter in the regulations and guidance that are issued to local authorities and others as part of the EDP. We received a letter from the Commission for Racial Equality asking us to incorporate such issues into either legislation or appropriate guidance. I am sure that the groups cited by the hon. Gentleman in support of the amendment would agree with such provisions being included in guidance.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I have a request to make of the Under-Secretary. I am grateful for what she said, but there is a distinction between guidance and a requirement. In his press release, the Minister said about variation by gender that there would be a ``requirement''. Can the hon. Lady explain how, if it is included in guidance, it would become a requirement?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> It will be a requirement for local education authorities to address in their education development plans how they will meet the need to raise standards for specific groups of young people. It will be considered by the Secretary of State when he approves or otherwise of the EDP.
<P>
The matter unites the hon. Member for Bath and the Government. How to raise the achievement levels of groups of people who have been denied the opportunity to achieve and to progress to other opportunities later in life is one of the biggest challenges facing this country. It is not easy, but we are determined to tackle the problem. As I said, we were successful with girls and, if progress can be made with that group of people, it can be made with others. Having received those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for her comments. She is right that this subject unites us. If such issues are not addressed, the fractious nature of our society will continue. We must find ways in which to develop a truly inclusive education system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> In the interests of making progress, I have not contributed to the debate. However, the hon. Gentleman was gracious enough in his introductory remarks to refer to the fact that the previous Government made progress on this subject. Although I do not entirely agree with the use of EDPs as the means of delivering the objective, it is an objective that the Opposition share.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful for the right hon. Gentleman's comments. It is a subject on which there is great unanimity.
<P>
In the light of the assurances that I have received from the Under-Secretary, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 128, in page 4, line 39, after `authority', insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and to the governing body of any independent school which is specified in the statement under subsection (2)(a).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> This is, in a sense, a maiden speech as I have not previously tabled an amendment in Committee. I hope that it will not be the last occasion that I do so--I am sure that Labour Members would be disappointed if it were. I do not expect the same concessions that I might receive when making a maiden speech in the Chamber, but I hope that my amendment is so uncontroversial that it draws support from all members of the Committee.
<P>
The comments of the Under-Secretary in respect of the previous amendment were welcome and they lead in neatly to what I shall say in support of amendment No. 128. The importance of raising standards for all children is something that we all accept, as we accept the importance of ensuring that education is provided for all groups in society. Given the broad acceptance of that theme when we discussed the previous amendment, it is essential that the Government are prepared to consult widely with groups that need proper provision made for them in the local education service. The consultation process to draw up the educational development plans should reflect the diversity of our country--the diversity of ethnic and religious groups--and the distinction between public and private provision. We have a rich diversity of educational provision, which I hope will become even richer and more diverse.
<P>
We have already touched on the importance of single-sex and sixth-form provision and the religious character of schools. To return to the principle behind the amendment, people have a right to be consulted on how education will be provided in their areas. The clause appears wrongly to exclude certain groups. I take it from the fact that the Government have tabled amendment No. 76 that they agree at least in part with that principle. However, by proposing that consultation should be extended to Roman Catholic and Church of England dioceses, the Government have not gone far enough. Consultation should include, in the words of amendment No. 128,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``promoters of local new schools''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and those who already provide education in the locality in the private sector.
<P>
It is clear from the Government's proposals for education action zones that they accept the role of private sector provision in the Bill. In areas such as my constituency, the private sector is an important part of the overall pattern of educational provision, especially in religious educational provision. While I accept that Government amendment No. 76 covers consultation with the dioceses, governors of independent schools should also be consulted. More than one diocese may be involved, as is the case in my area.
<P>
I do not intend to detain the Committee for long on the amendment, but it raises an important point of principle. The Government have commendably accepted recent applications for grant-maintained status from Islamic schools. The principles of openness and diversity in education reflected in that decision should be included in the Bill. The amendment would open the door to wider provision--not only to Islamic schools but to Jewish schools and to other private providers who may want to propose new types of school. It would be a welcome addition both to the Bill and to education provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I want to speak briefly to the amendments in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) explained the importance of writing into the Bill who will be the partners in consultation. The Committee will be aware that under the Bill one group is to be consulted--the governing body and head teachers--together with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such other persons as they consider appropriate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is important that we tease out from the Minister, through amendments such as these, what sorts of people and bodies he imagines would be considered suitable to be consulted.
<P>
I hope that the Minister has considered amendment No. 100. Although I am no supporter of grant-maintained schools, it appears strange that governing bodies and head teachers of maintained schools will be consulted, whereas there is no reference to head teachers of grant-maintained schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I had not intended to intervene in this debate. However, I want to stress the importance that I attach to the point that the hon. Gentleman is making about amendment No. 100. I imagine that there is a drafting mistake, so I hope that the Government will address what is an inequity in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I suspect that the Minister is likely to say that the composition of governing bodies of grant-maintained schools is slightly different from that of maintained schools. Notwithstanding his likely response, it is important that the head teacher, as a specific person, should be entitled to be consulted as an individual rather than as a member of the governing body. I hope that the Minister's response will be positive.
<P>
The other amendments that I tabled deal with those whom it is important to consider as partners in the process of developing the EDP. Those people are listed in amendment No. 9. I draw the Minister's attention to the importance that I attach to involving teachers as partners in drawing up the EDP. In doing so, I remind him that the Government are signed-up to the social partnership agreement that is part of the Maastricht treaty. That requires member countries to promote
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a dialogue between management and labour''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``information for and the consultation of workers''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would not necessarily have used that language, but the intention of the social partnership agreement is clear. It is vital to involve teachers in the consultations. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on those proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> On amendment No. 100, there is no specific reference to head teachers of grant-maintained schools for the reason, to which the hon. Member for Bath referred, that they are automatically members of the governing bodies of GM schools because of the way in which those bodies are constituted.
<P>
I shall take this opportunity to say, for the record, that head teachers should be consulted specifically as head teachers and that that applies to head teachers of GM schools as well as to those of other schools. Our interpretation of the clause, as drafted, is that head teachers will be consulted specifically as head teachers, even though they might be head teachers of GM schools--they are part of the governing body. Head teachers of GM schools will be consulted in their capacity as head teachers, not just as members of the governing body. That matter is dealt with both by the way in which the Bill is drafted and by that interpretation of it, which I give on behalf of the Government.
<P>
On the specific amendment by the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West--amendment No. 128--there is always a difficult decision to be taken on what statutory requirement for consultation should be defined in the Bill. We have decided--this is reflected in Government amendment No. 76--that we should consult those partners in the settlement under the Education Act 1944. I understand that nowadays society is different from that of 1944, so it might be argued that other groups should be involved. That is why we refer to the need to consult other groups when it is appropriate to do so. In some local authorities, it would be inappropriate to consult more widely because of the nature of the schools that they contain. Therefore, I shall resist amendment No. 128.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Although the Minister might not want include such consultation within the Bill, will he say whether, just as he apparently welcomes private sector involvement in education action zones, he welcomes private sector partnerships in other LEAs when that is appropriate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I have no doubt that LEAs will, as part of their education development plans, consult those bodies and organisations that they think appropriate. I should have thought that many authorities would think it wholly appropriate to consult the private sector in whatever form--perhaps chambers of commerce or regional offices of the Confederation of British Industry. That would be commendable, and I urge LEAs to do so. I think that most of them will do so without it being specified in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am concerned about the Minister's response to the amendment. He opposed it on the ground that it would not be appropriate, in some parts of the country, to consult Muslim or Jewish communities. However, the amendment does not list groups of people who should be consulted; it merely requires local authorities to consult those promoters of new schools that want to have an input. That principle was largely accepted in the case of the Islamia school, which the Government recently approved. As the clause stands, LEAs could, quite wrongly, exclude such schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The clause states that authorities shall consult
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such other persons as they consider appropriate''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If people feel that they have not been involved in the process, I am sure that they will make representations to the Secretary of State. He will reflect on that in considering approval, which may be made conditional on wider consultation. That is what happens in practice--it is a far better way of making progress.
<P>
Government amendment No. 76 is important, as it reinforces partnership with the Church authorities. It is wholly appropriate, and the omission of specific mention of those groups was an oversight.
<P>
My reply has been brief, as I know that the Committee wants to make progress. I hope that, given the catch-all provision in clause 6, the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West will feel able to withdraw the amendment. I ask the Committee to support Government amendment No. 76.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 76, in page 4, line 39, after `authority;' insert--

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No, 91, in page 4, line 40, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(6A) In the course of preparing an education development plan the authority shall agree targets with a school, to which the school shall have regard.'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 97, in page 4, line 40, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(6A) In the course of preparing an education development plan the authority shall have regard to the curriculum statement produced under sections 370 to 374 of the Education Act 1996.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 98, in schedule 29, page 215, leave out line 28.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Given the Committee's clear desire to make progress, I shall be very brief. Amendment No. 91 would give effect to what, just under an hour ago, the Minister said was his intention. In our lengthy discussion of Leafy Lane high school, he specifically said--as the record will show--that the LEA would be required to agree targets with that high school and other schools in its area. The amendment is common sense, as the Minister agreed, so I need not detain the Committee by pressing the argument further.
<P>
I must briefly mention amendments Nos. 97 and 98. One of the most surprising proposals for those of us who have looked through the minutiae of the Bill was the one in schedule 29, line 28 on page 215. It will repeal sections 370 to 374 of the Education Act 1996, which require LEAs to draw up a curriculum plan, which is an important part of the process of raising standards. Without a plan, it seems inconceivable that LEAs can fully carry out their role in the partnership with schools to raise standards.
<P>
Rather than repeal the measure, the amendments together would provide that the requirement that the LEA draws up a curriculum statement should continue, but that the curriculum statement should be integrated within the EDP. I am sure that both sides of the Committee would agree that is sensible. We look forward to the Minister's acceptance of all three amendments. We can then make rapid progress.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> Our progress may not be as rapid as the hon. Gentleman expects. My hon. Friend the Minister made it clear in an earlier debate that schools are responsible for raising standards; theirs is the primary responsibility. The problem with amendment No. 91 is that if the system is to work, schools must have ownership of their targets. It is good planning that they should be accountable for ensuring that the targets are reached. The Bill seeks accountability on inspection and performance, and it contains measures to ensure the publication of performance tables and results. We want to ensure accountability. The local authority's responsibility will be continually to challenge the schools to ensure that the targets are rigorous and sufficiently high. The amendment would take away from the schools the ownership of those school-based targets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Did the Under-Secretary, or did she not, hear her hon. Friend the Minister specifically say 55 minutes ago that LEAs would agree targets with their schools? Did she hear that--yes or no?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Obviously, I noted those few words. Yes, we hope that schools will set targets and that the LEAs will agree that they are sufficiently rigorous and challenging. If the schools succeed in their individual targets, the LEAs will succeed in their overall targets. Of course, we hope that that will happen.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath, however, talks in his amendment of the LEA agreeing targets with a school to which the school ``shall have regard''. Far more accountability is needed in the school-based targets than is implied in the amendment. It is crucial that the school must have ownership of those targets. The local authority's job is to make sure that those targets are challenging, and I am sure that in the vast majority of cases, if not all cases, agreement will be reached that the targets are sufficiently challenging.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am anxious to make progress. If the record shows that the Minister said the words that I believe he said, and if it was possible to delete the last few words of the amendment, which are:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to which the school shall have regard'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would the Under-Secretary agree to come back on Report with similar words, or words identical to the first two thirds of the amendment? If we can agree about that--it seems to be what the Under-Secretary is saying and what the Minister has already said--we can make rapid progress.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> The hon. Gentleman is optimistic about the ability to legislate for agreement. The reason why I will not accept the amendment is that the key to raising standards is that the school should have ownership of the targets. The record will show that my hon. Friend the Minister talked about challenging schools to set sufficiently demanding targets that the LEAs can agree. However, the key factor is that the targets are set by the schools; the schools own the targets and are responsible for their structure. Once we start allowing schools not to have ownership of their targets, their belief that the targets can be achieved will be diluted. Ownership is a key part of the target-setting process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do not propose to make a speech in the debate because I made it clear earlier that I disagree with the hon. Member for Bath on amendment No. 91. If it came to a Division, the Opposition would undoubtedly support the Government, because the Under-Secretary rightly said that schools must be responsible for their own targets. The problem, as we have seen throughout our debates this morning, is that it leaves a huge question mark over where the added value lies in the costs associated with the EDP.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> In my hon. Friend the Minster's description of Leafy Lane and Park View high schools, he made it clear that schools need to be challenged, otherwise complacency can set in. We have witnessed too much under-achievement in schools. Sometimes it is clear that schools are under-achieving and sometimes it is not. With such new measures as benchmarking, information can be supplied to schools so that they can judge their past performance against schools with similar intakes. That is crucial. I do not wish to accept amendment No. 91 because of the ownership of the targets. I am surprised that the hon. Members for Bath and for Harrogate and Knaresborough do not support that.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 97 and 98 are connected, so I shall respond to them together. They suggest that we restore the statutory requirement for local authorities to have a curriculum statement. They could have such a statement if they wished, but there is no compulsory requirement. As the right hon. Member for Charnwood will know, the curriculum statements pre-dated the national curriculum and my understanding is that they were transferred to the current legislation during the transitionary period of the national curriculum. We do not want to be overly bureaucratic and we do not want to require LEAs to prepare more paperwork than they need. We feel that what is set out in the national curriculum is sufficient. The hon. Member for Bath will also know that curriculum plans within local authorities vary tremendously; some are very thin, some very heavy. There is no evidence that the existence of compulsory plans did much to raise standards. They have been overtaken by the national curriculum. For that reason, and in the spirit of reducing unnecessary burdens on local authorities, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am disappointed, but not surprised, by the Under-Secretary's responses. They demonstrated the total lack of clarity in the Government's thinking on the relationship between schools and the LEA. The right hon. Member for Charnwood and I may disagree about the balance of functions between the LEA and the school, but we are at least united in our desire to press the Government to be clearer about their position. I listened with considerable interest to the Under-Secretary. My problem is that while it was logically consistent, it was inconsistent with what she and her hon. Friends have said on previous occasions.
<P>
I referred earlier to the White Paper. On page 26, it sets out clearly the role of the Government, LEAs and schools in relation to targets. The right hon. Member for Charnwood may not agree with the formulation that is specified there, but at least it states clearly that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Government sets national targets and publishes national performance and benchmark data.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Each LEA provides benchmarking data and guidance to all its schools to help them set targets''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Each school sets draft targets, taking account of the comparative data and their own previous best performance, for discussion with its LEA.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The next point is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Schools and LEAs agree targets, covering a 3-year period and subject to annual review.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister says that they might not always do so. The White Paper covers that, because the next point is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Where exceptionally an LEA cannot reach agreement with a school on its targets, the LEA may invoke the early warning system''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is described in subsequent paragraphs.
<P>
In the White Paper, the Government were clear about how the relationship between schools and the LEA was to work in regard to targets and other matters. In view of the Under-Secretary's response this morning, I am firmly convinced that that clarity has now gone out of the window. I hope that all members of the Committee will read very carefully the precise words of the Under-Secretary's hon. Friend the Minister just over an hour and five minutes ago in relation to that question. I am certain that the record will show that he specifically said that LEAs will agree targets with Leafy Lane high school and other schools in its areas. Because I believe there does need to be clarity on the issue, I am not prepared to withdraw the amendment.

Clause 6, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Approval, modification and review of statement of proposals</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 73, in page 5, leave out lines 28 to 45.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 74, in page 6, line 2, leave out from second `(b)' to end of line 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The clause is important. I regret that the Committee accepted clause 6. However, having done so, we must now consider the respective roles of the Secretary of State and the local education authority in the preparation and execution of the plans that we have been discussing. This morning's debate has demonstrated that it is extremely unclear as to where the responsibility for delivery of standards rests between the LEA and the school.
<P>
That has been an argument between the LEA and the school, but the clause would now nationalise the argument. Indeed, that is a move that the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) might welcome with the enthusiasm with which he welcomed the prospect of the nationalisation of the channel tunnel rail link last night.
<P>
We have heard several speeches from the Government Front Bench about the role that the LEA can play in delivering standards. However, clause 7 makes it clear that the Government do not believe that the LEA will deliver the standards. Despite the history of accountable elected local education authorities that have been in the school service since 1944, the clause will give powers to the Secretary of State for Education and Employment that are similar to the powers of the Secretary of State for Health over the national health service. The national health service, however, does not have elected local health authorities, but health authorities that are appointed by the Secretary of State.
<P>
There is no argument in the health service about who is responsible. The Secretary of State is accountable to Parliament and the executive functions are held by locally appointed health authorities that are accountable to the Secretary of State. Accountability is clear. The problem with the clause is that it leaves it extremely unclear as to whether accountability in the schools service rests with the elected LEA or with the Secretary of State.
<P>
I do not normally read clauses to Committees, because most clauses are a pretty dry read, but it is worth reflecting on some passages of the clause. The Secretary of State is given the power to approve the statement, to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``require the authority to make such modifications to the statement as he may specify''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or to reject the statement. Once the plan is approved, the clause gives the Secretary of State power to keep the execution of that plan by an authority under review. If he concludes that he was wrong to accept the plan, he can change his mind and withdraw approval. The most extreme provision of the clause is that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``where he is of the opinion that the authority's proposals are not being properly implemented by them, he may withdraw his approval''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Not only is the Secretary of State responsible for approving the plan and given the power to require changes to it; he is given the duty to monitor the execution of the plan by LEAs week by week and month by month and, if he is not satisfied with its execution, the power to intervene in the local education authority's affairs.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 73 is to invite the Committee to consider two propositions separately. It is one thing for the Secretary of State to have the power to approve a plan or to require it to be amended; it is something quite different to give him the power to monitor the delivery of a service by a local education authority on a day-to-day basis. I have not studied the NHS legislation, but such a power may even be in excess of that which the Secretary of State for Health has over the delivery of the national health service.
<P>
Amendment No. 73 would remove the power to monitor delivery of the service and confine the Secretary of State to agreeing the outline of the plan. I invite the Committee to agree to the amendment, so that we can look separately at the question of whether the Secretary of State should have the power to require modification of the plan proposed by the local education authority.
<P>
Amendment No. 74 concerns an extraordinary power accorded to the Secretary of State. Under clause 7(7), if a Secretary of State rejects an EDP, a revised EDP shall be drawn up under the provisions of clause 6. However, the Secretary of State is given the power completely to rewrite that clause, to which we have just agreed. Subsection (7) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Section 6 shall apply to the preparation of a revised statement . . . with such modifications (if any) as the Secretary of State may determine.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What is the point of the Committee agreeing a phrase in the Bill that gives the Secretary of State the power to rewrite a whole clause that we have just spent just over two hours considering this morning? That is what subsection (7) gives the Secretary of State the power to do if he has rejected a plan drawn up under the terms of clause 6.
<P>
The Government are seeking extraordinary powers. We should certainly not accord them those powers in their current form.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I do not want to add a great deal to what my right hon. Friend has said, because I want to hear some answers from the Minister. I regret that I did not receive answers on special educational needs and the role of residential care, but I hope that I will on this important issue.
<P>
Unless the amendment is accepted, it will be difficult for an LEA to involve the private sector in any form of partnership. The Secretary of State will be able to say that he does not like an agreement between the LEA and the private sector and require the LEA to undo it.
<P>
If the Under-Secretary of State is sincere in wanting partnerships between the private sector and LEAs, she should spell out her attitude towards them. Does she agree that, if an LEA has entered into a contract with the private sector in good faith, the Secretary of State cannot reasonably intervene, using the powers in the clause, to break that agreement?

<P>

<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> First, I assure the hon. Gentleman that details of any arrangements between an LEA and the private sector would not be in the EDP. The EDP will outline the LEA's plans to raise standards and the targets it is aiming for.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am sorry, but I fail to understand that. As the Under-Secretary says, the EDP is about raising standards. The Government have cut the allocation to the local authority in my area by &#163;2 million next year for nought to four-year-olds, so it will be difficult to raise standards if we cannot involve, in some shape or form, the private sector. I can envisage how the private sector could become involved in the implementation of the ambitious EDP that will be required to meet the targets that the Government have set, but the Government are asking us to raise our standards while the money that is given to us is being cut.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> It will be decided locally how to deliver the targets that are part of the EDP. That level of detail will not be in the EDP. The main body of the plan will be the targets that are set, which is what the Secretary of State will want to approve. The hon. Gentleman need have no fear about that and I hope that I have reassured him.
<P>
The starting point is that, sadly, some schools are underperforming. We need to take steps to ensure that those schools realise in what ways they are underperforming; they must set targets for improvement and be held accountable for them. Some LEAs also underperform and do not offer a good deal to the children who attend their schools. We have shown that where that happens, as in Hackney, we shall take steps to ensure that standards are raised.
<P>
We do not want matters to be left to the point at which a local authority is failing its children before action is taken to help it raise standards in its schools. The benefit of having EDPs is that they allow LEA targets to be put in the public domain. It is right that the Secretary of State should have powers to ensure that EDPs are sufficiently challenging and fit in with the Government's overall policies.
<P>
As to amendment No. 74, EDPs may need to be modified while they are in effect. During what is essentially a three-year plan, it could be the case that the targets are not being met or that provisions are not being carried out. It is right that the Secretary of State should have the power to look at an EDP again; no time must be wasted in ensuring that the LEA sets targets and takes action to deliver them. LEAs expect that of schools and we need to expect the same of LEAs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The question that the Under-Secretary must answer is to whom schools, as part of the public sector, are ultimately accountable. Does accountability rest with the LEA or is the whole education system a nationalised service in which accountability rests with the Secretary of State? If the former is the case, the Secretary of State's powers would be illegitimate. If the latter is the case, why elect authorities, which are part of a direct line of accountability to the Secretary of State? Where does accountability rest?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Accountability rests with many different people--
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell rose --</B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> No, I want to answer the question. This is an important point; it is what we disagree with right hon. Gentleman about in our approach to how to raise standards. Schools are accountable to their governing bodies and to their parents. There are many lines of accountability, but, essentially, all those involved--the schools, the local authorities and the Department--are part of an education service. Standards will not rise unless all members of that education service--whether it be the Secretary of State, or teachers in their first year of teaching--play their parts in the common agenda of raising standards. The EDP represents a vehicle to ensure that all those in the service can play their part in what I am sure the right hon. Gentleman agrees is essentially a national agenda to increase our children's standards.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The idea that accountability can be diffused in the way that the Minister described is, frankly, a recipe for shifting blame so that no one carries the can. Whitehall has always been structured so that Ministers are accountable to Parliament for the delivery of the service and the accounting officer is responsible, through the civil service line, for the probity of expenditure. The Minister has described the introduction into the school system of what she said were several different elements of responsibility. When responsibility and accountability are diffuse in the way that she describes, no one carries the can. Who carries the can?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We all do.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> As my hon. Friend said from a sedentary position, we all do--we are all part of the service. In the first few months of this Government, the Department has taken more measures to make clear its accountability in the mission to raise standards than the right hon. Gentleman's Government ever did. We have made it clear that if we do not reach our national targets, we, too, will have failed. That is the core of the difference between us. It is too easy in the model that the right hon. Gentleman has described to blame others for failing to raise standards.
<P>
We are trying to produce a change in the culture so that everyone in the education services accepts some responsibility for ensuring that standards are increased. There is more openness--targets and EDPs are in the public domain. Parents can see what targets the LEA has set for their school and, therefore, their children. It is our responsibility to ensure that targets have been set within the EDP. That is crucial to the EDP; it is essentially what it is. We must ensure that those targets are sufficiently demanding. If we do not do that, we shall let down children and their parents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I want one more go at this. Let us suppose that, when the local elections are fought, all the evidence shows that the outcome of an election was determined quite differently from all the surrounding local elections--education being the key issue that determined which way the votes were cast. Let us further suppose that the Secretary of State disagreed with the conclusion that the electorate had reached in that local election process. The clause will give the Secretary of State the power simply to sweep aside the decision that, on any analysis, the local electorate had taken. That would undermine accountability. I think that I have correctly described the position, but does the Under-Secretary feel comfortable with it?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> That situation would not arise. The EDP is about setting targets. I cannot envisage circumstances in which a party would win power in a local authority on a manifesto either of refusing to set targets or of setting targets that are too low. Targets will be set in the EDP for the school and the local authority. That is crucial. The Government have a responsibility to ensure that those targets are sufficiently rigorous. If not, we will have under-achieving schools in under-achieving local authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Blizzard </B>(Waveney): Does my hon. Friend agree that if, for example, a local education authority fell into the hands of a rabid right-wing set of councillors--[Interruption.] It might happen as a result of a by-election. The council might, as a result, completely ignore the targets set by the LEA and approved by the Secretary of State. Surely, parents would expect the Secretary of State to take swift action; rather than wait for three or four years until the next election, they would want him to vote out such extreme and unacceptable measures. That is why reserve powers are needed.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Parents would be appalled if that was the case. When moving amendment No. 99--he later withdrew it--the hon. Member for Bath spoke about the underperformance of boys and children from certain ethnic groups. It could be that performance was not addressed during that three-year period or even that the performance of those groups had fallen further. Under those circumstances, it would be entirely reasonable for parents to want the Secretary of State to have another look at the plan and ask for modifications to be made.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> This issue is at the heart of the balance of responsibilities between elected Members of Parliament and locally elected councillors. The Under-Secretary has not adequately addressed the issue, which is that locally elected councillors on a local education authority are responsible for the provision of education in that local education authority area. The Government are saying that the Secretary of State can cast aside decisions taken by democratically elected local councillors, saying that they have got it wrong. But the Secretary of State may get it wrong.
<P>
With due respect, the argument is not just about targets. If it were, I suggest that the Under-Secretary should herself have tabled amendments to clause 6. We are talking about the provision of education in a local education authority area, not simply about targets. The locally elected councillors have a responsibility in that matter, and the Government seem to have set it aside.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> If a local authority were letting down children, the parents would expect the Secretary of State to take action. In the past, there has not been enough accountability. The various members of the education service have not had sufficient power to prevent underperformance, and we shall not be able to raise standards unless everyone in the service is able to play their part. As for EDPs, the Secretary of State's part is to approve them and, if necessary, to seek modifications.
<P>
We have had a full debate. It is crucial that the Secretary of State has those powers, both in the initial consideration of EDPs and while the EDPs are being carried out, to ensure that the targets are being reached. I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn. If not, I invite the Committee to reject it.
