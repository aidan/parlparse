Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): It is a pleasure to be back here this afternoon under
your chairmanship, Mr. Hood. I shall pick up where I left
off in moving new clause 16. Ministers have previously suggested that
they have no plans to make local housing allowance available to
existing housing benefit claimants, but that position will be reviewed
after a two-year period. I have expressed several concerns, not least
the risk that landlords will seek to evict their existing tenants to
let to new tenants at a higher rate, if local housing allowance happens
to be at a higher rate. Local citizens advice bureaux have reported
many cases of landlords increasing their rent to local housing
allowance level.</div><a name="061128121000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems not impossible, although I am not a fortune teller, that
landlords will respond similarly in the national roll-out and will not
necessarily distinguish, in their rent-setting behaviour, between
tenants whose housing benefit is assessed under the existing rules and
those whose housing benefit is assessed under the local housing
allowance rules. That could leave some tenants at a disadvantage. One
can envisage a situation in which some landlords would be pushing rents
up towards the local housing allowance level, causing shortfalls,
potentially, among the tenants who were in receipt of existing housing
benefits.</div> <a name="061128121000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause, as I said earlier when probing the Government&#146;s
intentions, would address the problems by allowing existing claimants
to choose whether to transfer on to local housing allowance, or, at any
rate, by giving the Secretary of State powers to make regulations to
allow that to happen. Such an approach would be consistent with another
of the Government&#146;s priorities for the local housing allowance,
which was, after all, to promote choice, in terms of shopping around
with benefits and local housing allowance. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column523" />Column number: 524</div>In addition, such an approach could perhaps ease acceptance
among claimants of some of the changes, because it would allow them
greater choice.</div>
<a name="061128121000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000350"></a>The
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform (Mr. Jim
Murphy):</b> It is a particular delight to welcome you,
Mr. Hood, to the Chair in our third from final sitting of
the Committee, where, as the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds said, we
have had particular consensus about important principles. He of course
alluded to the lack of such consensus yesterday in the Chamber<i class="I">.
[Interruption.]</i> That demonstrates again once and for all that there
are
substantial&#151;</div><a name="061128121000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000351"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I feel obliged to remind Opposition as
much as Government Members that we expect better order in this
Committee.</div><a name="061128121000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000352"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> You are right, Mr. Hood, because that
behaviour was worse than anything in the Chamber yesterday.
Nevertheless, the level of disagreement yesterday demonstrates that
there are substantial policy and priority differences between the two
major parties, particularly about poverty and child poverty. The Bill
is an important contribution in that area; I remind hon. Members that
one in six of current incapacity benefit customers has a dependent
child and the Bill would make a substantial impact on the child poverty
measurement.</div><a name="061128121000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
acknowledge the comments on new clause 40 made by the hon. Member for
Daventry in the debate on new clause 38. I thank him for giving us
advance notice of his questions and comments in that
way.</div>
<a name="061128121000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="061128121000353"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): For the avoidance of doubt,
or perhaps to avoid concern on the part of the Committee, I think that
the Minister means clauses 38 and 40&#151;not new clauses. Fertile we
may be on these Benches; disrespectful and even stroppy we may be from
time to time. Nevertheless, our book does not run to creating 38 new
clauses, although, if tempted, we might be inclined to add to their
number.</div><a name="061128121000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000354"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> As is often the case, the hon. Member for Daventry
is entirely right. Of course, it was clause 38 rather than new clause
38. I was going on to compliment the hon. Gentleman, but I do not know
whether I should do so now. It is a matter of public record that he has
chosen to serve his remaining time in Parliament on the Back Benches,
and we have seen over the years that he has been a free thinker on the
Front Benches as often as one can be. We look forward to his continuing
contributions from the Back Benches. He is someone to whom
compassionate Conservatism came naturally over the years, whereas for
others, it seems that that is not their mother tongue. However, the
hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds has done very well thus far in
convincing the Committee that it is indeed his second
language.</div> <a name="061128121000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
the points made by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey. The tone in which he offered his comments suggests that it
was a probing new clause. As he rightly said, we intend to begin by
rolling out local housing allowance only to new claimants and to those
existing claimants who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column524" />Column number: 525</div>move house. Although that is different from the approach taken in
pathfinders, there are good reasons for doing it.</div>
<a name="061128121000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Under-Secretary of State
for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling
(Mrs. McGuire)&#151;I take a temporary foray into her area
of expertise in local housing allowance&#151;has commented before on
the matter. The evaluation reports have made clear the importance of
effective and targeted communication and support. Although some
customers will be able to handle the transition to manage their own
benefits effortlessly, there will, of course, be others who need more
help and support. That is an important lesson learned from the pilot
tests held across the country. At national roll-out, we think that it
will be important to target support where it is most needed, rolling
out new claims only, to allow us and local authorities to concentrate
our resources and efforts on that target group.</div>
<a name="061128121000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the other hand, extending
the provisions to all&#151;new and existing&#151;claimants from day
one would dilute the available support, and would not enable such a
controlled implementation, which I know that all members of the
Committee would wish to see. As noted during our earlier discussions, a
smooth implementation will in part depend on the success of local
authority IT systems.</div>
<a name="061128121000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">As noted in the 15th monthly
operational report, which I am sure the hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey has in his folder and would be able to
quote from in some detail, a number of local authorities experienced
technical problems in re-assessing awards on the anniversary. Brighton
and Hove was the first big bang authority to do that, and its impact
was underestimated. It was, as one interviewee put it, &#147;almost
like starting again.&#148; That contrasts with those authorities that
phased in the introduction: there, the annual assessment of awards
presented no problems.</div>
<a name="061128121000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, careful
consideration was given to the Green Paper respondents&#146; views on
the issue. Although some stakeholders were concerned about the
potential administrative complexity, others were keen to see the
gradual implementation that we envisaged in the Bill. For example, the
National Housing Federation supported that approach. The Chartered
Institute of Housing strongly supported the phased approach to
implementation, recognised the importance of doing the groundwork
before roll-out, and appreciated the potential risks posed by such a
large-scale change for 408 separate local authorities.</div>
<a name="061128121000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I can also
reassure the hon. Gentleman about his fear of landlords&#146;
behaviour about eviction of
customers.</div><a name="061128121000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000355"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> Before the Minister moves on from his point
about learning from the pilot experiences, he has quite rightly talked
about the benefits of the phased approach. However, as I understand it,
the approach now proposed by the Government is different from the
phased approach that took place in the pilots. That approach
transferred people from the old benefit to the new benefit at the time
when their benefit claim was reviewed or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column525" />Column number: 526</div>re-assessed, whereas what the Government are talking about in this case
is not transferring people even at that assessment period for a period
of at least two years.</div>
<a name="061128121000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000356"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I want to say a few words, if the hon. Gentleman
will allow me. Six out of the nine pathfinder local authorities chose
the phased approach, so the principle of the phased approach is well
established. Of course, the way in which that phase-in works has been
changed as we look towards national roll-out, but the principle of
phased introduction is well established in two thirds of the pathfinder
local authorities that were involved in the pilots.</div>
<a name="061128121000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have already said,
offering such technical detailed advice to our customers has been a
great learning experience and it has empowered them to make the
transfer from housing benefit to local housing allowance. As well as
learning from that experience we are seeking to ensure that the various
resources for advice&#151;including the civil service, local
authority advisers and welfare rights officers&#151;can support
customers in the way that we envisage by means of the phasing that is
set out in the
Bill.</div><a name="061128121000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey mentioned a reasonable
concern about landlords&#151;a concern that others may have, too. The
lessons of the pathfinders programme should be considered, however,
because there is no evidence from that programme of such behaviour by
landlords. Despite that, there will be a continuing closely examined
review of local housing allowance during a two-year period, and as the
national roll-out is implemented the concern that he has mentioned will
be a factor in assessing its
effectiveness.</div><a name="061128121000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
recognise the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern that local authorities
will be required for a period to operate two separate, parallel
schemes. As he said, existing housing benefit arrangements will need to
run alongside local housing allowance. He was also concerned about
existing customers being denied access, and about the number of people
who will not be transferred to local housing allowance. Let me share
with him some of our assessments of the likely turnover numbers. The
turnover rate in the private sector is naturally very high, as he is
aware. We estimate that within a three-year period only 20 to 25 per
cent. of customers in the deregulated private rented sector will remain
on housing benefit. The rest will have moved on to local housing
allowance or off housing benefit altogether. That is, three quarters
will be transferred over to local housing allowance or will not be on
the benefit at
all.</div><a name="061128121000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have already alluded to our plans to review the impact of local housing
allowance after the first two years. One of the main aims of that
review will be to consider options for transferring housing benefit
customers in the private sector to local housing allowance if, at that
time, such a step is considered necessary. We therefore believe that
our approach will allow us to extend the benefits of LHA to all, at the
earliest opportunity, while managing the risks inherent in such a
fundamental and wide-ranging change in the benefits system&#151;a
system that is administered by 408 separate local authorities. I hope
that that reassures the hon. Gentleman sufficiently for him to
withdraw the motion.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000357"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful for that response. I am not sure
that the Minister has answered all my concerns in detail, but I hope
that that will be addressed as the Bill goes through another place. In

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000358"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="061128121000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
relates to the process by which overpayments of housing benefit are
legally recoverable. The Committee will know that, under the current
housing benefit regulations, all overpayments are recoverable unless
three conditions are satisfied: that overpayment was caused by official
error; that the claimant did not cause that error; and that the
claimant could not reasonably have realised that an overpayment had
been made.</div><a name="061128121000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause probes the Government&#146;s thinking on how to deal with
overpayments of housing benefit. The test that I have
described&#151;in particular the third element&#151;is harsher than
that for other Department for Work and Pensions benefits. As I
understand it&#151;I am sure that the Minister will correct me if I
am wrong&#151;the tests for those benefits do not include the third
element. The new clause probes whether that additional third hurdle is
reasonable.</div><a name="061128121000321"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="061128121000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once again, I
am indebted to Citizens Advice and Shelter for some useful briefings.
Perhaps I should have stated earlier that I am vice-chair of the
all-party group on citizens advice. I am not sure if that counts as an
interest, but it certainly makes me interested. <i class="I">[Interruption.]
</i>I would not go too far. Citizens advice bureaux report regularly
their concerns that overpayments are being recovered despite the fact
that claimants have promptly and correctly reported their full
circumstances and the overpayment is due to an official error or
failure to act promptly on information provided by claimants in a
timely, correct and appropriate way.</div>
<a name="061128121000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Failure to recover
overpayments has an impacton local authorities&#146;
performance targets so theyare reluctant&#151;perhaps
understandably&#151;to use their discretion not to recover the money.
In some cases, the resultant debt caused by somebody realising that
there has been an overpayment that must be repaid, much like the
problems in the tax credit system, puts a major strain on the household
budget of the claimant, who by definition of the fact that they are in
receipt of housing benefit is on a low income.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column527" />Column number: 528</div><a name="061128121000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where the claimant already has
a suspended possession order against them and is repaying rent arrears,
for example, on a set rate over a set time, the additional burden of
repaying a housing benefit overpayment can easily tip them into
breaching an order and facing eviction. The consequences of asking
people to repay overpayments in circumstances in which they have done
everything right except understand the rather byzantine and complex way
in which housing benefit calculations are made can be serious, and in
some cases cause severe hardship to claimants. In that shared spirit of
concern about those in such circumstances, I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="061128121000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many
cases, it seems that the root of the problem is the regulation that
allows the recovery of overpayments even in cases of administrative
error, if the person ought reasonably to have known that they were
being overpaid. It is worthy of the Committee&#146;s consideration
that the complexity of the housing benefit regulations, the scheme and
scheme application process means that collecting overpayments on those
grounds could in some case be unreasonable. I hope that the Minister
will respond to that point in his reply to this short
debate.</div><a name="061128121000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">A further
issue is that sometimes, in cases in which repayment is demanded even
when someone has done everything that could possibly have been expected
of them, bar understanding the complex procedures that would have been
necessary for them to have realised that they were being overpaid,
claimants do not seek advice and simply accept the overpayment recovery
as inevitable and pay up. I am sure that many hon. Members in this
Committee will have had that experience, not least in connection with
tax credits, but I am sure in connection with other benefits as well.
Those people have to cope with the consequences, which are likely to be
long-term rent arrears threatening their housing security and living
standards. As a result, they are more likely to get into debt in other
areas. I know that the Minister is rightly concerned about child
poverty. He will be aware of the impact that such long-term financial
considerations can have on child poverty and I hope that he will look
at the new clause in that
light.</div><a name="061128121000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">In his
response, I would like the Minister to address the contention that, in
the cause of fairness and benefits simplification, which we have been
discussing, the housing benefits rules should be aligned with those of
other means-tested benefits by removing from the provisions the words
&#147;reasonably have been expected&#148; to realise, so that
overpayments are recoverable only if the claimant has failed to
disclose or misrepresented a material fact. Running through the Bill is
the underlying principle of responsibility and we have debated during
earlier clauses the idea of reciprocal responsibility. It is quite
right that the claimants should have responsibilities&#151;indeed,
local housing allowance in particular will increase those
responsibilities by giving claimants responsibility for paying rent
themselves&#151;but surely authorities have responsibilities too.
Local authorities have a responsibility when they have made an error
not caused by the claimant. Surely they should accept that rather than
expect repayment to be made in all such circumstances. I look forward
to the Minister&#146;s response.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000359"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I need make only a brief contribution. I
sympathise very much with the spirit of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
comments in moving the new clause. As a matter of what might
be termed judicial reasonableness, Ministers are at least obliged to
share with the Committee why the hurdles should be set slightly
differently for housing benefit than for other benefits. That is not
just some sort of lawyer&#146;s quibble; it is a substantive
issue.</div> <a name="061128121000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that to the extent to which something is obviously wrong, there is an
obligation on the citizen to do something about it. I will share with
the Committee an experience from my association with a not-for-profit
organisation. We recently received a cheque for a six-figure sum from
the Department for Work and Pensions. As it was mentioned to me by the
treasurer, I had the opportunity to draw it to the attention of the
Secretary of State&#151;who I hope did not pocket the
amount&#151;and we got it back to the right place. It is perfectly
reasonable when dealing with such people&#151;the turnover of the
organisation was rather less than &#163;10,000 a year&#151;to say,
&#147;Something has gone wrong, and we really ought to do something
about it.&#148; We can be good-natured about that.</div>
<a name="061128121000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must admit to the Minister
of State that I do not always agree with him on political issues, but I
agree that I might have been a little sharper in my exchanges yesterday
with his colleague the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions,
the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington, on official error. I was
somewhat surprised by his colleague&#146;s assertion that only a
quarter of overpayments related to official error rather than client or
customer error. We will not debate that at length now, but the fact is
that a significant number do arise from official error&#151;too many
for comfort. That is partly a function of the benefits system, and it
is important that we should get to the bottom of it, see why it happens
and get it rectified, which is the most important thing.</div>
<a name="061128121000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our constituents who might
claim, even more than some of us, to know a little bit about this
complex system, are not expected to sit an exam on the details of the
benefits system. They also have a perfectly natural predisposition to
say that if the calculation is an official calculation it is likely to
be right. I am not talking about people getting a cheque for
&#163;250,000 in the post as their housing benefit; I am talking
about comparatively minor overpayments that are not easily
spottable.</div><a name="061128121000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="061128121000360"></a><b class="B">Adam
Afriyie</b> (Windsor) (Con): I am sure that my hon. Friend is
aware that people with dyslexia or learning difficulties have great
trouble reading multi-page forms and letters on benefits from local
authorities and central Government. That exacerbates the
issue.</div><a name="061128121000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000361"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I entirely agree. My wife used to be an adult
literacy practitioner, and my hon. Friend accurately reports the
experience of many people in that
position.</div><a name="061128121000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the
Minister of State to reflect on one further point. I do not know the
answer; I raise it in a spirit of inquiry. We had a little fun
yesterday about the error taskforce. The error taskforce has an
important job to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column529" />Column number: 530</div>carry out, and I would like it to do so properly and be resourced to do
so. I am not entirely clear whether its remit extends directly or
indirectly to local authorities&#146; performance in overpayments of
housing benefit. Administration of housing benefit is a function
derived from statute but devolved by the Secretary of State to them as
local housing authorities. It would make a lot of sense, given that it
is for all practical purposes a social security benefit, if the error
taskforce were able to investigate local authorities to see, for
example, whether there are significant differences in performance
between the 408 local authorities, as I suspect there are, or between
the local authorities system and what one might call the central
benefits system.</div><a name="061128121000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
in this Committee have a common interest in trying to get the regime
right, minimising errors at source and being fair to citizens if an
error occurs. Trying to tease out the right balance in doing so is the
spirit of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s new clause, and I hope that the
Minister will reply accordingly.</div>
<a name="061128121000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000362"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey was right to pay his compliments to Citizens Advice. Hon.
Members on both sides of the House will likewise pay tribute to
Citizens Advice nationally, and, more importantly, at local level for
its phenomenal work in supporting people in communities throughout the
length and breadth of the United Kingdom, not least in my constituency
where a fantastic woman called Teresa O&#146;Hara manages the
citizens advice bureau in Barrhead to great
effect.</div><a name="061128121000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman said that in tabling his probing new clause, he was motivated
to make non-recoverable those overpayments in housing benefit and
council tax benefit caused by DWP official error. I say first that the
Government were minded to treat that type of overpayment in the way
envisaged in the new clause. An addition to primary legislation would
not be necessary, as current powers mean that the Secretary of State
could do that by way of regulations if he were so minded. However, the
Government do not intend to do that; all types of housing benefit and
council tax benefit overpayments are recoverable from the customer,
including those caused by DWP, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and
Customs, and the local authority
itself.</div><a name="061128121000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">That type of
overpayment can be recovered only if the customer could reasonably have
been expected to realise that they were being overpaid. Only then
should recovery be pursued. If that were not the case, people would be
allowed to keep taxpayers&#146; money when they knew they were being
overpaid. That is not reasonable, and I do not believe any hon. Member
would consider that to be a reasonable way for a Government to behave.
If we were to try to convince the Committee that it was reasonable, I
suspect that a series of alternative amendments would be tabled, quite
fairly, to say that it was
not.</div><a name="061128121000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000363"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> We all understand the outlying case, such as the
one I cited, half in jest, about a six-figure overpayment. The
insidious and difficult case is one in which the citizen or claimant is
receiving slightly more than they should, so there is a grey area as to
whether 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column530" />Column number: 531</div>they, a non-expert on the social security system, thought, &#147;Well,
that is a bit more than I was expecting, but if that is what they sent
me they must be right.&#148; That is different from a grossly obvious
overpayment. It is easier to see that something is wrong if the
overpayment is a thousand quid a week than if it is a tenner a
week.</div>
<a name="061128121000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000364"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, which is
why the customer has the right to appeal against the decision to
recover overpayment. That is the important protection within the
system.</div> <a name="061128121000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The DWP
seeks repayment of overpayments under common law. Housing benefit and
council tax benefit are treated as they are in terms of the recovery of
overpayment primarily because the customer would be expected to know
their rent level and their council tax liability, so the types of wild
fluctuation that the hon. Member for Daventry reasonably raised would
be easily identifiable within a housing or council tax benefit
payment.</div> <a name="061128121000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
that reassures hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. We know
from constituency case work&#151;the letters we receive from
constituents and the people who attend our surgeries&#151;that the
matter causes frustration and worry. That is why the balance of the
challenge is on reasonable expectations, and why people have the right
to appeal against a decision. We must also ensure that recovery
measures are implemented sensitively, so that the customer&#151;the
citizen&#151;can afford the repayment from their remaining income.
That is important, particularly in the context of child poverty and
family poverty in general. Although it might not have a dramatic impact
on the 60 per cent. median income measure of relative poverty, it will
have an acute impact at a local level on material and absolute poverty.
We should not lose sight of that as we roll out the local housing
allowance and try to get the system absolutely
right.</div><a name="061128121000322"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000365"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> Probably the nub of the debate is the meaning
of the word &#147;reasonable&#148;; perhaps it always was. The way
in which the Minister described the meaning of the word was reasonable,
and I think that all members of the Committee would agree with it. My
concern was that in some specific cases the implementation on the
ground is not as reasonable as the Minister described. I am reassured
by his remarks, but I hope that he will monitor carefully the local
implementation of the provisions to ensure that the reasonableness
provision is not used, contrary the intentions behind it, to require
claimants to have a level of knowledge and understanding of the benefit
system that might only be held by a few academics, and perhaps not even
to members of the Committee. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="061128121000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000367"></a>The

information&#146;.</div><a name="061128121000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000368"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I shall be brief. There are broader issues,
some of which were raised earlier by the hon. Member for Daventry, that
we might consider in a clause stand part debate.</div>
<a name="061128121000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would exclude
medical information from the information that can be shared under
clauses 40 and 41. The reason is pretty simple and straightforward: as
I hope all members of the Committee agree, medical information is
particularly personal and is, with good reason, subject to a great
degree of confidentiality in the medical system. Without such an
exclusion, there is a risk that medical information about claimants
could float around the system, being passed back and forth between
agencies. That could include potentially sensitive, personal medical
information. Is there not a risk that relatives or other people known
to a claimant could get access to their medical information through the
mechanism in the clauses? It is an important principle that medical
information about an individual should be subject to very high
standards of confidentiality and of appropriateness before being shared
with any other agency. I hope that the Minister can allay my
concern.</div><a name="061128121000085"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000369"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Again, I find myself much in sympathy with the
hon. Gentleman. His remarks are of course consistent with what I said
earlier. Does he agree that the important principle is that of consent?
I believe that one of his amendments to a later clause confirms that he
does. The consent of the client should be obtained before information
is released to others, particularly if it is of the highly sensitive
nature that the hon. Gentleman
describes.</div><a name="061128121000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000370"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. As the
hon. Gentleman says, an amendment I tabled to a later clause refers
explicitly not only to consent but to informing someone when
information has been shared. That is an important principle and applies
even more strongly to medical information than to almost any other
category of information that we might debate under the
clause.</div> <a name="061128121000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point is
plain, and I hope that the Minister will reassure us, ideally by
accepting the amendments, which would improve the Bill no end, if I may
say so. If he feels unable to do that, I hope that he will at least
give the Committee an undertaking to reflect further on how explicit
protection for medical information can be put into the Bill within the
provisions on information sharing for social
security.</div><a name="061128121000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000371"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> I shall be brief. First, could the Minister say
what role, if any, the Data Protection Act 1998 plays in relation to
the exchange of such information between the DWP and, as subsequent
clauses will show us, other local authorities and county
councils?</div> <a name="061128121000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
I assume that most of the data exchange will take place primarily on
computer systems, although I suspect a large degree will be on physical

<div class="Column"><a name="Column532" />Column number: 533</div>paperwork. Can the Minister give us some reassurance that the IT systems
in use, or those that will be used, are able to protect certain
categories of information from general viewing by all people who can
access those systems?</div>
<a name="061128121000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">My primary reason for speaking
to the amendment is directly linked to my concern that relatives or
associates of the claimants and customers who have their medical
information on the system might be able to see their details. That
might be a former partner, or a close or distant relative of the
individual in question. The idea that their medical records&#151;or
medical data exchanged between authorities&#151;are freely available
to somebody with a clear right to access the system, and a need to
access it in exercising their functions, means that there is a deep
concern about the potentially detrimental impact on that
person&#146;s privacy and relationships, and perhaps even on their
family situation.</div>
<a name="061128121000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000372"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I am pleased to have the chance to respond to this
brief debate. I absolutely agree with the hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey that we need very high standards of
protection. I assure him that that is what we seek to do through the
Bill. He put it colloquially, but that I do not think that accepting
his amendments would improve the Bill no end.</div>
<a name="061128121000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Members for Daventry
and for Windsor made some entirely reasonable points. I confirm to them
and to the rest of the Committee that section 123 of the Social
Security Administration Act 1992 provides that it is a criminal offence
to divulge any social security information, including medical
information. That safeguard will apply in new section 7B of the 1992
Act as well as in amended section 7A. Clause 41 also considers medical
evidence, while clause 42 complements the 1992 Act by making it a
criminal offence to divulge that information. In this context,
&#147;information&#148; includes medical evidence. I hope that that
reassures hon. Members that it is a criminal offence to carry out the
type of activity about which they raised concerns.</div>
<a name="061128121000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey was fair enough to
acknowledge, amendments 168 and 169 would limit the sharing and use of
information under the clauses to non-medical information. Amendment 168
would prevent medical evidence gathered in connection with a claim to a
benefit from being used for a prescribed, relevant purpose. Here, a
relevant purpose is set out in regulation 6 of the draft Social
Security (Claims and Information) Regulations 2007. It is a while since
we thumbed through the documents that we had at the start of our
proceedings when we were talking about Employment and Support
Allowance, but it is on pages 125 to 128 of the draft regulations
before the Committee. I know that the hon. Gentleman carries those with
him religiously, so if he wishes to ask about specifics, he can of
course do
so.</div><a name="061128121000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000373"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> If medical evidence or records are disclosed, the
information sheets that I have seen&#151;partially for my own
records&#151;are all put together in one bundle or on one screen,
without much shielding of other information. Will the Minister reassure
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column533" />Column number: 534</div>Committee that only the relevant parts of such medical evidence will be
disclosed, not the entire file or section?
</div><a name="061128121000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000374"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman again makes an entirely fair
point: we are discussing the disclosure of appropriate medical evidence
rather than the divulging of entire medical records.</div>
<a name="061128121000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The relevant purposes are
contained in the draft regulations. At this stage, they are only draft
regulations, and hon. Members and others can reflect on their contents
and offer observations about their potential operation, as they can
about all draft regulations that we provided to the Committee in
October.</div> <a name="061128121000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
function of clause 40 is to enable local authorities administering
housing benefit in English county councils to promote the take-up of
benefits administered by the Department. Such benefits, which are
listed in draft regulation 6(b), include those in which the provision
of medical evidence in support of a claim is necessary. The words
&#147;is necessary&#148; are important. The benefits include
incapacity benefit, employment and support allowance and disability
living allowance. It is right to support customers in making claims for
benefits to which they are entitled. Removing the ability to use
medical evidence when appropriate to encourage and assist customers in
making such claims would hamper that objective, particularly in
relation to joint team activity or targeting at certain customers,
including older customers.</div>
<a name="061128121000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many of us in our
constituencies or elsewhere will have seen that joint team working. I
have seen it in the east end of Glasgow and in Liverpool. We have
already discussed the Streets Ahead project in Liverpool, where
different agencies come together and literally knock on people&#146;s
doors and offer joint advice and support. It is an innovation in
customer care and support, but we must share that information better
and make it more joined up for our customers. As we roll out the city
strategy consortiums, there is an opportunity for co-ordinated and
coherent customer support. However, it will be based on the appropriate
sharing of information among all consortium participants.</div>
<a name="061128121000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some joint teams, local
authorities administering housing benefit and English county councils
work together as agents of the DWP to collect claims information and
evidence, including medical evidence. I stress that people are not
required to make a claim or to provide evidence to a joint team. They
remain in control throughout, and they can opt to make their claim
direct to DWP if they prefer.</div>
<a name="061128121000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 169 might
prevent local authority welfare services teams from confirming with DWP
or local authority benefit teams that the means test for certain
benefits has been met. I am sure that that is not the intention of the
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey. Welfare
services teams would have to continue to duplicate the activity of the
benefit teams by collecting and considering financial information
needed to decide whether a customer meets the means test for welfare
services assistance. That would run contrary to his well intentioned
and well founded public policy statement, and his rhetoric about and
intentions towards our deliberations.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column534" />Column number: 535</div><a name="061128121000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would hinder a
local authority&#146;s decision about whether housing benefit should
be paid to a tenant or to a landlord. The decision hinges on whether a
customer is considered to have difficulty managing their own affairs
and whether they would be likely to misuse their benefit&#151;in
other words, whether they are a vulnerable customer. Information
concerning a customer&#146;s medical condition would greatly
influence that decision. That is acknowledged throughout the
Committee.</div> <a name="061128121000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
information gateway in subsection (2) would enable housing benefit
teams to receive information about a customer&#146;s vulnerability
from welfare services teams. The decision of the housing benefit
authority will be subject to appeal to an independent tribunal if
either the customer or their landlord disagrees with the
authority&#146;s opinion. It is therefore essential for the authority
to have a firm and complete basis on which to make its decision,
including appropriate&#151;I stress the word
&#147;appropriate&#148;&#151;medical
information.</div>
<a name="061128121000323"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="061128121000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns. He raised them in the correct
spirit and, I believe, in a probing sense. We will exercise control
through regulations made under clauses 40 and 41, and I invite him to
offer observations about the draft regulations. For example, the effect
of draft regulation 7(2)(c) of the Social Security (Claims and
Information) Regulations 2007, which are to be made under clause 40, is
to permit a local authority administering housing benefit and English
county councils to verify information and evidence received from a
customer making a claim for a benefit administered by the Department
for Work and Pensions. However, the regulations specify that those
authorities may not verify medical evidence, as it is not for them to
do so, and must instead forward it to the Secretary of
State.</div>
<a name="061128121000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000375"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> The Minister of State is helping to address the
Committee&#146;s concerns about this matter. Will he say something
about the situation where information is properly transferred because
it is relevant to the payment of a benefit or where it is transferred
for some other perfectly acceptable purpose and is then not well
controlled within the receiving authority? In the real world, some of
our concerns are not about whether the gateway is passed, but about the
situation once it has been passed. Even if it were well understood on
one side of the gateway that the information was not to be made
available to third parties, when it reaches the team on the other side
the security might be insufficient to confine it only to those who need
to know it. Sensitive information that started in the right hands may
pass through again to the right hands but may somehow leak from them to
a wider number of people, in the local authority or otherwise, some of
whom might be bent or might find it appropriate to misuse it. Such a
situation would concern us a lot.</div>
<a name="061128121000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000376"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Typically, the hon. Gentleman raises a reasonable
concern. His specific point captures some of the worries raised by the
hon. Members for Inverness, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column535" />Column number: 536</div>Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, and for Windsor. It would be a criminal
offence to violate the protections that we envisage in the Bill and the
regulations, and the principles of the Data Protection Act 1998 are
taken into account&#151;a point raised by the hon. Member for
Windsor.</div> <a name="061128121000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
measures aim to ensure that the information must be relevant, a point
to which I have alluded, and be obtained and processed lawfully. It
would be forbidden to check NHS databases, for example. These legal
safeguards are important. We are extending convenience and better
support for our customers, many of whom, as we are all aware, are in a
vulnerable situation, and it is important that protections go alongside
that improved service.</div>
<a name="061128121000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as the legal
protections, to which I have alluded at length, there is the additional
safeguard that benefit and social services staff are subject to their
own disciplinary codes, which carry the ultimate sanction of dismissal
for the types of situations that the hon. Gentleman has
mentioned&#151;the unlawful use or disclosure of information. Local
authorities are subject to the 1998 Act, and information on computers
and elsewhere has to be held securely.</div>
<a name="061128121000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000377"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> This is just a quick reminder of the question I
raised earlier. It relates to safeguards to prevent a relative or
former relative of somebody who is claiming a benefit, or someone who
has been in a relationship with such a person, from seeing their
records. I am sure that there must be such a provision somewhere in
local authority procedures or regulations. Will the Minister of State
offer reassurance by pointing to where the restriction
exists?</div>
<a name="061128121000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000378"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I have mentioned that disclosure of medical
evidence of this sort would be a criminal offence and that IT systems
in local authorities and elsewhere are covered by the 1998 Act and
additionally by the staff disciplinary process. How local authorities
carry out such functions and undertake the powers in respect of a
&#147;relevant person&#148; and a &#147;relevant purpose&#148;
has been discussed in this Committee. Section 2(1) of the Local
Government Act 2000 gives every local authority the power to do
anything that</div><a name="061128121000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;they
consider is likely to achieve ... the promotion or improvement of
the economic well-being of their
area&#148;</div><a name="061128121000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div><a name="061128121000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;social
well-being of their
area.&#148;</div><a name="061128121000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, that
includes the opportunity to support customers and join up services to
support them. However, they do so in the context of the disclosure of
medical evidence being a criminal offence. They are also covered by the
data protection arrangements and must act entirely within the
disciplinary codes. Those three checks provide a triple lock on the
misuse of the
information.</div><a name="061128121000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000379"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am still troubled by a point that may arise
from my relative ignorance about the provisions of the Data Protection
Act 1998. What would happen in respect of a person in a local authority
receiving information about someone with whom they previously had a
connection, when they would normally be the person to whom that
information would be relayed? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column536" />Column number: 537</div>Sometimes an allegation is made, for example, that somebody&#146;s
estranged partner who happens to work in a local authority has a downer
about a planning application. There may be nothing improper in that
person handling such data normally, but if they had a clash of
interests because they were aware of another person&#151;just as a
judge in hearing a case may be conflicted&#151;can the Minister
assure us that they would not be the one handling the data? Would he be
satisfied that the local authority in question would say, &#147;X may
not handle this case, because they are declaring an interest in the
person, so Y will take it on&#148;? It is not a matter of an improper
release of information under criminal charges, but a question of the
person who would normally deal with such information not being
appropriate in that particular
circumstance.</div><a name="061128121000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000380"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> In concluding, as I have said already, it is about
access to relevant medical evidence, rather than medical records. The
triple protection that I have spoken about&#151;the criminal offence,
data protection and the codes of conduct and disciplinary
process&#151;is important. However, the hon. Gentleman makes a
reasonable point. Our constituents do not just raise concerns about a
relative or an estranged relative: they could be concerned about a
neighbour or anyone with whom they have a disagreement, gripe or
grudge; or they may have another reason not to trust a person&#146;s
judgment.</div><a name="061128121000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that the hon. Member for Daventry would expect me to say that this is
an internal management issue for local authorities. Of course, we will
keep the matter under review as a national Government, but we cannot,
and the hon. Gentleman would not expect us to, design a system
centrally that would take into account specific concerns, whether about
neighbour disagreement, estranged family or allegations of
discrimination on whatever grounds. Local authorities of all parties
would take such matters seriously, monitor them and interrogate
management information to ensure that there are no such trends, or
discrimination, and see that people do not take their personal
disagreements into their business
activity.</div><a name="061128121000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
I have reassured the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey that the triple protection would prevent the misuse of
relevant medical evidence. I invite him to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="061128121000116"></a>

Alexander:</b> I am gratefulÂ as always to the Minister
for his full response. Earlier in our proceedings, I mentioned the
importance of advancing ideas about allowing medical assessments for
one benefit to inform assessments for others, to get a more efficient
system of medical assessments from the claimant&#146;s point of
view&#151;so they were not called for multiple assessments. I
understand the Minister&#146;s point about the importance, in certain
circumstances, of allowing the relevant evidence to be shared. The
Minister&#146;s remarks in respect of my concerns about
confidentiality have given me a considerable degree of reassurance. I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000382"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> You will recall, Mr. Hood, that there
was some reference to theology this morning. In view of my contribution
this morning, I can only pray in aid St. Augustine, who I think advised
the sinner to sin boldly, but always remain conscious of the presence
of his redeemer. As I spectacularly misapplied my remarks on clause 38,
I hope that it will be in order if I
reiterate&#151;</div><a name="061128121000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="061128121000383"></a><b class="B">Mr.

description of Government Ministers&#146; approach to simplifying the
benefits
system?</div><a name="061128121000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000384"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am sure that even Government Ministers may look
forward with at least some qualified assurance to the possibility of
salvation, but I agree with my hon. Friend that they have not yet
reached that state of bliss.</div>
<a name="061128121000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000385"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
(Mrs. Anne McGuire):</b> If the Conservative party
wished to adopt a saint, perhaps the appropriate one would be St. Jude,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000386"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> The hon. Lady has now succeeded in fulfilling my
expectations. I ought to resist further invitations, but perhaps I
could suggest thatSt. Anthony of Padua, the patron saint of
those who find lost items, might be a little more appropriate? We have
found some principles that have perhaps been downplayed over the years.
The only substantive point that I wish to make is that what I said this
morning was timeless rather than pointless. The problem this morning
was that it was clauseless. I now think that we have found a clause on
which to hang it, and I hope that the Ministers will respond
accordingly.</div>
<a name="061128121000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000387"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> I am pleased to rise to speak to clause 40 stand
part. It is the first time that I have led on a particular clause under
your chairmanship, Mr. Hood, but I have observed, during
former proceedings, that your guidance is often robust&#151;so I am
slightly nervous&#151;but always useful and helpful in steering newer
Members.</div> <a name="061128121000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 40
relates to the sharing of more information between more bodies. In
particular it extends the parties that are able to view information
from claimants or customers to county councils, between local
authorities, with third parties to whom a local authority or the DWP
are subcontracting, and between the DWP and various other parties. In
the notes and several other documents that I have read, including the
Green Paper, the line is that the purpose of this clause is to promote
the take up and delivery of benefits.</div>
<a name="061128121000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure all Members will
agree that the sharing of information can often lead to greater
efficiencies and we all see greater efficiency in the delivery and take
up of benefits. But we must also be careful to balance the privacy of
claimants and sometimes the security of claimants against that desire
for greater efficiency. Of course greater efficiency is what we want
and to some degree the entire Welfare Reform Bill pushes towards 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column538" />Column number: 539</div>greater efficiency&#151;both in getting people into work and in the
allocation of benefits.</div>
<a name="061128121000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The points that I would like
briefly to raise concern the security of data and the relevant purpose.
Some experience has come through from the pathways to work pilot
schemes. There must be some evidence or experience there about whether
the requirement for further data sharing was necessary. I am happy to
take interventions on the way if the Minister feels that he wishes to
answer the point quickly because I simply do not have the information
that he has available.</div>
<a name="061128121000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">There must be some evidence
that additional data-sharing powers were required. If those additional
data-sharing powers were not part of the pathways to work pilot scheme,
what impact did that have? Did it have a significant impact? Are these
new powers of data sharing absolutely necessary in improving
efficiency?</div><a name="061128121000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to civil liberties and privacy and, in some cases, the security
of individuals I have a general question. I believe that around 400,000
civil servants would generally have access to this kind of area, but
does the Minister have some figures on how many additional civil
servants and, more precisely&#151;or more importantly&#151;how many
additional sub-contractors to the DWP or to local authorities or county
councils might have access under these data sharing
arrangements?</div>
<a name="061128121000324"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="061128121000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not run
through sections 7A or 7B, which were created in the Social Security
Administration Act 1992, in detail other than to say that it is very
clear that third parties now obtain access to information, which is a
concern. What vetting procedures does the Minister anticipate will be
used to select employees among third parties to access the newly shared
data? That is a key
question.</div><a name="061128121000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
already run through the concerns, under amendments Nos. 168 and 169,
about an individual being related to someone who is making a claim and
the effects that that can have. What safeguards are in place for
employees accessing the system as employees of third party
contractors?</div> <a name="061128121000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
relevant purpose for use of information is to be set out in the
regulations. It was very helpful to see a set of draft regulations
beforehand; I have had a quick scan through and am comfortable with the
direction that many of them take. I seek some reassurance though:
proposed new section 7B(3) says that a relevant purpose for the sharing
or use of information
is</div><a name="061128121000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any prescribed
purpose which relates to a claim which is made or which could be made
for a specified
benefit.&#148;</div><a name="061128121000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern is about the
wording</div><a name="061128121000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a claim
... which could be made&#148;.</div>
<a name="061128121000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that it must have something to
do with the technicalities of drafting legislation, but I seek
reassurance. To my mind, as a layman, it seems that that would enable
the sharing of absolutely everybody&#146;s information, because a
claim may be made by any citizen at some point in the future. Somebody
may suffer a bereavement or a relapse of a mental health 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column539" />Column number: 540</div>issue and make a claim. Somebody may make an inquiry about a benefit
with no intention of taking it up. I have done so myself on behalf of a
relative who was suffering from Parkinson&#146;s
disease.</div><a name="061128121000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000388"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Would my hon. Friend also like to reflect that
making a claim is, by definition, different from being in a position in
which one might make a claim? In the first case, in making a claim, one
implies acceptance of the rules of the scheme under which that claim is
made, whereas in the second case, one has made no commitment at
all.</div>
<a name="061128121000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000389"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for making the point
crystal clear. This is why my concern is with the
wording</div><a name="061128121000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or which could
be made&#148;</div> <a name="061128121000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">in respect of
a specified benefit: a claim is not actually being made at that stage.
What reassurance can the Minister offer that there is not a
free-for-all in the distribution or use of anybody&#146;s
information, whether they have made a claim or
not?</div><a name="061128121000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">In order to
promote the take-up of benefits so that a form for a particular benefit
is populated from information that is contained locally&#151;there is
a good example in the explanatory notes, or possibly in the
regulations&#151;surely some sort of budget would be required. If the
intention is to extend the promotion of benefits, additional money will
need to be spent. Will the Minister say a few words on where that
additional budget is expected to come from? Will the local authorities
be expected to come up with it, or will it be the DWP
centrally?</div> <a name="061128121000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
we had a full and frank debate about the use of sanctions when we
discussed previous clauses. I have noticed that financial sanctions
will come up again in later clauses, together with prosecutions,
investigations and yet more financial sanctions. If we are to feel
certain that the purpose of clause 40 is to promote the take-up and
delivery of benefits, as opposed to introducing a mechanism for
imposing sanctions on offenders or for sharing information so that more
prosecutions and investigations can be undertaken, the Minister must
reassure us and rebalance the equation in his response. Will he explain
where the promotion of benefits comes into the clause in budgetary
terms and say something about the fact that the promotion of benefits
is not mentioned in the regulations or anywhere else other than in
notes and the Green Paper, and then as an intention?</div>
<a name="061128121000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Overall, the Bill is to be
welcomed. If the clause does what it is purported to do, it will
clearly be welcome. We all want greater efficiency so that more
resources reach the claimants, but I hope that the Minister can give us
some reassurance on the two or three points that I
raised.</div><a name="061128121000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000390"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I will not dwell on the comments made by the
hon. Member for Windsor. He raised many of the points that I was
seeking to raise, so I will be brief.</div>
<a name="061128121000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was important to say, as
the hon. Gentleman did, that the provisions for information sharing
will be welcome if what they lead to is more efficient benefit
processing and a greater ability for services to be joined 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column540" />Column number: 541</div>up for claimants, so that their experience is more straightforward and
benefits decisions can be taken more quickly. I think it was important
to preface my comments in that spirit.</div>
<a name="061128121000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000391"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> May I put to the hon. Gentleman the converse?
Individual officials, for whatever motive, may embark on what lawyers
would call a fishing expedition, trying to find out information that
may or may not be relevant to the case or to other matters with which
they may have to deal, or which possibly cast aspersions on a claimant
that are entirely
irrelevant.</div><a name="061128121000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000392"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point and
I hope that the Minister will find time to address it in his response.
The powers have to be used responsibly&#151;not in the way that the
hon. Member for Daventry described, as a kind of fishing expedition.
They should be used to make inquiries in a proper sense.</div>
<a name="061128121000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall raise one additional
matter that has not been mentioned in the course of the debate. Will
the Minister address the issue of how the provisions might, in due
course, interact with the national identity register and the national
identity card, a benighted project&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.]</i>
The Liberal Democrats have opposed the project on a range of grounds
that I do not propose to dwell on
now.</div><a name="061128121000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000393"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman heard
the Minister saying &#147;sainted&#148; from a sedentary position,
but does he agree that it would be a complete miracle if the scheme
came in on time and on
budget?</div><a name="061128121000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000394"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> It would be a miracle of saintly proportions if
that happened.</div> <a name="061128121000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the arguments that Ministers advanced in support of that misbegotten
and misconceived project was that it would make it easier for members
of the public to access public services. The realm of public service
that we are debating is access to benefits and access to support from
the welfare system. My concern is the extent to which the provisions in
the clause will allow information that is held for social security
purposes, including medical evidence, although not medical
information&#151;a distinction drawn earlier by the
Minister&#151;to be linked into the national identity register to
enable claimants to access public services. They may be using a
national identity card to identify themselves. Could that information
end up being stored on the national identity card, supposedly for
reasons of administrative convenience? I hope that the Minister can
give me a categorical reassurance that there will be no interaction
between the social security information that we are debating and the
national identity register, and that there is no possibility whatsoever
that such information will be stored on the national identity
card.</div>
<a name="061128121000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="061128121000395"></a><b class="B">Kali
Mountford</b> (Colne Valley) (Lab): I served on the Standing
Committee for the identity card Bill on both of the occasions on which
it went through Parliament and I do not recognise any of the scenarios
that the hon. Gentleman has described.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column541" />Column number: 542</div><a name="061128121000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000396"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for that
intervention. I hope that the Minister will be able to give me similar
reassurances about how the Government intend to make use of the
provisions that we are debating. The Minister is a reassuring presence
on this Committee, and I am sure that he will carry out that role
effectively, as he has done before. I am concerned about the issue, and
I hope that he can give me the categorical reassurance that I
seek.</div>
<a name="061128121000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000397"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I shall try to respond relatively briefly, because
I know that we are encouraged to make progress to clause 52 by whatever
time of evening or night we manage to get there. Generally, my view on
information sharing is that we need to go further in shaping public
services around the needs and experiences of individuals, and learning
from some of the experiences of the private sector. As I have said
before, we should be intolerant of the state&#146;s oft-repeated
requests for the same information for similar purposes on consecutive
days. I give the example of a part-time worker who is a mother who
drives to hospital for her appointments. The state interacts with that
citizen in all sorts of different ways: as a mother, a patient, a
driver, a worker, a taxpayer, and somebody who might be receiving tax
credits or the national minimum wage. We say that the state
collectively does not do enough to communicate and interact with its
citizens as rounded citizens; we can have a series of transactional
relationships that do not in any way match up. There can be convenience
for the citizen and efficiency for the state in the way in which we
interact and transact with our customers.</div>
<a name="061128121000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to some of the points
that have been raised, I do not want to rerun the conversations that we
had on earlier amendments, and I am sure that you would not encourage
me to do so, Mr. Hood. However, on the point made by the
hon. Member for Daventry and others about a &#147;fishing
expedition&#148;, we are protected against such expeditions by
guidance and staff codes as well as by wider human rights
safeguards.</div> <a name="061128121000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Windsor asked how many additional civil servants would have
access to the information. I know that figures are sometimes difficult
to ascertain, but the advice here is that it is a round figure and it
is nil. I hope that that reassures him. There are other figures of
course. The clause extends the ability to share the information to
English county councils, and I do not have a figure for that. I do not
think that it is a matter of principle; it is a question of
information. However, if the hon. Gentleman feels passionate about the
issue, I am happy to follow it up with
him.</div><a name="061128121000154"></a>

Boswell:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for having
spoken&#151;as we have said, the hon. Gentleman is a reasonable
person. I am not seeking to force heat out at this stage of the
proceedings, but it is implausible to say that the Government are about
to share more information with relevant people and then, in the same
breath, to say that no one is going to benefit from receiving that
information other than those who already have it. Those two
propositions are difficult to reconcile. Will the Minister of State
reflect on that? I am not asking for a pat answer now. Will he come
back to us and say, &#147;Yes, we need to expand the constituency
people who have access to that information. That is what we need to do
and these are the safeguards.&#148;? We will then be ready to accept
it or at least listen to it. At the moment, he is imagining two
impossible things together before dinner. He needs to revise his
ability to ride both those horses
simultaneously.</div><a name="061128121000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000401"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I will take up the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
invitation. As I said, if I am in error, I will enlighten the Committee
about the specifics. Is it St. Luke who isthe patron saint of
light? The provision concerns the greater use of information rather
than its sharing. The clause provides an extension of that opportunity
to English county councils. I confirm again to the hon. Gentleman that
third parties will not have wider access to information under clause
40. However, I will respond, in a technical sense, to his specific
points.</div> <a name="061128121000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
additional points raised by the hon. Member for Windsor alluded to the
breadth of the power to make regulations. Clause 40, as with other
clauses, gives the Secretary of State a relatively broad power to take
into account changes in the benefit system, the changing nature of the
welfare market, changing pressures, the shape of the labour market, the
need to adapt to the opportunities of information technology, including
those in the future, and the changing relationship between the private
and voluntary sector and the welfare market. It is important to give
that broad power to the Secretary of State. We will state that in more
detail, in regulation and guidance, before implementation.</div>
<a name="061128121000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members of the Committee will
have an opportunity to offer their reflections on the draft regulations
before the Committee and state whether we have got them exactly right.
For the first time in this Committee, I offer to write to hon. Members
if I have not got the numbers exactly right. Neither myself nor my hon.
Friend the Under-Secretary of State enjoy doing that. I think that we
have written once to Members during our entire deliberations. However,
if necessary and for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column543" />Column number: 544</div>first time in our proceedings, I will write to the Committee. With that,
I encourage the Committee to let the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="061128121000161"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000403"></a>The

amendment No. 146, in clause 41, page 34, line 41, after
&#145;function&#146;, insert &#145;prescribed by the Secretary of
State&#146;.</div><a name="061128121000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000404"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I do not need to detain the Committee for long
on the amendments. They probe a simple point. I know that clause 41 is
trying to do something slightly different from clause 40. It is about
making provisions relating to the sharing of information for a specific
purpose. The explanatory note covers supporting people grants. However,
I want to probe the relatively loose use of language under paragraphs
(d) and (g) in subsection (4), although I am sure that there is an
intention behind it.</div>
<a name="061128121000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Incidentally, I am delighted
to see the temporary promotion of the hon. Member for Colne Valley. I
hope that, given her contribution to the Committee, that will soon be
made permanent.</div> <a name="061128121000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause refers twice to a person authorised to exercise &#147;any
function&#148; of such an authority relating to housing benefit. The
phrase &#147;any function&#148; is broad and I want, through the
amendments, to probe what the Government mean by it. I look forward to
the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="061128121000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000405"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I am not sure that I have the confidence or the
courage to share with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for
Defence the information that the position in Committee of my hon.
Friend the Member for Colne Valley is a promotion from her role as his
parliamentary private secretary. However, the hon. Gentleman might
wish, in a quieter moment, to offer that observation to my right hon.
Friend.</div><a name="061128121000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Protection
under subsection (4) is set out in terms of the appropriate person. As
the hon. Gentleman is aware, draft regulations 125 to 128 set out the
legitimate purpose. At present, it is up to local authorities to
provide for the delivery of such services in the manner that best meets
the needs of the communities they serve. The amendment would
unnecessarily involve the Secretary of State in that local authority
role and matter. Although the phrase applies to a person authorised to
perform any function, the sharing can take place only for a relevant
purpose in respect of housing benefit and welfare services. I hope that
the relative narrowness of the power will reassure the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="061128121000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
already contains adequate safeguards to ensure that only appropriate
persons are involved in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column544" />Column number: 545</div>information sharing. In particular, any information sharing under the
clause would need to be for the legitimate purpose of either applying a
welfare service grant or for a welfare service housing benefit purpose
prescribed under the regulations. Only those persons whose functions
relate to such purposes can be involved in the information sharing, so
there is no need to be more specific about the persons
involved.</div> <a name="061128121000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
123 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, which I have
alluded to, and clause 42 of the Bill would also make any unauthorised
disclosure of information made by a person authorised to exercise a
housing benefit and welfare service function respectively a criminal
offence. That reassurance is important. However, if the hon. Gentleman
has specific worries, he can allude to them when referring to the draft
regulations before us or do so in later proceedings. I encourage him
gently to consider withdrawing the
amendment.</div><a name="061128121000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000406"></a>Danny

encouragement to comment on the draft regulations, which I shall be
keen to do in due course. I am aware of his previous implication that
now is the time to debate not draft regulations in detail, but more the
principles of clauses. However, I am now reassured about
matters&#151;although that it not always the case. I beg to ask leave

the person to whom that information has been

of the Committee may have observed that such an amendment might have
been appropriate also under clause 40&#151;indeed it might have been.
However, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column545" />Column number: 546</div>the amendment seeks clarification from the Minister on the rights he
envisages customers having to knowledge and information about them,
which they might have supplied to an agency or Department, such as
their local authority, and which might then have been shared with
another Department. On the face of it, it would seem to me reasonable,
on the grounds of basic fairness, that that claimant should have the
right to know that information about them has been shared, the nature
of that information and with whom it has been
shared.</div>
<a name="061128121000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the volume of
correspondence with which customers almost inevitably are burdened
during the course of their interactions with the relevant Departments,
I cannot see an argument against my proposal on the grounds of
administrative efficiency because there is regular correspondence in
any case. On the grounds of natural justice and fairness, it seems
reasonable that if information about me is being shared, I should be
made aware of what that information is and with whom it is being
shared. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="061128121000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000412"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Again, briefly, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
intention is of course a fair one, but he seeks to solve a problem that
I do not think actually exists. In doing so he would set up a series of
inappropriate and unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles that would run
entirely contrary to what the Government are seeking to do in many
other ways&#151;occasionally we have his party&#146;s avowed
support, but only occasionally&#151;in order to lighten the
bureaucratic burden on public servants, businesses and customers.
Instead, he wants to create an entirely unnecessary set of bureaucratic
hurdles to the processes that we are seeking to put in
place.</div><a name="061128121000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
147 would place a duty on welfare services and benefit teams sharing
information under subsection (1) to inform the customer whose
information is being shared what information is being shared and with
whom it is being shared at each and every stage in the chain of events
as that information is received by those in the welfare system who wish
to support them. If I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment
correctly, that information, as well as a request for information to be
shared and the fact that it is being shared, would have to be confirmed
in writing with each customer. I do not think that that is an
appropriate way to handle the situation. We are trying to introduce a
system that will remove bureaucracy, reduce the number of repeat
requests and lighten the load created by complications, which would be
welcome. The hon. Gentleman has a good purpose and reasonable concerns,
but the outcome of what he has designed would add to the bureaucratic
burden and complexity of the system. That is unnecessary and
unwelcome.</div><a name="061128121000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">In any
case, information sharing under the clause is subject to the usual data
protection principles. It is important that that is put on the record.
In particular, those principles provide already that the sharing
proposed should be foreseeable to the customer. In practice, that
involves the customer being told of the use to which their personal
information could be put when they supply
it.</div><a name="061128121000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000413"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> I seek a little further reassurance before
relaxing on the point. The Data Protection Act 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column546" />Column number: 547</div>1998 is very clear. My background is in IT services and I understand the
principle that a person opts into rather than out of data sharing. Will
the Minister confirm that when a customer acts as a claimant by making
a claim, they opt in by physically signing to say, &#147;Yes, you can
share my data.&#148;? Is that the situation regarding benefit
claimants?</div><a name="061128121000326"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="061128121000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000414"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I am at a bit of a disadvantage, in that the hon.
Gentleman used to be an IT consultant but I only used to be the local
e-government Minister. Our conversation on the Bill can sometimes be
pretty dry, but if we were to enter into a conversation on the nature
of the relationship between the state and IT and how we use our IT, I
am sure that it would be a dialogue involving only
two.</div><a name="061128121000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The customer
would be aware at the outset of the types of organisation that would
use the information and the purpose for which the information would be
deployed within the welfare realm and shared to make their navigation
around the system much easier for them and those who advocate on their
behalf.</div><a name="061128121000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000415"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am grateful for the assurances that the
Minister is offering to the Committee. I did not want to speak at
length because I am conscious that this is an intervention, but since
yesterday, when somebody ran into my car&#151;it was not my
fault&#151;I have been somewhat preoccupied with having to deal with
claims. It has been interesting. I have had to duplicate information
for different bits of the responsibility&#151;picking up the excess
and so on&#151;which I concede is irritating. However, I have also
been struck by the way that those with whom I have been
dealing&#151;exclusively on the telephone and not
documentarily&#151;have said right up front, &#147;At this point
you are making a return, and the information is personal information
that you may or may not be disclosing under Data Protection Act
principles.&#148; It is absolutely up front and explicit. We are all
anxious for the Minister to ensure that at some point, in training,
through explicit notice in scripts for telephone information
downloading, or on documents filled in by claimants, it is made clear
that the information has a purpose and may be used within the proper
principles of the Data Protection Act 1998, so that there need be no
doubt. No corner-cutting should take
place.</div><a name="061128121000191"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000419"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I will not take up the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

and experience and to that of the hon. Member for Windsor&#151;that
any person who supplies information to DWP or local authorities will be
given a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column547" />Column number: 548</div>fair processing statement explaining to what uses the information will
be put. In addition, all guidance issued by the Department on the use
of the power will be freely available to anybody who wishes it.
Similarly, and importantly, anyone can request from local authorities
involved in sharing information documents that set out their policy on
the matter under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. I hope that with
that important reassurance, the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey will be inclined to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="061128121000195"></a>

proposed, </i>That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="061128121000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000421"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> I am conscious of time, so I will be as quick and
to the point as I can without being peremptory. The clause relates to
sharing information on certain benefits under the supporting people
framework, which is a funding mechanism for giving money to vulnerable
or needy groups in society.</div>
<a name="061128121000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause aims to ensure that
the information available on grants given by other mechanisms is
available to the people administering employment and support allowance
and other benefits under the Bill. I am aware that the Local Government
Act 2000 makes it an offence to share information other than in
relation to a very narrow category of benefits. Clearly, something
needs to change, and the clause is necessary if information is to be
shared. However, as I said on clause 40 stand part, we must go no
further than necessary when disclosing personal and private information
to achieve efficiency.</div>
<a name="061128121000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two or three concerns
about which I trust that the Minister will reassure us. First, the
pathways to work pilots will already have had access to certain
information through the supporting people framework. What impact did
that have on how efficiently benefits were delivered under the new
schemes?</div><a name="061128121000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
concern, which is fairly significant, is about the powers being created
under the clause. Subsection (9)(a) states that the power to make an
order or regulations under the clause includes the power</div>
<a name="061128121000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to make different provisions for
different purposes&#148;.</div><a name="061128121000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
a cursory glance, that seems to mean, in layman&#146;s language, that
the Secretary of State can make any provision for any purpose. I am
sure that that is not the case, but will the Minister explain where in
the Act the power is checked or contained?</div>
<a name="061128121000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">My third concern is about the
definition of welfare services, which is key to the clause and to the
sharing of information under the clause. The definition at the end of
subsection (10) is fairly vague. It states that welfare services
include</div><a name="061128121000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;services which
provide support, assistance, advice or counselling to individuals with
particular needs.&#148;</div><a name="061128121000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that that is covered in the regulations, because it does not take
a large leap in imagination to realise that pretty much any support
service that is provided to any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column548" />Column number: 549</div>individual could be considered to fall within that grouping. I would
like some reassurance that that broad&#151;indeed, vague, from a
layman&#146;s perspective&#151;definition will be dealt with in the
regulations. If I have misunderstood the legal language, will the
Minister explain where I have misunderstood
it?</div><a name="061128121000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Access to the
draft statutory instrument relating to clause was very welcome because
it makes it clear how orders and regulations will be made and gives us
the shape of the instrument. That was useful in showing how complicated
the benefits system is and how welcome parts of the Bill are in
tackling some of that complexity.</div>
<a name="061128121000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation to the employment
and support allowance and other benefits under the Bill, what was the
experience of the pathways to work scheme with overlap and interaction
between the supporting people framework and that funding mechanism? Was
there any confusion? Were there any representations that the two are
incompatible? Was there any trouble or rub-up between those two
overlapping schemes?</div>
<a name="061128121000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, clause 41 needs to
stand part of the Bill. If the Minister gives me the reassurance that I
seek, I will be comfortable in accepting it as it
stands.</div><a name="061128121000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000422"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I shall respond relatively briefly to the specific
points that have been raised. As hon. Members will know, the clause
will replace section 94 of the Local Government Act 2000, to which the
hon. Member for Windsor referred. Section 94 allows only a one-way
sharing of benefit information from benefit teams to welfare services
teams for purposes connected to the application of welfare services
grants. Clause 41 will make that one-way gateway into a two-way sharing
provision, which is
important.</div><a name="061128121000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a point
raised by the hon. Gentleman, the same definition of welfare services
will apply as under the 2000 Act. We are not redefining welfare
services in this clause. That is an important reassurance, and I know
that he will take it as such. We are simply continuing and extending
the sharing that is already in
place.</div><a name="061128121000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">On pathways
and, as the hon. Gentleman put it, the possible rub-up between schemes,
I have pathways in my own area and, as a constituency Member of
Parliament, that is not something that I have noticed. Others might
have their own experience, but we have already committed to the
publication of the experiences and assessment of pathways. We will of
course share them with the Select Committee on Work and Pensions, which
will make its own observations on the neatness of the fit between
pathways and other DWP programmes, whether they are provided by the
state or enabled by the private and voluntary sector.</div>
<a name="061128121000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman was right
to allude to the complexity of the benefits system, the welfare market
and labour market interventions. As we seek more collaboration between
the public sector and the private and voluntary sector and use the
opportunity that technology provides, collaborative work will become
much more commonplace and will be welcomed more by ourselves and, more
importantly, by our customers. Two-way information sharing is crucial
to enable that to
happen.</div><a name="061128121000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked earlier about the cost of enabling the provision. We do
not have an identified set 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column549" />Column number: 550</div>of costs, because we are not putting an additional statutory obligation
on local authorities. It is important to point that out to our local
government colleagues. We anticipate that as a consequence of
information sharing, there will be significant savings and a reduction
in duplicate requests for information from the same customer. That is
all that I can say on costings at this
time.</div><a name="061128121000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000423"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> In cases in which the local authority assumes the
burden of administering a national benefit, will there be provision for
the reimbursement of the local authority, either through the normal
local government formula or by way of a special acknowledgement of its
work? It is clearly important that such work is done as efficiently as
possible, and that the costs should be met if they are
disproportionate. For example, if a ring of fraudsters is operating in
a particular local authority area and the authority has to do a lot of
extra work, who will pick up the
tab?</div><a name="061128121000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000424"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises an important principle,
which he knows is exercising the Government. I shall put it in the
context of the conversation that we are currently having in Parliament
and elsewhere about how properly to devolve the welfare state and how
to incentivise good behaviour and ambitious thinking and delivery. In
the private and voluntary sector there is a well established
procurement process, identified in contracts, and risk and rewards.
That is set out in pathways and in other private and voluntary sector
support.</div> <a name="061128121000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">How to
incentivise local authorities is an important conversation and the
truth is that we have not got it right over time. One of the problems
by which we are currently taxed is city strategy. As we heard yesterday
at departmental questions, the fifteen city consortiums are to put
their proposals to the Government by29 December. Within that
context, the question is how properly to reward those who go beyond the
norm in progressively supporting people to get off benefit and into
work, so that they can retain some of the savings for investment in
subsequent success. We are alive to that principle. We acknowledge that
over time, Governments of all persuasions have not gone far enough or
come close to getting the right rewards in the public sector,
particularly in respect of local authorities. We are determined to
address that in our city
strategy.</div><a name="061128121000327"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000425"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> My final point was about the wide-ranging power
in clause 41(9)(a) to make different provisions for different
purposes.</div><a name="061128121000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000426"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for not having
alluded to his specific question. What we seek to do there, as in other
clauses, is to draft quite a wide power and then follow it up in
regulations or guidance, whichever is most appropriate. Draft
regulations in relation to the clause have been provided. The
alternative to taking the relatively broad power is to set out in
primary legislation a rather prescriptive definition of the
purpose.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column550" />Column number: 551</div><a name="061128121000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Welfare reform Bills do not
appear annually. We cannot rely on the flow of primary legislative
vehicles to continually update the Government&#146;s interventions in
a changing welfare market. That is why we take a relatively broad power
which we can follow up with regulations or guidance. The House and
others will take a view so that we get those regulations and guidance
absolutely right. To place on the face of primary legislation a
specific constraining power would mean that the primary legislation
would be pretty quickly out of date and unable to adjust to the
changing nature of the welfare
market.</div><a name="061128121000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000427"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> The reason that I make the observation is that on
a cursory glance through other legislation passed in the past five to
10 years, I could not find an identical phrase or the same structure of
comment. That was why I raised the concern. Perhaps at some other point
the Minister may allude to it
again.</div><a name="061128121000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000428"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> That is an important point. Perhaps later in our
deliberations we can return to that. We have taken similarly broad
powers in earlier clauses. I cannot recall the exact phrasing. I think
we had a Division on one earlier. That the Secretary of State should
have a power to vary provisions because of the changing nature and
changing circumstances of the labour market and the welfare system is
an important and well-established principle.</div>
<a name="061128121000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can discuss the points
raised by the hon. Member for Daventry about the issue of fraud and
specific efforts by local authorities at a local level when we come to
clause 45. I do not want to entice the hon. Gentleman to prolong his
point, but there will be an opportunity to do that then. With those
comments, I encourage the Committee to agree that the clause stand part
of the
Bill.</div><a name="061128121000222"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000429"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> I want to make two or three brief points. The
clause appears to bar the unlawful disclosure of certain information by
people involved in the use of the information. Essentially, it aims to
stop the unlawful disclosure of information when disclosure is probably
enabled by the previous two clauses. The third party organisations and
private companies that may be employed in the use of information and
the delivery of welfare services will clearly have access to the
information. I seek some reassurance on the controls on the employees
of those third party organisations. Will criminal record checks be
compulsory? I should like some information on the vetting of employees
in third party organisations to which services may be contracted
out.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column551" />Column number: 552</div><a name="061128121000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a &#147;techy&#148;
point, but I am curious to know the difference between clause 42 and
section 123 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, which it
clearly seeks to reflect. If there are any differences, what is the
reason for them?</div><a name="061128121000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
final question is on budgets. It is intended to promote take-up, but
the clause says that it will be unlawful to disclose information.
Inquiries and monitoring will incur costs, so from which budget will
those costs be paid? I appreciate that the costs will not be
significant or enormous, but will they be paid by local authorities,
third party suppliers, or the
DWP?</div><a name="061128121000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000430"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Clause 42 is needed to align existing protections
against unauthorised data sharing in relation to benefits staff and
local government. The hon. Member for Windsor said, rightly I think,
that the clause replaces section 123 of the Social Security
Administration Act 1992, which applies to benefits staff, and section
95 of the Local GovernmentAct 2000. The clause creates a
criminal offence of unauthorised disclosure by welfare services staff
of information gained through clause 39, which is headed
&#147;Information relating to certain benefits&#148;. Conviction
for the offence may lead to a fine or, importantly,
imprisonment.</div><a name="061128121000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000431"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I assume that, when the Minister referred to
clause 39, he meant clause 41, because the Bill has been
renumbered.</div><a name="061128121000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000432"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right, and he encourages me
to mention that the wording of the draft regulations and supporting
material will also need to be updated, because having been published in
October they predate the additional clauses.</div>
<a name="061128121000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">To address the point made by
the hon. Member for Windsor, subsection (2)(a) covers third party
employees&#151;parties employed by local authorities. It is up to the
authorities to conduct appropriate checks on staff. Hon. Members were
keen to see the paperwork that we compiled on the roles of the private
and voluntary sectors in future pathways, and will now have had chance
to reflect on it. In drafting that paperwork, we dealt with staff
training, staff experience and keeping staff skills up to date, and we
wanted to ensure that people will be supported in getting back into the
labour market by appropriate staff with appropriate experience and
relevant backgrounds.</div>
<a name="061128121000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
narrow, technical question on clause 42, I am advised that the narrow,
technical answer is that there are no differences between the clause
and section 123 of the 1992 Act in what constitutes unauthorised
disclosure. I hope that the reassures the hon.
Gentleman.</div>

giving way, but I just want to be absolutely clear that third party

their employees, and that consideration of what is appropriate is in
their hands. That rings a few alarm bells with
me.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000434"></a>Mr.

private and voluntary sector contracting and so on in the light of the
paperwork that the Government have provided. He is correct in saying
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column552" />Column number: 553</div>we will not centrally stipulate the criminal record checks to be

a triple protection mechanism. I hope that for the hon. Gentleman, who

<a name="061128121000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000435"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> I want to make a couple of comments about the
recovery of overpayments. The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey covered this territory earlier, and it is
uncontroversial to say that if an overpayment is made, it should be
recovered. However, I have two concerns. With the changes to the Social
Security Administration Act 1992, an overpayment that is due to a
banking or processing error by the local authority or whoever makes the
payment will automatically be reclaimed without a new decision
confirming that an overpayment was made. Somebody who is a couple of
hundred pounds overdrawn, who continues to spend, as most people do,
and who does not spot the overpayment will be put in a difficult
position if the money has to be returned immediately. They are already
in a difficult financial position, by virtue of the fact that they
claim those benefits. I want an explanation of how the new power to
reclaim an overpayment immediately will impact on the least well off in
society&#151;those who claim benefits.</div>
<a name="061128121000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000436"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that as more benefits
are paid automatically into bank accounts, for reasons that we have
rehearsed in other places, overpayments will become less obvious to the
claimant? For example, my winter fuel payment status has changed during
this month. I have no idea whether the Department has succeeded in
paying my wife and myself, or only myself or whatever. I shall find out
by the end of the month, and if anything is wrong, I shall rectify it.
However, I cannot do so immediately. Many people in that position may
continue to pay up until they run out of cash in their
account.</div>
<a name="061128121000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000437"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> My hon. Friend clearly illustrates what may
happen, and I accept his point entirely. With many benefits paid into a
single bank account and with many direct debits and other demands on
people&#146;s accounts, an immediate reclamation without a decision
on an automatic payment made to a claimant could cause great
difficulty.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column553" />Column number: 554</div><a name="061128121000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause also says that the
Department or the paying body will be able to reclaim an overpayment
when somebody has misrepresented the information that they provided. Of
course, if somebody has deliberately misrepresented the information
that they have provided in order to obtain a short or long-term benefit
or payment, that is unacceptable and it should be dealt with
appropriately through an immediate repayment. However, will the
Minister of State assure the Committee that where someone who has
dyslexia, which many of my friends struggle with to a certain degree,
or a learning difficulty accidentally writes one wrong figure on a
form, there will be a safeguard to ensure that they will not be
immediately penalised and treated as if they had participated in a
gross misrepresentation?</div>
<a name="061128121000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having voiced those two
concerns, which I trust the Minister of State will be able to address,
I am happy to sit
down.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000438"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> We are making deserved and popular progress, so I
shall not seek to delay the Committee. Clause 43 is headed,
&#147;Recovery of overpaid benefit: Great Britain&#148;. It might
help the Committee if I confirm that the clause seeks to codify what
already occurs in practice. No one will be affected in a material sense
by the power we are taking in the clause. The issues that the hon.
Gentleman reasonably raises as concerns are already dealt with in
practice. The clause ensures that there is no ambiguity in the
legislation about the processes for determining and recovering
overpayments of benefit when they are paid through the banking system.
Social security commissioners have said that this aspect of our
legislation is unclear, and we are taking this Bill as an opportunity
to put the matter beyond doubt.</div>
<a name="061128121000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">An overpayment of this kind
can arise, for example, when a benefit payment is issued through the
banking system and a change in circumstances that reduces entitlement
is properly reported by the customer after the time that we are able to
recall the next payment, but before the payment enters the
person&#146;s account.</div>
<a name="061128121000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause does not remove the
need for an award to be revised before an overpayment can be
determined, as that is retained within new section 71(5A). However, it
will enable us to review an award and then consider the recoverability
question at a later date, allowing for a more considered approach to
determining whether the overpayment is recoverable. The change follows
a similar one in 1996, and simply ensures that benefit overpayments can
continue to be dealt with as was always intended. Given the
reassurances that the clause simply codifies current practice and
removes any dubiety or lack of clarity identified by the social
security commissioners, and notwithstanding the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
concerns about what already happens, I urge that the clause stand part
of the
Bill.</div><a name="061128121000247"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<a name="061128121000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be of interest to the
Committee to hear that about half the fraud against housing benefit
also involves fraud against another national benefit. Current rules

and will allow local authorities to investigate fraud against national

intention has always been that we will balance the powers with
safeguards. The safeguards will allow the Secretary of State to ensure
that local authorities do not misuse the powers. We have discovered a
technical problem with our ability to set out the safeguards in
regulations, and the amendment will rectify it. The safeguards will
include limiting the type of benefit offence that a local authority may
investigate, allowing particularly difficult or sensitive cases to be

case of misuse.</div><a name="061128121000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the specific issue that the hon. Gentleman raised, tackling local fraud

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000445"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> We are tumbling quickly to a conclusion this
afternoon, Mr. Hood, and I thank you for that. During the
debate on amendment No. 68, I spoke about the need for safeguards to
prevent the misuse of local authorities&#146; new investigation
powers by local fraud investigators. These amendments ensure that we
have corresponding safeguards in place to prevent misuse of the new
prosecution powers introduced in clause 46.</div>
<a name="061128121000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause will allow local
authorities in England and Wales the power to prosecute fraud against
DWP-administered benefits, which I have already mentioned. In Scotland,
the procurator fiscal will be responsible for the prosecution of all
criminal activity. The safeguards will include limiting the type of
benefit that a local authority may prosecute and directing that
authorities may not bring proceedings in certain cases. We require that
local authorities have regard to the code for crime prosecutors when
prosecuting in cases of national benefit fraud. We would also, as I
indicated earlier, withdraw the powers in case of misuse. If the
Secretary of State withdraws the powers, he or she may continue with
any proceedings that have already been started or he or she may
discontinue them. I am pleased to move the
amendments.</div>
<a name="061128121000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000446"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Briefly, I do not think that there is anything
objectionable in principle here. It would be helpful if the
Under-Secretary could share with the Committee any information that she
has about anybody else who is empowered to carry out prosecutions in
relation to benefit fraud on behalf of the DWP. Are there any such
persons? Perhaps not. To extend the thought for a moment, in relation
to those who provide support under pathways to work, will she assure
the Committee that it is the Government&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column556" />Column number: 557</div>intention, at least at this stage, not to award any prosecution powers
to private sector providers and that the powers will be kept in-house
in the Department, just like the decision-making
process?</div>
<a name="061128121000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000447"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I am happy to pick up on the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point. It might be helpful in case of
misinterpretation of the new burdens to say that the Government do not
anticipate that the clauses and Government amendments will impose any
new burdens on local authorities. They are there for the sake of
clarity, so that when central Government impose new burdens on local
authorities, there will be a principle to deal with
it.</div><a name="061128121000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps it might
be helpful for the Committee to understand that we anticipate that the
powers will create efficiency savings. They should result in an
efficiency savings of between &#163;450,000 and &#163;600,000 each
year for DWP and local authorities because of the reduced need to

said when I opened this debate, about half of housing benefit frauds

of Benefit for commission of benefit
offences</div><a name="061128121000275"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Bill.</div><a name="061128121000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000448"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I want to take this opportunity to probe the
Government&#146;s thinking on this change. In previous debates in
this Committee in which we have discussed benefit sanctions or
conditionality, I have been keen for information from Ministers about
the evidence on which the proposed change is based.</div>
<a name="061128121000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I understand it, the clause
will extend from three years to five years the period in which benefit
may be sanctioned or lost if a second benefit fraud conviction takes
place. Will the Under-Secretary tell the Committee on how many
occasions the power has been used since it was introduced with a
three-year limit? When it has been used, on how many occasions has it
resulted in benefit being withdrawn entirely, and in how many has
benefit been withdrawn partially?</div>
<a name="061128121000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the no doubt detailed
assessment that the Under-Secretary and her officials carried out
before proposing the change, in how many cases would the power have
applied since it was introduced if the five-year time limit had been in
place rather than the three-year time limit? It is important
for the Committee to understand, looking back, what difference the
extended power would have made in practice in evaluating the judgments
that Ministers have made in advancing the clause. I look forward to her
explanation of that evidence
base.</div><a name="061128121000329"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="061128121000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000449"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> It may not be possible to give the detailed
analysis of the number of cases per year, for which the hon. Gentleman
asked. However, I can give him some information, which I hope will be
useful, on the number of cases that we anticipate, based on current
trends. That may go some way to deal with the
issues.</div><a name="061128121000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
about deterring benefit fraud, rather than punishment. We are
determined to tackle benefit fraud. When a person is convicted of a
second benefit fraud within a specified period&#151;we are asking the
Committee to accept that the current period of three years should be
extended to five&#151;that allows us to reduce benefit entitlement or
to remove it. The Department already uses that process to reduce
benefit fraud, but it is especially aimed at deterring those who offend
persistently and have been given repeated warnings to the effect that a
further conviction would have an effect on their benefit. The current
legislation works. We want to maximise the deterrent effect, without it
running contrary to other legislation relating to re-offending, such as
the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, under which some offences are
spent after five
years.</div><a name="061128121000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked for the number of cases that we would expect to capture
by extending the legislation. We anticipate that, based on current
trends, there will be somewhere between 30 and 50 additional cases per
year. However, we should hope to see a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column558" />Column number: 559</div>reduction in the number of cases. If people realise that there could be
a removal or a reduction of their benefit, that in itself will,
hopefully, be a
deterrent.</div><a name="061128121000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000450"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> The Under-Secretary is giving a satisfactory
response to the queries that have rightly been raised. Will she confirm
that there has been no historic difficulty with the three-year rule in
respect of the Human Rights Act 1998 and that there have been no
successful defences of the allegedly fraudulent claimant on the grounds
that, somewhere, the process has been unfair? Bearing in mind that
Ministers have given their certificate about compliance, will she
confirm that a five-year period is within those principles? I have no
difficulty with
them.</div><a name="061128121000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000451"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> The hon. Gentleman identifies specific
circumstances where an individual may wish to pursue a case under human
rights legislation. I assure him that the five-year period does not run
counter to that. As my hon. Friend the Minister of State has said, the
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has made a statement under the
Human Rights Act, which is at the front of the
Bill.</div><a name="061128121000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have talked
about the cases that we hope to catch in future, based on our current
analysis. Currently, there are 320 cases per year where two strikes
have encouraged us to see whether there should be a sanction, and the
sanction was applied in 190 cases. There are no details about how many
people were in hardship or partial award. I hope that that is a
satisfactory explanation for the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and
Strathspey.</div><a name="061128121000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
penalty applied on the two-strikes cases will not change. I hope that
that gives some comfort to the Committee. It remains a fixed 13-week
period, during which a customer&#146;s benefit ceases or may be
reduced. It is not necessarily removed; it can be reduced. Most
importantly&#151;this links into what is behind the hon. Member for
Daventry&#146;s question about safeguarding rights&#151;those first
convicted of a benefit fraud will receive a written warning telling
them about the two strikes provision. Therefore, people will be under
no illusion: if they continue to defraud the benefits system there will
be a penalty with the two-strikes approach. Any right of customers to
request hardship payments will not change either. I hope that gives
some comfort to the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey.</div> <a name="061128121000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
payments will help to ensure that the basic needs of vulnerable
customers or those with families continue to be met. No deductions are
made from retirement pensions, benefits paid for children, or
disability living allowance, while an underlying entitlement remains to
passported housing benefit and free school meals.</div>
<a name="061128121000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that members of the
Committee will appreciate that we are extending the time for very good
reason. We want to root benefit fraud out of the system. We have also
built in safeguards so that those who are vulnerable will have
protection under the new system. Most of all, we will make clear to
customers who have a tendency&#151;as I say, we are talking about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column559" />Column number: 560</div>very small numbers here&#151;to defraud the system what the penalties
are for that action. With that explanation, I trust that the Committee
will accept the clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000452"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I welcome the clause, but may I have some
latitude, Mr. Hood, to probe a related matter briefly? This
clause and clause 50 seem, on the face of it, to make improvements in
respect of the conditions that relate to widowed mother&#146;s
allowance and widowed parent&#146;s allowance in cases where the
child is not resident with the parent. It seems broadly sensible to
place that under the heading, &#147;Benefits for bereaved
persons&#148;.</div> <a name="061128121000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has recently been drawn to my attention by a constituent that there is
another matter relating to bereaved persons. I hope the Minister might
be able to take that away and have a wee look at it: the conditions for
entitlement to funeral grants where there is a sharp three-month
cut-off point. If the claim is not made within three months, not only
can there be no appeal, but the administrative rule is strict. I have
recently had a local case where a claim has been refused after the
three-month period, despite there being reasonable grounds for an
appeal to be considered and a grant to be made. I hope that, with the
leave of the Committee, the Minister will have a wee think about that
and come back to me.</div>
<a name="061128121000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000453"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments on
both clauses 49 and 50, which are linked. He is right: it is an
improvement on the current situation. The arrangement is to withdraw
child dependency increases as part of the move to child tax credits.
The exact provision had not been made, and we have used this Bill to
tidy that up.</div> <a name="061128121000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to entitlement to bereavement grants and the three-month
cut-off, if memory serves&#151;a few of us here were around in the
1997-2001 Parliament&#151;there was some debate of that issue at that
time. It was accepted by the House that we should have a three-month
period when the bereavement grants would be considered and after that
there would be a cut-off. I will not give any definitive comment at the
moment and I will get back to the hon. Gentleman about that particular
issue.</div> <a name="061128121000295"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="Column"><a name="Column560" />Column number: 561</div><a name="061128121000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000454"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> Clauses 51 and 52 make provisions for people
under 16 in relation to the care component of the disability living
allowance and the mobility component respectively. Will the
Under-Secretary give a brief statement as to the rationale behind the
changes?</div><a name="061128121000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061128121000455"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I welcome this opportunity to clarify the
changes, which will be of particular interest to Committee members who
are interested in the administration of the disability living
allowance. Clause 51 removes an anomaly from the legislation governing
the entitlement conditions for the care component of disability living
allowance for people on or around the age of 16. The hon. Gentleman
rightly points out that clause 52 is linked to clause 51&#151;I hope
that I am not going out of order here, Mr. Hood&#151;and
covers entitlement to the mobility element of the DLA.
</div><a name="061128121000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes are
principally to ensure that people on or around the age of 16 do not
lose three months&#146; benefit entitlement. To be entitled to DLA, a
person must have satisfied the conditions of entitlement for at least
three months&#151;the so-called qualifying period&#151;and must
continue to satisfy them for a further six months. That is the
prospective test, because the benefit is for long-term conditions.
Additional entitlement conditions apply to children under 16. A recent
social security commissioner&#146;s decision highlighted an anomaly
in the legislation that meant that people on or around the age of 16
who claim DLA or an additional amount to an existing award could lose
up to three months&#146; worth of benefits.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column561" />Column number: 562</div><a name="061128121000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause modifies the normal
conditions of entitlement for children under 16. It will principally
mean that someone who is 16 or over who claims DLA or an additional
amount to an existing award will be awarded the benefit if they satisfy
the normal adult entitlement conditions even if part of the qualifying
period falls before they were 16. Conversely, a child who is under 16
will have to fulfil only the additional conditions that are applicable
to children up to and including the day before their 16th
birthday.</div> <a name="061128121000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
does not change the entitlement conditions for adults or children. It
simply ensures that the entitlement of people who claim on or around
their 16th birthday will continue to be decided in the way that
existing legislation intended. This is a situation in which the law was
not quite in balance with the original policy intent, and we have taken
this opportunity highlight the anomaly and to clarify the legal
position. I welcome this opportunity to explain the changes because it
will make a difference to young people who need to claim DLA and will
prevent the cliff-edge effect that sometimes happens in the benefit
system when a young person goes through the legal transition from
childhood to
adulthood.</div><a name="061128121000304"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
