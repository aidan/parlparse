you in the Chair, Mr. Benton. It seems like a long time

					<a name="08013014000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Edmonton, who is not in his place at the moment, has mentioned the
independence of the Office for National Statistics. The position is
clear. It is not for Departments to approach the ONS directly as part
of their development of Government policy, which would risk
compromising the independence of the ONS. All discussions on such
matters are conducted through Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury, which has
advised us that the changes proposed under the Bill are not salient to
the classification decision. It is not therefore appropriate to consult
the ONS on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column630" />Column number: 630</div>changes. I suggest to the Committee that that is the proper process and,
on that basis, I am clear that the proposed changes do not
amount to direct management control, which has been suggested, and that
the Bill does not change the classification
process.</div>

Julian Ashby, who gave evidence on 13 December,
said:</div>

working on the Cave review...we sought advice about the
classification...The aspect of the Bill that gives me concern

determines the detail of the standards that were for the regulator to
set.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Housing and

					<a name="08013014000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could go on,

evidence from the Treasury, but he expressed concern that the Bill, as
drafted, did not achieve the objective that the Cave review felt was
the right way forward. Does my hon. Friend consider that there is
really ground for worry and that, by some means or another, the view of
the ONS should be sought before the situation becomes a fait accompli
with disastrous
consequences?</div>

important to make sure that we get matters right, and I am satisfied
that we have followed the due process in that regard. I hope that he
will intervene, if I have matters wrong, but at the evidence session
Julian Ashby said something about the Secretary of State determining
the detail of standards&#151;I hope that I understood him correctly,
because I do not have a copy of the report in front of me. I suggest
that that is not even how the current regime that we propose stands.
The Secretary of State will not direct in detail the nature of
standards, and it will be a broad-brush approach. The regulator will
undertake that direction, but we do not anticipate the Secretary of
State taking part in direct
detail.</div>

							<a name="08013014000727"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I agree that we should be absolutely certain. My
firm feeling is that the Bill does not represent my right hon.
Friend&#146;s interpretation of it. However, I am aware of the worry
about such matters. I hope that he agrees that the right approach is to
work in consultation with stakeholders and that he and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column631" />Column number: 631</div>others will play a large role in ensuring that we get the matter
absolutely right. I do not agree with the concerns about direct
management control. However, I hope that we can move forward on
particular areas such as directions, guidance and standards in which
the Secretary of State is
interested.</div>
					<a name="08013014000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 42 proposes to omit clause 173(2)(k), which permits the
regulator to set standards
on</div>

contribution to the environmental, social and economic well-being of
the areas in which their property is situated&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08013014000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was mentioned by my right hon.
Friend this morning, and it has been reiterated several times during
the Bill&#146;s deliberations. There is concern that the regulator
may be able to set and enforce standards on non-social housing issues,
including local voluntary activities&#151;we certainly do not want to
discourage such activities.</div>
					<a name="08013014000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I explained in the debate on
clause 86, while subsection (2)(k) would allow the regulator to
regulate such activities, if they are linked to social housing, it does
not necessarily follow that that power will be used. The regulator does
not have to use that power, and there might be more appropriate ways of
achieving the regulator&#146;s sixth objective. Nevertheless, we
believe that the regulator should have power to regulate registered
providers&#146; wider community activities. Martin Cave recommended
that all parts of the domain should have a statutory duty to co-operate
with the convening and place-shaping role of local authorities. That
obligation will be stronger in areas in which a provider has a
significant number of homes. I share my right hon. Friend&#146;s
concern that any requirements imposed on registered providers in
relation to place shaping should not be unduly or disproportionately
onerous. That is why we rejected imposing a direct statutory duty, as
the Cave review suggested. It would be difficult adequately to express
in the Bill the idea that the strength of the obligation should vary
depending on the extent of the landlords&#146; activities in an
area.</div>
					<a name="08013014000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2)(k) was included to ensure that registered social landlords
co-operate with local authorities in local place shaping, but in a
reasonable and proportionate manner to their holdings in an area. By
giving the regulator the power to set standards, acting in accordance
with its objectives to regulate proportionately and in a way that
minimises the burden of regulation, I believe that we are carrying
forward the spirit of Cave&#146;s recommendations, but in a manner
that is less onerous and more flexible and
practical.</div>
					<a name="08013014000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right
hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich also expressed
concern about what a standard under clause 173(2)(k) might require.
However, that is not for me to say, because such standards will be set
by the regulator. On that basis, I hope that I have reassured him on a
whole range of things, and I hope that I have made it clear that the
Government intend to move forward on the regulator, the setting of
standards and the role of the Secretary of State. Therefore, I ask my
right hon. Friend to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08013014000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 229 is our only amendment to clause 173. It is a

standards on antisocial behaviour should only be in respect of existing
duties and powers of landlords under the 1996 Act and should not be a
wider, open-ended power. In that way, I hope that we are mitigating the
concerns and risks that stakeholders have expressed with regard to the
antisocial behaviour standard as well. That is the approach that I aim
to take forward as the Bill progress through all its
stages.</div>

							<b class="B">Sir
George Young</b> (North-West Hampshire) (Con): I want briefly
to respond to what the Minister said before he moved on to the
Government amendment. I agree with him that this is one of the most
important issues in the Bill, as the right hon. Member for Greenwich
and Woolwich has also said. It is the obverse of the problem with
Soci√(c)t√(c) G√(c)n√(c)rale, which thought that there
was something on the balance sheet and then discovered that it was not.
With this, the Government thought that something was off the balance
sheet, but they may discover that it is inadvertently on it. That is
the other side of the coin.</div>
					<a name="08013014000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before we rose for lunch, the
Minister said that he would look at the issue again and engage opinions
on it before Third Reading. That was helpful, but I am worried that he
is relying on meetings with Treasury officials. Treasury officials are
not omniscient. They were wrong about foundation hospitals&#151;they
said that they would be off balance sheet, but they turned out to be on
balance sheet. There is a risk in relying on Treasury opinion. I am
sorry to press the Minister, but I remind him what the Chief Secretary
to the Treasury, the former Minister for Housing, said about the
ONS:</div>
					<a name="08013014000647"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I have
asked about potential arrangements for taking advice from the ONS in
advance of the Committee stage, as opposed to the normal approach in
which the ONS gets asked afterwards. It would be helpful to have its
advice in advance, and I have asked for
it.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Housing and
Regeneration Public Bill Committee, </i>13 December 2007; c. 142,
Q233<i class="I">.]</i>
					</div>
					<a name="08013014000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words,
she asked the ONS for its advice. However, the Minister has not made it
clear what the advice might have
been.</div>
					<a name="08013014000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said&#151;I think that I understood him&#151;that it would be
improper to have a dialogue with the ONS, because it is independent. I
do not follow that line of argument. Yes, it is independent, but what
would be wrong with the Government saying, &#147;We must get this
definition right. This is what is in the Bill. Will you tell us whether
we run the risk of having the debt classified as public sector
borrowing?&#148; What would be improper about such a dialogue, which
seems entirely sensible? Indeed, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury
thought it was sensible on 12 December. Now, there will be no direct
dialogue with the ONS and the matter must go through the Treasury,
which will not put the question to the ONS
directly.</div>
					<a name="08013014000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
press the Minister about the alleged impropriety of talking in advance
to the ONS about the likely definition of housing association
borrowings. I have listened to what he has said about the measure
simply bringing the social housing regulator into line with other
regulators. I do not know whether in his nightmare weekend he read the
Centre for Economics and Business Research report that compared this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column633" />Column number: 633</div>regulator with all the others. The powers in this Bill go way beyond
those of other regulators. For example, as we discovered a few moments
ago, appeals against this regulator can be made only to the High Court,
whereas other regulators have an appeal body. The Charities Act 2006
states that charity
commissioners</div>
					<a name="08013014000648"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall
not be subject to the direction or control of any Minister of the
Crown&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08013014000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
rail regulator, despite much pressure to the
contrary, is only required &#147;to have regard&#148; to Government
guidance. On Ofcom, there are a few occasions where the Secretary of
State can make directions, but those are in the interests of national
security, relations with a foreign Government, for securing compliance
with international obligations or in the interests of public safety or
public health. Those definitions are much narrower than the definitions
in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08013014000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
listened to the debate, my anxieties have not been allayed. The
Government could go further than they have so far in getting the
necessary assurances from the ONS that the debt likely to be incurred
will not be scored as public sector debt. As a responsible Minister, he
owes it to the Committee to come back on Report with better assurances
than he has given today.

get it right. There are concerns, and I have pledged to the Committee
that I will go away and re-examine the matter to reassure the Committee
and wider stakeholders that management control&#151;direct
micro-management by the Secretary of State&#151;will not be enacted
as a result of the Bill&#146;s provisions. I recognise the point, but
I want to reaffirm that I am satisfied that we have followed due

choose just one particular complexity in relation to Network Rail.
There has been constant discussion about whether Network Rail is in or
out and whether it has public sector debt, which gives a flavour of the
complexity. Before the Bill is enacted, it is important that
reassurance is provided that what the Government intend to do with the
Bill will actually be carried through and will hold firm into the
future.</div>

right hon. Gentleman that we are some way away from that. Foundation
trusts were a new platform for the delivery and provision of health
care, and we are in no way near that. I hope that that provides a
degree of reassurance. In that Committee, the right hon. Gentleman also
suggested to the then Under-Secretary that he wished to see her rapidly
promoted to Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, but
she has done one better than that, because she is now a Secretary of
State.</div>

about foundation trusts is important, and I hope that the right hon.

						</b> We have had a good debate and aired a number of
extremely important issues. I do not think that any of us should
underestimate the significance of what we have been talking about,
because if the classification issue is not got right, the whole
strategy for delivering an expanded housing programme and for
facilitating investment through housing associations is destroyed.
Therefore, I am pleased that the Minister has accepted that there is a
need for further reflection and that he has welcomed the participation
of the stakeholders in that process. I shall be only too happy to
continue to play a role in that, if he would welcome
it.</div>

Hampshire, my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton and me.</div>

slightly mischievous comment that given the Minister&#146;s concern
that the consultation with the ONS should be done only through the
Treasury, he is extraordinarily well placed, in that the Chief
Secretary to the Treasury, the former Minister for Housing, can pursue
her inquiries in her new role without any breach of propriety. I hope
that the clarification of the position on the ONS proceeds and that we
will have greater certainty when we return to the matter.</div>

							<a name="08013014000735"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> I will not detain the Committee, because the
amendments are broadly similar to those that we have debated. Amendment
No. 346 would amend clause 172(c), which gives the regulator
a</div>
					<a name="08013014000651"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;degree of control over
the governance of non-profit registered providers&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08013014000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">to give a slightly more felicitous
wording, so that the regulator would
have</div>
					<a name="08013014000652"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;certain powers
relating to the governing instruments
of&#148;</div>
					<a name="08013014000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">registered providers.
Obviously, the purpose is to safeguard against a possible
interpretation of the &#147;degree of control&#148; to be exercised
over RSLs, which might lead to their being classified as public sector
bodies. Those arguments have been rehearsed, and there is no point
repeating
them.</div>
					<a name="08013014000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
350 and 351 are of a different nature. I am puzzled about the grouping,
but that is not for me to question&#151;it is your decision,
Mr. Benton. The amendments concern the smaller issue of the
consent that is required by RSLs who seek to change the rules. Under
the Bill, the regulator must give prior consent for any changes in the
rules. The amendments  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column636" />Column number: 636</div>would limit that consent to important changes in the
organisation&#146;s objectives, changes in the rules that apply to
the use of property in the event of an organisation going out of
existence, or any changes</div>

them&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08013014000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
would be proper safeguards. Prior consent for such changes from the
regulator is appropriate, and more technical or trivial changes really
ought not to require prior consent from the regulator. If we are
seeking to act on the conclusions of the Elton review, which looked at
the degree to which housing associations are subject to over-heavy
regulation, this is a matter where there is scope for
improvement.</div>
					<a name="08013014000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that my hon. Friend the Minister can at least reassure me on the
objectives of the amendments, even if he will resist the precise
wording. It is in all our interests that there is an effective form of
regulation that does not involve over-detailed or over-intrusive
examination of relatively trivial
matters.</div>

						</b> I have a lot of sympathy with the motivation
behind amendments Nos. 350 and 351. As my right hon. Friend has rightly
pointed out, they identify the key areas of interest for the regulator
in a provider&#146;s constitution. However, I hope that my right
hon. Friend accepts that I cannot accept the
amendments without first considering a detailed analysis of the risks
of removing the existing controls. I pledge to do that, and I hope to
update him on
Report.</div>
					<a name="08013014000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 346, I agree that the regulator should not and will not have
general control over a registered provider&#146;s
day-to-day management or activities. I suggest that that will remain
the responsibility of registered providers&#146; governing boards,
which is how it should be. Clauses 187 to 190 do not apply to
profit-making bodies, and nor should they. The main aim of requiring
the regulator&#146;s consent to a non-profit body&#146;s change of
constitution is to ensure that it retains its non-profit status and
housing focus and cannot realise and distribute publicly funded social
housing assets. As my right hon. Friend is aware, we are introducing
amendments to strengthen that system, and I suggest that that is
irrelevant to profit-making bodies.</div>

						</b> This is another take on the
classification of housing associations, but it also raises an important
question about their rightful independence and their ability to manage

					<a name="08013014000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">its rules and
articles. That is a sound principle for regulation, and it would
provide a safeguard in relation to the classification issue, which we
have discussed already&#151;I do not intend to repeat the details,
because the arguments have been well rehearsed. I shall say no more
than that the amendments would provide one 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column638" />Column number: 638</div>further safeguard. I expect the Minister to say that he will consider
the amendments along with the other issues identified as part of the
general appraisal of the structure of this part of the Bill. If he can
provide that undertaking, I shall happily seek leave to withdraw the

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013014000743"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> In order to make progress, I am tempted just to
say yes and sit down, but I cannot do that. I intend to consider the
matter further, but I would prefer to provide a slightly longer answer.
As with most things that my right hon. Friend does, I have much
sympathy with amendment No. 46. As he has said, it is designed to
maintain the independence of RSLs. However, I do not believe that the
amendments are necessary, because I am satisfied that the Bill
preserves that independence. Having said that, I shall reconsider the
whole matter.</div>
					<a name="08013014000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
several concerns about how the proposal would work in practice. I am
concerned that providers would exploit it in order to evade standards.
Furthermore, constitutions cannot be changed easily. Under clauses 188
and 190, non-profit providers will require the regulator&#146;s
consent to such changes, or the Charity Commission&#146;s consent if
the provider is a charity. Given that profit-making providers can
change their constitutions without the regulator&#146;s consent, such
a provider could, in theory, change its constitution so that a
particularly disliked standard did not apply. Without first checking
every provider&#146;s constitution, it would be impossible for the
regulator to be absolutely certain that its standards were not in
conflict.</div>
				
					<a name="08013014000692"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div>
					<a name="08013014000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Contracts can
easily be entered into by providers. The regulator cannot restrict such
transactions, save during a moratorium when a provider is insolvent or,
under Government new clauses 55 and 56&#151;should they be
accepted&#151;during or following a public inquiry into a
provider&#146;s affairs to protect the provider&#146;s tenants or
assets. I would be concerned about allowing providers such an easy
means of evasion.</div>
					<a name="08013014000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second concern is that such opt-outs might lead to a multi-speed
regulatory system in which every provider has a different set of
standards. Our aim is to have a clear set of standards that deliver
equivalent outcomes to tenants, regardless of the identity of their
landlord, notwithstanding our debates on a whole range of issues in
this regard. I suggest that the amendment would make that harder to
achieve.</div>
					<a name="08013014000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, and
most vividly, the amendments would make it unclear who should judge
whether a standard violates a constitution, contract or charitable
status. If it is not the regulator or provider, the issue might end up
in the courts, which would be expensive and time-consuming. We do not
want this issue to dominate the regulator&#146;s time or to delay the
standard-setting process if that can be avoided. As regards charitable
status, we would have to be absolutely sure what it meant, especially
with unregulated
charities.</div>
					<a name="08013014000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 48 does the same as amendment No. 46 but in relation to clause 174,
and some of the same issues apply. I recognise that the regulator needs
to handle governance according to the nature of the organisation, and
that it already has slightly separate powers in relation to charitable
housing associations. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column639" />Column number: 639</div>Whatever standards it sets in considering what enforcement action, if
any, to take in the event of a provider&#146;s non-compliance, the
regulator will have discretion. It will have to act within its
fundamental objectives, including, as I am fond of
saying, minimising interference and acting proportionately within its
compliance code.</div>
					<a name="08013014000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new enforcement powers in chapter 7 will give providers an opportunity
to make representations before the regulator acts, and to offer
undertakings. If a registered provider has genuine, good reasons for
not complying with a particular standard&#151;for example, if its
constitution does not permit it to carry out a particular
activity&#151;I imagine that the regulator would act
sensibly.</div>

co-operate with the guidance and regulations set down by the new
regulator. Will he describe the problem for which this regulation is

up to the plate a great deal to ensure that tenants are well provided

Second Reading. My hon. Friends the Members for West Ham and for
Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry) have talked about

						</b> The Minister&#146;s case against accepting
the amendments is twofold. First, there might a temptation for some
providers&#151;possibly private sector providers&#151;to abuse the
powers in order to limit regulatory burdens. Secondly, it could result
in excessive complications and possibly litigation if the regulator
were to set standards that were, in any respect, in conflict with the
articles of any legal registered body. There are answers to both those
points. The whole purpose of the regulation should not be driven by the
tail, but by the dog. As the hon. Member for St. Ives pointed out, the
vast majority of registered social landlords are only too happy to have
articles and memorandums that are consistent with the standards that
are likely to be set. Therefore, there is a sense of an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column640" />Column number: 640</div>argument being used on the basis of a minority, rather than majority.
Nevertheless, I accept that it is a concern that the Minister
raises.</div>
					<a name="08013014000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the second
issue, frankly, the regulator will take legal advice on any standards
that are set. The regulator will be satisfied if the standards are
compatible with the aims, objectives, articles and memorandums of the
majority of bodies that are registered with it. It would be very
foolish for them to be otherwise, as that would inevitably invite
litigation. I do not see that as a really serious obstacle,
particularly if there are models, rules and articles that will be
adopted by the overwhelming majority of bodies that seek registration.
They will probably seek advice from the same legal experts who will be
advising the regulator. One thing that we can be quite certain about is
that the lawyers will do well out of this process. I am not sure that I
entirely go along with the Minister&#146;s arguments, but I accept,
with a degree of sympathy, his good faith in wanting to look at the
matter further. I therefore beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08013014000749"></a>Sir
George Young:
						</b> I want to press the Minister on subsection
(2), which looks remarkably like a list to me. It sets out the
standards with which registered providers have to comply. Subsection
(2)(e) is on the levels of rent. I would have said that the level of
rent is what one pays for a standard, rather than its being a standard
itself. I am concerned that some very sensitive decisions about rent
levels will be subcontracted to the regulator. I want to press the
Minister on the freedom that the regulator might have. Rent levels are
enormously sensitive economic and political indicators. They impact on
inflation, on public expenditure through housing benefit and on the
number of new homes that are going to be built, because that affects
the income of a housing association.</div>
					<a name="08013014000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder whether the Minister
is going to leave to the regulator this total discretion on rent
levels, including provision for minimum or maximum levels, or whether
the Secretary of State will give a direction on this under clause 177.
When local authority homes come within the embrace of the regulator,
will he really set the level of local authority rents, as well as
housing association rents? The Minister looks puzzled, and I am waiting
to hear what the answer might be. If the social housing regulator is
going to set the level of rents for local authorities, that is a
serious move in respect of the autonomy of local authorities
and the consequences on the housing revenue account. Also, such a move
might have consequences for any attempts to harmonise rents if they did
not come within the ambit of the social housing regulator. If he is
going to have this level of discretion under subsection (2)(e), do we
have any idea what principles he will follow? Will he move towards
market rents, or towards cost rents? Will he use the existing rents
plus the retail price index? This is an enormous discretion to give
him. I suspect that the Minister may say that under clause 177, the
Secretary of State will constrain that discretion for the reasons that
I have given. If so, when we come to clause 177, perhaps the Minister
might outline what parameters he will put around subsection (2)(e), so
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column641" />Column number: 641</div>housing association tenants know roughly what sort of regime will be
introduced by the social housing regulator.</div>

						<a name="08013014000750"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Andy Slaughter</b> (Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush) (Lab):
I entirely agree with the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire
about the wide ambit of the provisions under subsection (2), even
though they may be qualified by intervention and direction, and so
forth. In my view, it is right to keep that ambit wide&#151;the
assumption must be that it will be used in the exception rather than
the rule. However, a problem has been articulated by a number of
members of the Committee, and when social landlords are not fulfilling
the function that I am sure most of us would wish to see them fulfil,
tinkering at the edges will not be an acceptable provision.</div>
					<a name="08013014000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I spoke on Second Reading
I alluded to an example of getting the balance right in a particular
area in terms of housing supply. It may be a question not simply of the
number of units but the type of units&#151;mixed tenure estates, for
example&#151;and the emphasis being on renting rather than shared or
intermediate ownership. That is a particular problem, as I have said,
with both local authority and RSL provision. On Second Reading, I was
highly critical of a number of RSLs operating in west London. I
received a comment from one of the leading RSLs that I
criticised&#151;Notting Hill housing trust&#151;and this is an
example of why it is necessary to have this stick in reserve, as it
were.</div>
					<a name="08013014000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said that in
the rush to home ownership, renting tenants of that association were
being neglected. Its response was that it was true that it gives a lot
of emphasis to helping tenants fulfil their home ownership aspirations,
but it did not do that at the expense of those tenants who did not
want, or could not yet afford, to take on the responsibilities and
costs associated with home ownership. Nor did it proceed at the expense
of those who were not able to secure social housing. That language has
exactly the same ring as the paragraph that I quoted during last
Thursday&#146;s sitting, about the Opposition&#146;s policy review
document. I hope that I am not digressing too far&#151;it may be more
of a point of order than a contribution, but we will see.</div>
					<a name="08013014000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The quotation
in question came from the Conservative policy review, and I never tire
of repeating
it:</div>
					<a name="08013014000656"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Living in
social housing should be viewed as a transition during which support is
temporarily required before moving up the &#145;ladder&#146; to
some form of shared or outright
ownership,&#148;</div>
					<a name="08013014000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
quotation, which I constantly see parroted by RSLs as well as by
Conservative local authorities, was not attributed in the <i class="I">Official
Report</i>. In other words, there is no indication at that stage,
although I am certain that I gave it, as to where that quotation came
from. I know where it came from, because when the hon. Member for
Welwyn Hatfield leapt to his feet, or got slowly to his feet, a column
later, at column 544, in an anxiety to put some distance&#151;some
clear blue water&#151;between his own policy review and his Front
Bench, he
said:</div>

they should. I am slightly deviating from the subject, but the point is

provide their property. I want confirmation that their contribution
will be in proportion to their interests within the area. There are
many circumstances in which they might have a small collection of
properties that have been developed as a result of a quota on a site,
which is primarily and predominantly private sector development.
However, it would be inappropriate if, as a result of the standards set
by the regulator, RSLs had to provide a disproportionate contribution
to the environmental, social and economic well-being of the area and,
thus, let off the private sector provider of the bulk of the
properties. There are many times when, particularly in rural
areas, the local playing field or local environmental parking
arrangements and other facilities provide for the whole of the
community, not only those living in the small collection of houses
provided by RSLs. I would much appreciate the Minister putting it on

							<a name="08013014000754"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire
made a good point about standards and rents. I think that I am clear
about such matters: the regulator will be able to set standards for the
rent policy for registered providers. Under clause 177, I expect
directions from the Secretary of State to apply with regard to
standards in respect of registered provider rents. I have said that I
will look again at the issue. The Cave report was clear that standards
should be set with regard to the rent-setting regime. That is an
important line in the
sand.</div>
					<a name="08013014000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the right
hon. Gentleman hinted during his contribution, rent-setting is
important to the whole housing benefit bill and wider Government
economic policy. It is right and proper that the Secretary of State has
the ability to direct the regulator to set a standard with regard to
registered provider rents. Initially, I expect that to operate along
the same lines as the rent-influencing regime, but the right hon.
Gentleman 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column643" />Column number: 643</div>mentioned an important point about local authorities. In a sense, he hit
the nail on the head as to why we cannot have the single domain
regulator.</div>
					<a name="08013014000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
real practical difficulties. The right hon. Gentleman said that huge
issues would need to be addressed, which is what the advisory group
headed by Professor Ian Cole from Sheffield is doing at present. We are
considering how regulations and standards could apply to the local
authority stock, which is one of the reasons why we could not move more
quickly to a single domain regulator.</div>
					<a name="08013014000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon. Member for

Wright:
						</b> The governance and viability of registered
providers will be a central concern of the new regulator. A poorly run
or non-viable provider will inevitably be bad for tenants and might
become insolvent&#151;something that has happened in recent weeks.
That should be avoided if possible and cannot be allowed to impact on
the security of tenants&#146; homes. Clause 174 gives the regulator
the power to set standards for registered non-profit providers relating
to the management of their financial and other affairs. The amendments
will also permit such standards to be set for profit-making providers,
but only in respect of the social housing that they own, because, for
example, the regulator might need to ensure that profit-making
providers make adequate financial provision to cover future repair
costs of social
housing.</div>
					<a name="08013014000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
mentioned on a number of occasions&#151;certainly this
morning&#151;during the Committee&#146;s deliberations, we expect
social housing activities to form a much smaller proportion of the
overall business of registered profit-making providers than of existing
RSLs. As a result, it would be disproportionate for the regulator to
set standards for governance and viability for all of the affairs of a
profit-making provider. Shareholders and other owners hold to account
the board of a share-distributing, private company. However, to the
extent that threats to governance and viability might jeopardise the
necessary protections we are seeking to secure for social housing
tenants, the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column644" />Column number: 644</div>regulator should have a more limited role in setting standards for the
proper conduct of a profit-making body&#146;s social housing
business.</div>
					<a name="08013014000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Montgomeryshire is not here, but he raised a number of
issues this morning about amendment No. 230. He asked how it relates to
clause 123. The point is that good housing management might require a
provider to put aside enough money for repairs, as I mentioned earlier,
to which the ability to make accounting directions is relevant. The
provider might need contingent liabilities on a range of things that
need to be addressed, and it is necessary for accounts to show that.
Financial viability standards for profit-making providers are likely to
involve ensuring sufficient money or liability to make repairs a
practical concern. I hope that the hon. Member for St. Ives will pass
that on to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire. This is a sensible
group of amendments that will ensure that tenants of social housing are
adequately protected. I hope that hon. Members will accept
them.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013014000758"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> I have discussed this matter with my hon. Friend
the Member for Montgomeryshire, who welcomes the amendments, which are
in the spirit of those to which he spoke in this morning&#146;s
sitting. I welcome the amendments. My only question to the Minister
concerns the restrictions in amendment No. 231, which
states:</div>
					<a name="08013014000659"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
respect of profit-making registered providers, standards may be made in
relation to the management of their affairs only so far as relating to
the provision of social
housing&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08013014000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that
respect, presumably by defining social housing as that part of the
stock provided by the profit-making registered provider, can a local
authority have some influence on allocations to those properties?
Perhaps there is another definition of what the social housing element
of the profit-making provider is. I encourage the Minister to expand
his definition of the extent to which regulation should apply to
profit-making
providers.</div>
					<a name="08013014000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely, in
some circumstances, the public sector and the taxpayer have an
interest, for example when a property is occupied by a tenant who is in
receipt of housing benefit, when some form of grant aid has contributed
to the renovation or upkeep of a property, when public money has been
spent through a disabled facilities grant to enable it to be used by
someone who has a particular need, or when a property is sub-let by a
local authority. The latter circumstance is common these days in areas
of high housing demand stress. A private sector provider of rented
accommodation could make a property available, perhaps on a short-term
basis, to a local authority, so that the authority can meet its local
housing obligation.</div>
					<a name="08013014000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful if the Minister explained a little more about the
extent to which amendment No. 231 will apply to profit-making
providers. How will the measure apply? To what extent can the measure
be extended to ensure that the tenants of profit-making providers of
such housing are protected by the
regulations?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013014000759"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I am not certain that I follow the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s line of questioning. He made a number of points
about the definition of social housing. He should go back to the
comprehensive and detailed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column645" />Column number: 645</div>deliberations on the definition that we heard when we debated clauses 66
to 69. From the manner in which he spoke&#151;he can correct me if I
am wrong&#151;it seemed that he was suggesting that he tabled an
amendment to introduce a similar measure, which he wanted to be a
back-door way of regulating the private rented sector. My hon. Friend
the Member for West Ham is nodding furiously at that. However, as I
said, that is not practical at the moment.</div>
					<a name="08013014000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">My basic premise on for-profit
providers is that it is sensible for the regulator to have assurance
that they will not go bust and leave tenants high and dry. The
regulator needs to ensure that the financial and governance
arrangements for that particular provision of social housing are
adequately addressed. I do not see that as moving any further towards
the regulation of the private rented sector, but I stand to be
corrected.

the basis on which it is provided? The remainder of that stock is not

						</b> Again, the hon. Gentleman was not here this
morning when I talked about a sort of murkiness of providers. I meant
that in the best possible sense, not in a corrupt manner. I meant that
previously, from 1974 onwards, social housing was provided by housing
associations and market housing by private sector developments, and
that we now have much more cross-fertilisation, for want of a better
term. I also pointed out that private sector developments might provide
money and housing that would be available on the open market, and might
cross-subsidise by providing social housing in addition to grants from
the Homes and Communities Agency and other such public funding. That
cross-fertilisation is important. The regulator needs reassurance
regarding the financial viability of that element of social
housing.</div>

						</b> This is an important clause. We have been made
very aware of that today, and I hope that the Committee will recognise,
from the points that I have made in earlier discussions and
deliberations on amendments, that I am going to look at this issue
comprehensively. I hope that interested parties, stakeholders and
Members will be involved in that process.</div>
					<a name="08013014000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government amendments Nos. 234
to 237 and amendment No. 49 refer to clause 177, which permits the
Secretary of State to issue directions to the regulator, to set a
standard or to advise on the content of standards with which the
regulator must comply. It is also required that the Secretary of State
consult on the directions and publish them. As I have said, I am aware
of concerns and I will try to do something about them; the amendments
are likely to be consistent with whatever final position I bring
forward.</div>
					<a name="08013014000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 234 and amendment No. 49 seek to achieve the same
goal&#151;to ensure that any directions given by the Secretary of
State do not conflict with the regulator&#146;s fundamental
objectives, as given at clause 86. We can all agree that that is an
important control on the Government&#146;s ability to tell the
regulator what to do, and in mitigating against the risk, which we have
mentioned many times in Committee, of policy passporting with regard to
registered providers.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column648" />Column number: 648</div>
					<a name="08013014000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The objectives include&#151;I
have mentioned this important point time and again&#151;requiring the
regulator to minimise interference. We do not believe that the
Secretary of State could compel the regulator to act outside its
objectives, even without the amendments, but it is worth while
addressing these concerns and making the point explicitly the Bill. The
two amendments are slightly differently worded, and in my view both
would probably work, although naturally I prefer Government amendment
No. 234 because it recognises implicitly that the objectives need to be
balanced, and that there will be trade-offs.</div>
					<a name="08013014000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I again refer Members to clause
86, subsection (13) of which
states:</div>
					<a name="08013014000662"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
order in which the objectives are listed in this section is not
significant; the regulator shall balance them as it thinks
appropriate.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08013014000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments Nos. 235 and 237 deal with the potential problem of double
consultation; I hope that that addresses the point that was made in
connection with the earlier group of amendments. The Secretary of State
will consult on the issue of direction, and the regulator will have to
consult on it again, under the requirement in clause 176, before
issuing it as a standard. The whole Committee will be aware that that
could be very slow and duplicative process. That is why we have
included clause 177(5), which makes it unnecessary for the regulator to
consult when it is complying with a direction.
However, I have reconsidered that subsection. In some cases, the
Secretary of State could issue a detailed direction&#151;on rent
policy, for example&#151;which the regulator could then implement
without the need for further consultation because it had made no
substantive additions to the
direction.</div>
					<a name="08013014000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">In most
cases, we expect that a direction will be strategic, not detailed, and
that the regulator would add the detail. In such cases, the regulator
should be required to consult again. We think that the Secretary of
State needs more discretion here. Amendment No. 237 proposes to remove
clause 177(5), and in amendment No. 235 I propose adding a replacement
provision that would allow the Secretary of State, by direction, to
disapply the requirement in clause 176 for the regulator to consult on
matters specified in that direction. That would allow the Secretary of
State to decide whether additional consultation was needed on an issue
on which they had
directed.</div>
					<a name="08013014000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 236 proposes to add two lines to clause 177(4), which currently
requires the Secretary of State to publish each direction. The
amendment ensures that the Secretary of State will publish three
things: the proposed direction on which they have been consulted, all
responses to the consultation, and the final direction. That is
intended to improve and enhance the quality and transparency of
consultation. I hope that the amendments clarify the measure and that
they show the direction of travel that we want to move in. On that
basis, I hope that the Committee will accept the Government amendments
and reject amendment No.
49.</div>

that, providing regard had been had to the powers, that was sufficient
to satisfy the

					<a name="08013014000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The bottom line
is that there is concern that the power of direction is extensive. It
is almost as far as that power in relation to the HCA, which is a
public body. Issues have been raised, such as whether the power will
have public sector borrowing requirement implications or whether we are
moving the whole sector into the public sector because of the degree of
direction and the like. We would just like to put on the record that we
have a fear of that happening and, accordingly, when the provision is
considered again, we are interested to make sure that the power of
direction should not be as strong and that there should be no doubt
about where the sector boundaries
lie.</div>

slightly pessimistic. Had the Government&#146;s amendment said that
the Secretary of State shall have regard to the regulator&#146;s
fundamental objectives, and it was assumed that the Secretary of State
could then ignore items that she did not agree with, the hon.

putting the case that I do not think that such matters are exactly the

provided we have had regard to something, we would have satisfied the
test of having regard. It means that we might be able to move in a
different direction. However, all will be cleared up in the future to
show that my pessimism was entirely unjustified and that matters will
not work that way. We have discussed the implications of the provision,

the argument of the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire that, as

position of the Secretary of State in significantly more vaguely
drafted terms that would clearly increase her capacity to intervene in
future. Earlier, I spoke of my worry about the wording of Government
amendment No. 235 on the extent to which the Secretary of State may
disapply the requirement to consult in respect of &#147;specified

number of occasions that I will look at the provisions again and bear
in mind the points raised in the Cave report about raising standards

Committee, so I put on the record that when I spoke today about
consulting with hon. Members, stakeholders and the wider RSL sector, I
did not want the Committee to think that I will be undertaking a formal

creditors of registered providers. That is eminently sensible in that
the regulator should not do anything that destabilises the financing of
housing associations. The question is, if it were sensible for the
regulator to consult those bodies before he did anything to the
standards, why are those bodies not included in clause 177(2)? It is
identical in every other respect except that it excludes the interests

Raynsford:
						</b> The Committee is probably relieved that this is
the last group of amendments that I shall move. It tidies up one of the
remaining concerns about the specific powers of the regulator, and how
the regulator will look at standards and use evidence of a failure to
meet standards as a basis for intervention with a failing provider. It
is important for the regulator to have this power. It is right that the
regulator should intervene if a provider has not met proper standards
and that has resulted in substandard management, misconduct or other
unfortunate circumstances that adversely impact on tenants or possibly
on public
finances.</div>
					<a name="08013014000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
question about the importance of a regulatory regime that allows
intervention. There is, of course, a question as to whether the
regulatory regime is proportionate, encourages good practice and avoids
the worst type of tick-box mentality that simply wants people to say
that they have done certain things in order to satisfy the regulator
that standards have been
met.</div>
					<a name="08013014000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
amendment No. 50 is to specify that the regulator, in exercising his
powers to secure the proper management of the affairs of a registered
provider, may have regard, among other matters, to the extent to which
standards have or have not been followed when deciding whether
misconduct or mismanagement have occurred. That seems to be a sound
basis for the regulator reaching a judgment about the need to intervene
or to take action to remedy a failure without the risk of becoming
unduly prescriptive on the one side or unduly tokenistic&#151;the
tick-box mentality that I already described&#151;on the
other.</div>
					<a name="08013014000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other two
amendments, which are about management tenders, are designed to leave
out in clauses 223 and 225 the provision that states that a section
applies if</div>
					<a name="08013014000663"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a registered
provider has failed to meet a
standard&#148;</div>
					<a name="08013014000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">because
it simply creates as the test the fact that a standard has not been
satisfied. There is the danger, as I said, that people will look solely
at the extent to which the letter of the provision has been satisfied
when determining whether there has been a failure. Unfortunately, it
will probably lead to a more mechanistic, more tokenistic approach to
regulation than I would
like.</div>
					<a name="08013014000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the amendments is to delete the automatic
provision for intervention if there has been a failure to meet a
standard. Instead, there is a wider provision for the regulator to have
regard to the failure to meet a standard in deciding whether
mismanagement or misconduct have occurred; therefore, there is a need
for intervention.</div>
					<a name="08013014000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will say that
the amendments are unduly restrictive because they retain the tests of
mismanagement and misconduct that are part of the current regime. I
believe that those tests are important because, ultimately, regulation
should not be about simply seeing whether people satisfy a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column653" />Column number: 653</div>particular test and ticking the box, but seeing whether they are
managing properly and effectively, and are not guilty of
misconduct.</div>
					<a name="08013014000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have not
tabled the amendments with any great expectation that they will be
accepted, but I hope that they reinforce the case that I have made that
the whole regulatory framework needs to be reviewed to ensure that we
have the right balance between effectiveness on the one side and
appropriateness and proportionality on the other. For the reasons that
I have outlined in previous debates as well as this one, I still think
that there are grounds for concern about the clauses in this section of
the Bill. I look forward to further discussion in due course on
amendments that my hon. Friend may wish to introduce on Report or at
subsequent stages to ensure that we have the best possible regulatory
framework.</div>

						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 335, in
clause 181, page 70, line 33, leave
out subsections (4) to
(7).</div>
					<a name="08013014000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">This amendment
has the vocal support of my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire.
Its purpose is self-evident. RSLs would not wish to heap upon
themselves unnecessary costs, but owing to the way in which the clause
is drafted, inspection costs could be heaped at relatively short
notice. One does not know what those costs will be, and they could be
generated for purely vexatious but insubstantial reasons that might
none the less need to be satisfied at the expense of the RSL.</div>
					<a name="08013014000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that some of the
inspections might need to be made at relatively short notice, they
cannot be budgeted for. All the arguments are self-evident. As
discussed previously, the clause will place RSLs at a disadvantage
compared with competitors that do not need to meet those regulations
and inspection costs. For all those reasons, RSLs will need reassuring
that if costs are to be applied, they will be proportionate. As
drafted, however, the clause does not provide that reassurance. It is
best, therefore, that we delete subsections (4) to (7) to ensure that
RSLs are properly protected from unplanned expenditure that in many
cases might be brought upon them in a climate of
over-regulation.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013014000793"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I disagree fundamentally with the amendment. On a
point of principle, it is right that a registered provider
suspected of failing to meet standards should be required to pay. The
alternatives, about which we could argue, are that the costs be met by
all registered providers or by the taxpayer. However, I disagree with
both of those. In some cases, it might not be in the interests of the
tenants for the registered provider to be charged the full costs of an
inspection, which is why we envisage that the regulator&#146;s scale
of fees will provide for the size or turnover of the registered
provider and other circumstances affecting the provider&#146;s
ability to afford the full
fees.</div>
					<a name="08013014000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman must agree that we need some controls on the power, which is
why we have proposed that the Secretary of State may authorise the
regulator to charge fees under clause 181(4) and that, before doing so,
he must also consult with the regulator, the Audit Commission and
persons representing providers, under subsection (6). Before charging
fees, the regulator must prescribe a scale of fees, on which it should
consult with the Secretary of State and persons representing providers,
as set out in subsection (7). I am fairly convinced that the regime as
set out in the Bill is appropriate and right in principle. On that
basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div>

charges would be applied only if a housing association were found
guilty of the accusations behind the inspection, that would be
reasonable. I am concerned, however, that the regulator might be
perpetually inspecting a perfectly acceptable housing association that
provides an excellent service but is simply under the cosh of
complainants pursuing vexatious complaints against it, thereby forcing
it to meet excessive costs.</div>

to seek reassurance from the Minister and the

then have to meet the costs of the inspection.</div>

						</b> New clause 40 is linked to clause 182, which
allows the regulator to require registered providers to prepare an
annual report assessing their performance by reference to the standards
under clause 173, and then to send it to the regulator and to specify
what the report should cover. That allows the regulator to get the
information that it needs to monitor and enforce good housing
management, supplemented by additional information collected under
clause 104 or inspection reports under clause
181.</div>
					<a name="08013014000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it is
fair to say that tenants, local authorities and others also need useful
information on landlord performance so that they can compare the
service different landlords offer and help hold them to account. New
clause 40 places a duty on the regulator to provide information at
least once a year. It specifies that the information includes that
likely to be useful to tenants, potential tenants and local
authorities. It could include, for example, its assessment of
performance, self-assessments, the outcome of inspections and tenant
satisfaction data. It will help to achieve the recommendations of the
Cave review. Martin Cave saw the regulator as publishing comparative
information and effective local league tables for registered providers
so that tenants and others could compare performance within the same
local area, similar to those for schools, universities and
hospitals.</div>

It allows the regulator to arrange for the publication of the
inquirer&#146;s report, rather than publish the report itself. This
simply adds flexibility to the process. It may be, for example, that
the person conducting the inquiry might also publish the report. The
decision as to whether the report or part of it should be published at
all will be strictly a decision for the regulator. It might
decide not to publish all or parts of a report, for example,
where it contains commercially sensitive information. It is a sensible
amendment, and I hope that Committee members will accept it.</div>

George:
						</b> In relation to our earlier debate following the
amendments moved by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich
and in relation to clauses 172 to 174, the right hon. Gentleman
suggested that in order to protect the independence of the RSLs, it is
important that they can reflect it in their memoranda and articles of
association, their constitution and so on. What troubles me here, and
this is reflected in these clauses, is the extent to which the
regulator, under both clause 188 and clause 189, must first, in the
case of industrial and provident societies, have consented under clause
188(3) to any changes that the RSL wishes to make to the
society&#146;s rules. Similarly, under clause 189(3), the regulator
must be consulted by the Charity Commission if someone seeks to make an
amendment. To an extent, we have debated this issue before. The
Minister has reassured the Committee that these bodies retain their
independence, but what troubles some of us is that these two clauses
suggest that their independence is not entirely maintained by the
extent to which the regulator can intervene. The Charity Commission has
to be consulted and the regulator has to give consent to the changes
that may be proposed by housing associations that are registered as
industrial and provident societies. I simply seek some reassuring
statement from the Minister with regard to these two
clauses.</div>

						</b> I am not certain what the hon. Gentleman is
getting at. I think that we have covered this issue fairly
substantially. I think that what he is saying is that he is concerned
that the regulator will intervene in a disproportionate manner in
regard to the activities of the registered providers. My very clear
intention, which I have expressed to the Committee, is that that is
precisely what we want to avoid. Modern regulatory regimes modelled on
other industries suggest that we should be proportionate, have a light
touch, and should minimise interference wherever possible, and that is
locked into the regulator&#146;s objectives, as set out in clause 86.
I am very keen to reassure the hon. Gentleman, but the situation is as
it always has been. I could look at <i class="I">Hansard </i>to see whether I
have missed something, but I would have thought that the parameters
that I have just outlined provided that

penalty or fine. Again, and as with similar amendments, the measures
are technical.</div>
					<a name="08013014000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments will allow penalties to be used if registered providers fail
to pay an annual registration fee, require a penalty notice to specify
how that must be paid, and what interest or additional penalty is
payable in the event of late payment. They will allow the notice to
require that the provider publishes information about the penalty. They
explain details of how the penalty and interest is to be paid and
enforced, appeal rights, and the consequences for prosecution of a
penalty imposed for a criminal offence. They also refer to clause 206,
which I shall come to later and which we propose to remove from the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08013014000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
remove an erroneous reference to clause 232 in the context of combining
warning notices before enforcement action, and require that a copy of
the penalty notice is sent to the Homes and Communities Agency. As I

accept them on that

					<a name="08013014000443"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the

Bearing in mind that whatever charges are made in penalties, they will
ultimately find their way back to the tenants of the providers.
Presumably, they will be required to find the money to help the
providers to pay the fines.</div>
					<a name="08013014000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">Has the Department thought
through any indicative level of fines, so that we know what new costs
are being added? I raise that in the context of the regulatory burden
being imposed. I understand that it is assumed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column664" />Column number: 664</div>to be about &#163;15 to &#163;20 per house in the housing
association sector. The Bill might add something like &#163;10 a
house, so it all adds up to a big sum at the end of the day. Are we
talking about indicative fines or about housing associations and
registered providers having to find substantial amounts of
money?</div>

						</b> As the hon. Gentleman is aware, we will discuss
penalty notices in the clause 206 stand part debate. The regulator will
have the power to set the general level of penalty notices for
registered providers. We propose that it should be able to require
financial penalties of no more than &#163;5,000. The point has been
made, certainly on Second Reading, that what we are trying to do is
almost an exercise of naming and shaming rather than financially
penalising registered providers. I should not like penalties to be
imposed because I hope that registered providers will give tenants a
good service, but it is a means by which we can publicise it when
housing services have not been what they should be. So the fines will
be subject to a limit somewhere around the &#163;5,000 mark, but we
will consider that
further.</div>

							<a name="08013014000831"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> We have already had a brief debate on the
matter before us, but clause 207 deals with the amount of a penalty
charge. I have a number of points to raise with the Minister about the
thinking behind the clause. First, in subsection (2), a clear link is
made between the amount of a penalty in case 5&#151;in which a
registered provider has given an undertaking and failed to comply with
it&#151;and the maximum amount of fine that a magistrates court could
impose for the relevant offence. That linkage does not apply in any of
the other cases.</div>
					<a name="08013014000465"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have been told that the figure of &#163;5,000 stated in subsection
(3) might be subject to reconsideration, because the Government are
anxious that it should not jeopardise a provider&#146;s viability.
However, for many of the larger providers, &#163;5,000 will not
present a serious risk to their viability, and would probably have very
little impact on their thinking. I suppose that my second point,
therefore, is about the concept of proportionality in fines relating to
the size and capacity of the organisation and to its ability to deliver
services. The degree of the offence that has merited the fine does not
appear to be set out in the Bill. Will guidance be given to the
regulator on introducing the concept of proportionality?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column666" />Column number: 666</div>
					<a name="08013014000466"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, the Minister mentioned
compensation to tenants as a further option, in the light of which he
withdrew clause 206, which required the regulator to consider the
impact of a penalty on a provider&#146;s ability to provide services
or on its financial viability. That, of course, raises questions about
the extent to which compensation to tenants should be an overriding
entitlement, owing to the landlord&#146;s failure to provide services
that he ought to, and about whether such a penalty will be considered
in proportion to its possible impact on the viability of an
organisation and its ability to deliver services. There is probably
quite a lot of uncertainty, and scope for some pretty messy decisions,
if greater thought is not given to how the regime will operate. I would
welcome the Minister&#146;s thoughts on that, not necessarily today,
but certainly before the Bill completes its passage in this
House.</div>
					<a name="08013014000467"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013014000832"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I appreciate my right hon. Friend&#146;s last
point about providing an outline of where I think that this needs to
go. He was extremely kind and gracious on that.</div>
					<a name="08013014000468"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall expand on points that I
made earlier in discussion with the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire. The setting of penalties requires a careful balance. It
is quite right that &#163;5,000 could be a very low-level fine for
some large housing associations, but for others it could represent a
significant financial penalty. In any case, the aim of the fine is
explicitly not to bankrupt the provider, or to inhibit in any way the
provider&#146;s social housing activities. I see it as a way publicly
to rebuke the provider for minor problems, and to prevent those
problems from getting worse. There are a range of powers at the
regulator&#146;s disposal should the breaches get worse, to the point
at which it could intervene much more directly. However, I think the
question of balance is
important.</div>
					<a name="08013014000469"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come back
to one of my favourite parts of the Bill, clause 86, and objective 10
regarding proportionality, which my right hon. Friend mentioned.
Proportionality is important both for objectives and for penalties, and
the regulator will have to have regard to that. On that basis, I will
take up my right hon. Friend&#146;s invitation to write and express
my thoughts more clearly. I hope, however, that I have reassured
him.</div>

						</b> This group of amendments and new clause 46 relate
to clauses 213 to 222, which permit the regulator to require registered
providers to compensate tenants for the provider&#146;s failures. The
amendments are technical. They require the regulator to take account of
the provider&#146;s financial standing and the effect on services
when issuing compensation notices, a point that we have just touched
on. They require the compensation notice to specify what interest or
additional compensation is payable in the event of a late payment. They
allow the notice to require that the provider publish information on
the compensation; they require the notice to explain how payment of the
compensation and any interest on it are to be enforced, and to explain
appeal rights. They require the regulator to consult the ombudsman
before issuing a pre-compensation notice&#151;that is, a warning
notice&#151;to avoid dual compensation for the same failing. They
also require the regulator to say whether a voluntary undertaking could
be accepted in place of a compensation notice, as per other
powers.</div>

could be the length of time it might take for a victim of poor
performance by an RSL to receive their compensation. Will the Minister
also clarify under what circumstances the regulator would accept a
voluntary undertaking rather than compensation? Obviously, that would
impact on whether the tenant&#146;s just demands were granted, with
regard to the kinds of offences that the regulatory body had identified
the RSL as having failed to deal

undertakings, I point out to my hon. Friend that, as the clauses and
amendments on enforcement notices and penalty powers suggest, the
regulator will be required to state in a notice whether it will
consider a voluntary undertaking. In many cases it might not, but that
is for the regulator to decide. I shall be frank with my hon. Friend:
it was an oversight that that provision was not also included in the
compensation power. I suggest to her that voluntary undertakings could
encourage a provider to resolve its problem in its own way without the
need for top-down intervention. That would be a good thing and might
help the regulator to ensure that tenants&#146; concerns are
addressed. I hope that she is reassured by
that.</div>

service extends outside social housing and has a certain competence in
the private rented sector. Whether or not the Minister has seen the

minor. Amendments Nos. 288 and 289 clarify the power in clause 227 that
relates to strengthening a registered provider by the appointment of an
individual special manager rather than an organisation providing
management services. If the regulator wanted the provider to appoint an
organisation to manage social housing, it could require a tender under
clause 223, or transfer to another provider under clause 225. Where a

290 enables that notice to be combined with other pre-enforcement

notices. Amendment No. 291 keeps the HCA aware of the position on
enforcement at a registered provider. It requires the regulator to
notify the agency of the regulator&#146;s appointment of a special
manager under clause 227(2)(a), or its requirement under clause
227(2)(b) that such a

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013014000849"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> This clause relates to the removal of officers.
It gives power to the regulator, in certain circumstances, to get rid
of the directors, trustees or committee members of not-for-profit
organisations. My question relates to the fact that the vast majority
of the cases under which the regulator has a power to act are to do
with technical matters where the person is either bankrupt or has been
disqualified under the Companies Act, or is incapable because of mental

<div class="Column"><a name="Column672" />Column number: 672</div>disorder from performing his functions. Subsection (9) provides the
seventh case, which applies to
a</div>
					<a name="08013014000673"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;person who is impeding
the proper management of the registered
provider&#148;</div>
					<a name="08013014000536"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;it goes
on to say&#151;</div>
					<a name="08013014000674"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by
reason of absence or failure to
act&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08013014000537"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have been
cases of people who, for a variety of reasons, have seriously
mismanaged housing associations. There was a strong case for their
removal but that was not because of absence or failure to act. It was
because of their malpractice. I am surprised that, unless I am
misreading the provisions, there does not appear to be any power to
enable the regulator to remove someone who has been capricious and
incompetent or who has been acting in a way that has squandered the
resources of the organisation. In earlier discussions, I referred to
the affairs of the Ujima housing association, where it appears that
there is quite strong evidence that there was mismanagement by
senior members of that association. That
mismanagement contributed to the financial difficulties that ultimately
led to the association having to be transferred into the ownership of
another one. This is not some theoretical case but a real-life
circumstance and a situation where there could well be a need for
judicious action on the part of the regulator to safeguard an
association whose long-term health and viability is being put at risk
by the misbehaviour of one or more members of its board or
committee.</div>
					<a name="08013014000538"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two
questions. First, why is case 7 written in such restricted terms as to
apply only to people who are judged to have impeded</div>
					<a name="08013014000675"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the proper management of the
provider by reason of absence or failure to
act&#148;?</div>
					<a name="08013014000539"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, what
powers does the regulator have to deal with other directors or
committee members who are guilty of
mismanagement?</div>
					<a name="08013014000540"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013014000850"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I appreciate what my right hon. Friend is saying.
However, I point out strongly to him that this power is an existing
power of the Housing Corporation, under the terms of the Housing Act
1996. As he will understand, this power is only used when it is clearly
necessary to protect the assets and the tenants. I go back to my old
friend, objective 10 in clause 86, which is designed to ensure that
this power is used in a &#147;proportionate&#148; manner. Also, the
regulator will be able to remove officers during the inquiry stage.
Hopefully in a moment, we will introduce new clauses 47 and 48, under
the terms of which the removal of officers can happen when the affairs
of an association have been mismanaged. We are improving the system as
it currently stands, but the bulk of the system&#151;the main
foundation of it&#151;is in the 1996 Act. I hope that that provides
some reassurance.</div>
					<a name="08013014000541"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013014000851"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> I cannot say that I am entirely reassured. In
earlier exchanges, my hon. Friend rightly highlighted the fact that we
are dealing with different circumstances from those that applied with
the Housing Corporation. He has justified the changes that have been
made elsewhere on the ground that the new regulator requires greater
powers because it does not have the direct sanction of withdrawing
grant, which is currently available to the Housing Corporation. I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column673" />Column number: 673</div>sceptical of the argument that this power is simply a carry-forward of
the powers available to the Housing Corporation. Secondly, if it is the
case that someone&#146;s activities are seriously jeopardising the
viability of a housing association, surely it is better for the
regulator to be able to act swiftly rather than having to go through a
protracted inquiry, by the end of which it may be impossible to
safeguard the continued viability of that organisation.</div>
					<a name="08013014000542"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are creating new
provisions that are appropriate to the new circumstances and to the new
regulator, we ought to take account of circumstances that are wider
than the very limited ones that are provided for under case 7. Will my
hon. Friend give further thought to this issue&#151;&#151;not
today, because clearly we have to make progress, but before the Bill
completes its passage through this House?</div>
					<a name="08013014000543"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013014000852"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I have a lot of respect for what my right hon.
Friend says, and will look at this issue again. However, as I have said
before, under the current regulatory regime, the Housing Corporation
has powers to intervene when there are serious problems with a
regulated body. The lenders have insisted on that, quite rightly,
largely in regard to mismanagement or misconduct. I suggest that these
powers are mainly appropriate in only the most extreme cases. The new
regulatory regime will try to solve housing management problems at a
much earlier stage. It will intervene earlier and maybe not in such
extreme circumstances.</div>
					<a name="08013014000544"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sad that the hon. Member
for North-East Bedfordshire is not here, but he is muddled on the
modern regulatory regime. Intervening earlier will help to stop
systemic problems with services to
tenants.</div>

					<a name="08013014000545"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right
hon. Friend will, I think, agree with me that the
sector should be compliant with recent developments in improving
regulations. For example, the Macrory report suggested a number of
intermediate intervention steps, which we are proposing, while at the
same time making sure that the existing powers are there, as I said
before. However, I hope that the regulator would not have to intervene
at such a late
stage.</div>

removal of officers of registered providers for grounds such as
insolvency. Government amendment No. 293 removes reference to a removed
officer&#146;s right to appeal to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column674" />Column number: 674</div>High Court, because that will now be in new clause 50, which we will
discuss later. Amendment No. 294 simplifies the wording of the
restriction on that power for charities, the details of which are now
in new clause 58, which we discussed with clause 183. I do not want to
detain the Committee any

					<a name="08013014000555"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is the other side of the coin of the debate that we have just had. When
the regulator removes officers from the board of a housing association,
clause 233 deals with his powers to appoint new officers. My amendment
seeks to constrain that power, to avoid the regulator, by stealth,
effectively taking over the running of a housing association. There is
concern in the National Housing Federation that, particularly given
subsection (1)(c), the regulator could go on appointing new officers to
the housing association until he had, in effect, taken over the
provider by appointing a controlling majority to the board. The
amendment seeks to prevent that by restricting the number of officers
that the regulator can appoint. Clearly, if the regulator has lost
confidence in the board as a whole and wants to replace a lot of them,
he would use other powers in the Bill and not clause 233, so I am not
sure that the amendment is constraining the regulator from intervening
if there are causes for concern, but it would allay an anxiety on the
part of some of the housing associations if the power of the regulator
was capped, as indicated in amendment No.
100.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013014000857"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I quite like the amendment. I have a lot of
sympathy with its motivations. However, on reflection, it would be
difficult to implement while protecting powers that the regulator will
need in the most exceptional and difficult cases. In the vast majority
of cases, even serious ones, it would not be appropriate for the
regulator to make large-scale board appointments. Indeed, as the right
hon. Gentleman will know, the Housing Corporation usually appoints only
three persons under its existing power, which it states is enough to
provide the necessary mix of skills and
expertise.</div>
					<a name="08013014000557"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, there will be circumstances in which it might be necessary for
the regulator to appoint more than three board members to safeguard
public investment and the interests of tenants. The Housing Corporation
has been obliged to use the power on four occasions when a board has
resigned en masse. It is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column675" />Column number: 675</div>important that the regulator has the powers needed to intervene in such
extreme or rare situations without having powers that might be
considered excessive in other situations. Although I cannot accept the
amendment, I am happy to consider whether it is possible to limit the
regulator&#146;s powers to appoint a majority of board members to
specific circumstances. The resignation of a board en masse is an
obvious example, but there might be other circumstances that we should
and could provide for, such as the immediate threat to the viability of
the
provider.</div>

							<a name="08013014000858"></a>Andrew
George:

However, would the housing association in question not also be
registered with an industrial and provident society or the Charity
Commission and would other provisions not come into play to deal with
potential dissolution? If a board resigns in such circumstances, would
it not be more appropriate for that regulatory authority and those
rules to apply, rather than for the regulator to appoint members to the
board, particularly if it has a majority stake on the
board?</div>

							<a name="08013014000870"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> As the Committee is well aware, we are
establishing a new social housing regulator whose key objective will be
the protection of tenants of registered providers. Part of the
protection that we currently provide to such tenants comes in the
requirement that their landlord must seek consent before they can
dispose of their homes. In most cases, a registered social landlord
requires the consent of the Housing Corporation for disposals of land,
but with certain homes, the Secretary of State&#146;s consent is
required instead. Section 171D of the Housing Act 1985 requires the
Secretary of State&#146;s consent if the tenant has the preserved
right to buy, which applies generally 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column679" />Column number: 679</div>to homes that were previously owned and let by local authorities.
Sections 81 and 133 of the Housing Act 1988 require the Secretary of
State&#146;s consent for the first disposal of a home acquired
respectively from a housing action trust or local authority. The local
authority would have required the Secretary of State&#146;s consent
for the initial disposal under the 1985 Act, section 133 of which
requires consent for a subsequent disposal.</div>
					<a name="08013014000598"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is entirely right and
consistent that registered providers should seek such consent from the
new regulator in future. New clauses 38 and 39 put that into effect.
The clauses provide that consent must be sought first from the new
social housing regulator, if consent is sought by a registered provider
for disposal of a home in England; secondly, from the Secretary of
State if consent is sought by any other landlord for disposal of a home
in England; and, thirdly, from Welsh Ministers if consent is sought for
disposal of any home in Wales, whoever proposes to dispose of
it.</div>
					<a name="08013014000599"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 39
repeals subsection (6) of sections 81 and 133 of the 1988 Act, which
require the Secretary of State to consult the Housing Corporation
before consenting to a disposal of land by a registered social
landlord. As the Committee is aware, the Bill will abolish the Housing
Corporation and Oftenant, the regulator, will take over its disposal
consent functions. That requirement is therefore obsolete.</div>
					<a name="08013014000600"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 303 and 305 are
consequential on new clause 39. They add references to the repeal
provisions to the schedule of repeals. I hope that that has made things
clear.</div>
