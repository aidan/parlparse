<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/054/2000054.htm">Postal Services Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>1.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Motion made, and Question proposed,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the remainder of the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 68 to 79, Schedules 4 and 5, Clauses 80 to 92, Clauses 94 to 100, Clauses 102 to 105, new Clauses, new Schedules Clause 93, Schedule 6, Clause 101, Schedules 7 and 8—[Mr. Alan Johnson.]
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Alan Duncan </B>(Rutland and Melton): It might benefit the Committee and you, Mr. Butterfill, if I were to ask the Minister what he hopes will be the Committee's timetable. There is a risk of this Committee clashing with the Budget on Tuesday afternoon. As I understand it, the intention is to proceed as far as possible today, with a view to covering most if not all of the remaining business on Tuesday morning, and not to sit on Tuesday afternoon, whatever happens. If so, the Opposition would agree with such an arrangement.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competitiveness (Mr. Alan Johnson):</B> I can confirm that. If we reach clause 105 today, a couple of new clauses will be tabled for next Tuesday. I see no reason why we should not be able to finish our consideration on Tuesday morning. We certainly do not intend to have a sitting on Tuesday afternoon.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 68</center></H4>
<H4><center>Interfering with the mail: postal operators</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 151, in page 37, line 7, at end insert `or a mail-bag'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider Government amendment No. 152.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> These are simple and self-explanatory amendments. We are adding the word ``mailbag'', because it has been pointed out that some criminals open mailbags without opening postal packets. Without that addition, there would be some ambiguity in relation to the criminal offence, which is defined in existing legislation.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 68, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 69</center></H4>
<H4><center>Interfering with the mail: general</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment made: No. 152, in page 37, line 17, at end insert `or a mail-bag'.—[Mr. Alan Johnson.]
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Page </B>(South-West Hertfordshire): I see that the Minister has his alocytes all around him, as well as one alocyte. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A person commits an offence if, without reasonable excuse, he intentionally delays or opens a postal packet in the course of its transmission by post.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would be grateful if the Minister were to expand on what is meant by ``reasonable excuse''. It could affect the work of the police, Customs and Excise and, indeed, the intelligence services. The special section of the Post Office's investigation branch, which is based in Union house, near St. Paul's cathedral, has routinely opened mail. Mail has also been inspected by police officers, Customs and Excise officers and intelligence officers. The absence of provision for Crown officers should be explained. I shall not speak any further on that issue, but I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Committee will recall that the precise matter raised by the hon. Gentleman will be debated when we come to new clause 2. Of course, it would be in order for us to debate it at this point, but that might preclude a similar debate on new clause 2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I intended to speak at this juncture, rather than during the debate on new clause 2. However, I shall take your advice and ask the Minister to hold his horses. I shall return to the matter when we debate new clause 2.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 69, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 70</center></H4>
<H4><center>Prohibition on sending certain articles by post</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The clause governs the posting of indecent or obscene material. Over the years, it has become clear that a blind eye is turned in the case of some vulgar articles. Although I have sympathy with the intention of the clause, I must say that subsection (3)(a) is almost redundant in practice, in terms both of the law and of real life. No end of obscene material, including videos, magazines and, one might argue, devices, can be bought by mail order and delivered by post, but that rarely leads to prosecution. I shall not argue about whether such laxity is a good thing—that is for another time. I am interested in the practical question of how the law will be enforced. What standards will be set for the enforcement of the clause? Should the clause not be revised to make it more specific?
<P>
What is Government policy on the availability of material that might come through the post and might, technically, cause offence, but in fact no longer does? Does the Minister accept that there may be a call for the clause to be studied further and amended, in order to bring it up to date, adjust it to actual practice or simply make it more realistic? We should be grown up about what really happens. Frankly, lots of things happen that might be offences under the clause, but for which the law is never invoked. What would be the proper enforcement of the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) has raised an important point. However, he did not mention one aspect that, I think, should be mentioned, which is that the Public Order Act 1986 imposes controls on the publication, possession and distribution of racist material. The controls cover instances in which there is an intention to stir up racial hatred, or it is likely that such hatred will be stirred up. That means that such material is outlawed on the basis of a threat to public order. We are discussing with the Home Office whether specific offences relating to the sending of racist material through the post should be included in the clause.
<P>
We shall also discuss the hon. Gentleman's specific point with the Home Office. Obviously, it is not a matter for this Committee. We are bringing across provisions that exist already. It is fair to ask how rigorously the provisions will be enforced, and we will raise that issue. Certainly, the Post Office is concerned about it.
<P>
My final point is that the clause will strengthen the law, because it extends the prohibition on sending such material through the post, which currently applies only to material handled by the Post Office, to postal packets handled by all operators. Consequently, obscene material and so on cannot be sent in postal packets, whether they are handled by the Post Office or by any other postal service provider.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan: What is the principle governing that? If selling something in a shop is legal, should not posting it be legal? At the moment, it may be legal to sell in a shop something that it is illegal to post.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson: I shall check that out, as I am not equipped to answer at the moment. However, the Obscene Publications Act 1959 and the Protection of Children Act 1978 cover such matters. I am not aware of any disparity between laws governing material that may be sold and laws governing material that may be sent through the post. However, we shall return to such matters later, as we have not completed discussions with the Home Office on whether a specific provision on material that stirs up racial hatred is needed.</B><P>
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 70 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 71 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 72</center></H4>
<H4><center>Prohibition on misleading descriptions</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): The clause states that it is an offence for someone to place a letter box that may lead the public to believe that it is a UPS letter box on a ``place belonging to him''. What happens if someone puts a letter box on property belonging to another person whom he does not control? It may be a general law that people do not put things on the property of others. However, there are houses and, indeed, trees, that are not in anyone's ownership and on which people could put a post box for a while. Has the Minister given the matter any thought, as such locations are not under the control of those wishing to place boxes on them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> Clause 72 relates to people who use
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any words, letters or marks which signify or imply<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that such boxes are post boxes or letter boxes. Under the circumstances mentioned by the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter), there would be no difficulty removing boxes that one person had placed on another's property. However, should the person on whose property such boxes had been put object to their removal, the authorities have the power to enforce such removal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I am not sure whether that is the case, but I stand corrected by the Minister.
<P>
The clause implies that people commit an offence if they put a box on property that they own. It does not cover putting boxes on other people's property or a tree in the countryside that belongs to no one. However, I may be wrong about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry </B>(Banbury): It is intriguing that there is specific provision for someone setting up a fake post office—I cannot imagine that there are many such offices. We are anxious about the real post offices that will disappear if the rural village network is not maintained.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The clause relates not to post offices but to post boxes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> Clause 72(1)(b) mentions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any words, letters or marks which signify or imply or may reasonably lead the public to believe that any house or place is a universal postal service post office, or that any box or receptacle is a universal postal service letter box.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Notwithstanding that, the disappearance of post offices is not relevant to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> The point about the clause—

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> That was a good try.
<P>
<H5>1.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I shall turn to my next point, if I may. Post boxes, which are a vital element of street furniture, are also a beautiful and diverse part of our national heritage. Any new postal provision should ensure that our wonderful Victorian, and other, post boxes are maintained. One of the most unfortunate downsides of the privatisation of British Telecom was the removal of the old telephone boxes, which was a matter of great sadness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) is trying hard to raise an important constituency case on behalf of a sub-post office in his area. If he writes to me, I shall be delighted to deal with the problem. That will save him having to take the tortuous route of trying to introduce it into this debate.
<P>
The clause transposes into the Bill a provision that has existed in legislation since 1953, if not before. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare raised a fair point. I believe that there is no problem in relation to someone else's property, because other laws exist to deal with those circumstances, but I shall check that. Previously, a daily fine rate of 25p for every day that the offence continued was imposed to deter people from carrying out devious acts of that kind. We did not consider that to be appropriate and therefore, as a modernising Government, consulted with the Home Office to modernise fines for offences under the clause by moving them from level 1 to level 3.
<P>
Although it is not such a heinous crime as it was in 1953, it must still be guarded against. People trust post boxes enough to put items into them, and that kind of trust can easily be abused. Presumably, if a box were put on someone's premises, they would want it to be removed rather than run the risk of committing an offence under the clause. The issue has not arisen in the 31 years since it was addressed in the Post Office Act 1969, but the hon. Gentleman raised a valid point and I shall write to him about it.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 72 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 73</center></H4>
<H4><center>Obstruction of business of</center></H4>
universal service providers
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 153, in page 39, line 21, leave out from scale' to the end of line 22.
<P>
We have again taken the opportunity to review the penalties that are imposed under the Bill, all of which flow from existing legislation. The amendment removes the penalty of imprisonment from the obstruction offences in the clause. The Home Office has advised us that that penalty is not consistent with an offence carrying a level 2 fine, which is the level that is appropriate to the offences in the clause.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I have a simple question of interpretation for the Minister. Clause 73(1)(a) refers to a person obstructing someone who is engaged in the business of a universal service provider. Is there any way in which that could be interpreted as applying to dog owners?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> As a veteran of some terrifying attacks, I immediately answer in the affirmative. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman if that is not the case. It occurred to me last night that the clause covers any form of obstruction, including a large Alsatian dog.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> Am I allowed to welcome the initiative of the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton? Having been bitten at least twice by a dog while delivering Liberal Democrat ``Focus'' newsletters, I am glad to hear the Minister's answer. I only hope that dogs will be informed that they need to avoid postmen and other people who deliver literature.
<P>
Clause 73, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 74 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 75</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exclusion of liability</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I rise with trepidation because clauses 74 to 77 hang together and if I inadvertently stray from clause 75, you may tell me off, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
The clauses relate to the legal relationship between a universal service provider and its customers. Can the Minister give us a pointer on what policy will be adopted? Current arrangements to provide compensation when mail fails to be delivered are derisory. The level of compensation does not justify postal charges or a proper level of service from the Post Office.
<P>
The clauses flow together. Clause 76 limits the liability of the universal postal service provider. Clause 77 limits claims for relief under clause 76. It is a belt-and-braces job. Why should the universal service provider be immune from actions in tort for loss or damage suffered by customers? Do the Government intend to provide a better level of compensation when mail is entrusted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I should like to supplement what my hon. Friend said because he is on to something.
<P>
The Post Office is the universal service provider. It alone covers the distribution of packages and letters to certain parts of the United Kingdom. By and large, the consumer cannot exercise a choice to ensure and guarantee against the loss of a package. If a person sends a package through a courier, he might have at his disposal a series of insurance options, but when it comes to insurance and compensation for items of value that are sent through the universal provider, the approach is like it or lump it, take it or leave it. I accept that proof of posting is necessary, and that people cannot claim that a lost item is of value unless they have made that clear. One has to insure against loss because if it did not arrive at the other end, that would be a great penalty to the sender.
<P>
What is the current regime, and what options do postal customers have to volunteer to insure a package or letter against a set value for a price? I may be wrong, but I believe that senders cannot do that—if one sends a package or letter by registered post, there is no scale of insurance against which one can claim compensation in return for paying a scaled premium. If a universal service provider is entrusted with the delivery of packages, consumers should be able to insure against loss on a reasonable basis, and preferably with a degree of choice. Perhaps the Post Office, which provides a wonderful laptop terminal in each Post Office building, could tell its customers, ``The Commercial Union could insure that item for 2p for £1,000-worth of cover and Legal and General will insure it for another sum.''
<P>
Such a service does not currently exist, and postal users and consumers face risks that it is unfair to expect them to face. They are denied the opportunity properly to insure an item that they trust the universal service provider to deliver. Is there a satisfactory insurance regime, or will the Minister take steps to ensure that one is established? If my premise is right—that postal users do not currently have a proper opportunity to cover their liability and risk—a mechanism should be established that will allow them to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman rightly says that the provisions apply only to universal service providers, which at the moment means the Post Office, and that we are making progress with measures that already exist.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) will be aware from his ministerial experience that if the interlinked clauses were removed, the use of the pillar box would probably cease. The provisions apply to universal service providers because the service has to be accessible. Since the century before last, when Anthony Trollope invented the pillar box, that service has been available through posting facilities. The business has no control over what comes into the system.
<P>
Two points are relevant to the compensation arrangements. First, one can insure mail on a reasonable basis if its value is declared. There used to be a service involving high-value packets, and registered post is available—it involves a scale, although I am not aware of its details. Proof of posting also involves a set scale of compensation. Secondly, the regulator and the revamped consumer protection body will consider whether those scales are adequate or need to be revised. We have given the commission the duty to consider compensation. Compensation must be part of the licence that it gives to the universal service provider.
<P>
The Post Office Users National Council, the consumer representative group, considered the matter in 1992 and decided that changes were not needed. It criticised the levels of compensation that were available for registered post and recorded delivery, but it did not suggest making changes to the principle that we are discussing. POUNC and Committee members recognise that the alternative would be a step backwards that could jeopardise universal service provision—the Post Office could be subject to proceedings in tort in relation to the 73 million items that are posted in pillar boxes every day. I could write to Committee members about the full range of services that are available. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton is asking for information that will take time to research and provide. Of course, customers cannot get proof of posting when using a pillar box, but I shall write to Committee members about insurance scales in due course.
<P>
Some 4,000 private couriers will not be affected by the provision because, in general, they deal with items on a hand-to-hand basis. A transaction involving the package takes place at the time, so people cannot say, ``We posted a parcel that contained the Crown jewels'', and seek compensation on that basis. If people decide that the Post Office is not offering reasonable insurance services, they can turn to the competing private sector, which has the means to provide them.
<P>
<H5>2 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I do not think that the Minister is being disingenuous, but no one is saying that anyone who loses a letter or packet that they posted in a pillar box should be able to claim vast compensation. I recently used the House of Commons post office to send important legal documents, which took a long time to prepare and which would have cost an immense amount of time, trouble and energy to replace. I checked that they would be delivered properly and asked what compensation would be paid if they were lost. The sums were derisory and I was not permitted to take out further cover. We are not asking the Minister to provide a new scale today, but we need to send a message to the new commission. The Bill should establish a new compensation scheme in the mould of the private sector.

<P>

<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> It is not my or the Committee's job to swap anecdotes or opinions on compensation. I am not prepared to say that the level of compensation offered by the Post Office or private couriers is wrong. The important point was made that, in most cases, people who use the universal service provider do not have much choice, which is why it is obliged to guarantee the service that it provides. The level of compensation was a matter for POUNC and it is now a matter for the Consumer Council for Postal Services. The important difference is that we now have a regulator that will take a keen interest in the matter and make it an essential feature of the negotiated licence.
<P>
To those who believe, as the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire clearly does, that the scales of compensation that the Post Office currently offers are derisory, I can say that the consumer will be better protected under the Bill. These clauses, as he recognises, are intended to protect universal service provision.

Clause 75 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Clauses 76 and 77 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 78</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to modify sections 74 to 77</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> This may provide the solution to our previous discussion. We want a new licence holder to be required to provide insurance cover for delivery of items. If such a condition is placed on a new licence holder, the clause ought probably to be invoked to change clauses 74 to 77 in some way. That would secure equity between the universal service provider and comparable licence holders, and ensure that the compensation arrangements that we are considering are properly contained in the effective licence of the universal service provider. The Minister will appreciate that that is perhaps the vehicle that we would like to see invoked, so that the postal user can post high-value items and be sure to get proper compensation if they are lost, without the rigmarole of taking out private insurance to cover just one item. Provision for that should be available at the counter to which the item is taken to be posted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> We are in violent agreement on that. Clause 78 provides a facility for the Secretary of State to make orders modifying the schemes. It is our intention that the schemes will be kept under review, although that is more a medium-term goal than a high priority. The commission will need to consider the scope of the reserved area, and the price control in the whole area. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, the clause allows for orders to modify clauses 74 to 77.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 78 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 79</center></H4>
<H4><center>Provision relating to land</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I seek your guidance, Mr. Butterfill. Clause 79 contains the power to give effect to schedules 4 and 5. My concerns relate largely to the schedules, but perhaps I can raise them in broad terms while speaking to clause 79, unless you advise me to wait until a discussion on the schedules, especially those that deal with the acquisition of land.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As clause 79 is simply an enabling clause that gives effect to the provisions of schedule 5, it might be more appropriate to have such a discussion when we debate schedule 5.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Thank you, Mr. Butterfill. In that case, I shall delay my speech on the iniquities of schedules 4 and 5 until that point. In the meantime, we shall allow clause 79 to pass without objection.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a general principle here. We do not know what schedules 4 and 5 will contain until we have debated them; they could be substantially amended. If they were, clause 79 would give effect to something very different from what is presently in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I welcome your ruling that we shall have the opportunity to consider the matter further in our debates on schedules 4 and 5, Mr. Butterfill. There remain certain areas of concern.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`to be'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following: Government amendments Nos. 155, 156, 157, 158 and 162.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> These are technical amendments, proposing minor changes to the drafting of the Bill. The words ``to be'', with their Shakespearean tones, have been left out of the schedule on pages 67 and 70, which means that it does not read properly. In schedule 5, the reference on page 71 to the Minister for Rural Development in Northern Ireland needs to be changed to a reference to the Minister for Regional Development. The procedure for presenting petitions outlined on page 45 is amended to include a reference to the Clerk of the Scottish Parliament. On page 74, the reference to the Director-General of Water Supply is amended to read ``Director-General of Water Services''. These are textual amendments that need to be implemented.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> May I have your guidance, Mr. Butterfill? Is it in order to discuss the provisions in schedule 4 generally?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It would be more appropriate to discuss that during our debate on schedule stand part.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 155, in page 70, line 11, after `continue' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`to be'.—[Mr. Alan Johnson.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Fourth Schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> We have serious concerns about the powers in this schedule and schedule 5. Any power to acquire compulsorily someone's land, with or without compensation, raises a grave issue. If full market compensation is given, it is not as grave as if there is no compensation at all. None the less, it is a significant power. The philosophical starting point of Conservative Members is to believe in the right of ownership and private property. Some Labour Members will share that view, while some perhaps still will not. None the less, private property is the bastion of freedom, ownership and wealth, and all of the other splendid things that I endorse.
<P>
The schedule includes a sweeping power to acquire land, but it is unclear why a compulsory purchase order might need to be invoked. There is a large network of post offices, although the number is going down rather than up. If there is an opportunity to set up a new, little post office, it is more likely than not to be on private land, with the willing consent and enthusiasm of the owner. If there is a plan for a new, large post office in a town, I would expect the usual commercial journey of discovery, as with any other search for a property.
<P>
New systems of distribution might require a warehousing facility or massive car park, to ensure the provision of a proper centre from which further distribution will emanate. Again, it is difficult to envisage that the search for such a site would require compulsory purchase. If a motorway needed to be routed through sections of land that were owned by a farmer, for example, compulsory purchase measure be necessary. The same thinking would apply to the construction of a bypass. However, in the case of logistical units in the distribution and purchasing sales network of the modern Post Office, it is difficult to understand how another site, which is similar to that which one has in mind, could not perform the same function. I cannot see how a plot of land that might be required for the purposes of a post office network could be unique, and, therefore, why compulsory purchase might be necessary. A motorway is a different proposition, as the failure to purchase one random strip could destroy the whole project, and the particular plot of land would have to be acquired.
<P>
Does the Minister know how many compulsory purchases have been made during the past five years, under already existing powers? For what purpose were those compulsory purchase orders applied? What was the scale and nature of the orders? On the basis of that and the projected future shape of the Post Office, where might the schedules apply? Are they more likely to apply to commercial property than private residential property? Can the Minister provide the Committee with any other information that will allay our fears about such an open-ended power, which does not seem necessary?
<P>
<H5>2.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton raised many of the points that I wished to raise. I am concerned about the ways in which the powers may be invoked. As the hon. Gentleman said, we need to know how often that is likely to happen, and on what scale. There must be restrictions of some kind on the compulsory purchase of land. If the universal service provider can acquire a particular piece of land, it can equally acquire extra land and use it for a purpose that has nothing to do with the service that it is there to provide—selling ice-cream, for example.
<P>
Clearly, the value of the land is an important ingredient in a compulsory purchase. Is that covered, as is usual, by general law? Will there be any means of appeal against a compulsory purchase order? It should not be a draconian measure against which there is no opportunity to lodge an appeal.
<P>
Between us, the hon. Gentleman and I have raised several points on which we seek clarification from the Minister, and I look forward to hearing what he has to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I assure the Committee that this is not an assault on private property or an extension of the theory of surplus value; it has nothing to do with the dictatorship of the proletariat. We gave careful consideration to carrying forward the powers. In 1981, when the Conservative Government, under Mrs. Thatcher, considered amending the powers in the Post Office Act 1969, they decided to leave them as they were.
<P>
In response to the hon. Gentleman's question as to how many times the powers have been used, the answer is that there is no recorded instance of that ever having happened. Whenever the Post Office has sought to ensure that universal service provision is afforded to the British public, a sensible deal has been struck that does not require the powers to be used. The Post Office has a universal service obligation to deliver to the door six times a week, which means that delivery offices must be located locally. I am not talking about the network of 18,500 sub-post offices, but the 4,500 delivery offices that are essential in carrying out the universal service obligation. Every Member of Parliament knows that if their local post office closes it causes a problem. If their local sorting office closes and is relocated miles away, they feel, usually rightly, that service will deteriorate as a result.
<P>
The powers are necessary to ensure that there can be local delivery offices. Sometimes, planning development has meant that existing offices, which are usually located in the centre of town and close to the railway station, have had to move. The Royal Mail has itself been subject to compulsory purchase orders. It has to have the safeguard of being able to secure other premises, if necessary by compulsory purchase. If we asked the British people, ``Is it essential for you to have a local delivery service, and is it essential for the Post Office, if it needs to, to use these powers to provide that?'' they would say yes.
<P>
I reiterate that the powers have never been used. The Post Office negotiates perfectly reasonable agreements to acquire property and land in order to ensure that universal service provision can be continued. We do not take the powers lightly, and we are carrying forward existing provisions that have presented no difficulty in the past. Schedule 4 states that the Secretary of State may authorise a compulsory purchase. Where an alternative to compulsory purchase exists, I think that the Secretary of State would use it.
<P>
I understand the concerns raised and we considered the matter long and hard. Having retained the power until now, we felt that abandoning it would present a real risk. It might send the perverse signal that the commitment to a universal service will be made not by 4,000 local delivery offices but a centralised fleet, which might deliver less frequently and later in the day. For those reasons, we decided to retain the power.
<P>
I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman and that the Committee will support schedule 4.

<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I find it very unsettling to have it pointed out that I am in disagreement with Baroness Thatcher—God bless the very mention of her name.
<P>
The weakest part of the Minister's argument arises from his pointing out that the powers have never been used. The situation does not resemble, say, the laying of a gas pipe, where gas cannot be sent from the producer to the consumer until the two ends are made to meet. There is an existing network of roads and plenty of properties. One property a little way down the road from another would probably prove just as suitable. If extra flexibility were required on, say, the building of a new depot, the local council would doubtless co-operate on planning. Therefore, it is unfortunate and unnecessary for those powers to lie on the statute.
<P>
That those powers have not been used demonstrates that the Post Office and the Secretary of State take them seriously and would not use them improperly. However, given that they have not been used, there is no need for them. The Post Office can survive as a universal service provider without compulsory purchase powers. There will be a price to pay in respect of anything that the Post Office might need to do in future, and it should pay it. It is in that competitive spirit that its ability to acquire land should be permitted. Such powers of assistance are unnecessary and should not exist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I have two points to make on that. First, the fact that the powers have never been used is not an argument for doing away with them. Perhaps the Post Office's power of compulsory purchase leads to fewer problems with councils in respect of relocating sorting offices locally. When siting a sorting office, one must remember that it will sometimes need to remain open all night and will certainly need to open from 4 am. Vans and at least 30 postmen and women will be travelling backwards and forwards in the early hours. A local sorting office is not an easy place to locate. Having discussed the matter at length, we felt that the fact that the power had not been abused was in its favour. Its existence probably helps the Royal Mail to negotiate—
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> It is a threat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> No, it is a power of last resort that enables the Post Office to ensure that a local community will get the sorting office that it needs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> In the event of an unreasonable outcome, would there be an appeals procedure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I shall deal with that in a moment.
<P>
The level of compensation is a matter for negotiation between the owners and the acquiring authority. Owners of land and property to be acquired may be compensated under the terms of the legislation covering compulsory purchases, and the modifications set out in the schedule. For example, paragraph 7 requires the acquiring authority to take into account any depreciation of the land as a result of the acquisition, and also damage sustained by severance of land from other land belonging to the owner. Paragraph 8 provides protection for the vendor against severance of a house or garden. Paragraph 20 protects the interests of tenants occupying land to be acquired. Protections therefore exist.
<P>
The terms of appeal will be as under existing powers. If the hon. Member for Western-super-Mare would like more detail, I can write to him. It has never happened before, but if a Secretary of State were to use those powers, proper appeal provisions exist.

Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Fifth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I merely want to echo our concerns about schedule 4. I see no point in re-enacting the previous debate or forcing a vote, as schedules 4 and 5 go hand in hand. It is regrettable that such sweeping powers are provided for what should be a free competitive service, like any other. It is not a question of starting afresh—if a new town needs a sorting office, a site will be found. Likewise, there is no need for a power to enter, snoop and look into the

</UL></FONT>Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> The clause relates to petitions. Petitions and addresses forwarded to Her Majesty are exempt from postage, as are petitions and addresses to Her Majesty that are sent by post to Members of either House of Parliament and petitions addressed to either House of Parliament. Therefore, presumably, if people petition Her Majesty because they are concerned about the closure of rural post offices, they will be able to send their petitions to the House of Commons or Her Majesty without postage. If large numbers of people in north Oxfordshire and elsewhere in rural England have such concerns, they can do that.
<P>
The clause seems an amazingly antiquated provision. I do not think that, in the 18 years that I have been in the House, I have ever been sent a petition to forward to Her Majesty; and petitions that come to me tend not to be sent without stamps. Is it an obsolete provision from earlier legislation, which could perhaps be updated and reconsidered?
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Given the concern about rural post offices, can my hon. Friend imagine our constituents signing a petition to be sent to Her Majesty or the Secretary of State in such small numbers that it weighed less than 1 kg?
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> That is certainly the case. If petitioners in my constituency wanted to forward a petition to Her Majesty, I, like every other conscientious Member of Parliament, would be there in person to collect the petition from them at a designated place, with the Banbury Guardian well in attendance. That is accepted, and it is standard form.
<P>
It would not be necessary for me to keep making interventions about rural post offices and my concerns about the network if we could do a deal with the Minister. Perhaps he could do a ``Dear colleague'' letter, setting out in detail the protection that will exist for rural post offices.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman was remaining in order, with some ingenuity, up to that point, but now that he is going on to develop his concerns about rural post offices, he is straying out of order. He must return to the clause under debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> May I just finish this point, Mr. Butterfill? There would be no need for my constituents to petition the Queen or Parliament on their concerns about rural post offices if, in advance of their petition, I could write to them with a helpful ``Dear colleague'' letter from the Minister. I thought that perhaps that was coming, because on Tuesday night I—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry, but the hon. Gentleman is straying from the clause. This is a general clause about petitions; it does not relate exclusively to rural post offices, although I am well aware of the hon. Gentleman's reputation for assiduousness in that regard. He must now return to the clause under debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I have made the point, Mr. Butterfill. I shall not press it any further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I think that it should be a headline for the Banbury Guardian, that the Conservative party opposes a basic democratic tradition that has been in place in this country for many hundreds of years, since the time of Charles 1, on the basis that it is old-fashioned. Here we are, a party of modernisers, being berated by Conservative Members for retaining a provision that we think is part of the democratic process. Whether people choose to use it is a matter for them, and some do choose to use it. The Post Office estimates that free petitions cost it an average of about £5,000 a year. Some 100 petitions of less than 1 kg in weight have been submitted through the post to the Scottish Parliament since it was set up. If one examines the proportion of the population that delivers petitions through their Members of Parliament, it could be argued—it would be a spurious argument that the Government would not support—that a cost is involved for the time of the Clerk, the Table Office and so on. But what price democracy? This crucial debate, which has surprised us, draws a clear line between the two parties. The Labour party is dedicated to democracy, which means retaining the right to send petitions not exceeding 1 kg in weight through the postal service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> If the Minister is so dedicated to democracy, can he not take it one stage further? If it is good news for constituents to be able to afford petitions, surely we should introduce a system whereby constituents or anyone else can write to their Members of Parliament without paying postage. That would encourage our constituents to write to us more. I must examine the schedule to see whether it is possible to table an amendment to that effect. That really would be one for the Banbury Guardian.

<P>

<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> We are always willing to consider amendments, but no such amendment has been tabled. I see looks of horror in the Room, which I presume arise from the exorbitant cost that would be imposed on the Post Office. We would love to receive more letters from our constituents and I know that the hon. Gentleman's suggestion was well intentioned. He veers from trying to suppress democracy to trying to ensure that it flourishes. I admire his inconsistency, but I ask the Committee to support clause 84.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 84, as amended, order to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 85 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 86</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to ensure compliance with</center></H4>
the Postal Services Directive
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 33, in page 48, line 4, leave out from `require' to `to' in line 5 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`a universal service provider or any licence holder under Part II who is not a universal service provider'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure fair play and an even hand. The obligations under the European postal service directive are confined to universal service providers and do not extend to postal operators who are not providing a licensed service. I shall not quote at length from paragraph 3 of article 3 of the directive, which states all the guarantees that universal service providers should deliver. We had a most useful debate on that when discussing clause 4 and the Post Office was praised for its level of service above the minimum. We all say amen to that and congratulations.
<P>
The nub of the amendment is that the current universal postal service obligation is inapplicable to non-licensed postal operators. We see no reason why it should be extended to them and I do not believe that it should fall within the obligation that we have set out in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> We oppose the amendment. The powers in the clause apply only if the Secretary of State considers
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) that a Community obligation under the Postal Services directive is not being complied with, or
<P>
(ii) that it is likely that any such obligation will not be complied with, and
<P>
(b) has been unable to obtain any undertakings from any person or persons which are sufficient to satisfy him that the situation will be remedied.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government place enormous value on the universal service obligation. The primary duty of the commission is to ensure that that service is delivered, and the intention is that it should do so through the licensing regime, by imposing a requirement to provide a universal service—or part thereof—as a condition of licensing.
<P>
We also intend that the requirements made of universal service providers, such as quality of service, standards and regulatory accounts, will be enforced through the licensing regime. The Bill has been based on that premise. The amendment would restrict flexibility in respect of which postal operator might be required to provide postal services by an order under the clause. It would prevent the Secretary of State from making a decision about which operator or operators should be required to provide the necessary postal services, on the basis of the facts at the time. The Secretary of State's discretion would be fettered by a decision taken now, against a background that is unlikely to be relevant in years to come.
<P>
The power will be applied only to designated USO operators, but we must cater for any eventuality. If it were to be used, existing USO operators would be the first to be called upon. If that were not possible—if the universal service operator were going into liquidation, for example, or if there were other circumstances that we cannot foresee at the moment, but which might arise during the generation for which the Bill is meant to last—the public would be left without a universal service. The amendment would deprive the Government of the flexibility necessary to ensure that such a service was provided.
<P>
The Government might have to provide money so that the operator could run the service. I see the point made by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire. A small private sector company that was not a USO or a licence holder would suddenly have greatness thrust upon it, as it were, and would have to be able to perform that task. Money might have to be provided to allow it to do so. The hon. Gentleman must accept, however, that we cannot allow a situation to arise in which we cannot carry out our commitments under the European postal services directive. Circumstances that are almost inconceivable now, but which might arise, may oblige us to call upon a number of private sector operators to deliver that service.
<P>
That is why the clause is framed as it is, and why the amendment should be withdrawn or defeated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I am amazed that the Minister is saying that there is a possibility—a remote one, I accept—that our Post Office operation could be put into liquidation and its obligations thrust on to others. I will reflect on the Minister's comments and return to the issue on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 34, in page 48, line 14, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(f) require a universal service provider to keep separate accounts for each of the postal services which may not be provided unless he is a licence holder under Part II and any other postal services, and the accounts for any other postal services shall clearly distinguish between services which are part of a universal postal service and services which are not,
<P>
(g) prohibit cross-subsidies by a universal service provider between the postal services which may not be provided unless he is a licence holder under Part II and any other postal services which are not part of a universal postal service.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee has heard the call for transparency before, and is about to hear it again. This is perhaps the most crucial time for such a call. We seek openness and clarity in the Post Office's dealings, so that there can be no financial fiddles and diddles. It is a simple plea for clarity.
<P>
Amendment No. 34 would amend the provision that empowers the Secretary of State to ensure compliance with the European postal services directive, so as to give him specific powers to enforce the provisions of the directive relating to transparency of accounts, and to the limitation of cross-subsidies. The entire competitive regime would become nonsensical if there were massive cross-subsidies between one part of the Post Office's activity and another. If there were competition between the Post Office and a licence holder while the economics of the two organisations were structured on a completely different basis—one enjoying massive cross-subsidies and the other having to stand on its own two feet—the vision of an efficient postal communications network would not amount to very much.
<P>
The Government have also put forward that argument. The White Paper emphasised the importance of transparent accounting and limiting cross-subsidies to a level necessary for the preservation of essential services. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Regulator will need to ensure that the necessary accounting transparency is in place to give credible assurance that there is no undue cross-subsidy from the business units operating in the monopoly area to those competing in other market sectors.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That imposition may, in those terms, be one step removed from the amendment, inasmuch as the Minister might say that the commission will set standards for this sort of transparency. However, there is no guarantee that it will. I seek to incorporate into the Bill a clearer guarantee that separate sets of accounts will accurately reflect the commercial activity of the various separate units of the Post Office empire.
<P>
The White Paper also stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In particular the Regulator will ensure that any cross-subsidy from the monopoly area to competitive activities is the minimum required, in the opinion of the Regulator, to ensure the continued provision of services required by the USO and the uniform public tariff.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not confident that we should leave this entirely to the regulator. A more specific provision is needed in the Bill.
<P>
The Select Committee on Trade and Industry reached a similar conclusion. Paragraph 26 of its 12th report noted that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There has for some years been understandable resentment among the Post Office's commercial competitors in the parcels business at the way in which Parcelforce has been kept afloat by loans from the Post Office, despite a record of losses in successive years . . . An early task for the regulatory Commission will be to reassure commercial competitors of Parcelforce that they are not being subject to unfair competition.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Transparency of accounting and the limiting of cross-subsidies is a central theme of the European postal services directive, with which I am trying to make the Bill consistent by tabling the amendment. The directive states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Whereas separate accounts for the different reserved services and non-reserved services are necessary in order to introduce transparency into the actual costs of the various services and in order to ensure that cross-subsidies from the reserved sector to the non-reserved sector do not adversely affect the competitive conditions in the latter.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would ensure that the Bill incorporated the stated aims of the directive, the White Paper and the Select Committee report. Those aims are to ensure that competition is fair, that cross-subsidies are limited to cases in which they are necessary to maintain the universal service obligation and that all accounts are transparent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman has misunderstood the purpose of the powers set out in clause 86. His amendment sets out to ensure two things—that universal service providers keep transparent regulatory accounts, and that anti-competitive cross-subsidies from the reserved to the non-reserved areas should be prohibited. Those are aims with which the Government have considerable sympathy, as was discussed previously. The regulatory framework established by the Bill already provides for both.
<P>
The amendment would have no practical effect unless and until order-making powers were used under clause 86. Those powers are only intended to be used in limited circumstances—in effect, they are emergency powers. In the previous debate, the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said that obligations would be imposed on non universal service obligation providers, who will have greatness thrust upon them and be turned overnight into universal service providers. Those are the only terms in which the clauses will come into effect. There will be many problems for a provider who is put in that position, but I doubt whether cross-subsidies from the reserved to the non-reserved area will be top of the agenda. A USO provider might be in that position, but the previous debate concerned what would happen if a non-USO provider, and a currently unlicensed company, were in that position.
<P>
There is a great deal wrong with the amendment on those grounds, but it is not even necessary in respect of the order-making powers. The two issues highlighted in the amendment are already subsumed in the general provision in clause 86(2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State may by order make such provision as he considers appropriate to ensure that the obligation is or will be complied with.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To ensure that a level playing field exists, and that the Post Office company does not abuse its dominant position or act in an anti-competitive manner—including illegal cross-subsidy—the Bill establishes a regulator and licensing regime. I know that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton does not think that that goes far enough. However, it would be wrong to include the amendments in the emergency provisions, which relate to what happens when people are running around like headless chickens because a universal service cannot be provided to comply with the European postal services directive. That would be entirely the wrong time to consider such issues. In any case, we believe that we have made proper provision elsewhere. It is intended to be a condition of the Post Office company's licence that it competes within the law, is subject to the Companies Act 1989, does not abuse its dominant position, and does not enter into anti-competitive agreements or use anti-competitive means to enter new markets or consolidate its position in existing markets. The Post Office company will, like any other licensed or unlicensed postal operator, be subject to general competition law. The amendment is therefore unnecessary. I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it. We sympathise with the argument about cross-subsidy, and we have sought to deal with the matter elsewhere in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The intent of the amendments remains valid. The Minister pointed out that the amendments would only apply if the Secretary of State were to make an order. His argument was annoyingly persuasive. I am so frustrated that I am inclined to use what my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) would describe as a man's word. However, I shall resist the temptation to express myself so explicitly.
<P>
The Minister is right to say that the power of the amendment collapses because it could only be invoked by order, whereas I want it in the Bill from the start. I accept the Minister's point about the regulatory regime being likely to impose similar disciplines in a licensed context. We shall give the matter further thought before Report stage. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I rise because I have been scarred by regulation, both as a Minister responsible for small business, when I saw regulations that would be borne on the backs of men and women trying to earn some money, and as a humble business man, struggling to earn the odd crust and keep the organisation afloat. I raise the matter because the Government introduced more regulations and burdens last year than in any other year in this great country's history. The clause will empower the Secretary of State to ensure compliance with the EU directive on postal services. The power will apply when obligations under the directive have not been met and are not likely to be met, and no undertakings have been obtained to rectify such omissions. The clause also refers to an order to modify the functions.
<P>
In effect, the Secretary of State will have the power to ensure that the requirements of the directive are met. If certain aspects of the directive are introduced, in whatever form, an element of gold plating may impose burdens more onerous than those placed on operators in other countries. My concern about this matter is shared by organisations such as the Countryside Alliance, which has suggested that the Secretary of State should require that any such directive be met
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>after seeking advice from the European Commission that his interpretation of the Postal Service's directive is correct and publishing such advice as may be given after consultation with the Council and (postal) Commission.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am uncertain whether the Commission is the right body from which to seek advice on whether the directive will be correctly and fully implemented.
<P>
We should ensure that there is no gold plating and that no excessive burdens are imposed. I understand, and certainly shall not argue against, the reasons behind such a directive and requirement, but I would like to think that regulation will be implemented with the lightest touch. I could refer to a number of regulatory regimes that were introduced in this country that proved onerous and disastrous, and which closed down many companies that would still be in business had they been based in mainland Europe.
<P>
I am tempted by the idea that the implementation of regulations should be subject to positive resolution. That would render the obligation under the EU postal services directive subject to further ratification by Parliament. That is just an idea, but I want to make clear to the Minister our concerns about the possible implementation of any directive. Such circumstances are unlikely to arise, because we will undoubtedly be in the lead in implementing the requirements of the directive. However, I hope that the Minister can assure me that, should they arise, they will be handled with the lightest touch and to the maximum benefit of our postal services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> Opposition Members are making rather a meal of this. The provisions, which will provide a necessary safeguard, are unlikely to be used and they would be flagged up well in advance. I remind the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire that the scope for order-making powers is no wider than is necessary to ensure the provision of universal postal services in circumstances that we cannot predict. I hope that he has noted that the trigger for the use of powers is quite narrow. The powers will apply only if the Secretary of State considers that the Community obligation under the European Union directive is not being met. It is inconceivable that he would do that without being sure that the directive was clear and had been discussed with the Commission. The powers will be used only where he has been unable to obtain an undertaking from anyone to satisfy him that the situation will be remedied.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
To answer the accusation of gold plating, subsection (2) provides that the order must be appropriate to ensure that the obligation in the directive is being or will be complied with—no more, no less. There is no reason to believe that the Secretary of State would insist on gold plating. Indeed, he could not do so, because he would be trying to ensure a universal service, which is a huge task, in the most difficult circumstances. Discussions must take place beforehand with the operator who may be used in those circumstances; there must be financial compensation. A series of criteria must be met.
<P>
I was also asked why the power would be granted under the negative procedure and not by affirmative resolution. If the licensed area has gone, we envisage that, in all but exceptional circumstances, the market will meet the needs of users of postal services, including services deemed to be universal. The power is a reserve power in case the market fails to provide the necessary minimum service and it is necessary to move quickly to ensure that services are resumed as soon as possible. As it would be an emergency, it would be better to use the negative rather than the affirmative procedure.
<P>
I hope that hon. Members will accept that this is a necessary safeguard for the public and the Government, even if we never use it. When we are in our dotage in 20 years' time and sitting in Banbury, where we shall all retire to get the benefit of that local sub-post office, we will look back and say, ``This provision was never used and did not have to be used.'' That would be the ideal situation, but we need to include safeguards in the Bill and I urge the Committee to support the clause.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and—
<P>
`(c) make provision for any person to seek and secure any reasonable change in their details'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 119 and 120 are allied. The Post Office bureaucracy may regard the sentiment behind them as a hoary old chestnut, but I see them as an attempt to address a constant irritant in the way that the Post Office has power over a small part of an individual's identity—that is, one's address. It is hard to exaggerate the extent to which some people get steamed up about that. The current regime is one of control; it is inflexible, insensitive and annoying. This does not need to be a party political matter. If the Government can accept the amendment, they may make a little difference to many people's lives.
<P>
Amendment No. 119 concerns the postcode address file, which is a national database that is carried on fast-acting computers. For the purposes of mail order and many kinds of telephone inquiry, the postcode can provide the exact details of the address that should appear on an envelope, and ultimately the name of the person who lives there. When one phones up to take out a subscription to The Spectator, or some such sensible magazine—it could even be the New Statesman—the first question that one is often asked is, ``What is your postcode?'' The person dealing with the inquiry can then say, ``Oh yes, you live in such and such a street''. They can immediately match one's name and postcode to an exact address. Some people object to the amount of personal detail that can be gleaned from the holding of such information, but that is a different argument for another day.
<P>
It is often impossible to get details on the database changed and, given that, I am concerned about gremlins creeping into it. Many new houses are being built. The numbering of those that are built on greenfield sites is likely to be clear. In the case of houses that are built on a land infill area—such as a former farmyard—each building plot is allocated numbers at the beginning of the planning process. The plot number then becomes the house number, which is added to the postcode address file. After that, there is absolutely nothing that can be done to change the wretched thing if it is wrong. For the rest of the inhabitant's life in that house, whenever he phones up to take out a subscription, the irritating person on the other end of the phone will refuse to accept his proper address details. If he tries saying to the lovely lady on the phone—with whom it is difficult not to get annoyed—that he would like to have an input into changing the details, she will say, ``It's not me, love, it's that Post Office lot''. When he writes to that Post Office lot, they will, by and large, ignore his entreaties. That is an unacceptable state of affairs.
<P>
In urban streets where the numbering is absolutely clear, the Post Office does not find it acceptable for those house numbers to be replaced with lovely-sounding house names. They claim that that makes it difficult for the postman to make his deliveries. In many rural areas, with their higgledy-piggledy villages and little lanes, a proper address with a house name is far more helpful to the postman. The belief that a number is more helpful is complete stuff and nonsense. The postman knows his round; the name of the house may help him locate it, and the lane and village names are equally helpful. The amendment would help to get the gremlin out of the works, so that the citizen, the homeowner, would be able to say, ``Cannot we tweak the address a little, because it will help me and the postman.''
<P>
I refuse to accept the Post Office's blind notion that every house must have a number and that the description must be entered in the national postcode address file. There are too many cases of rubbish in, rubbish out. The uniformity demanded by the Post Office does not suit the efficient delivery of post. If someone living in a terraced house wanted to call their house Westminster Castle, that would obviously be unreasonable.
<P>
The amendment states that the Post Office must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>make provision for any person to seek and secure any reasonable change in their details.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The key word is ``reasonable''. Indeed, during our debates, the Minister has often defended the use of that word. We even have cross-party agreement that the use of the word ``reasonable'' is itself reasonable. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. It would make life that little bit better for a lot of people who get mightily hacked off by having an address forced on them that is a poor illustration of where they live and that is not helpful to the postman.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Randall </B>(Uxbridge): Before I continue the admirable arguments put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton in support of amendment No. 119, I recall that in earlier deliberations the Minister said that the father or grandfather of the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Dr. George Turner) was a postmaster. That stirred my memory; one of my great grandfathers was postmaster in Kings Lynn in the hon. Gentleman's constituency as well as being postmaster in Uxbridge. I claim some hereditary knowledge of the matter, even though I never met the gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Is my hon. Friend claiming any relationship with the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk, or was it a completely independent operation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> I am simply expanding on my family background.
<P>
Amendment No. 119 relates to a matter that has been raised with me by many of my constituents. I pay credit to the members of the Ickenham residents association. The association's initials cause consternation among my colleagues when I say, ``I am off to attend the AGM of the IRA.'' However, it makes a serious point.
<P>
My constituency is composed of several communities that, in times gone past, were separate. Indeed, some still are separate. Ickenham has a village atmosphere. Unfortunately for its residents, the name Ickenham no longer features in the postal address. They now live in Uxbridge. That has resulted in some unfortunate misdeliveries of mail. However, as my hon. Friend said, the postcode data file is made available for many purposes, including subscriptions to journals, which are delivered by organisations other than the Post Office. For example, an elderly couple did not receive the flowers that were sent to them on their golden wedding because instead of going to the Greenway, Ickenham, they went to the Greenway, Cowley. Both have the postal address of the Greenway, Uxbridge. It is to the credit of the Post Office that when the problem was raised it sorted it out. However, it has happened quite frequently. The Ickenham residents association has a large data file, which its representatives and I have presented to the Post Office on several occasions. This is an ideal opportunity to raise this point again.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I live in Cowley—that name has now disappeared from the postal address. That is a great shame because it means losing the feel of an individual community. It also makes it difficult for people trying to deliver mail. I understand from the Post Office that for sorting, and to some extent delivery, it requires only the number and the postcode. However, people often do not use the postcode and losing the name will only cause further confusion.
<P>
There is another problem, and I cite another local example. Close to where I live we have a Station road. What was Station road, Cowley, is now Station road, Uxbridge. There used to be a station there, but people who have moved into the area recently and people from outside the area would not be aware of that. If they were to search around the underground station in Uxbridge for Station road they would be about two miles from where they needed to be. The amendment might seem slightly pedantic, but if it helps people who have experienced such difficulties and annoyances it will have served a useful purpose.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Diana Organ </B>(Forest of Dean): I have some sympathy with the Opposition's suggestions, but I have no sympathy whatever with the argument that subscription magazine delivery organisations other than the Post Office, or any other marketing or commercial organisation, use the postcode to identify people on a computer. I have some sympathy with the point that people's post is late because of those issues.
<P>
In my constituency of the Forest of Dean, the word ``Dean'' can be spelt either Dean or Dene and it is used in hundreds, nay thousands, of addresses. In small villages there may be two or three Dean Views or Dean Cottages. The postman who may be local will know which one applies to the Franklins, which one applies to the Jenkins and which one applies to Mr. and Mrs. Mann, so that has not proved a problem to those individuals up to now. However, if the Post Office is to be pedantic and insist that people amend their address—the tradition of using this old name of Dean will be lost, which would be a sorry state of affairs.
<P>
More importantly, the other issue that causes concern is when people are given a postcode by the Post Office to aid delivery and the postcode does not fit with the area in which they live. For example, most postcodes in my constituency are GL postcodes because they are Gloucestershire, but three or four villages have an MP postcode.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Lady is now straying into amendment No. 120. I will be happy to call her if she seeks to catch my eye when we come to that amendment, but I hope that she will return to amendment No. 119, which we are currently discussing.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Organ:</B> I shall return to the matter when we consider that amendment, as it concerns many of my constituents, as well as those of other hon. Members.
<P>
There is sympathy with the need for the Post Office to allow local tradition, usage and names to be used in addresses and not to impose on people a format that they find unacceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton has obviously been scarred by a terrible experience that he had when dealing with somebody at the Post Office. I shall, however, ask the Committee to resist the amendment, which deals not with corrections but with changes in address details. The local post office is not responsible for how many Station roads there are in a town; that is the responsibility of the local authority. It is not responsible for people's addresses. If somebody wants to call his house Chez Standing Committee B, he can do so.
<P>
The Post Office has set up a postcode system that is, in a sense, its property, as it is its method of ensuring proper use of new technology to deliver and sort mail. A distinction must be drawn between giving people access—a right that is already contained in the Bill and which is eminently reasonable and proper—and giving people the absolute right to change that information. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton referred to a reasonable change, but it should be up to the Post Office and any future owner of the postcode address file to be able to change entries in that file. That is the system that allows the Post Office to ensure that post is properly sorted and delivered. When the system comes to fruition, local delivery postmen and postwomen will not have to sort their own mail, which will be sorted in sequential order by the machinery; they will simply take it out for delivery.
<P>
I am not against people's ability to make representations to the Post Office, and the horrendous experience to which the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton is obviously a cause for concern. If people have the wrong postcode, they should be able to correct them. If they do not do so, it is in the interests of the Post Office to ensure that corrections are made so that mail can be delivered correctly. The clause confers upon the owner of the PAF—currently the Post Office—a duty to maintain the file. That will ensure that existing practice is continued by the Post Office, which has put a lot of time and effort into trying to ensure that the information contained in the PAF is accurate and that people are aware of and use postcodes correctly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> Perhaps the Minister does not understand that complications such as those involving road names arise because the Post Office has removed part of the postal address. I cited the example of the Greenway, Ickenham and the Greenway, Cowley, which were distinct addresses with which there was no problem. However, they were combined to become the Greenway, Uxbridge, even though they are located three or four miles apart. Such confusion could affect emergency services, which may not know where to go as emergency callers are asked for their postcodes and their postal address is consequently used. People who make representations to the Post Office asking for the addition of the relevant part of the address should be listened to. We seek merely to ask the Post Office to add in an element of the postal address for clarification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> Those are legitimate concerns, but the clause does not deal with information in the PAF or the way in which it is recorded; it deals with the right of access to that information. It is perfectly proper for hon. Members to take up such concerns with the Post Office on behalf of their constituents. However, the postcode is the combination of letters and numbers at the end of an address—it is the way in which letters find their way to each address. The rest of the address will increasingly become superfluous to the machinery that sorts the items. It is mainly needed for manual sortation. The PAF is about the combination of letters and numbers so that the optical character recognition mechanism and other Post Office sorting machinery can recognise and direct mail to the correct sorting office and the correct delivery bench.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> It is about a lot more than that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I am sorry, but Opposition Members have referred to the PAF in the context of how mail comes to their addresses, in which case, it is only about the combination of letters and numbers at the end.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Will the Minister confirm that we are talking about the same thing? Does he accept that in addition to doing what he has described, which I do not dispute, the PAF provides the database that mail order companies use to put on the face of an envelope a complete address, from the name of a person, through the number of the property and the name of the street, to the postcode itself?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The PAF does not contain people's names; it is about addresses. It is rare for a name to be on the PAF. It might appear if the only way to recognise an address is to call it Randall's cottage, which identifies the property's owner. It is not about the names of people but about addresses.

<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> It may well be—and if the Minister can prove that we are talking at cross-purposes, fair enough—but what official national database, authorised by the Post Office, is used by mail order or subscription companies to put a standard form of address on an individual's mail?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The PAF is used for that purpose, but the hon. Gentleman referred to people's names, which are not included on it. That is one of the protections. The Post Office cannot be responsible for how organisations use the PAF. It has to be accurate. If there is confusion about Cowley and Ickenham—I know the area from when I lived in Slough—because addresses are wrong and emergency services cannot reach them, that should be taken up with the Post Office. The clause will allow access to information. It ensures that the PAF must be maintained, which is currently the responsibility of the Post Office, and makes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the File available to any person who wishes to use it on such terms as are reasonable.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton proposes will cause chaos. That is clear from his argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I am sorry, but those are the amendment's terms. Rather than correcting the details, it would change the details. Changing the details of postcodes for mail sorting purposes would mean changing the last line of an address.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have to say to the Minister that if the amendment was outside the scope of the clause, I would not have selected it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I am not saying that it is, and I apologise if there has been a misunderstanding. What I am saying is that the amendment would cause chaos. It would give people the right to contact the Post Office and to change the postcode. The amendment does not deal with the right to correct a postcode. Any citizen has the right to take that up with the Post Office. The postcode exists purely for operational reasons. That will continue to be the case for whoever is the keeper of the PAF.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I have almost finished. The amendment would cause chaos, which is clear from the Opposition's misunderstanding of the situation. It would not help one jot. It is up to the Post Office to get the postcode right. The amendment would give people access to information that should reasonably be used only by the Post Office.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The Minister has completely misunderstood the amendment, but I do not suggest that he has done so wilfully. No one suggests that the amendment should allow someone who has a postcode to call the Post Office and demand that their postcode be changed—that would be absurd. Everyone accepts their postcode as their own, unless theirs is a marginal case. The Minister's suggestion is irrelevant to the debate—it is an Aunt Sally, a red herring, stuff and nonsense.
<P>
If one talks to someone who can enter one's postcode into a database, one gives him information and, working backwards, he matches one's postcode with one's name, and the exact wording of one's address will appear on his screen. If my name were Smith and I said that my postcode was PU2 5LR, he would say, ``Oh yes, Smith with a postcode of PU2 5LR. Your address is 6 Water lane, Bloddington.'' I might reply, ``No! For the last time, it is not 6 Water lane. It is Mill cottage, Water lane. That address is known by the postman and by everyone else.'' There are gremlins in the works. The situation is George Orwell gone mad.
<P>
The PAF includes postcodes and addresses, and it is the address that it contains that makes people go bonkers. The Minister said that he would not accommodate the poor person in Water lane who says, ``For God's sake, that is not my proper address. The address is not useful to the postman or to me, and it does not refer to the way in which I describe my property. It is not useful in any way.'' A meaningless number that is stuck in this wretched database has confused everyone.
<P>
The amendment would help all the citizens who suffer from this irksome and bureaucratic nonsense. They should be able to say, ``Excuse me, I must tell you for the 100th time that I want my address to be changed. This is driving me nuts.'' The Minister refuses to respond to a citizen's simple plea to be able to describe his property in a way that is reasonable and useful. The rest of the clause is about access, but not this provision. Making the relevant files available will help the likes of The Spectator or the New Statesman or anyone else who has a subscription list—they will benefit from simpler data entry. However, the gremlin is already in the works, but the Minister refuses to agree to provisions that would remove it. Either he has been wrongly advised and misunderstands the situation—I do not suggest that he does so wilfully—or I am discussing a different database, in which case I am the one who is going bonkers and off his trolley. The fact that several Committee members are nodding suggests that several of us have experienced this irritant in our daily life— and very irksome it is.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) was dead right about the emergency services. There was a fire in my constituency, and the emergency services—initially, the police—did not know where it was. That is one of the problems of rural policing these days. I imagine that the emergency services database is probably linked to a system that is similar to that which we are discussing, and that such a detail—the name of a house at the end of a lane—could make the difference between someone burning in a building or not. I suspect that the police use the same database.
<P>
Is the Minister really unprepared to change not the postcode but parts of the address? We do not encourage people to say, ``In order to improve the value of my property I want to have a postcode that is for Gloucestershire rather than for Warwickshire.'' He is not prepared to introduce any flexibility or allow what we might call the upper details of the address to be used. An address consists of a name, a house name, a street, the village—Ickenham or Cowley, for example—and perhaps the name of a nearby bigger village.
<P>
There are 100 villages in my constituency. There are probably also that many hamlets of five or six houses. It will be an omission not to have ascending—or descending, depending on which way one reads it—layers of detail, the better to advise people exactly where a house is. There will also be a problem of sorting, which is what the postcode is largely about. It will be a deficiency, which the Minister seems intent on fossilising in the Bill.
<P>
Can we not have a little flexibility to allow the citizen to say ``Can we get this detail right, Mr. Chairman of the Post Office? I am being reasonable. Please take a look at it.'' The Post Office could then ask the postmen, ``As you do your daily round, what's easier for you, mate?'' I bet that they would all give the same answer, which would be that they would rather have Mill Cottage than No. 6 Mill Street. However, the Minister seems determined to say no. What he said about postcodes was a misunderstanding—a complete diversion. George Orwell seems intent on taking over, so that the citizen cannot change anything. That is a sad reflection on big government in a world in which the individual should matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> Let me try to explain the Government's position. There is no question of people having no right to ensure that the information on the PAF is accurate. I made the point earlier that all that the Post Office system needs is the post town and the combination of letters and numbers. Other people want access to that information—that is the free market at work. Whether the Post Office grants access to the file, and how the companies use the information, is a matter for them.
<P>
However, the amendment would cause all the problems from the days before mechanisation of the Post Office to crop up. People would want their house to be called So-and-So Cottage; they would want to describe it as being in Cowley rather than in Ickenham. The Post Office wants to have an accurate postcode, but people sometimes want to change the other information in their address. The hon. Gentleman has just hit on the reason why the amendment would cause absolute chaos. Any delivery postman, postwoman or sorting office worker can spot the people with aspirations to be like Mrs. Bouquet on the television programme, who would describe Slough as Farnham Royal. I should not go on; I might insult someone from that area.
<P>
This is not a rehearsal of the arguments of Magna Carta. The Government are seeking to enact a precise obligation to maintain the file, and to make it available. The hon. Gentleman proposes that the owner of the file should also
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>make provision for any person to seek and secure any reasonable change in their details.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment refers to change, not to corrections. He wants people to be able to say ``I want my address to be Farnham Royal. I may not live in Farnham Royal, but that is what I want it to be.''
<P>
I appreciate all the hon. Gentleman's arguments, and all the frustrations that Conservative Members have with the Post Office. The Post Office needs, take cognisance of this debate if it is so difficult for people to change details of their address that are obviously wrong, or to change aspects of the address other than the post town and postcode that are important in identifying the location. Those matters are relevant and must be taken up with the Post Office. I am sure that that will happen as a result of this debate.
<P>
Tempting though it is to accept a proposal like this, it would cause great difficulty to incorporate in the Bill an amendment that would make provision for the keeper of the PAF to allow anyone to make changes. It would cause difficulty in keeping the PAF and further inhibit the Post Office in its task.
<P>
<B>Miss Geraldine Smith </B>(Morecambe and Lunesdale): I agree with my hon. Friend's comments. When I worked in the Post Office, a company based on the border of Morecambe did not want a Morecambe address, because it thought—I do not know why—that Morecambe was more downmarket than Lancaster and it wanted a Lancaster address. A battle ran for months and months and took up a great deal of the time of the Post Office employees who tried to deal with the matter. The company insisted on putting ``Lancaster'' and we had all sorts of problems. Unfortunately, Opposition Members are not aware of the Post Office's workings. If the amendment were carried, it would cause chaos.

<P>

<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. I accept that that is not what Opposition Members intend, but they must see that it could be the result of inserting the amendment in the Bill. I wish that could offer something that would help Opposition Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Capitulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman says, ``capitulation'' from a sedentary position, but the details in the PAF are a matter for the Post Office and exist only to ensure that letters are addressed and delivered accurately. I am sure that all the problems that have been mentioned can be resolved, but not through the amendment, which would create more problems than it solves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> I want to make two points to the Minister. I understand what he is saying and now that I know that he lived in Slough, I understand why he is so reasonable. Is it correct that this data file is available and sold commercially? That is one question that has been raised with me. If the Post Office obtains commercial gain from it, it has a duty of care to ensure that the details in it are correct. I understand what the Minister and his hon. Friends have said, and we would not want the amendment to allow that sort of thing to go on.
<P>
However, I know from personal experience that it is almost impossible to persuade the Post Office to agree to change postcodes. We got very close to it. It saw the sense of the change, went away and then refused it. Frustration has built up because of the complications that have arisen. If the Minister could give us an assurance, we may be able to think again on it, as Opposition Members are very reasonable people too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I assure Opposition Members that I shall personally bring this matter to the Post Office's attention. It is clearly a serious matter, of which I was unaware in the sense that these debates are always useful in identifying such problems, especially in relation to emergency services. There is obviously such a problem about changing what is on the PAF that people are becoming extremely frustrated.
<P>
I give the assurance that the hon. Gentleman seeks, but I ask hon. Members to accept that they are using a sledgehammer to crack what is admittedly a considerable nut. We shall try to deal with the matter, but I ask the Committee not to support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for what he has said, but the understanding shown in the debate has not been as great as it could have been. The irritant remains and needs to be addressed. As the Minister has said that he will discuss the matter with the Post Office, I shall not press the amendment to a Division at this stage, but I may table a new amendment on Report, depending on what happens in the meantime. We owe a duty of care, as does the Post Office, as my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge said, and we shall want to revisit the issue. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 120, in page 50, line 16, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(1A) In the File—
<P>
(a) each address shall include a county; and
<P>
(b) each postcode shall reflect the county in which the addressee resides, except in as much as the efficiency of sorting addresses near county boundaries requires reference to a neighbouring county on the official address'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Committee thought that I was getting stewed up about the last amendment, just wait. The amendment relates to an allied matter, which also irritates people.
<P>
Let us try to find some common ground. We all understand what postcodes are for. We all understand that they exist to help the mechanism of sorting and delivery. We also understand the point to which the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Miss Smith) referred obliquely—that a postcode does not necessarily reflect the county in which someone resides. We accept that. The nearest sorting office for people living in the north of Leicestershire is in Nottingham, so a town in the north of Leicestershire may have a postcode beginning with NG. If they live on the edge of the county, they have a Nottinghamshire postcode because that is the route by which letters are most efficiently delivered. Similarly, people who live in north-east Leicestershire have a Lincolnshire postcode, either Peterborough or Grantham.
<P>
No one is saying that the postcode must exactly reflect the boundaries of the county, so we can dismiss that argument from the start. However, returning to the postcode address file, the bordering county may be the county for the purposes of delivering letters in the most efficient way, but, none the less, my argument is that a written address should include a county. I suspect that the Post Office has a plan to get rid of counties from addresses. There are forceful historic, aesthetic and purely practical arguments against that, and I dismiss the Post Office's argument that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>because county boundaries have a habit of changing, we would need to be constantly changing our records to reflect the change. As such, we are no longer amending county information.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not true. County boundaries do not often change and if they change marginally, the spill-over that I have described would not change but would remain the same, so that is a non-argument.
<P>
I should declare an interest on behalf of my constituents who reside in Rutland. We now have the complete and utter nonsense that Rutland, which has been restored as a county and is known as a county, appears on the address file as Rutland, Leicestershire. Any schoolchild who says that Rutland is in Leicestershire deserves a mild ticking off.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> A beating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Perhaps a thrashing, but only on the third offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> A scragging.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> A serious scragging on the second offence.
<P>
The wretched postcode address file now enshrines simple geographic inaccuracy. It is wrong. Rutland, Leicestershire is like saying Glasgow, England or London, Scotland and it annoys my constituents, but the Post Office refuses to do anything about it.
<P>
There is a slight quirk of parliamentary procedure in that when Rutland regained unitary status it was described as Rutland county council district council, which sounds likes a wonderful hybrid. That adds to the argument covering ``any reasonable change''. I am not saying that the postcode for Rutland must be RU1—or RU1-too, or whatever. Apart from anything else, it would be too expensive now to change letterheads and so on. The postcode is LE15. I accept the point that the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale made. Rutland, as a county, must have a Leicestershire postcode because post is mostly routed through Leicester. However, Uppingham and Oakham are in Rutland, not Leicestershire. The absurdity of the existing postcode address file is that at the moment addresses in Oakham, the county town of Rutland, are ``Oakham, Rutland, Leicestershire''. The address includes two counties, which is another example of the absurdity and annoyance of the rubbish in, rubbish out postcode address file.
<P>
An official address, as it works its way back from the postcode to the name of the planned recipient of the letter, should have sufficient, accurate, geographical detail to make it a comprehensible indication to someone looking at it afresh of where the addressee resides, so that it can be found on a map. People's official address is not just for the convenience of the Post Office, but for other people too. The Post Office's selfish, parochial attitude to its monopoly database for the entire country is reprehensible. Why should it dictate the terms of the postcode file? It is not just for the Post Office; it is for other people—for us and for visitors. The Post Office must change its attitude, wake up, appreciate the needs of individuals and communities who value where they live and how it is described, get off its bureaucratic backside and accept that we have a legitimate argument in saying that personal addresses should reflect the wishes of the people who give the Post Office its profits by using its services.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Organ:</B> I want to make a few comments about a situation that is similar to that in Leicestershire and Rutland, but with the added complication of two bordering nations. A couple of villages in the Forest of Dean—Tidenham and Sedbury— instead of having a Gloucestershire postcode, have NP postcodes because their post goes to Newport. Their address on the Post Office address form is Chepstow, Gwent, but they live in Gloucestershire and Chepstow, Gwent is in a different country—Wales. That causes extra complications for deliveries, taxis and so on. Most important, as we are discussing the Post Office, their mail is regularly delayed. Their packages, parcels and Christmas post is delayed because people look at the address and think that it cannot be right that post to residents of Gloucestershire is sent to Wales.
<P>
Residents have made representations to the Post Office, but it is intractable and seems unaware of residents' concern. We need a means of dealing with county addresses when postcodes do not match up.
<P>
Debate adjourned.—[Mr. Betts.]

Adjourned accordingly at seven minutes to Four o'clock till Tuesday 21 March at half-past Ten o'clock.
