<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We come now to measures, in addition 
to those already in the Bill, that would strengthen the 
protection afforded to young children. At present, the Bill 
is concerned with protecting 16 and 17-year-olds from 
those who breach a position of trust. We want that protection to be as strong as possible, and we have tabled constructive amendments with that in mind. The Bill, 
however, does not add to the legal protection that is 
already available for youngsters who are aged under 16. 
It does not give them specific protection from breaches of 
trust by older people. As we all know, young people in 
that age group can be all too vulnerable to such breaches 
of trust, often when they are away from home and looked 
after by older people in a variety of settings.
<P>
New clause 6 takes the concept of a position of trust, 
as it is established in the Bill, and applies it to the existing 
law to give greater protection to young people under 16. 
Under the new clause, when an older person in a position 
of trust commits an offence against a person under 16, 
that offence would be aggravated by the breach of trust 
provision and that older person would face a higher 
maximum sentence than would otherwise be the case.
<P>
I shall cite some examples. It is already an offence for 
an older person to have sexual intercourse with a girl aged 
under 16 years. As we know from last week's discussions, 
unlawful sexual intercourse by that I mean consensual 
sexual intercourse, not rape carries a maximum sentence 
of two years. Under the new clause, when the older person 
who had unlawful sexual intercourse was in a position of 
trust, that offence would carry a higher maximum 
sentence of seven years' imprisonment.
<P>
Furthermore, it is already an offence for an older person 
to carry out an indecent assault on a youngster under the 
age of 16 as it is for an older person to carry out an 
indecent assault on anyone else. That carries a maximum 
sentence of 10 years, and that offence is often committed 
by those with paedophiliac tendencies.
<P>
Under the new clause, in cases when the person who 
carried out an indecent assault is an older person and in a 
position of trust, and the victim is a youngster under the 
age of 16, there would be a maximum sentence of 14 
years, which is higher than the existing maximum 
sentence of 10 years. The new clause sends a clear 
message that those who are in a position of trust and who 
carry out offences against youngsters under 16 would face 
a stiff sentence. Such a message needs to go out to people 
and be part of the legislative framework.
<P>
Members of the Committee will recall the concern that 
was expressed in June 1998 about vulnerable young 
people. Such a debate was engendered by the original 
amendment to lower the age of consent, and was taken up 
by the Government's working party. The background to 
that concern was a series of scandals that involved the 
abuse of children, which had taken place in various 
settings throughout the country, often in residential care 
of one form or another. Such incidents were well 
documented in the Utting report, which was 
commissioned by the previous Government and reported 
to the present Government. Hon. Members will recall that 
that report was referred to during our debates in June last 
year and subsequently.
<P>
The Utting report was the result of the continuing and 
widespread revelations of the sexual, physical and 
emotional abuse of children in a variety of settings during 
the preceding 20 years. The report said that a repetition 
of abuse on that scale, whether in children's homes or in 
a variety of residential settings, was less likely today 
because far fewer children now live in such places than 
did so in the 1960s and 1970s. The report also said, 
however, that here were no grounds for complacency. not 
least because of the appalling consequences for the 
victims of such abuse. The report said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A single perpetrator is likely in a lifetime's career to abuse 
hundreds of children, who suffer pain, humiliation and torment, and 
incur permanent emotional damage"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One of the most poignant and striking features of child 
abuse is that it does not come to light until many years 
later, no doubt because of the heartache and hurt that it 
causes over the years; but it is often said that those who 
are responsible for such sexual abuse were themselves 
victims of abuse. That process continues: we hear 
revelations from all over the country. The Minister will 
have seen that I have a pile of documents with me that 
set out and chronicle cases of abuse in a variety of 
settings, all of which involve people who are in charge of 
children. I do not propose to speak about them all, but it 
is important to note that, during the past month or so, 
since the debate was launched on how best to protect 
children, it has been evident that cases still occur that 
contain all the features that we have known of over the 
years.
<P>
I shall cite only one case, but it is typical of many. In 
December 1998 only a few weeks ago a man of 52 
was sentenced at York Crown court for taking advantage 
of vulnerable youngsters for his own sexual gratification 
between 1967 and 1974. He was arrested in June 1998 
the very month when the House was debating the 
subject after a former resident of the Spring Hill 
Barnardo's home in Ripon in North Yorkshire, which 
cared for children with behavioural problems and learning 
difficulties, made a complaint to the police. The man 
eventually admitted to 14 charges of indecent assault, 
three of serious sexual assault and two of cruelty to 
children relating to 12 boys and one girl aged between six 
and 15.
<P>
The prosecutor told the court that the abuse began 
almost immediately after the man joined the home in 
1967. He sought to establish control of the children by 
violence or by emotional grooming. Prosecuting counsel 
said that the accused
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"sought to be able to engage these children is sexuality activity when 
he liked and without any repercussions for himself."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In mitigation, defence counsel said that his client had been 
the victim of sexual abuse as a child.
<P>
That recent case encapsulates all the features of the 
terrible events that can too frequently happen to children. 
Such events led to our debate in June a debate that 
continues. In that case, as in so many other cases, the 
victims were youngsters aged between six and 15. That is 
why we must take the opportunity to protect children 
under 16 years of age as well as those over 16.
<P>
As I said at the outset, the Bill does not offer any 
additional protection to children under 16 who are likely 
to be much more vulnerable, to be far more susceptible to 
the attentions of older people in positions of trust and to 
have far less ability to look after themselves than those 
over 16. Children under 16 need the most protection; if 
the concept of a position of trust can be imported into the 
law to protect over-16s, it should be possible to do so, 
through the new clause, to protect the under-16s.
<P>
I make no claims for the drafting of the new clause, 
but its aim of giving such protection to the under-16s is 
consistent and legitimate. Bearing in mind that we need 
to do all that we can to protect the under-16s, who have 
so often been the victims of sexual abuse., I look forward 
to hearing the Minister's reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): I support my hon. 
Friend's new clause. Some members of the Committee 
may think that a maximum sentence of 14 years is too 
high; it is true that it has rarely been imposed for such an 
offence. However, the point that we should be seised of 
is that people who both abuse their position of trust and 
commit indecent assault on a very young person are 
committing a serious offence not only because it is 
sexual, but because it can shatter the confidence of the 
young person's belief in all adults. If the abuse has come 
from the very person or people who is/or are in a position 
of authority or trust to a child, that can have a shattering 
effect on the child and seriously impair the child's ability 
to come to terms with the trauma, because he can have 
no confidence that those around him will help him to do 
so. The evidence suggests that it can also affect the child's 
ability to form healthy relationships as an adult.
<P>
Those are three good reasons why we should think 
carefully about the new clause. I am confident that the 
Minister is already considering such changes; he told us 
in an earlier debate that the current sentence of two years 
for unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 16 was 
too low and that he was reviewing it. I hope that, in his 
reply, he will acknowledge the very serious nature of the 
offences that we are discussing and will agree to keep 
them under review.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Robathan </B>(Blaby): I shall speak briefly 
in support of my hon. Friend. The new clause goes to 
the heart of the matter in asking whether members of the 
Committee really believe that children should be protected 
from adults who abuse their trust. All of us understand 
that children get up to all sorts of strange games, and those 
games sometimes proceed to other things as children get 
older. However, we are debating whether an older person 
who abuses a child should be considered to have 
aggravated the offence. We should accept new clause 6, 
because that is exactly what it would do.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis </B>(New Forest, East): I return to the 
problem of serial or repeat offenders, which was raised in 
an earlier sitting. Nothing in new clause 6 states that a 
long sentence must be imposed; it gives the option that, 
if the circumstances warrant it, a sentence longer than two 
years can be imposed. It is easy to envisage such 
circumstances.
<P>
I was encouraged by the positive remarks that the 
Minister made after my intervention during a previous 
sitting. I hope that he will expand on those remarks; 
otherwise we shall face, in this area of the law, problems 
with repeat offenders similar to the problems that we 
faced in other areas in years gone by, when only a few months was the average sentence given to people who committed two, three or more offences. I am encouraged 
by the Minister's nodding; I hope that he will say 
something positive.
<P>
<B>Dr. Evan Harris </B>(Oxford, West and Abingdon): The 
clause raises a serious issue. It might be considered that, 
where there is a position of trust, the maximum sentence 
of two years for unlawful sexual intercourse by an older 
person with someone under the age of 16 a girl, under 
the current law is too light. The question is whether 
there is an alternative in law to ensure that such offences 
are not treated as consensual. I should be interested to 
hear whether the Minister has any such plans.
<P>
It might be that consent, as understood under the 
offence of unlawful sexual intercourse, is vitiated when 
the young person is below the age of consent above 
which no crime is committed in certain circumstances 
and a position of trust exists. Two years is too low a 
maximum sentence for such offences.
<P>
However, new clause 6 might be the wrong way to 
approach the matter because the offence of indecent 
assault, which includes sexual intercourse, already exists. 
If an act is not consensual, rape is the appropriate charge. 
The maximum sentence available in cases of indecent 
assault is 10 years.
<P>
Perhaps the problem is that insufficient cases are 
prosecuted as indecent assaults where a position of trust 
exits, which vitiates any consent given by someone under 
the age of 16. Perhaps a review of the prosecution 
approach, rather than a change in the law, is needed.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere did not address an 
inconsistency in his proposal. He suggests a maximum 
sentence of 14 years for unlawful intercourse, but life 
imprisonment can be imposed for unlawful sex between a 
boy under the age of 16 and a man. Clearly, the law and 
the approach to sentencing is in much need of review. 
That is why I was delighted that the Home Secretary 
announced a review of all such matters.
<P>
The key question is one of consent because sufficient 
statute law on non-consensual offences already exists to 
deal with the sort of outrageous and heinous behaviour 
that the hon. Member for Hertsmere mentioned.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng):</b> The amendment is undoubtedly well 
intentioned. It is, however, misdirected and flawed. The 
Government want primarily to protect 16 and 17-year-olds 
who will be over the age of consent under this measure, 
but who require special protection because of the four 
principles that I have previously outlined: that the young 
person is especially vulnerable because of personal 
circumstances; that the location makes him or her 
especially vulnerable; that the special influence of the 
adult is such that the relationship is similar to in loco 
parentis and is brought to bear on the young person; or 
that there is a lack of access by that young person to other 
adults and therefore the absence of a countervailing 
influence. In such circumstances, 16 and 17-year-olds 
require special protection.
<P>
At the heart of the Bill is the fact that the sexual activity 
with which we are primarily dealing is that which takes 
place between the young person and a person in a position 
of trust on a consensual, albeit unequal and improper, 
basis. The provisions in the Bill are designed to counter 
that particular mischief. However, on any interpretation 
of the clause, the offence of abuse of trust is not limited 
to those of 16 or 17 years of age, so the point made by 
the hon. Member for Hertsmere is misdirected. It could 
be used against someone who abused a position of trust 
in respect of, for example, a 13-year-old. However, as 
the amendment implicitly recognises, the criminal law can 
already deal with such offences as unlawful sexual 
intercourse with a girl under 16, indecent assault and 
indecent conduct towards those under 14. Therefore, in 
such circumstances, the amendment, although obviously 
well intentioned, is simply not necessary. Even if the 
Crown Prosecution Service did not bring a prosecution 
under any of those offences, it could still bring a charge 
of abuse of trust against the person involved. However, I 
expect that that would not be the case, and that the Crown 
Prosecution Service would choose to bring a prosecution 
for the more serious offences that I outlined.
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary because, as the hon. 
Member for Hertsmere should be aware, the Court of 
Appeal has laid down on numerous occasions that it will 
take into account abuse of trust as an aggravating factor in 
sentencing. In the case of R v. Baker in 1989, Mr Justice 
Hutchison identified a breach of trust as an aggravating 
factor in a range of sexual offences, including indecency 
with a child and unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl 
under 16. In the case of R v. Roberts and Roberts in 1982, 
the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Lane, identified abuse 
of trust as an aggravating factor in rape, as some hon. 
Members will be aware. As recently as 1997, in the case 
of R v. B, Mr. Justice Poole identified a gross breach of 
trust as an aggravating factor in a case of rape and 
indecent assault. In all such cases, an addition will be 
made to the sentence to reflect the extent of added injury 
that the court considers has occurred as a result of the 
abuse of trust.
<P>
I entirely share the sentiments of the hon. Member for 
Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh). No one would fail to take 
seriously, in terms of sentencing, the impact of abuse of 
trust on the young person offended against. Such abuse is 
corrosive of the young person's trust, his sense of self and 
identity. Continuing harm can be caused as a result of the 
peculiar nature of the relationship of trust, which requires 
from both parties that additional element which, when 
broken, has a devastating effect. I accept that entirely, but 
I cannot go from that conclusion to accepting the 
amendment, which is not necessary.
<P>
I hear what the hon. Member for Hertsmere says about 
making no claims about the drafting of the new clause, 
which is sensibly modest of him. It is technically flawed, 
but the technical flaws lie not simply in the draftsman's 
hands. It was, no doubt, a best effort; I have been there 
and done that, so I know what the hon. Gentleman has 
been through in tabling it. It is flawed because, although 
we are perfectly entitled to debate the level of sentencing 
in Committee, we cannot get away with dealing with such 
matters in an ad hoc, piecemeal way. If we do so, we shall 
get ourselves into an awful tangle and will create all sorts 
of new anomalies. The point was made with welcome 
brevity by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and 
Abingdon (Dr. Harris) that the issue is an example of the 
extent to which the law is full of unconscionable 
anomalies. Another one would be created if we accepted 
the proposal of the hon. Member for Hertsmere. If abuse 
of trust is to be an aggravating factor applicable to 
indecent assault, why not indecency between men when 
it involves a boy under 16? Why should the penalty in 
those circumstances be different?



<P>
The sexual offences review will take place in 
circumstances very different from those in this 
Committee. People will be able to reflect at leisure, 
receive evidence and submissions and take a view in the 
round that is simply not available to us in the time that 
we have or by the nature of our proceedings. This is not 
the place to take an overview of sentencing within the 
procedural and time constraints that apply. The sexual 
offences review, which I am glad has been welcomed on 
both sides of the Committee, will do so, and I expect it to 
take into account the remarks made by the hon. Member 
for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) about persistent and 
repeat offences. In cases of child abuse and abuse of 
young people generally, the conduct is often of a serial 
nature. The considerable sheaf of cuttings 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> These are for the next debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I see we have one of those days ahead 
of us. The considerable sheaf of cuttings that I see on 
the Conservative Front Bench will undoubtedly show that 
some indeed, probably the majority of those who 
appear before the courts on such matters have offended 
again and again and will continue to do so unless we put 
a stop to it. It is right that the sexual offences review 
should encompass the problem of serial offending 
highlighted by the hon. Member for New Forest, East.
<P>
The amendment does not meet the requirements for the 
reasons that I have outlined. The offence of abuse of trust 
is primarily about protecting 16 and 17-year-olds in what 
would otherwise be consensual relationships. A person 
under 16 cannot lawfully consent to sexual activity. Other 
offences and penalties are available to the prosecuting 
authorities. There is already a range of offences to protect 
those under 16, and the courts will treat abuse of trust 
as an aggravating factor as they should. Concern about 
inadequate penalties for existing offences should be dealt 
with as part of the sexual offences review as a whole.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Although I well understand why the hon. Member for 
Hertsmere has brought the matter before the Committee, 
I ask him to reconsider and to withdraw his amendment 
because, for the reasons that I have given, we cannot 
accept it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friends for 
their support. All my hon. Friends except my hon. 
Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson), for 
understandable reasons have spoken in favour of the 
amendment.
<P>
I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Oxford, 
West and Abingdon and understand his point about 
disparity in sentencing, and the sentences available for 
unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl and buggery in the 
case of a boy when the event is consensual. The 
amendment was trying to establish the principle that, in 
either case, whatever the penalty, it should be an 
aggravated additional penalty when there is a breach of 
trust by an older person towards a younger one in this 
case, the younger person being under 16. Although I am 
grateful to the Minister for his characteristically courteous 
and considered response, I think that he missed the point 
that I was trying to make. I wanted to do more for 
under-16s, but the Minister's argument that the 
amendment is concerned primarily with 16 and 
17-year-olds and the four principles that he enunciated are 
slightly contradictory. I invite him to consider those four 
principles, which he said in our first sitting underpinned 
the legislation, and apply each one to an under 
16-year-old. He will see that, whereas they have great 
force for 16 and 17-year-olds, they have an even stronger 
force for those under 16.
<P>
The Minister talked about vulnerable people. 
Under-16s will be more vulnerable even than 16 and 
17-year-olds simply because they are younger. He 
referred to people being in loco parentis, which of course 
applies to under-16s. Local authority homes or 
organisations are in loco parentis, which has much greater 
force for under-16s than for 16 and 17-year-olds. The 
Minister talked about lack of access to an adult. A person 
under 16 years of age in one of those settings will have 
less access to an adult than a 16 or 17-year-old, not least 
because the child is in care. If the child tries to leave the 
home, he is likely to be returned to it, which is not 
necessarily the case with a 16 or 17-year-old. I suggest 
that each of the Minister's arguments is an argument for 
the amendment.
<P>
The Minister made a very ministerial point when he 
said that such offences were already covered in law and 
that there were learned authorities from the Court of 
Appeal saying that judges and magistrates must take those 
offences more seriously when there is a breach of trust. 
I hear all that, but even though such authorities exist, 
what Parliament says goes further; it is a stronger 
authority than whatever the courts may say. Parliament 
would be sending a message that those offences should 
be taken more seriously.
<P>
The Government have taken that view in regard to other 
offences; racially aggravated offences, for example. 
I remember the debates that we had on that. The Minister 
has quoted authorities in support of the argument that the 
abuse of trust by an older person should be regarded as 
an aggravating factor; such authorities also exist in 
support of the argument for regarding racial motivation as 
an aggravating factor. However, on the latter offence, the 
Government took the view and the Opposition understood 
why that they wanted to send a stronger message by 
setting a high maximum penalty.
<P>
The Minister did not have this present responsibilities 
when the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 was being 
debated. As some of my hon. Friends will remember, we 
took a constructive view and tried to suggest ways in 
which the Government could take the measure even 
further. We are saying that if it was and it was right 
to set down such a penalty in the case of the aggravating 
factor of racial motivation, it is right to do so in the case 
of the aggravating factor that we are discussing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> My hon. Friend knows that the courts are 
now allowed to read the Minister's speeches in Hansard. 
Does he agree that the Minister's comments this morning 
have created a dangerous precedent? The Minister appears 
to be saying that an evil exists that should be confronted, 
but that there is no need for a new law because the courts 
already view breach of trust as an aggravating factor. My 
hon. Friend referred to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, 
on the Committee stage of which we both served. The 
Government are demonstrating their double standards 
regarding the two types of offences and are creating a 
dangerous constitutional precedent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend speaks with the 
experience of having served on the Committee stage of 
that Bill. He will remember the approach taken by both 
sides at the same time. We need to think about what more 
we could do to protect under-16s because, to repeat my 
earlier point, it was they who were involved in all the 
cases of abuse that have occurred over the years in various 
settings and about which the House rightly expressed 
concern when we debated the matter last summer. 
Parliament should be debating such abuse because its 
incidence over the years is shocking and scandalous. We 
want to seize every opportunity to do something about it 
and to send out the appropriate signal.
<P>
I know that the Minister is concerned about the 
matter I acquit him of any lack of personal concern 
but his arguments were misdirected and the Government's 
overall approach verges on the sort of complacency to 
which Utting referred. We wanted the Government to 
embrace the principle of sending a strong message in the 
case of offences that are aggravated by a breach of trust. 
I am not satisfied by the Minister's approach.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint </B>(Don Valley): My concern about the 
amendment is the same as that raised by the hon. Member 
for Eastbourne; it seems to draw a comparison between 
consent given by under-16s and over-16s. If the abuse of 
trust involves a child under 16, consent has implicity not 
been given. Our debate centres on the issue of lowering 
the age of consent to 16 to which Opposition Members 
are opposed and the abuse of trust involved is therefore 
that of 16 and 17-year-olds.
<P>
I was happy to support the amendment of my hon. 
Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Ashton) in our 
debate last year and I accept that issues exist in regard to 
under-16s that must be addressed, as I hope will happen 
under the review, but I am concerned about sending the 
message that those aged under 16 can implicity give 
consent to sexual relations and about trying the two issues 
together in the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Lady is slightly missing the 
point. [Interruption.] It is true that the new clause goes 
wider than the specific remit of the legislation; the 
Minister may take comfort in that, but it is a threadbare 
refuge. As I made clear earlier, I appreciate that the 
offence already exists in regard to youngsters under 16 
the amendments are saying that an offence that is 
committed by someone in a position of trust is even more 
serious and attract a higher penalty. Many cases involving 
people who are in a position of trust who are often not 
serial offenders have cropped up over the years.
<P>
The Minister spoke about serial offenders, but offences 
are often committed by someone who is persistent and 
devious but who gets into a position of authority. Such 
cases may never come to light and such people may have 
no history of previous convictions. We want to send out 
a message to those people that they will face a stiff 
sentence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): Does my hon. 
Friend agree that if, in my view misguidedly, Parliament 
is to reduce the age of consent that has already been 
debated and it is not a matter for the Committee it must 
lose no opportunity to state in every possible context that, 
by reducing the age of the consent, Parliament is not 
sending the message to offenders that they will be treated 
less harshly. Indeed, Parliament should be sending the 
opposite message.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We want to protect those who are 
under 16, who, we believe, are all the more vulnerable in 
such circumstances. I listened carefully to the Minister's 
response, but I shall press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Does my hon. Friend know whether 
members of the Committee have a free vote on the 
amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> There will certainly be a free vote for 
Conservative members. The result of that will be no 
surprise, however, because Conservative members of the 
Committee have made clear in speeches or interventions 
their support for the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I confirm that 
Liberal Democrats will have a free vote. I have sympathy 
with the hon. Gentleman's arguments. The proposal deals 
with under 16-year-olds, a matter that excites me more 
than the issue of older people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> We have had a good debate, but let us 
be clear what it is about. We are discussing whether the 
current sentencing regime is too low, but the matter has 
been dressed up as something else. I have not discussed 
it, but the chances are that members of the Committee 
may agree with me that, in the main, the current 
sentencing regime for a range of offences is too low. We 
have established a review body, the purpose of which is 
to determine whether it is too low. I shall certainly draw 
the deliberations of the Committee to the attention of the 
review body. It must take into account the views of a 
range of people so that it can go to Ministers with a 
coherent and informed opinion about sentencing and 
penalties. I look forward to that; Parliament must have 
the opportunity to reach its own conclusion and to send 
messages to society and the judiciary about penalties and 
sentencing.
<P>
It is important that our message is direct and true, not 
muddled and confused. That is why the contribution of 
my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline 
Flint) was so absolutely spot on. We want to protect those 
in consensual relationships. The Government's view is 
that all under-16s are vulnerable. Consent is neither here 
nor there; they are entitled to full protection under the law.
<P>
There is nothing more odious than sexual offences 
against children. Undoubtedly, they are aggravated by an 
abuse of trust and it is important that we put in place a 
coherent set of penalties. Offenders may well require a 
higher penalty, but a piecemeal approach to such matters 
will create nothing but confusion and mystification where 
none should exist.
<P>
I give the hon. Member for Hertsmere an example. Is 
he seriously suggesting that the new clause is necessary? 
What on earth does it add? Absolutely nowt, because in a 
case of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 13, 
offenders are already susceptible to a punishment of life 
imprisonment. He may want to see much stiffer penalties, 
as I do, but that is not how to achieve that goal.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have listened with great care to the arguments so 
ably presented

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh </b>rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I enjoy listening to the hon. Member 
for Gainsborough enormously, but he has overblown the 
matter into a major constitutional issue. It is, of course, 
nothing of the sort.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> He did not say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> He did. The hon. Gentleman was not 
listening. I was listening; I always listen. The hon. 
Member for Gainsborough managed to bring the 
constitution into the debate I do not know how; it was 
uncharacteristically overblown, even for him.
<P>
We have an opportunity with the Bill to send a clear 
message. Please let us do that. We should not confuse the 
issue; we must oppose the amendment, and we shall.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> One of the pleasures of serving on this 
Committee, Mr. Atkinson, is that it gives us the chance to 
admire the Minister's skill as an advocate. Whenever we 
hit on something of public importance, we know that, if 
the Minister does not have an adequate reply, he will slide 
off and talk about something completely different.
<P>
The Minister has skilfully moved the goalposts by 
talking about sentences in general. Irrespective of the 
general level of sentencing for sexual offences, the 
principle that we are trying to establish is that, if such an 
offence is committed against someone under 16 years of 
age by an older person in a position of trust, a higher 
maximum penalty should apply. Such people should face 
a tougher sentence because they are abusing their position 
of trust.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for 
giving way, as I know that he is keen to press on. 
I suggested an alternative way to deal with this very 
serious issue. I sympathise with what the hon. Gentleman 
is trying to do: find a way of ensuring that a position of 
trust will vitiate consent in what is currently unlawful 
sexual intercourse a "consenting"	 offence. Is not that the 
most appropriate way to continue? The Government 
accept that the abuse of trust regulations are quite widely 
drawn. if the courts or the prosecution authorities 
determine that the position of trust has vitiated consent, 
tougher maximum sentences are already available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's 
reasons for wishing to take that course. The problem is 
that, even though the act may be consensual, it would still 
be an offence with someone who was under 16-years-old. 
Such a person could not legally consent, which would 
thereby make it an unlawful activity. A girl of 14 or 15 
giving her consent to sexual intercourse will not make it 
a lawful activity. It will still be an unlawful activity even 
if she consents. If she does not consent, however, it will 
be rape a much more serious offence.
<P>
Nevertheless, as the law says, such girls must often be 
protected from themselves; and there are other reasons for 
wanting to protect them. It would be an offence even if 
she had given consent, a point also made by the hon. 
Member for Don Valley. If she was under 16-years-old 
and gave consent, it would still be an offence for the older 
person to engage in that activity with her.
<P>
I come to the Minister's final point, which was the one 
that I enjoyed most. Once again, we have the advantage 
of having served on the Committee that was considering 
the Crime and Disorder Bill when the Government were 
faced with the problem of how to treat racially motivated 
offences. Many such offences carry a maximum of life 
imprisonment. However, some offences that are racially 
motivated have a sentence of life imprisonment and others 
do not. Even though some of the more serious offences 
carry a life sentence, the Government pressed ahead with 
setting a higher maximum penalty for the lesser offences 
that carry a determinate sentence if racial aggravation is 
proved. The Minister smiles; I shall give an example. As 
he knows, the offence of wounding with intent carries a 
discretionary life sentence of imprisonment; the offence 
of wounding, without intent, carries a maximum sentence 
of five years. The fact that a life sentence is available for 
the more serious offence of wounding with intent did not 
prevent the Government from setting a higher maximum 
sentence for wounding in cases of racial aggravation. The 
Opposition said that that should be examained, to embrace 
the principle across the board, but the Government did not 
share that view. The Government faced exactly the same 
issue in dealing with racially aggravated offences, and did 
not find it to be an insurmountable obstacle, as the 
Minister claims it to be today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Can my hon. Friend recall a single instance 
in the Committee when the then Minister of State, Home 
Office, now Secretary of State for Wales, the hon. 
Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael), 
said that the introduction of a new offence was not 
necessary because judges always increased the sentence if 
the attack was racially motivated?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes a fair point. 
More or less implicitly, the then Minister did not take that 
view. He took the view that Parliament should send out 
the signal that it took that matter especially seriously. We 
fully understand the reasons given, but if we can do it for 
that, we can do it for the protection of under-16s from 
abuse of trust by older people. Otherwise, we must face 
the fact that the Bill will contain nothing to protect 
younger people. We shall therefore press the amendment 
to a Division.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We have now reached the important 
question of who should be regarded as being in a position 
of trust for the purposes of the Bill. According to the Bill, 
a person over 18 is in a position of trust in relation to a 
person under that age 16 or 17 if the older person 
satisfies any one of the four conditions specified in clause 3. The amendments tabled in my name and in that of my hon. Friends would add a further two conditions. The 
Committee will have noticed that it is grouped with 
amendments tabled by other hon. Members that would 
add other conditions. The two conditions proposed in the 
amendments tabled in my name and in that of my hon. 
Friends would apply to members of a Church or religious 
organisation and to members of youth organisations.
<P>
The Committee will, no doubt, by now be familiar with 
the four principles that the Minister has enunciated as 
underpinning the Bill's legal framework. I do not propose 
to detail each of those now, but in dealing with the 
question of the position of trust in the Bill, the Minister 
has made it clear that the Government regard the special 
influence of the adult as especially important. That is a 
fair and important point. However, on reflection, it is 
rather difficult on that basis to distinguish between the 
relationship between, for example, a teacher and a child, 
and the relationships between other categories of older 
people and a child or, rather, a 16 or 17-year-old.



<P>
Many other people would find it hard to distinguish, 
say, the relationship between boy scout or girl guide 
leaders and youngsters, between clergymen and 
youngsters and between teachers and youngsters. As for 
clergymen or faith leaders of whatever domination, it is 
arguable that there is potential for an even more special 
relationship to exist. In religious organisations, there is an 
additional element of spiritual authority that can give a 
vicar or priest more control over youngsters and result in 
their being more highly trusted by adults and the families 
of the youngsters.
<P>
Sad to say, a small but significant minority of spiritual 
leaders do abuse children. The Minister referred to the 
bundle of papers that I had in front of me during the 
previous debate. It comprised notes on cases concerning 
different religions and nominations in which young people 
had been the victims of an abuse of trust. They are 
worrying cases and give rise to great concern. We must 
see what we can do about the problem.
<P>
The working group identified certain criteria for the 
position of trust, any one of which could result in a 
relationship coming within that ambit. One criterion is 
that the position is strong and well established, and that 
the person is in loco parentis. That would include the 
teaching profession and foster parents. As I have made 
clear, others besides teachers occupy strong, well 
established positions of trust and we should not allow 
ourselves to be over-inhibited by the concept of in loco 
parentis. Surely, we should show some flexibility. 
I suspect that many members of the public would want 
us to extend the legal protection of establishing a position 
of trust for those purposes to cases where it is needed.
<P>
If we do not take a more flexible approach, we will be 
in danger of creating anomalies and inconsistencies that 
will do little to enhance the standing of the Bill. We may 
hear more about that from other members of the 
Committee during our debate. Will the Minister say why 
other people in important positions of trust should not be 
brought within the ambit of the position of trust? We have 
in mind particularly leaders of youth organisations and 
religious, spiritual leaders.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> While I support what my hon. Friend 
said, I shall address my remarks to amendments Nos. 7 
and 8. When it comes to clergymen, scout masters, youth 
leaders and the like, there is much press coverage of 
abuses of trust. Such matters always seem to attract tremendous headlines in the tabloids. Fortunately, I do not read many of them, but a scurrilous and prurient attitude 
always comes to the fore.
<P>
The majority of cases of child abuse take place within 
the family. I took advice on amendment No. 8, which is 
why it relates particularly to godparents. My intention 
was, however, to deal more with those who were put in a 
position of trust by parents. As for amendment No. 7, the 
Minister will know more about the extent of child abuse 
within families than I do. However, every report draws 
on the fact that parents more often, step-parents, foster 
parents and siblings are responsible for that abuse. 
Parents and blood siblings are dealt with under the law 
of incest, but extended families are not dealt with in the 
same way.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Murder is, of course, covered by other laws, but I cite 
the murder of a poor child in Warminster a couple of 
years ago as an example. The stepfather took the child out 
of the family home, sexually assaulted the child and then 
murdered it. That sort of case produces headlines, but 
many other cases involve children of 16 and 17. A case 
in my constituency was recently drawn to my attention. It 
was horrific, and I shall not dwell on the details except to 
say that a girl was systematically abused first by 
someone whom she referred to as "uncle"	 and 
subsequently by other members of her family. Part of that 
abuse would have been incest, but part would not; it is 
the latter that concerns me.
<P>
Hon. Members may say that that abuse took place 
before the girl was 16. It may have done, but we should 
send a clear signal that abuse is not acceptable while the 
victim is a child, even though the child may have been 
led to believe that it was perfectly acceptable and normal. 
In many cases of child abuse, the victims are led to 
believe that the abuse is part of so-called family life, or 
of life within the extended family. Abuse of children 
under 16 is already outlawed, but we should give the 
protection of the law also to children over 16.
<P>
I hope that amendment No. 8 will catch family friends. 
It is a probing amendment, and I suspect that it is flawed. 
However, I hope that it will be considered in the 
forthcoming review of sexual offences legislation. The 
amendment would cover someone being entrusted by his 
or her parents to a family friend. For instance, using the 
terminology of the Bill, A may take his own child and 
another child, B, every week to watch football, to dancing 
classes or, as the child gets older, to discos. As the 
children grow up, a friendship springs up between A and 
B, which is quite normal. B may even develop a crush on 
A. However, it seems to me that A would be taking 
advantage of that friendship if he it is normally he 
abused his position of trust with B.
<P>
The Committee, and Parliament, should say that that is 
not acceptable. We should protect the child and reassure 
those parents who entrust their child to another. Some will 
say that the law should not be involved, but I disagree. 
We should make it clear that we will not tolerate such 
abuse and that it is not acceptable in our society. As for 
the family clause, when the time comes, I shall certainly 
press it to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> A week ago, the Home Office published a 
report on sex offences against children. The forward to 
that report was at least signed by the Minister 
[Interruption.] Given the hon. Gentleman's intelligence, 
it may have been written by him. He said that it would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"enable the police and other agencies to focus their efforts on where 
the majority of offending occurs. Sex abuse by a stranger is of great 
concern to the public but the report shows that abuse within the 
family, or by an individual who has a relationship based on trust 
with the child, is more common"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I want to speak to all the amendments in this group, 
but I shall speak first to amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 25, 
the latter being in my name. The amendments are about 
the abuse of trust within the family. We all agree that that 
is the ultimate abuse of trust. We all agree that it is within 
the family that there is the greatest opportunity to abuse 
trust. We all agree also that it is within the family that the 
abuse of trust can cause the greatest damage.
<P>
Children are protected from abuse in the home by two 
types of law. First, they are protected by general laws on 
sexual offences, such as rape, indecency with children, 
indecent assault and age-related consent offences. 
Secondly, incest is criminalised throughout the western 
world. For a girl in a family, the United Kingdom law 
on incest criminalises her brother, half-brother, father or 
grandfather for having sexual intercourse with her. There 
are parallel arrangements for boys. Incest is so repugnant 
to society that it has always been believed that it should be 
a criminal offence. Indeed, there is a seven-year custodial 
penalty and, if a man commits incest with a girl under the 
age of 13, the penalty is life.
<P>
Everyone agrees that such an offence is shocking and it 
disgusts right-thinking people. To allow sexual behaviour 
between a father and his daughter or between a brother 
and his sister undermines the family. We have always 
agreed on that. As I said when we debated an earlier 
amendment, abuse in the home can cause far more 
damage than other sorts of abuse because it shatters 
children's trust in adults. It shatters their understanding 
of familial affection and can affect their ability to form 
relationships later in life. Therefore, incest should be 
recognised as a specific offence.
<P>
I support amendment No. 7, tabled by my hon. Friend 
the Member for Blaby. As he said, step-parents are 
uniquely able to abuse their position of trust, but no law 
of incest applies to them. I have a report on broken homes 
and battered children, written by Robert Whelan and 
published by the family education trust. It is a study of 
the relationship between child abuse and family type. The 
report is based on an analysis of the registers of the 
National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Children, covering both sexual and physical abuse, so it 
is well researched. Its conclusions are interesting, and 
show that children in step-families are six times more 
likely to be abused than children living with their two 
natural parents, whether married or cohabiting. That is a 
worrying statistic. The risk of abuse for children in 
step-families is 33 times more than that in a married 
family. That is an analysis of cases of abused and at-risk 
children taken from the Family Court Reporter. This is 
proper research not just someone sounding off. The 
analysis is based on what has been happening in the 
family courts.
<P>
The definition of "head of household"	, which is 
mentioned in the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend 
the Member for Blaby, covers live-in adults who may 
exercise some of the responsibilities of a parent. The term 
"head of household"	 is broad enough to catch situations 
where there is no relationship of blood or marriage 
between the abuser and the young person, but where the 
abuse of trust is considerable. Our country's divorce rate 
is one of the highest in the world, so there are many 
more step-families.
<P>
The statistics are clear, and we should take amendment 
No. 7 extremely seriously. It may be technically defective, 
but it identifies a serious point. We need to establish the 
principle that abuse of trust by step-parents must be 
treated by the law in exactly the same way as abuse of 
trust by parents.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 8, which was also tabled by 
my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby, and which covers 
those who look after children with the consent of parents. 
The Utting report has already been mentioned in our 
debates. it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"An outstanding characteristic is their ability to establish 
themselves in roles in which they are trusted to excess as friend, 
colleague or employee."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In situations such as holidays or social events, a young 
person can start to feel relaxed with an adult carer and if 
an adult spends a lot of his time with a young person, 
he obviously has opportunities to abuse his position. The 
amendment at least raises an important debating point.
<P>
I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments 
on amendment No. 25, which stands in my name. I may 
be wrong the Minister, with all his advisers, will correct 
me if I am but I believe that there is no equivalent to 
the law on incest for homosexuals. The law on incest, 
which has existed for centuries, criminalises incest if it is 
heterosexual, but not if it is homosexual. Those who 
support the Bill it is well known that I am not one of 
them argue that homosexual and heterosexual behaviour 
must be treated in the same way. Should they not also 
accept equality between homosexual and heterosexual 
offences? Such equality between sexual orientations is 
clearly the will of Parliament, which we must accept; 
why, therefore, have we allowed that lacuna in the law? 
My amendment would rectify it.
<P>
If a father has sex with his daughter, the law is clear: 
that is incest and he can go to prison for a very long 
time in theory, for life. However, the law does not 
regard the offence of a father committing buggery with 
his son as one that involves an abuse of trust and 
disregards the fact that it is incestuous. My amendment 
therefore addresses the gross inequality between 
heterosexual and homosexual offences committed within 
the family. If accepted, it would give further protection 
to children.
<P>
The Home Office report, to which I have alluded, 
makes clear what we already know from our experience, 
namely, that the overwhelming majority of sex offenders 
are men, which is why the law targets them. According 
to that report, women commit less than 5 per cent. of 
sexual offences against children. That figure is hardly 
surprising, but it is very low. Our law on abuse of trust 
should give the same protection to boys as it does to girls. 
At present, girls are for obvious reasons especially 
protected from close relatives, but boys are not. The law 
treats abuse by a father of his son as though the parties 
were complete strangers, which is very odd.
<P>
I do not have to hand the statistics on the number of 
cases involving fathers abusing their sons; maybe the 
Minister does have the figures and will tell us that it does 
not happen very often. Even if that is so, it must happen 
and it is a very serious offence. The Minister will 
probably say that the judge would view the offence as a 
particularly serious one and he may be able to quote 
judgments to me; if so, I should be interested to hear 
them. The Minister is obviously in the process of 
reviewing the laws. Even if he will not accept my 
amendment, I hope that he agrees that I am making a 
serious and arguable point and that he will at least look 
into it.
<P>
My next point is a general one, but is important because 
it undermines our debate. Having been in the House for 
16 years and witnessed the annual criminal justice Bill, I 
know that we are constantly making laws, criminalising 
more and more behaviour to the extent that on the 
debates on the Crime and Disorder Bill, I and my hon. 
Friends found ourselves to the left of the Labour party. 
However, there is no point in creating more offences if the 
police and the Crown Prosecution Service do not pursue 
prosecutions. The number of prosecutions for many 
sexual offences has fallen. The Home Office report 
states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the number of cautions and convictions for sexual offences against 
children has been declining steadily in recent years"	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"notifications of offences of gross indecency with children 14 or 
under of either sex...have more than doubled from 633 to 1,287 
over a 10 year period"	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to 1995. Convictions for the same offence over the same 
period have declined from 328 to 213. Notifications 
nearly doubled, but convictions fell by one third. I wonder 
why; I should be interested to hear the Minister's 
comments. What are the police doing?

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Clever lawyers.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> It is not a casual point. The Crown 
Prosecution Service and the police are not pursuing 
prosecutions. It has nothing to do with acquittal rates.
<P>
In 1987, there were 244 convictions and cautions for 
incest 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. 
Gentleman, but I have difficulty in following how this is 
relevant to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> It is relevant, but I have made my point 
and need not labour it. It is highly relevant, because there 
is absolutely no point in our creating new offences if the 
police do not pursue such matters. However, I shall not 
say any more; I have made my point. The statistics that I 
quoted are extremely alarming.
<P>
I should like briefly to speak to the important 
amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for 
Hertsmere. Abuse by members of religious organisations 
has received much publicity, and Parliament should be 
worried about it. It may be much more difficult for people 
who are abused in a religious context to come to the view 
that such abuse is wrong. As we all know, those who 
provide spiritual guidance can become very close to their 
charges, and sometimes that closeness can be mistaken for 
romantic affection. If such an amendment were passed, I 
hope that it would help to underline the point that such 
abuse of trust is especially serious.
<P>
Amendment No. 5 deals with the field of youth work, 
which is interesting because it takes place in a much more 
informal setting than the classroom. It provides an 
interface between adults and young people in a setting 
that is quite unlike any other. It is far less formal than 
school, with far fewer restraints. Sadly, some people 
deliberately obtain positions in youth organisations to gain 
access to children and young people. It is not uncommon 
for young people in such an informal setting, which may 
be a rather exciting environment such as on an outward 
bound course, to have a crush on an older person. It is 
especially reprehensible if that older person uses the 
position of trust in which he is placed as youth leader to 
abuse young people. Although the amendment may not be 
acceptable for various reasons, I hope that the Minister 
will make clear his abhorrence of such behaviour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I have some sympathy with amendments 
Nos. 4 and 5, which propose the inclusion of categories 
that seem to be equivalent to the other categories of 
people under discussion. Equivalence is the important 
thing. We have introduced a series of categories that could 
broadly be seen as equivalent to in loco parentis. The 
categories proposed in amendments Nos. 4 and 5 
religious leaders and leaders of youth organisations who 
have 16 and 17-year-olds in their care seem broadly 
equivalent.
<P>
I am much more concerned about the other 
amendments, which would include new categories of 
people that are not equivalent to those included in the 
main thrust of the Bill. We must remember that we are 
dealing with a very small window in young people's 
lives the ages of 16 and 17. Horrendous offences are 
committed against children under 16, but they are outwith 
the scope of the Bill and the categories under discussion. 
We are debating 16 and 17-year-olds only and how to 
respond to certain acts by different categories of people. 
I would feel more comfortable dealing with step-parents 
or parents and incest as a separate issue, perhaps within 
the review of sexual offences legislation. That matter is 
not about 16 and 17-year-olds but about 18, 19, 20 or 
21-year-olds and so on. Incest is not equivalent to the 
offences in the Bill.
<P>
As for amendment No. 8, I was concerned that 
Christians might feel discriminated against, given that it 
refers to godparents, which exists only in that religion. 
I then noticed, however, that it covered another category 
in that parents could, if they felt so inclined, legitimately 
allow their 16 or 17-year-old child to go on holiday with 
an 18 or 19-year-old partner. That is not something that 
all parents would feel comfortable about, but those who 
do would be brought within the scope of the amendment. 
Any person with whom a child is entrusted by the parents 
could fall within the ambit of the amendment, and I am 
worried that we are drawing it too wide. We cannot tell 
parents how to parent and if they choose to allow that 
activity, it is within their remit to do so.
<P>
We are debating limits on consent. Under the law, 
16-year-olds can consent to certain sexual acts. If they 
consent to have sex with a range of people outside the 
categories listed in the proposal, we are saying that that 
is absolutely fine under the law. We must be careful that 
we limit the Bill to certain categories. Why are teachers 
and care workers included in amendments Nos. 4 and 5, 
while youth organisations and religious organisations are 
not? To what extent does the hon. Member of Hertsmere 
intend to follow the working group's recommendations to 
extend the categories?
<P>
Clause 3(1) gives the Secretary of State the power by 
statutory instrument to extend the provisions. However, 
the issue of incest in amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 25 must 
be dealt with comprehensively and put well clear of that 
of 16 and 17-year-olds. We should make stepfamilies 
equivalent to any other family relationship under the law 
of abuse. Abuse against anyone within the family at 
whatever age, should be treated seriously.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I endorse everything that my hon. Friend 
the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) said about 
amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 25. I welcome the recognition 
by the hon. Member for Gainsborough of the need for 
equality, as I do the sentiment behind his amendment. It 
is right that where the incest law applies to heterosexual 
relations, it should apply to homosexual relations. I had 
not previously done so, but I now look forward to working 
with him in the search for equality in all areas before, 
during or after the review that the Government have set 
up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I wish to testify to the liberalism of the hon. 
Member for Gainsborough. During our debates on the 
Crime and Disorder Bill, he regularly quoted the Howard 
League for Penal Reform in support of his argument.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> The term "strange bedfellows"	 springs to 
mind, but I do not think that it should be used in this 
context.
<P>
I invite the hon. Member for Hertsmere to find more 
common ground in relation to amendments Nos. 4 and 5. 
I have two concerns about the framework of the Bill and, 
if they were met, I would not have a problem with the 
expansion of the categories, by way of an amendment or 
a statutory instrument. The Bill has been drafted too wide, 
as have the amendments. My hon. Friend the Member for 
Hallam and I have tabled amendments that would limit 
the scope of the Bill, but the same problems apply to 
amendments Nos. 4 and 5.
<P>
Amendment No. 5 deals with circumstances in which 
parents entrust their 16 or 17-year-old child to the care of 
a youth leader on a residential basis. The amendment 
states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A looks after persons under 18 who are members of a youth 
organisation and B is a member of that youth organisation."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I support the incorporation of amendment No. 5 within 
those categories because there seems to be no difference 
between that position of trust and that of a teacher in a 
residential establishment. The amendments have been 
tabled for that reason.
<P>
I should lay myself open to charges of inconsistency if 
I did not support a more narrow framing of amendments 
Nos. 4 and 5. The same provisions should apply to either 
residential care and/or direct pastoral care by person A 
the presumed offender of B. It is more appropriate to 
include those categories than the circumstances, to which 
I shall refer in a later debate, of teachers in large sixth 
form colleges who might have no responsibility for the 
pastoral care of other people they are not form 
teachers nor any direct educative relationship with them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman 
for giving way. I am listening to his speech with interest. 
Does he agree that it seems somewhat strange that a 
teacher who has an affair with a 16 or 17-year-old pupil 
at school will fall within the ambit of the Bill and commit 
an offence, but if that person is also the leader of a youth 
group and has an affair with a 16 or 17-year-old girl or 
boy who is not one of his pupils, he will commit no 
offence at all?
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I agree that that is an inconsistency. 
Indeed, it is even more of a gross inconsistency given that 
professional codes they might not be perfect already 
exist for teachers, but no professional codes, except 
informal codes of practice for individual organisations, 
exist for youth workers unless they are employed by a 
statutory organisation. Therefore, such codes might or 
might not apply.
<P>
Although the current legislation is too wide for schools, 
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is too narrow for 
other positions of trust. I hope that we can reach a 
satisfactory medium position, in which those with direct 
pastoral care who act in loco parentis, when parents 
expect due care and attention to be taken, will fall within 
the ambit of a criminal offence as well as under a 
disciplinary code, but other circumstances will not be 
covered. Therefore, I understand the sentiments behind 
amendments Nos. 4 and 5.
<P>
My other concern, which gives me pause before 
supporting the expansion into other categories, is the 
danger that the hon. Member for Gainsborough 
mentioned. As I have said in previous debates, if a 16 or 
17-year-old develops a crush on either a youth worker or 
a teacher in a position of trust, there is the problem of 
false accusations. False accusations are relatively common 
with unrequited crushes indeed, films have been made 
about them. The person who has had a false allegation 
made against him might be in a better position to see it 
coming if the law is restricted to positions that are clearly 
in loco parentis, involving pastoral care and/or a 
residential requirement.
<P>
At the moment, there is nothing to stop the person who 
has a crush on someone in a position of trust, a position 
in a youth organisation or a spiritual position from joining 
that organisation in order to make what might be a 
damaging blackmail threat. Such a person will say, 
"Return my affection, or I will accuse you of a criminal 
offence."	 People are less able to engineer such situations 
in schools because, whatever the system, the choice of 
school is usually made not by the child but by other 
people. As the hon. Member for Gainsborough described 
it, expanding existing categories without protection or 
restriction would lead to more problems than it would 
solve. The amendments in my name and that of the hon. 
Member for Sheffield, Hallam foresee that problem.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Finally, an analogous position is that of a homosexual 
youth worker or spiritual leader. I make no judgment on 
people taking those positions; they are entitled to take 
them. They, too, are vulnerable because of the way in 
which society treats their sexuality. They are vulnerable 
to false accusations the making of such accusations is 
not a criminal offence and are increasingly vulnerable 
to other more significant allegations; which may also be 
false.
<P>
Such people will be in a better position to protect 
themselves against false accusations if the Bill's 
provisions for schools and the proposed provision to cover 
youth organisations and spiritual organisations are more 
tightly constrained. The provisions should cover only 
direct pastoral care or residential care  for instance, on 
residential retreats or trips where people act in loco 
parentis because the children are away from home.
<P>
In closing, I ask the hon. Member for Hertsmere to 
reconsider his amendments. If he can bring them back 
more tightly framed, and if they made provisions, such as 
I have outlined, he might find support from these quarters.

<P>

<B>Mr. Joe Ashton </B>(Bassetlaw): I have some sympathy 
with the amendments. When I tabled my original 
amendment last July, I used not only the word "trust"	 but 
the words "authority, supervision and trust"	. Those three 
words were not my invention; they are used by other 
countries in the EC. The Bill has its roots in the fact that 
the European Court of Human Rights was about to impose 
an equal age of consent, whether we liked it or not. The 
previous Government and the present Government 
realised that they had to legislate; otherwise, an equal age 
of consent would have been imposed on us, and no one 
would have been happy.
<P>
Last July, we attempted to reduce the age of consent 
for homosexuals. It all sprang from a question to the 
Home Office, when I asked what happened in other 
countries. I was told that, on the question of authority, 
supervision and trust, there were two ages of consent in 
Europe. Other countries may have different definitions of 
authority, supervision and trust, and much of what the 
Opposition's amendments cover would fall into that 
category.
<P>
The amendment to the Crime and Disorder Bill was 
rejected in the other place last year. In a way, I am glad 
that it was rejected, because it has enabled us to debate 
the issue properly something that we could not do in 
three hours on an amendment tacked on to another Bill. 
That would have been a ludicrous way of doing business.
<P>
Since then, however, the matter has been much 
examined. I met my hon. Friend the Minister, and the 
Home Office wisely set up a committee to consider the 
matter. It was not easy, because the House was in recess 
at the time, but I gave a substantial amount of written 
evidence to the committee, and had interviews with Home 
Office officials. It became apparent from the report that 
its authors were experienced in matters of social work and 
in youth care. One of the first points raised by that 
committee was mentioned by the hon. Member for 
Gainsborough the valid question of incest and of 
stepfathers. It also considered the existing law and the fact 
that my hon. Friend the Minister said that a major Bill on 
sexual offences would be introduced.
<P>
If we start to incorporate into the Bill the changes 
suggested in the amendments, we might leave so many 
loopholes that no prosecutions can be brought. A case has 
to stand up in court and be proved beyond reasonable 
doubt. It is not decided on the balance of probabilities, as 
in a civil case. The "reasonable doubt"	 arguments about 
whether a youth leader was in a position of supervision, 
authority or trust could go on for ever and would 
ultimately destroy what we are trying to achieve. The 
clause will ultimately have to be tested in the courts, but 
it is designed to create a deterrent, not a punishment.
<P>
The clause was necessary because, as Utting said in his 
report, the system was not working and, as the hon. 
Member for Gainsborough said, the number of 
prosecutions was falling dramatically every year. Children 
in such cases do not make good witnesses any 
youngster, even of 15 or 16, would be intimidated by 
having to sit in court and be cross-examined under our 
adversarial system. Any child, especially one who is 
already traumatised, can be leaned on to change his 
evidence.
<P>
As the Utting report showed, the north Wales case was 
horrendous in that 2,800 statements were taken and about 
five people ultimately prosecuted; it took 10 months, cost 
hundreds of thousands of pounds and insurance 
companies opposed doing anything other than sacking the 
offenders. List 99 which listed about 100 teachers was 
not working. The BBC programme, "Just One Chance"	, 
revealed that about 1,000 teachers who were not 
included on the list had been sacked for offences against 
children. Some schools attracted terrible publicity and that 
led to situations such as that in Islington six or seven years 
ago, when the council sat on a report of child abuse 
because it did not want the bad publicity and was 
frightened that it would spread. In fact, someone sent a 
copy of the report to the Evening Standard and it made 
the situation 10 times worse. As the Utting report showed 
in great detail, there was a conspiracy between schools, 
local councils that did not want bad publicity and the 
insurance companies that did not want to pay damages for 
criminal injury. That is why I tabled the amendment.
<P>
I would like the sorts of cases that Opposition Members 
have mentioned to be included in the legislation. 
However, I also realise the practical wisdom of listening 
to the Home Office and legal experts. Too much baggage 
drags down legislation. It gives too many outlets for 
loopholes, and having the first two or three cases fail in 
court is much more damaging than having no legislation 
at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an important 
point about the climate in which we are conducting the 
debate. Is it not extraordinary that the number of 
convictions for incest has declined from 244 in 1987 to 
64 in 1997 and that, of those 64 cases, 22 merely resulted 
in cautions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> I am sad to say that the hon. Gentleman 
is right. However, would including all the different 
categories make things better or worse? I think that it 
would make the situation worse. The Crown Prosecution 
Service and the police would say that they could not make 
offences stick because of X, Y or Z they did not have 
the evidence and so on and, if cases went to court, the 
defendants would get off. The fact that people get 
acquitted for such offences is why the CPS takes fewer 
and fewer cases to court. It does not want rapists found 
innocent and coming out of court, jeering at their victims, 
with all their mates waiting for them; it also does not want 
all the newspaper headlines. Such things could encourage 
other rapists or offenders and would not do any good. A 
small, watertight Bill would catch the main offenders 
more effectively than adding amendments and new 
clauses.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister has promised that a 
wide-ranging sexual offences Bill will be introduced in 
the next Session of Parliament, which will allow us to 
start virtually from scratch and incorporate many of the 
issues that have been mentioned. The issue of stepfathers 
is a case in point. Practically every voluntary organisation 
says that that must be examined.
<P>
However, at this stage, we have to restrict the offence 
to someone acting in loco parentis in a situation in which 
the youngster can go home and tell his parents. That was 
the criterion that applied when Childline was set up by 
Esther Rantzen. The youngsters who rang the line were 
perhaps at public school while their parents were 
abroad perhaps they were civil servants who where not 
easily contactable or the children may have been in 
foster care. A careful balance must be struck between the 
youth worker who takes a child away for a week and the 
teacher who is with a youngster day in, day out. If they 
become too close, I think that they should move to another 
school. There is a fine line. Reluctantly, I must say that I 
think the amendments would do more damage than good.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> At the beginning of today's sitting, 
the Minister underlined once again his four criteria: They 
apply in different measure to the various amendments that 
we are now considering. I understand why the Minister is 
so keen to stick to those criteria. He will no doubt 
intervene if I am wrong, but I believe that he thinks 
rightly in my view that, if we do not have some definite 
tests, all sorts of anomalies will arise in the application of 
the law when it comes into force. We may then end up 
with inconsistencies in conviction and sentencing in 
courts in different parts of the country for what is arguably 
the same offence.
<P>
I realise that, if we were not to stick to those tests, the 
whole thing would become a hotch-potch and there would 
be a question mark over the practicability of having the 
clause in the Bill. If it is widened too much, we shall end 
up saying, "If it mustn't happen between this category, 
that category and the other category, why should it happen 
between any categories?"	 That is the rather more 
absolutist stance that I and many others take on the 
question following the age of consent which I appreciate 
we are not debating today, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
When we accept the Minister's case that there must be 
tight criteria and try to apply them to the various 
amendments that have been tabled, some of them fail. 
Someone going on a brief trip would fail to meet the 
criteria and somebody in a church or religious 
organisation would usually fail to meet the criteria, except 
in the case which the Minister might acknowledge of 
a sect that draws people into residence and takes over 
their whole lives. I have in mind the Moonies, who marry 
off people in mass ceremonies to partners whom they 
have not chosen for themselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. There 
was a sect in my constituency recently called the Family 
of God, whose members it is alleged were not involved 
in free sex they certainly denied having child sex. 
However, in the United States, the sect was prosecuted 
for teaching its members that they should have free sex 
and child sex. I have no idea about the people in my 
constituency, but they appeared to have no objection to 
having sex within the "family"	 as they referred to 
themselves. The sect's members has sex with anybody 
over the age of 16, which is exactly the sort of situation 
to which my hon. Friend refers.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for illustrating the 
point that I am making. In assessing which of the 
amendments if any one should support, I believe that 
the residence qualification is especially important. That is 
why I feel strongly about amendment No. 7, which 
refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the head of the household in which B resides."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What could be more fitting to the tests that the Minister 
has outlined than the fact that the abuse takes place in the 
household where B, the person under the age of 18, 
resides? That person is especially vulnerable because of 
the authority and the proximity of the abusers. The 
location lends itself to meeting the criteria set out by the 
hon. Gentleman, and the special influence of the adult 
acting in loco parentis, or even being a parent himself, 
clearly qualifies for inclusion in the criteria.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The fourth test that the Minister set out was the lack of 
access to other adults. If the abuser is resident in a 
household, that precludes the availability of anyone to 
whom the abused person may turn for advice, assistance 
and escape. Although I do not support all the 
amendments, I should be obliged if the Minister would 
deal with the two areas that I have focused on: the 
possibility that people in cults and Churches will take over 
the life of the child, and the possibility of abuse in the 
household where the child resides.

<P>

<B>Mr. Borrow </B>(South Ribble): I have considerable 
difficulty with amendments Nos. 4 and 5 because of their 
open-ended nature. I was once a venture scout, as was my 
sister 10 years later. Those who assisted the leaders of the 
organisation were aged only 19 or 20, and the thought 
that a romantic attachment that developed between a 
17-year-old girl and a 19 or 20-year-old youth leader of a 
voluntary organisation that met for an hour or two each 
week could become a criminal offence is incredible. 
People outside the House will think the same when 
considering our attempts to introduce such legislation. 
I understand the sentiments behind the amendments, but 
the way in which they are worded is so open-ended that 
we have not considered the consequences.
<P>
Youth organisations take part in sporting activities. The 
instructors will be aged 19 or 20. Are we saying that it is 
wrong for 16 or 17-year-olds to form a sexual relationship 
with whoever they wish above that age? Under current 
law, they are free to do so. Should they be stopped from 
having such a relationship with someone whom they meet 
for an hour or two a week for karate instruction or 
whatever? There is not a great age difference within a 
peer group of 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20-year-olds. At the heart 
of the abuse of trust provisions is the extent to which there 
is day-to-day, week-to-week authority over an individual. 
Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 seem to open that up to such 
an extent that the law could become ridiculous.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint:</B> The power of authority in a school or 
in residential care is obviously different from the power 
of authority in activities such as teaching someone to ski, 
swim or climb a mountain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Borrow:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. There may 
be certain issues with regard to youth organisations or 
religious bodies, but the amendments are not appropriate 
to deal with them. Such matters need to be examined 
during the sexual offences review, but not in relation to 
the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The debate has been useful, welcome 
and necessary. It has covered a wide range of matters that 
fall within our ambit, on the nature of appropriate 
relationships, on family policy generally, and on how we 
should properly regulate those matters.
<P>
Of necessity, we need to proceed with caution when 
bringing the criminal law into play. I am attracted by the 
robust approach adopted by my hon. Friend the Member 
for Batteslaw. What matters is what works. We know 
what we have to contend with. We know the nature of the 
problem. We must get to grips with it, and we must have 
a sense of priority and proportion a point made 
effectively by my hon. Friend the Member for South 
Ribble (Mr. Borrow).
<P>
We must also ensure that the Bill is sufficiently precise 
to do the business. We must create a law that commands 
the confidence and respect of the general public, and 
which will enable those charged with bringing 
prosecutions and investigating alleged offences 
successfully to achieve their objective which is to do 
justice, and to bring those engaged in abusive 
relationships to book.
<P>
One of the reasons why I say that our debate is 
welcome and necessary is that it enables us to address an 
issue referred to by several hon. Members, including my 
hon. Friend the Member for Batteslaw, for whom this has 
long been a cause of considerable concern, and the hon. 
Member for Gainsborough. I speak of attrition, and why, 
at a time of increased awareness of the scale of the 
problem, the number of successful prosecutions and of 
cautions seems to be ever-diminishing.
<P>
The figures are horrendous. I shall not quote them all, 
as I do not want to exhaust the Committee. In 1985, there 
were 2,416 indecent assaults on females under the age of 
16; in 1995, there were 2,116, which is down by 12 per 
cent. In 1985, there were 1,550 cases of unlawful sexual 
intercourse with a girl under 16; there were 603 in 1995, 
which is down by 61 per cent. That applies to each 
category of offence. Indecent assault on males under 16 
is down 29 per cent. Gross indecency on girls of 14 or 
under is down 37 per cent. Unlawful sexual intercourse 
with a girl less than 13 is down 27 per cent. So it goes on. 
Gross indecency with a boy under 14 is down 31 per cent.
<P>
We are entitled to ask why that is, and to expect 
something to be done to explore that diminishing number 
of convictions and cautions. It has nothing to do with 
smart lawyers. It is to do with the nature of our criminal 
justice system, not least its adversarial nature. It is to do 
with the priorities of the investigation and prosecution 
processes of the criminal justice system. It has something 
to do also with the extent to which the victims of and the 
witnesses to those offences are not properly dealt with by 
the criminal justice system; those people are not given 
support that they are entitled to support that would 
enable them to give their best evidence. That is why we 
are taking a series of measures in the other place, which 
will in due course come to the House of Commons, to 
safeguard the interests of witnesses and victims of such 
offences. The Home Office has therefore commissioned 
research into the attrition rate in this respect, so that we 
can discover what lies behind the alarming drop in the 
number of convictions and cautions.
<P>
In that context, the last thing that we should do is to 
add to the statute book an imprecise or unfocused law. 
We must be upfront and open about the fact that, without 
my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw, we would not 
be discussing the provisions. We owe him a debt of 
gratitude for raising the issue. We shall adopt his 
approach.
<P>
We cannot accept the amendments for a variety of 
reasons. First, the analysis of the hon. Member for New 
Forest, East was spot-on. He explained why I sought to 
tie our approach to these proceedings to the four 
principles that I have already outlined. They form the test 
that we apply to all the proposals in the Bill.
<P>
I referred to the accuracy of the hon. Gentleman's 
analysis of my approach to the issue, but I have 
disappointing news for him: none of the amendments 
even amendment No. 7, which mentions the head of the 
household meets the criteria due to lack of precision, 
although I understand the underlying thinking.
<P>
The concept of head of household is very difficult to 
define in law. I would not dream of saying who was the 
head of my household, although I know who it is, and it 
ain't me. That could apply to each and every one of us in 
different ways. The serious point is that the nature of 
family relationships now is such that it is a term of art, 
not of science; it is incapable of legal definition in a way 
that would suffice for the purposes of the criminal law.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> I understand the difficulty facing the 
Minister but, just because one cannot always identify a 
single head of a modern household, it surely cannot be 
impossible to identify who is running the household, be 
that one person or more than one, and who is at the 
receiving end of that household's regime, namely the 
child.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> We are absolutely at one about the 
importance of protecting the child who is abused. Our 
anxiety is whether any definition of a concept such as 
head of household does that job. We must get better at 
protecting children. I do not think that the definition 
proposed, or any definition of a concept such as head of 
household, will suffice, not least because of the situation 
referred to by the hon. Members for Gainsborough and 
for Blaby (Mr. Robathan) and by my hon. Friend the 
Member for Bassetlaw). The nature of families is such 
that it is possible for "uncle"	 to be head of household one 
week and, sadly, another "uncle"	 to be head of household 
the following week before a third "uncle"	 returns from 
work overseas. That is the reality of some households. 
In such circumstances, children are not protected by our 
seeking to launch legal proceedings on such unsteady 
ground.



<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere mentioned the Utting 
report, in the aftermath of which, as he knows, the 
Government made a raft of proposals and taken action. It 
is in that way, and with focused, effective criminal law, 
that we best protect children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Will the issue of step-parents and parents 
be covered in the review?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I was coming to that; I knew that I 
should not have given way. Precisely because that issue 
must be addressed, we have decided as part of the 
post-Utting agenda that it would be right to conduct a 
review of sexual offences.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The central task of that review is to tackle the question 
of how a modern law can protect vulnerable people in a 
family context. The new law will have to embrace the 
current nature of the family, in all its diversity and 
fluidity. In that context, the old law on incest is, as all 
hon. Members recognise, utterly inadequate. The old law 
on incest was designed to protect not children but the gene 
pool. It did not deal with homosexual conduct in families, 
because that did not threaten to "contaminate"	, in the 
language of eugenics, the gene pool. The new law, on 
which the review on sexual offences will advise Ministers, 
will need to focus first and foremost on child protection. 
That is what is lacking.
<P>
I understand the approach of the hon. Member for 
Oxford, West and Abingdon, but if he is trying to make 
common ground with the hon. Member for 
Gainsborough whom I know from having served with 
him on Committees he is about to discover the true 
definition of an unrequited crush. There is no way in a 
million years that they will be able to find ground that 
they can successfully hold together. I have known the hon. 
Member for Gainsborough for many years; I am learning 
about the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. 
There is no hope. However, we all have in common a 
determination to ensure that the modern family does not 
degenerate into a place where children are abused, 
perhaps because of its fluidity and diversity, so as to 
diminish the experience of childhood, which, as the hon. 
Member for Gainsborough rightly describes, happens all 
too often.
<P>
We shall consider in the review of sexual offences all 
the matters that hon. Members have raised in this 
important debate. However, the amendments, as drafted, 
do not fit the criteria that we have set and are technically 
flawed. We therefore cannot accept them.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to this very 
interesting debate and to the Minister's reply. I am 
grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough 
for again raising the issue of how best to protect the 
family.
<P>
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon 
suggested that the amendments are too widely drafted and 
asked whether I would table a more tightly framed version 
of them later. Perhaps I should have said, as I did in the 
previous debate, that I make no great claim about the 
drafting of the amendments. I say the same thing to the 
hon. Member for South Ribble. Although I make no great 
claim about the amendments, they embody my concern 
that we should give the protection that we wish to give 
where it is needed. We should not be hung up on too 
restrictive or legalistic an approach that prevents us from 
protecting young people when they need to be protected.
<P>
I join the Minister in welcoming the speech of the hon. 
Member for Bassetlaw. As I think I have said before, we 
owe him a debt of gratitude for raising the issue. What he 
said chimed in with many of my concerns about the 
approach adopted in the clause. He proposed sensible 
criteria for the sorts of people that we are trying to get 
at the possible abusers who are in positions of authority, 
supervision and trust. He made an important point, but 
those criteria would apply to people other than those who 
are specified in the four principles in the Bill.
<P>
I also agree with the hon. Gentleman's sentiments when 
he said that we should avoid leaving too many loopholes. 
That is precisely that I am concerned about. We must not 
leave loopholes or anomalies that will prevent the public 
from having confidence in the Bill. The Minister rightly 
said that he also wants the public to have confidence in 
it, but they will not have that confidence if the Bill 
contains too many loopholes and anomalies.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Ribble referred to people 
in youth organisations. That is a fair point about the Bill's 
drafting, but he will appreciate that the public are 
concerned about cases involving older people in positions 
of authority in youth organisations. The public are 
especially concerned about people in spiritual authority, 
and I am also very concerned about that.
<P>
When the Bill is enacted, a young teacher in his or her 
early twenties who wrongly forms a relationship with a 
16 or 17-year-old will be breaking the law. It is right that 
that should be so, but the person might think it strange 
that a much older clergyman in his thirties or forties will 
not be breaking the law if he engages in a relationship 
with a 16 or 17-year-old. It will take a bit of justifying to 
the young teacher concerned as to why he is breaking the 
law but the other person is not.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bassetlaw hit the nail on the head 
when he said that organisations do not want bad publicity. 
Certainly, the Church I use the word in the widest sense 
and mean religious organisations generally often does 
not want bad publicity. The churches often face a terrible 
dilemma about such matters.
<P>
Last June, The Guardian conducted an in-depth 
investigation, which echoed precisely the point made by 
the hon. Gentleman, into a particular individual in the 
Church of England against whom many members of the 
church thought it had taken insufficient action. The 
article states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Anglican church is accused by many within its ranks of 
mishandling complaints about its priests' involvement with children, 
of failing to follow the kinds of procedures which are now 
commonplace in other organisations and, above all, placing the 
interests of the suspect priest or even its own reputation above 
those of the child."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
After dealing with the particular case, the article 
continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The church is particularly vulnerable in this area. Priests are 
trusted, more than any other professional. They are expected to work 
with children; they can run youth clubs and Sunday schools and 
organise adventure holidays, and yet they alone are exempt from the 
police screening which now applies to all others employed in the 
care of children."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The article continues, quoting those who feel that the 
Church did not do everything that it could in that case.
<P>
Those are my concerns too. People in the Church are 
often in a position of spiritual authority. The Bill 
recognises that a teacher has authority over a child, and I 
suggest that in many cases clergymen and members of a 
Church have an even higher spiritual authority; they are 
taken far more on trust, not only by the young people 
concerned but by their families. If the measure should be 
applied to teachers and others looking after children in 
care, why should it not apply to others who also have 
positions of authority?
<P>
I listened carefully to what the Minister said, and I 
agree with his comments about the need for cases to be 
prosecuted properly. He made an interesting point about 
why there are fewer prosecutions than there were in 1985, 
and spoke about the nature of the legal system. I am not 
sure that the system then was any less adversarial than it 
is today; since then, many measures have been taken to 
protect vulnerable witnesses.
<P>
The Minister referred to the priorities of those who 
enforce the law and bring prosecutions. We should send 
a message to them, as well as to the public, that we take 
the matter seriously and are trying to protect 16 and 
17-year-olds. If we allow too many loopholes to remain 
open and there are too many possible anomalies, the 
measure may not be taken as seriously as we, and the 
public, would wish.
<P>
I am worried that the Minister should reject the 
amendments, even though it may be possible to frame 
better amendments to cover the abuses and mischief that 
we want to tackle, because the Government are taking 
an over-restrictive approach. I know that they have the 
important power of secondary legislation to enable them 
to add to the categories, but they should not be 
over-restrictive in future. They should give protection 
when it is needed, not allow a set of principles to become 
the be-all and end-all and, in the public's view, prevent 
young children from getting the protection that they want 
them to have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I hope that I can help the hon. 
Gentleman to draw matters to their proper conclusion. 
First, we accept that it is necessary constantly to keep the 
categories under review. That is why we have the power 
to expand them by affirmative resolution. Secondly, I 
have written to members of the Committee stating codes 
of practice will apply across the board. There is no reason 
why uniformed organisations, the Churches and all who 
have relationships with those in their charge or those who 
look up to them, should not use codes of practice to bear 
down on the mischief to which the hon. Gentleman 
referred. We are concerned with the criminal law, and we 
cannot accept that it is right to extend it in the direction 
that my hon. Friend the Member for South Ribble wanted. 
We make a distinction between the position of a teacher, 
who is in loco parentis, and someone who runs a church 
choir or with whom young people have contact in the 
context of an act of religious observance, because when 
they come home there are other adults around. Most acts 
of religious observance do not take place in a residential 
context; if they did in a Church boarding school, for 
example the Act would apply in full. But in a Church 
service, a retreat or a camp there are countervailing adult 
influences. That is my point. I understand the intentions 
of the hon. Member for Hertsmere but, in the light of that 
assurance, I urge him to think again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am aware that a statutory instrument 
will allow the Government to add other categories to the 
conditions. I am anxious that they may be taking too 
restrictive an approach, and I am aware of the codes of 
practice. As the Minister rightly said, we are talking about 
the criminal law. I am a little concerned about the 
coherence of the Government's proposals.


<P>
The Minister mentioned teachers and people in 
residential care. As I understand it, the provision is 
restricted not to teachers in a residential setting but to 
teachers in any setting. If teachers are covered by it, why 
not other groups when there is concern that the person 
occupies a high position of trust, especially that of 
spiritual authority? I am not asking the Minister to give 
any guarantees, but, if he is willing to reconsider the 
matter and examine the possibility of other categories, I 
shall withdraw the amendment. If his mind is closed to 
that as I suspect it is and the Government intend to 
take a restrictive position and not allow other categories 
to be included in the Bill, I shall press the amendment to 
a Division.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> This is the only occasion when I have 
regretted not reading law at university. It always seemed 
a rather dry subject. Having listened to the Minister and 
to my hon. Friends the Member for Hertsmere and for 
Gainsborough, however, I realise that they have a greater 
understanding than I do about the subject, which is 
extremely useful on such occasions.
<P>
Last week, the Minister accused me of being 
idiosyncratic. I shall accuse him not of that today, but of 
letting himself down with his understanding of language. 
He referred wrongly to the hon. Member for Batteslaw, 
instead of Bassetlaw as in hound. I accept that that is a 
small point but, more important, was his reference to "in 
loco parentis"	. I studied Latin, and "in loco parentis"	 
means "in place of parents"	.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Bassetlaw said, what could be 
more loco parentis than a second father, a step-father or 
an uncle who drifts in from outside? That person is in 
place of parents. Surely, amendment No. 7 meets all the 
Minister's criteria. My hon. Friend the Member for 
Gainsborough brought forward chapter and verse to 
support it, which was extremely useful. The Minister 
should accept amendment No. 7 or give a commitment to 
put a similar provision in the Bill.
<P>
The Minister's catch-all is that such matters will be 
studied in the forthcoming review of sexual offences. That 
is all very well, but if the hon. Gentleman will not accept 
something that meets his four principles especially in 
loco parentis that is an argument for scrapping the Bill 
all together. I would be pleased about that withdraw the 
Bill, by all means. While I should be happy to withdraw 
amendment No. 8, I would not be happy to withdraw 
amendment No. 7.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take 
the following amendments: No. 11 in page 3, line 22, 
leave out from `B' to end of line 23 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) is receiving such education; and
<P>
(b) resides in that institution.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 10, in, page 3, line 23, after `education', insert 
`from A'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I shall not detain the Committee long. 
The amendment would remove the term "full-time"	 before 
the word "education"	, so that education being given in an 
institution is sufficient cause for a position of trust to 
apply. What difference is there in full-time or part-time 
education when considering that position of trust?
<P>
Let us say that there are two children with exactly the 
same birthday going through the education system in their 
local comprehensive. After GCSEs at age 16, one 
continues to do A-levels and the other schoolmate goes 
off to sixth form college in a part-time capacity because 
he has a part-time job. He does one A-level there, while 
his schoolmate studies full-time and does, say, three 
A-levels. What difference can there be in the relationship 
between the teacher and the taught? The same would 
apply if, after school or college, they both took part in 
football or swimming training. There is an anomaly and 
the clause should cover not only full-time education but 
all education.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I shall speak to my amendment and 
amendment No. 11 in the name of my hon. Friend the 
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. We are trying to 
explore similar issues, many of which were raised during 
discussion of the previous group of amendments.
<P>
The net should be drawn to catch the appropriate 
people, according to the principles set out by the Minister. 
I share some of the concerns of the hon. Member for 
Blaby although I have perhaps a different response. 
There is an anomaly between full-time and part-time 
education and students in similar situations could be 
caught in different ways, but I am not convinced that 
broadening the scope of the clause is the way to proceed.
<P>
Amendment No. 10 was tabled to explore the 
Government's thinking and to tease out what "in loco 
parentis"	 means. The amendment would cover teachers 
who teach a pupil directly and would apply when there is 
a direct teacher-pupil relationship. I am thinking of what 
might happen in a large school, which has a young student 
teacher who has no contact at all with a 17-year-old pupil 
yet a relationship forms. Is it appropriate that that example 
should fall within the same scope as a direct relationship? 
Can one say that there is generally a relationship of trust 
or authority in those circumstances?
<P>
In loco parentis is a serious issue that we shall be 
discussing again in the next group of amendments. We 
sought a definition of what "in loco parentis"	 means in an 
educational context, but it was vague. Does it mean the 
form tutor, the class teacher, the gym teacher who comes 
in part time, or the music teacher who teaches one hour a 
week and who may not even teach the individual 
concerned? We very much want to explore these issues 
and the extent to which the Government feel comfortable 
that the Bill, as currently framed, hits the right people and 
the extent to which it could be modified to ensure that it 
covers the people who, in natural justice, we can honestly 
and truthfully say have such a position of authority over 
the individual concerned.
<P>
Amendment No. 11 seeks to hit what most people 
would recognise as one of the principal categories of 
offenders. It has been well attested to anecdotally that 
there are problems in boarding schools. Because they are 
fee paying and have a strong commercial interest in 
avoiding bad publicity, teachers are often moved on. In 
our internal discussions, we felt that that was a 
particularly significant category to hit. We wondered 
whether the clause should be directed at residential 
institutions, where the concept of in loco parentis is clear, 
rather than at day schools. The Minister spoke about the 
important element being the fact that the child has 
nowhere else to go, and clearly that is true within the 
boarding school context. But day-school pupils have 
somewhere else to go they return home to their parents 
every evening. The amendment explores those aspects and 
seeks clarification from the Government on whether the 
scope of the Bill will include that huge range of teachers, 
many of whom may not be in positions that one could 
describe as being of direct authority over the individual 
with whom they have allegedly had a sexual relationship.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I support the amendment tabled by my hon. 
Friend the Member for Blaby. The problem with the Bill 
is that it protects young people only if they are in full-time 
education. The amendment is useful because it removes 
the requirement that the education involved be full time. 
We can surely conceive of situations in which a young 
person in part-time education may spend more time with 
a certain teacher than would young people in full-time 
education. The fact that a pupil is in part-time education 
does not necessarily mean that he does spend a lot of time 
with certain teachers.
<P>
There is an increasing number of part-time courses, and 
there is no logical reason for the Bill to target teachers 
who teach full-time pupils; if a teacher is capable of 
abusing someone in the context of full-time education, he 
is surely capable of doing so in the context of part-time 
education. Another, practical point is that part-time 
education often takes place in the evening and may 
contain more gaps between lessons. Pupils are therefore 
more likely to socialise with teachers after classes in that 
context, and inappropriate relationships are 
correspondingly more likely to develop. There is therefore 
no logical reason why my hon. Friend's amendment 
should be rejected.
<P>
The amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats are 
extraordinary; I hope that the Minister will reject them 
out of hand. They drive a coach and horses through the 
Bill. Amendment No. 10 would narrow the scope of 
protection for those in full-time education so that only 
those who teach the young person, and not other staff in 
the institution, are prohibited from abusing their position 
of trust. The hon. Member for Hallam tried to defend 
himself by talking about very large institutions, but the 
amendment would mean that a sexually exploiting teacher 
need only ensure that the children he seduced were not in 
his classes if they were in someone else's classes, he 
could get away with it. That seems extraordinary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> To clarify the situation for the hon. 
Gentleman, all the other, professional codes of conduct 
would come into play in such situations. No one would 
be getting away with anything. We are talking about 
where the criminal law stops; we have a professional code 
of conduct that starts at that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Then why have a Bill at all? If we are 
going to rely on professional codes of conduct, which we 
have had for many years, to prevent teachers from 
behaving in this way, there is no need for the Bill. I cannot 
understand why the hon. Gentleman supports the Bill on 
one hand, but on the other tables the amendment 
although one has learnt to accept such anomalies from his 
party. If the amendment were accepted, one could have 
the ridiculous situation of a teacher abusing two pupils, 
one in his class and one in another class, but being 
prosecuted for only one offence. That cannot be the hon. 
Gentleman's intention, but his amendment simply does 
not add up.
<P>
Amendment No. 11 is even more extraordinary because 
it targets only teachers who live in full-time boarding 
institutions. The number of pupils in residential education 
is a tiny proportion of the total at a stroke, the 
amendment would knock out protection for 95 per cent. 
of children in education. It would wreck the central 
intention of the Bill and would create the absurd situation 
that a teacher at a private school who was abusing two 
children, one a boarder and the other a day boy, would be 
prosecuted only for attacking the boarder. The abuse of 
the day boy would not be a criminal offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Borrow:</B> The hon. Gentleman keeps using the term 
"abuse"	; if it is abuse, it is a criminal offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> It is abuse of trust.
<P>
<B>Mr. Borrow:</B> The Bill deals only with consensual, not 
abusive, sex.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Perhaps I am not using the right term. We
