<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking Government new clause 5--Prohibition of requirement as to production of certain records--and Government amendments Nos. 256 and 257.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department </B>(Mr. Geoffrey Hoon): I understand that this morning the Committee almost completed the debate on the amendments and new clause 5, which deals with enforced subject access, but that the Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth), did not have time to answer the two or three questions that remained. My hon. Friend regrets that he is unable to attend this afternoon's sitting. I hope that the Committee will accept my attempts to answer on his behalf. Of course, I have the considerable advantage of not knowing what the questions were, but I am sure that I can be enlightened if necessary.
<P>
I know that the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) asked about the Government's plans for bringing into force sections 112, 113 and 115 of the Police Act 1997, which provide for criminal record certificates. The Government are considering the timetable for implementing that legislation, but I apologise that I cannot give the Committee a precise date. The implementation of those provisions represents a major operation, as it involves establishing a criminal records agency to deal with records and to issue the new types of certificates. However, I confirm that the Government definitely plan to establish such an agency and that it is proposed that the three types of certificate will be introduced in sequence.
<P>
The first to be introduced will be the enhanced criminal records certificates, intended for the persons themselves and those organisations considering applicants for positions involving regular care for children and for positions involving the training, supervision and sole charge of children. Those certificates will also be needed for certain gambling and lottery licences. There is also a power to include those caring for vulnerable adults.
<P>
The second to be introduced will be the criminal records certificates, which will include spent and unspent convictions for certain organisations. Finally, the ordinary criminal conviction certificates will be introduced. They will be available directly to applicants for them to pass on to others with a relevant interest.
<P>
Clearly, the new enforced subject access offence that the Committee has debated can be brought into operation only when all three sets of certificates are available. However, it is important that priority be given, in the first instance, to the protection of children and vulnerable people.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale also asked what will happen in the meantime, before the certificates become available. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) asked about the position of local authorities, for example, which rely at present on enforced subject access. The straight answer to the hon. Member for Ryedale is that, under the new clause, there can be no enforced subject access offence until the other vital element--criminal records certificates--is in place. That is a deliberate Government policy. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said this morning, the fact that Parliament is creating an alternative route for the supply of conviction information eases the way to the creation of the offence.
<P>
Meanwhile, however, we must recognise the practical implications for any organisations employing or appointing people in sensitive posts. Whatever view one takes of subject access as a phenomenon, in the short term the loss of all access to criminal records information could cause those organisations significant operational difficulties.
<P>
It would be invidious to identify those cases in which we believe that the practice would be justified and those in which it would not. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East made a relevant point when he drew attention to local authorities. The interval before criminal records certificates become available will allow for a transition from current, established practice. The organisations involved can begin to prepare for a regime in which only authorised conviction information will be available.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway (Ryedale):</B> I am grateful to the Minister. It is difficult to criticise the lack of a date, as a Conservative Government, were we still in power, might well have given the same answer. However, it is important to appreciate that the new enforced subject access arrangements cannot come into force until the provisions of the Police Act 1997 do, for the reasons that the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East mentioned. I am sure that hon. Members will want to return to this matter on Report, given that this was a long-awaited new clause. Generally speaking, I welcome it, and I am grateful for the Minister's response.

<P>
shall not be made unless a draft of the instrument has been laid before and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.'.
<P>
Clause 63 provides the Bill's order-making powers, of which there are many. The Government suggest that those that are listed in subsection (4) should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Subsection (5) lists those order-making powers that the Government suggest should be subject only to the negative resolution procedure. We believe that some of the powers listed in subsection (5) should be subject to an affirmative order. They should not merely provide an opportunity to pray against the orders that have been laid by the Secretary of State. The order-making powers are all important to the structure of the Bill, and many of them introduce new concepts that are not currently covered by the 1984 legislation.
<P>
Clause 21(7) is first on subsection (5)'s list of the powers that are subject to negative resolution. It refers to the preliminary assessments by the Data Protection Commissioner that provide 28 days for a response plus one extension. Those assessments involve cases in which there may be substantial damage or distress, or in which the rights and freedoms of individuals may be significantly prejudiced. Any order would seek to alter the 28-day period and the arrangements for an extension. I am sure that the Minister will agree that data subjects and data controllers need to know whether preliminary assessments are going to be determined in their favour. Alteration of the 28-day period would therefore be a serious matter, and we suggest that an affirmative order would be more appropriate.
<P>
Clause 22 is next on the list in subsection (5). This clause provides for the possible appointment of a data protection supervisor and the arrangements by which data protection supervisors might assume an independent role in monitoring data processing that is carried out by, or on behalf of, a data controller. That is an important role, and Parliament should have the opportunity to debate the matter before an order could take effect. Therefore an affirmative resolution would be more appropriate.
<P>
Clause 50(3) provides for the Secretary of State to decide which areas of data processing must follow codes of practice. That is also a potentially far-reaching provision. Commerce needs a chance to consider and make representations before any order-making power comes into effect. That could be realised only by an affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>
You will recall this morning's debate, Mr. Welsh, about the functions of the Data Protection Commissioner as the designated authority for the United Kingdom in respect of the European Union, and as the means of effecting the United Kingdom's international obligations. The Committee's view was confirmed by the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth)--he recognised that they were important powers and agreed that they should be covered by the Data Protection Commissioner's annual report. He also agreed that clause 51(1) already provided a mechanism for that. Given the importance of those functions, the orders giving them effect should be subject to the affirmative rather than the negative resolution.
<P>
I stress that the affirmative resolution procedure would give those affected by a prospective order the opportunity to consider it and to lobby Members of Parliament as appropriate, so that they could agree on what should be done, rather than trying to pray against the order. The other paragraphs in the schedules are important for the interpretation of various parts of the Bill. Because many provisions break new ground, Parliament ought to have the opportunity to consider them in advance of any order coming into effect which hon. Members might want to annul, under the negative resolution procedure.
<P>
I hope that the Minister agrees that an affirmative resolution procedure is appropriate for at least some, if not all, of the provisions in the negative resolution list. In particular, I would single out clause 50(3) and subsections (2), (3) and (4) of clause 53, which we feel are extremely important. We welcome the Government's decision to subject the order-making powers under the provisions listed in subsection (4) to the affirmative resolution, but we cannot see the case for treating clause 50(3) and clause 53(2), (3) and (4) any differently.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> It has become clear in several discussions in the course of the Committee's deliberations that a considerable amount of work will still remain to be done after the Bill's passage before the new data protection regime can be introduced.
<P>
The Bill provides for many matters to be dealt with in subordinate legislation. Many of the orders, regulations and rules will need to be in place before the new regime can work effictively. Among other things, clause 63 establishes the parliamentary scrutiny procedure that will apply to each of the statutory intruments in question. The amendment would mean that all those for which the Bill currently provides negative resolution would be made subject to affirmative resolution. Such a comprehensive approach is not necessary.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 63(4) already sets out eight instruments that are subject to affirmative resolution. We have taken care to include in the list all those provisions that directly affect the scope of individuals' rights. I invite the hon. Member for Ryedale to give some thought to what the intellectual underpinning of the distinction should be. Having regard to individuals' rights and to questions of particular sensitivity is the appropriate way to draw a distinction between matters that should be subject to affirmative as opposed to negative resolution.
<P>
The affirmative group comprises the power to prescribe the processing that is to be subject to preliminary assessment under clause 21(1) and the power to prescribe additional circumstances in which sensitive data may be processed under paragraph (9) of schedule 3. The Government have also tabled an amendment that would add to the list of orders that are subject to affirmative resolution to give the Secretary of State the power to extend the scope of the new offence relating to enforced subject access, which is set out in new clause 5. Because of the nature of those issues, it is right that Parliament should be invited positively to approve the Government's proposals.
<P>
The Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation in another place commented on the Government's original proposals for parliamentary scrutiny of the subordinate legislation that is provided for in the Bill. We willingly tabled an amendment in another place to give effect to its recommendation that orders under clause 13(5)(b) should be subject to affirmative rather than negative resolution, as we originally proposed. The Government also accepted an amendment in another place to make the designation by the Secretary of State of media codes of practice under clause 31(3) subject to affirmative resolution. We are, therefore, alert to the need to ensure that parliamentary procedure is tailored to the nature of the powers in question.
<P>
However, the statutory instruments mentioned in clause 63(5) are not of the same degree of significance or sensitivity as those in clause 63(4). That is why we propose the negative resolution procedure. Those statutory instruments relate essentially to regulatory or procedural issues or to matters of detail. They do not directly affect the scope of individuals' rights or matters of inherent sensitivity in the same way as those instruments that are subject to affirmative resolution.
<P>
The clause achieves the right balance between affirmative and negative resolution. We cannot agree to making all the subordinate legislation except fees regulations subject to affirmative resolution. In those circumstances, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the logic behind the selection of the order-making powers that are subject to affirmative as opposed to negative resolution. We have had a useful exchange and we have noted his comments about the work that was done in the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation in another place. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 243, in page 36, leave out line 35.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendment No. 132.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Amendment No. 243 is consequential on the removal of order-making powers from clause 28(4). The Committee has agreed to amend the Bill by way of a new version of clause 28(4). It no longer contains any order-making power, so no reference to clause 28(4) is needed in clause 63. Clause 28(4) provided an order-making power for the Secretary of State to prescribe certain exemptions for crime and taxation purposes. The entire subsection was removed from the Bill on Third Reading in another place.
<P>
Amendment No. 132 proposes a relatively minor drafting change to clause 63(6), which states that a statutory instrument containing fees regulations must be laid before Parliament after being made. No other parliamentary procedure is prescribed in those cases. The amendment makes it clear that the provision is limited to statutory instruments that contain only fees regulations. It is necessary to add that precision since, by virtue of clause 63(4) or (5), statutory instruments may include fees regulations with other provisions. In those cases, the appropriate parliamentary procedure will be affirmative or negative resolution, depending on the nature of the other provisions. The clause 63(6) procedure will not apply in those cases, and the amendment makes that clear.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 247, in page 37, line 10, after `2' insert `or 7'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 248.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> These amendmements were tabled in response to expressions of concern that paragraph 7 of Schedule 3 may not be fully consistent with the data protection directive.
<P>
Paragraph 7 permits the processing of sensitive data where necessary for a range of public sector functions. Article 8.4 of the directive allows member states to prescribe circumstances in which sensitive data may be processed in addition to those that are specifically set out in article 8. Article 8.4 specifies that such processing must be accompanied by appropriate safeguards, and must be carried out for reasons of substantial public interest.
<P>
At present, paragraph 7 makes no express reference either to substantial public interest, or to safeguards. That is because we think that both these requirements will normally be met in the circumstances already covered by the paragraph. However, given the breadth of the provision, we think it prudent to make provision to deal with any cases that may arise where they may not be. That will allow us to ensure that the processing in question is carried out in full compliance with the directive.
<P>
Amendment No. 248 allows the Secretary of State by order to specify cases in which the public sector processing may not involve sensitive data. It would, for example, allow processing that was conceivably not in the substantial public interest to be excluded from the scope of the paragraph. The order may also specify cases in which sensitive data may only be processed if specified conditions are met. The conditions could take the form of additional safeguards to ensure full conformity with the directive in any doubtful case.
<P>
Amendment No. 247 provides that the power, which is essentially directed at providing further protections for data subjects, is subject to the negative resolution procedure.
<P>
It is desirable to include provision of this kind so that we can be confident that we are in a position to ensure that the requirements of the directive are fully met in every case.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 261, in page 37, line 10, after `2', insert `or 8A'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 262.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> These Government amendments give effect to a commitment that the Government gave on Report in another place. We undertook then to table an amendment to make it clear in the Bill that information about individuals' racial or ethnic origin, which is sensitive data for the purposes of the Bill, may be processed for the purposes of ethnic monitoring. The amendments give effect to that undertaking.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 297, in page 37, line 10, leave out `or'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 298 and 299.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> These amendments would allow an exemption from the subject information provisions for certain information processed in connection with corporate finance activities.
<P>
It has long been recognised in financial markets that it is important that the dissemination of information should be subject to restrictions and procedural safeguards. For example, the insider dealing legislation prevents insiders from dealing in securities on the basis of private information which could have an effect on the price of shares.
<P>
The list rules of the London stock exchange require information to be disseminated to the market through its regulatory news service, to ensure the orderly release of price-sensitive information. Therefore, the rationale behind these safeguards is to prevent partial and unregulated dissemination of information from disrupting and corrupting the financial markets and the associated efficient allocation of capital in our economy. The Government believe that the provisions of the Bill should not interfere with that important objective.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I rise merely to say that Conservative Members welcome this addition to schedule 7, which tackles a problem that has been noted in the Bill. It is a lengthy amendment and requires some study, but we welcome it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 302, in page 37, line 14, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(cc) regulations under section (Transmission of notices etc. by electronic or other means),'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government new clause 8--Transmission of notices etc. by electronic or other means.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The Bill makes provision in many places for notices and requests or other communications to be given or made ``in writing''. Earlier in our deliberations the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor) asked whether the Government would define ``in writing''. In response to his request, it was said that the Government were considering the matter and might well come back later with a clarifying provision. These amendments are the product of that further consideration.
<P>
On that earlier occasion, the hon. Member for Esher and Walton suggested that the Department of Trade and Industry should be involved in preparing any clarification provisions. I can tell him that that Department has been consulted about these amendments, and is content with how they will work.
<P>
As I said, the Bill provides for various notices and requests to be given or made in writing. New clause 8 provides, in respect of certain of these, that the requirement for them to be in writing is satisfied if they are given or made in electronic format--for example, by fax or e-mail. It also provides for the Secretary of State by regulation to provide that the requirement for notices and requests to be in writing is not to apply in circumstances prescribed in the regulations. Amendment No. 302 adds these regulations to the list of statutory instruments subject to negative resolution procedure in clause 63(5).
<P>
I emphasise that the Government have been selective in applying the new provisions to references to ``in writing'' in the Bill. That is because this approach breaks new ground. The Bill is, in that respect, running rather ahead of the more general consideration being given within the Government to the meaning of the term ``in writing'', and related terms, in statute.
<P>
For that reason, we have chosen to be cautious in our approach. We do not think it appropriate to apply the new arrangements to official notices issued for the purposes of litigation or by the Data Protection Commissioner in connection with enforcement arrangements. No doubt when the more general work to which I referred comes to fruition, whatever more general arrangements are introduced will be capable of applying to such documents, if that is considered appropriate.
<P>
That is why the amendments are limited to communications between data subjects and data controllers for the purposes of part II and clause 23 of the Bill; and to the submission by data controllers of a request to the Data Protection Commissioner for cancellation of an enforcement notice. The provision is permissive only, and does not require electronic communication, and of course e-mail communication is only an option where both parties have access to appropriate equipment. It is intended purely for the convenience of communication, and the convenience of those who choose to use it.
<P>
The Committee will have noticed also that the new clause does not apply to the notification arrangements in part III of the Bill. That is not because we wish to exclude notices and requests made under that part from a broader interpretation of ``in writing''. The intention is that the form of those notices and requests should be dealt with in notification regulations made under part III.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor (Esher and Walton):</B> I am grateful to the Minister for drawing attention to my raising the matter on 14 May at column 84. I am delighted that the Minister has given such an effective response, as far as it goes. I am concerned about the matter across Government. If we are not careful, all the efforts made by the Government to keep up with industrial practice, initiated by Conservative Members, will fall behind. It is appropriate that the Minister, who shadowed aspects of technology that were part of my portfolio in the past, should make the announcement. I am also particularly pleased that he has referred to the Department of Trade and Industry and the work that it is doing.
<P>
I should like nevertheless to say why I said that I was pleased as far as it goes. I am not sure that I understood the full implications of the Minister's final remarks, so I seek guidance. I am happy with new clause 8 in the context to which it applies, which is principally part II of the Bill. It not only meets my general requirements regarding data protection, but also work being done under the distance selling directive, which must be taken into account in this context. I am slightly concerned about part III, which, as the Minister rightly said, deals with notification--registration under the current law. The Data Protection Registrar hopes to receive applications by electronic means and to provide copies of notification entries by similar means. I cannot believe that the Home Office wants to prevent that. The Minister mentioned that the part III definition would apply to clause 23. Will he clarify why it cannot apply to the Bill as a whole? What regulations is he considering to meet those concerns?
<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer (Broxtowe):</B> I have a small question relating to new clause 8(2)(b), which contains the words ``received in legible form''. It might be helpful for later interpretation if the Minister were to define the meaning of ``legible form''. It could mean, for example, that the recipient specifies what form is legible. The provision could otherwise cause obscure debates about which specific word processing product is used, and other such matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I think that I am grateful for both interventions, but time will tell. With regard to the observations of the hon. Member for Esher and Walton, I am aware of the Data Protection Registrar's concern about part III. The hon. Gentleman was right to raise the issue for the Committee's benefit. I emphasise that the Government intend that notification regulations should deal with the form in which notifications are made. We would expect, in discussion with the registrar, to provide for that to be done by electronic means.
<P>
I understand that the registrar also wishes to provide copies of the register entry under clause 18(7) by electronic means. Nothing prevents her from doing so, provided that the person asking for the copy is willing to receive it in electronic form. We would assume that that is ultimately the direction in which everyone will go. Equally obviously, it is important to safeguard the rights of people who do not enjoy access to such electronic equipment. The Government therefore think it right that people who want a copy of the register entry should be able to insist on a hard copy, for the moment at any rate. That is the reason for my earlier explanation. We do not in any sense rule out the use of electronic communications of the kind in question when both parties are willing to send and receive them.
<P>
The best that I can manage with regard to legibility, as a humble lawyer--
<P>
<B>Mr. Greg Pope </B>(Hyndburn): Oxymoron.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I was going to say that I am not an expert on word processing. Clearly, the test of what is legible will have to be in the hands of the recipient, rather than in the hands of the sender. I anticipate that if people despatch material that does not arrive in a legible form, that will be their problem.

Government amendments Nos. 161, 163, 142 and 165.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I shall try to break down this rather large group of amendments into a more manageable form.
<P>
The purpose of amendments Nos. 133, 134, 136 and 142 was explained when we debated amendment No. 123, which removed the definition of inaccurate data from clause 12. Together with amendment No. 123, the amendments represent a series of small, but helpful, changes to the Bill. They remove two identical definitions of inaccurate data from clause 12 and part II of schedule 1; they remove from schedule 11 a reference to the clause 12 definition; and they insert a single definition of the same terms in clause 64, which contains supplementary definitions with a cross-reference to the index of expressions defined in clause 65.
<P>
For the benefit of the odd Committee member who did not follow that explanation, I emphasise that the amendments make no change of substance. They merely avoid unnecessary duplication.
<P>
In the second group--Government amendments Nos. 161, 163 and 165--clause 13A, which is temporarily added to the Bill by schedule 11, makes special arrangements to allow data subjects to rectify, block, erase or destroy inaccurate existing manual records during the second transitional period. Government amendments apply this provision to Gaskin records and to eligible manual data about financial status that is held by credit reference agencies during the first transitional period as well. During the transitional periods the third data protection principle, which requires personal data to be adequate, and which therefore deals with the question of completeness, does not apply to manual records. However, the directive expressly requires, at least insofar as the second transitional period is concerned, that the data subject should be able to rectify manual records that are incomplete as well as those that are inaccurate. For Gaskin records and credit reference agency files, the Government also wish to preserve the existing right of individuals to have their data rectified. That is why we are applying this provision to those records during the first transitional period also.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 161, 163 and 165 make the necessary additions to clause 13A to ensure that the right to rectify applies to data that are incomplete as well as inaccurate. When the second transitional period ends, the data protection principles, including the third principle, will apply in full to the manual records that are covered by the Bill. The transitional arrangements, including the express reference to completeness, will therefore no longer be necessary.

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister will be pleased to know that I followed all that.
<P>
When I raised the matter before, it seemed to me that incompleteness was an issue in respect of records that are kept by credit reference agencies. I am not sure that the Minister's proposal goes as far as I would like, and it certainly does not address the amendment that we tabled on schedule 1. Nevertheless, we should be grateful for such small mercies as we have been given. As we are nearing the end of today's proceedings in a charitable spirit, I shall simply welcome what the Minister has said, which entirely vindicates the argument that I used on a previous occasion. In that spirit, I welcome the proposals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 135, in page 40, leave out lines 7 to 10.
<P>
The amendment is a matter of considerable substance and principle. It is, however, also purely procedural. It removes clause 69(6), which provides that nothing in the Bill imposes any charge on the people or on public funds. The provision was added to the Bill in another place to avoid questions of privilege.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I had it in mind to table the same amendment. None the less, the Committee is owed a slight explanation because the situation is bizarre. The provision was added in another place and we are now agreeing to delete it. The Minister would help the Committee and the rest of the House if he could throw a little light on the reasons why. Given that the provision exercised their lordships in the other place, someone might attempt to persuade the Speaker to allow the House the opportunity to put it back in on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am straining my constitutional memory, but my recollection is that the other place is not permitted to pass any provision that imposes charges by way of taxes on the people. Given the importance of that constitutional provision, it is standard in the other place to include a provision such as that in clause 69(6) in any Bills. Charges are likely to be imposed, but they can be imposed under our constitution only as a result of votes in the House of Commons. It is, therefore, customary to add a provision such as that in clause 69(6) in the other place to avoid questions of privilege. When a Bill reaches the House of Commons, it is necessary to remove the provision. We are testing my constitutional history more than I would like.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank the Minister for supplying the other pieces of the jigsaw.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister and I am glad that I asked the question. I got the impression that you were as enlightened as I was, Mr. Welsh. I must confess that I did not know the background. The matter is clearly entirely procedural.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am reluctant to insist on having the last word. I said that, although the amendment is procedural, it also concerns a matter of fundamental principle--that the other place cannot impose charges on the people. Matters of deep constitutional significance are therefore involved.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I do not expect the Minister to answer this, but it is the appropriate point at which to ask the question. The initial subsections in clause 69 confirm which parts of the Bill come into force immediately on Royal Assent, but there will be substantial parts still to be implemented, not just under the transitional arrangements but also via regulations.
<P>
I have raised this matter before. The commercial interests that will to have operate under the legislation require certainty. Before we conclude our scrutiny of the Bill and send it back to another place, where the amendments that the Committee--and possibly other hon. Members downstairs--have made to it will be considered, will the Government provide a timetable, approximate though it may be, as to when the rest of the Bill will be concluded? That would be helpful.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I should congratulate the hon. Member for Ryedale on having so thoroughly learned the ways of opposition. I have asked similar questions myself in the past and I am about to give the hon. Gentleman the answer that I received when I asked those questions.
<P>
It is obviously important that the Government can prepare all the necessary regulations; it is also important that all those who will be affected by the legislation should be in a position to implement it. We will be able to implement the legislation as soon as possible.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 69, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
