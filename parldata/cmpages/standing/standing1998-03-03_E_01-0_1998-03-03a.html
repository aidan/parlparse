<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill and copies are available in the Room. This might not be necessary, but I should also remind members of the Committee that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that we reach during an afternoon sitting. I have selected the privilege amendment to clause 15.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Causing a nuclear explosion</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr. Tony Lloyd):</B> The Bill is designed to allow the United Kingdom to take part in the process of ratifying the comprehensive test ban treaty. It is important because it is clearly designed to restrict the development and qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons. It effectively ends the development of new and advanced nuclear weapons. It is, therefore, a necessary--albeit not sufficient--condition for the world to begin considering the process or ridding itself of nuclear weapons in perpetuity. The Bill's importance will be understood by all members of the Committee and of the House and, indeed, by everyone in the country.
<P>
The Bill is effectively divided into two parts. The first deals with nuclear explosions and the second deals with the means of inspection and ensuring that nuclear explosions for test purposes cannot take place.
<P>
Clause 1 makes it an offence to cause a nuclear explosion. That offence is punishable by life imprisonment. The phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is drawn directly from the treaty. That in turn reflects the language of the partial test ban treaty, which banned nuclear testing everywhere except underground. Subsection (2) makes it clear that a nuclear weapon explosion in the course of armed conflict does not come under the Bill's provisions.
<P>
I hope that that brief introduction to clause 1 and the more general observation about the political and human importance of the Bill will satisfy the Committee that clause 1 and the other clauses are necessary and that they are sufficient to allow the United Kingdom to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Faber (Westbury):</B> I echo the Minister's welcome for the Bill. We are pleased to see him here this morning.
<P>
The treaty was signed by the former Foreign Secretary, the right hon. and learned Malcom Rifkind. As we said on Second Reading, Conservative Members strongly support the Bill and the purposes behind it. The process has been a long one.
<P>
I want to ask the Minister a couple of questions about clause 1. Lines and 1 and 2 refer to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Any person who knowingly causes a nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister will recall a small side debate on Second Reading about sub-critical testing and sub-critical explosions. He will know that in July last year the United States conducted the first so-called sub-critical explosion, and more are planned this year. As the Minister will know, such tests involve the use of plutonium, but not a nuclear explosion or the release of fissile material. As such, they comply with article 1 of the comprehensive test ban treaty. Will the Minister tell us whether the Government think that sub-critical explosions are genuinely necessary? He intimated on Second Reading that he thought they were, but did not elaborate. Will he also tell us whether there is evidence that such warheads can safely be tested by other means? Is he concerned that such explosions may be perceived as contrary to the treaty, if not by ourselves or the United States, then by some of the non-nuclear states that are being asked, under the treaty, not to continue their testing programmes?
<P>
Clause 1(1) could also be open to misinterpretation, in that during the negotiations that led to the signing of the treaty, it was obviously understood that the ban includes atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs but allows small fusion explosions, if ignited by a laser or a particle beam implosion. Those are technical details, but I should like the Minister to say a few words on the wider issue. Clearly, such research takes place in both nuclear and non-nuclear countries. If some states are to be allowed to continue those specific sub-critical tests, is there not a danger that some of the non-nuclear countries or those that are being asked to stop or postpone their programmes may view those tests as contrary to the treaty?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Lloyd:</B> I hope I can give comprehensive answers to those questions. I shall deal first with pure fusion experiments. It is our firm view that such experiments would be prohibited under the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.
<P>
Experiments involving controlled thermonuclear fusion, such as those conducted with lasers or particle beam accelerators, do not constitute an explosion under the Bill or the treaty, and are therefore not banned by the treaty. Members of the Committee will recognise that those experiments are important to civil nuclear research because fusion has been seen for a long time as a potentially cleaner, safer form of energy technology than the fission method. It was therefore not the ambition of those who drew up the CTBT to ban all research into fusion.
<P>
We believe, however, that pure fusion experiments would be prohibited. I say to the hon. Member for Westbury (Mr. Faber) that a distinction is made between experimentation concerned with weapons development and that which is legitimately concerned with civil energy programmes.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about sub-critical tests. We currently have no plans to conduct such tests. Nevertheless we recognise, for ourselves and certainly for others, the need to maintain the safety and viability of nuclear weapons. It would be pointless to maintain a nuclear weapons stock that had no workable capacity. Sub-critical tests which do not constitute a nuclear explosion are an important part of the maintenance of the operability of the nuclear weapons system and of the safety regime that allows us to store and maintain those weapons. Within that context, we recognise, as does the treaty, that sub-critical experiments are consistent with the CTBT. They are necessary, and the nuclear weapon states recognised that such experimentation would occur in future.
<P>
The important question is the one asked by the hon. Gentleman about non-nuclear weapon states. The impact of the treaty must be that although any non-nuclear weapon state would be able to conduct sub-critical experiments, I am advised by those with technological knowledge that it would be impossible to develop a workable nuclear weapon only through the use of such experiments. It would have to go beyond that and conduct a nuclear explosion before it could be certain of the weapon's operability. The provision guarantees that non-nuclear weapon states that operate to the letter and the spirit of the comprehensive test ban treaty would thereby be prevented from developing nuclear weapons. I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman the reassurance that he sought.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Provision supplementary to section 1</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor (Solihull):</B> My eye lighted on the clause and I have a quick question to the Minister in connection with it. As these are technical matters, I do not want to be unfair to the Minister and I am prepared to give him notice of my question and for him to answer in writing before Report. That will be perfectly adequate, as we shall see the Bill again in the House. I am not trying to trip the Minister up or to ask him a question about something on which he is not prepared.
<P>
It is clear from subsection (1)(a) how a prosecution would be initiated in England and Wales and, from subsection (1)(b), how a prosecution would be initiated in Northern Ireland. What I have not been able to find in the Bill is how a prosecution might be initiated in Scotland. One does not wish to anticipate the frivolous and say that one's best advice to a constituent for whom setting off a nuclear explosion was an imperative might be to go north and do it in Scotland rather than in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, where it would be more perilous.
<P>
I pose that question having very limited experience of nuclear explosions. I was four years old at the time of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; I left the conduct of the second world war largely to other people. It is an innocent question asked by an amateur with little experience, but by a lawyer who is keen to see symmetry and order about the processes of prosecution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Lloyd:</B> I am delighted that the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) asked that question, because, despite describing himself as an amateur, his reputation as a lawyer is a little more than amateurish. Therefore, I am delighted that I asked the same question when I read the Bill. I am equally delighted that I can give an answer that satisfied me and which I trust will satisfy the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
It is necessary to write in the role of the Attorney General in England and Wales and the consent of the Attorney General for Northern Ireland because there is no such provision in existing law. However, a similar provision is not needed in Scotland, as criminal proceedings there can only be brought by or on behalf of the Lord Advocate. Therefore, in the Scottish legal framework that is already not simply implicit in the system but defines it.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I am well satisfied with that answer, which is perhaps the one that I expected. I leave the Minister with this thought--I do not even insist that he replies. Does he not think that the Bill would be that fraction better if it said so?

<P>

<B>Mr. Lloyd:</B> When our roles were reversed and on occasions I had recourse to the hon. Gentleman's ministrations as Minister, he was always so courteous in his dealings that I am almost inclined to say yes to whatever he asks. Perhaps I could crave the Committee's indulgence and say that I will see whether it causes any technical problems and consider the balance of the argument. If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I undertake to write to him and let him know the outcome.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clauses 4 to 14 order to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 15</center></H4>
<H4><center>Commencement, extent and citation</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Lloyd:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 8, leave out lines 8 to 11.
<P>
The amendment is a technicality. As the Committee knows, the Bill was introduced in the House of Lords. The amendment is necessary because the House of Lords has no capacity to engage in or legislate for financial expenditure. The words that the amendment proposes to delete are included in the Bill to protect the power of the House of Commons, and its sole discretion in legislating for financial matters. The amendment seeks simply to remove words that would prevent expenditure. The Committee will recall that a Commons money resolution was passed immediately after Second Reading, to authorise expenditure. The amendment will allow the Bill to take practical effect.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> At the risk of detaining the Committee, I shall say a few words about clause 15, as it is the commencement clause, and as it is a suitable clause under which to raise the wider issue of ratification of the treaty. The clause will bring the treaty into effect in Britain. The Opposition welcome the fact that Britain will be one of the first countries to ratify it.
<P>
Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This Act shall come into force on such day as the Secretary of State may appoint by order made by statutory instrument.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, the Bill is not the whole answer to nuclear non-proliferation. Wider issues are involved in the question of when the Bill might be enacted, including ratification in other countries. Does the Minister believe that a statutory instrument will follow consideration almost immediately and that Third Reading will signal our ratification of the treaty, or does he believe that there will be further delay? I should be grateful if he would say a few words about that.
<P>
At the time of Second Reading, 147 countries had, I think, signed the treaty, of which only seven had ratified it. Of the 44 countries needed to ratify it, only Japan had done so. Updated figures may now be available. In reply to questions about ratification, the Minister said on Second Reading that in our role as a member of the European Union--since then, of course, we have assumed its presidency--we had made what he described as a demarche to countries that had not yet signed. Will he say more about what has taken place in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's work programme since we took up the EU presidency? The programme features non-proliferation and disarmament issues and, in particular, agreements to implement and strengthen nuclear safeguards. I assume that that refers to the CTBT and encouraging other states to sign up.
<P>
I should like to ask the Minister to comment on four specific countries--I am sure that he is aware of them all. First, there is the United States. On Second Reading the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), who was speaking on behalf of the Liberal Democrat party, and I asked about the United States' ratification of the treaty. At the time, the Minister seemed surprised that we had raised the issue and responded robustly that President Clinton had sent a message to Congress expressing the hope that the treaty would be ratified as soon as possible in the United States.
<P>
At the time, I did not doubt the desire or will of the President to ratify the treaty, but the Minister will know that even before the current Iraq crisis there were severe doubts in Congress about ratifying the test ban treaty. Since the American Government took the line that it did over Iraq, we discovered that some members of Congress were not happy with the presidency on that issue, either. It is clearly important that the United States sign the treaty, because that will send a strong message to the rest of the world. Has the Minister any further information on that?
<P>
Secondly, at the other end of the political spectrum, there is North Korea. From the evidence that we have, it seems that it is still developing and improving its ballistic capability despite repeated international warnings. It poses a clear threat, not least because of its economic instability.
<P>
Finally and perhaps most relevantly, given what is happening in the rest of the world today, there is the issue of India and Pakistan. As has often been pointed out, Pakistan would probably follow suit were India to ratify the treaty. With the current elections in India, there seems this morning to be a real possibility that the BJP might be able to form a Government. Given its previous rhetoric on nuclear testing--it has said in the past and again during the election campaign that one of its first actions if it were elected to government might be to carry out a nuclear test, if only to show the world that India was capable of doing so--that is worrying, not least for the future of the test ban treaty.
<P>
I am grateful to you, Mr. Winterton, for allowing me some indulgence in the debate on clause 15, which relates to the Bill's commencement. Clearly, the commencement of the Act in this country has wider implications for the rest of the world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): The Liberal Democrats support both clause 15 and the Bill. The legislation is a small but necessary building block for the move forward to implement fully the test ban treaty.
<P>
I should like to echo some of the remarks that have just been made and to pick up on what the Minister said earlier about sub-nuclear testing. Sub-nuclear testing might give some of the nations that have not yet ratified the treaty--about which doubts have just been raised--verification of weapons that they had purchased or acquired, which could be damaging. That applies not just in the context of developing a completely home-grown weapon, where sub-nuclear testing might not give the necessary confirmation, but in the possible circumstances where weapons or weapons material and technology were being actively traded. Will the Minister address that when he talks about how the Bill will be ratified in the United Kingdom?
<P>
My colleagues and I will be very interested to hear about the timetable for the specific implementation of the Bill. We see it as a necessary step forward, not just in its own right but as a clear signal to other nations--not least the United States--that the treaty is a significant international move which needs to be pushed on with vigorously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Lloyd:</B> It is clear, Mr. Winterton, from the fact that you allowed these contributions that they were perfectly in order; such questions are central to the timing of the incorporation of the legislation into United Kingdom law. May I detain the Committee briefly by explaining that process?
<P>
The treaty is open to signature by any competent national authority. The latest information is that 149 countries have signed the treaty, and eight have ratified it. Those numbers are fairly low but as we are going through the process of ratification ourselves, we are not in a position to say that the system is behind time. For the treaty to come into force, there has to be ratification by 44 named states, which obviously include the defined nuclear weapon states. They also specifically include the countries named by the hon. Member for Westbury--India, Pakistan and North Korea.
<P>
In partial response to the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, let me say that some states seen as threshold states are signatories to the non-proliferation treaty, and to that extent are already bound by international treaty. The hon. Gentleman invited me to discuss the non-application of treaties, but that is a different domain, and not to do with the merits of pursuing a treaty route. There must be control on rogue states which sign and ratify treaties, claim to enforce them but violate them in both the spirit and the letter. However, that is a separate issue and would have to be dealt with outside the debate on the CTBT.
<P>
The NPT would cover most of the states about which we are concerned, with the limitation of the three states--India, Pakistan and North Korea--which are currently seen as barriers to the implementation of the CTBT. Within those terms, I am afraid that I cannot give any comfort to the Committee. It has long been recognised--and it was one of the reasons why there are named states in the treaty--that it would have been impossible to use the customary process whereby a treaty comes into force when a defined number of states sign and ratify it. In the case of the CTBT, there are named states in the treaty because it was necessary to define a tight ring round those states which are a potential source of concern, such as those with nuclear weapons and the so-called threshold states.
<P>
We have urged India, Pakistan and North Korea to sign the treaty and begin the ratification process. I am also aware, as the hon. Member for Westbury said, that the uncertainties over the general election in India and the politicisation of the debate on its role as a nuclear power will have an important impact on the direction in which India wants to go. Pakistan has always argued that its concerns about the developments of India's nuclear weapons programme condition its response. We shall continue to urge that progress be made by those three states and, of course, all others.
<P>
That leads me on to the United States. The position there is that the CTBT ratification process is currently before the Senate, along with other treaty-structured debates about the enlargement of NATO, the ratification of the Helsinki agreement and the START process. All those issues involve some controversy, and it could be argued that there is serious opposition in the Senate. Our judgment has to be that the will in the United States is to ratify the treaty. The ratification process is certainly in its interests, just as it is in the interests of the United Kingdom. As we move forward with the agenda, we will play our part in urging our friends in the American Senate to recognise our commonsense position, which would favour the United States as well.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Westbury asked about the Foreign and Commonwealth Office nuclear agenda. We do not confine ourselves to ratifying the treaty. We have to recognise that the road towards the final destination of ridding the world of nuclear weapons is complicated and might be long; nevertheless, we have to make progress. Other steps, such as the treaty on fissile materials, are also important. We will seek to make progress with our international partners, through the permanent five members of the Security Council--effectively the nuclear weapons states-- and more broadly. We will try to erect a regime that allows us to recognise that progress is taking place and to give real heart to those who believe that the eradication of nuclear weapons is a credible objective. In that way, we will be able to say that the comprehensive test ban treaty--like the partial test ban treaty in its time--is a stepping stone on the way to the eradication of nuclear weapons.
<P>
The Bill is significant; it is not a small step. It is important that the world recognise that we can make progress if the will exists. Our role in the legislative process is to say that this country has the will to make progress, and that will is shared throughout the House. I should pay tribute to the previous Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, who, as the hon. Member for Westbury told the Committee, originally signed the treaty. There is no difference between us on the issue. The Bill is a step along the road and it demonstrates our political will. It sends a strong signal to the rest of the world that it should develop the same political will. On that basis, we could all make progress.
<P>
I hope that I have responded to hon. Members' questions; if not, we will return to the matter on Report and Third Reading.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 15, as amended, orderd to stand part of the Bill.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I put the final Question, I thank hon. Members on both sides of the Committee for the positive and constructive way in which they have expedited consideration of the Bill. I also thank the Clerk, the Hansard writers and the police for the role that they have played in helping us to get through our business extremely quickly--
