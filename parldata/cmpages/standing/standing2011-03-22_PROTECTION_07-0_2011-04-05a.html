back in the Committee. We have been enjoying spring weather up until
today. When I came out of my door this morning it looked like a nice
spring day, but by the time I got off the train at the other end, it
was pouring down with rain. However, I am sure that nothing can dampen
the spirits of those on the Committee who are looking forward to doing
their upmost to hold the Government to account on their plans in the
Bill. I am looking forward to assisting the Minister in getting things
right, because he is a nice fellow and I care for him. I want to ensure
that he does not have to come back to the House all Lansley-like in a
few weeks’ time and make a statement about why it has all gone
wrong and why we need to consult and listen. Let us save him from
himself and do the job
properly.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
52 and 53 relate to our concerns about the penalty notices. One concern
is that it will lower the threshold at which people—particularly
the young—could come into contact with the criminal justice
system and have their personal details retained. Amendment 52 would set
an age limit of 16, so we would not expect DNA to be retained following
the issuing of a penalty notice to those under 16, because, as the Home
Affairs Committee indicated in its deliberations, arrests should be the
threshold. There are powers, as we have discussed under other clauses,
where DNA can be taken if an arrest is made, and if the crime is
serious enough DNA can be
retained.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With
amendments 52 and 53 we are saying, therefore, that the provision
should not apply to those under 16 and that arrest should be
the threshold that denotes whether someone should have their DNA or
fingerprints 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 250<a class="bkMark" name="Column250">&#160;</a>
                           </div>taken and retained, depending on the seriousness of the crime. The Bill
allows for that to be done on the issuing of a penalty notice.
Throughout the Bill, it is suggested that there should be some form of
check and balance through the justice system. There are, for instances,
references to magistrates courts for applications to extend retention
of DNA profiles, but someone could have their DNA taken and retained
simply following the issuing of a penalty notice by a police
officer.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
feel that some checks and balances are necessary. The amendments
provide them, and we would welcome the Minister’s comments on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000037">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Welcome back to the Chair for the
continuation of our consideration of the Bill, Mr Streeter. We had a
brief sojourn on to the Floor of the House for the Police Reform and
Social Responsibility Bill, in which I know that other members of the
Committee were similarly engaged. The hon. Member for Eltham mentioned
health, and despite some of the coughing and spluttering that I have
just heard, I was hoping that his health had improved after last
Tuesday, when, unfortunately, some of his personal health challenges
came to the fore. In the spirit of camaraderie, I wish him well, and I
hope that he has a speedy recovery from his
cough.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to turn back to clause 8. We had a wide-ranging debate last week
on retention periods. I need to understand better what the hon.
Gentleman seeks to distinguish, and how the Opposition have moved on
from their position on the Crime and Security Act 2010, where the
distinction was made simply on arrest, not on the issuing of
a fixed penalty ticket or penalty notice for disorder for under-16s.
Has there been further change on the approach that they may take?

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
8 does not give the police a new right to take DNA from someone on the
issuance of a PND. As we explained last week, it applies when someone
has been arrested under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act and DNA is
taken under PACE. This then deals with the retention arrangements that
operate thereby. In those circumstances, we believe that a two-year
retention period is appropriate, reflecting in many ways the situation
in Scotland.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000040">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman has sought to differentiate 16-year-olds. In essence, he is
saying that someone has to be over 16 for these provisions to bite. I
do not know whether he seeks to make a broader point about youth
penalty notices for disorder, which were introduced by the previous
Labour Government, albeit not with great alacrity, as their use has not
been fully adopted across all police forces. Perhaps there has been
some rethinking. We believe that, where a penalty notice for disorder
has been issued, it is appropriate to have a short retention period, to
reflect the fact that for a PND to have been issued, some criminality
would have occurred. Of course, it is a different type of disposal from
a caution or some other court-based sanction. We believe a two-year
retention period appropriate, given some of the cases that have
emerged.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000041">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Equally,
the hon. Gentleman will be aware of the peak age of offending about
which we talked last week. By excluding the issuance of fixed penalty
tickets, he is

                           </div>ignoring the evidence in the hazard rate analysis
report, which he pointed to, where the issues of youth offending are
highlighted, and, more generally, other statistics on youth
crime.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We believe
the measure is proportionate—that a two-year period is
reasonable. Looking at the evidence on 15-year-olds who may commit
crime, one can see why it would be appropriate to retain. There are
other provisions and protections in the Bill relating to the treatment
of young people. The hon. Gentleman’s Government when in power
recognised the case for having a separate arrangement for dealing with
retention for under-18s. Two years is a limited period, which we
believe is appropriate, and hope accordingly that the hon. Gentleman
will withdraw his
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000043">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The issue about 16-year-olds is consistent with
the 2010 Act. There was a reference to separate arrangements for
under-16s. I cannot find any reference—and will be corrected if
I am wrong—in the 2010 Act to specific treatment of people who
have been issued with penalty notices.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000044">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> If I may assist the hon. Gentleman, there was
no reference to penalty notices because the previous Government took
the view that simply on arrest retention should follow for the period
thereafter. The point that we seek to distinguish here is that the line
of retention should, in general terms, be on the issue of charge.
Obviously, we had the debate last week and that is possibly why he
cannot find the reference in the previous
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000045">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Exactly. Arrest was the measure under the previous
arrangements. We see an element of inconsistency in what the Government
seek to introduce. The Bill refers to magistrates courts overseeing the
use of that system. People have recourse to a magistrates court if they
are dissatisfied that their details have been retained. Similarly, if a
police officer wants to extend retention he has to apply to a
magistrates court. In the use of penalty charge notices, however, they
are just issued as a summary conviction by police officers and there is
no core procedure. To introduce that seems to be inconsistent with what
the Bill aims to achieve. There is a need for a special arrangement for
under-16s that is consistent with the previous Act, and I would like to
press the amendment to a

database is a device for the detection and investigation of crime.
Profiles are retained on the database to assist the police in that
endeavour. The rationale is that the fact that someone has been
arrested is an indication of a likelihood that they will
reoffend—or be rearrested, I should say—within a period
of time, and that there is a higher rate of offending for those who
have a previous arrest record than for the general public. That is the
rationale and we have had several debates on that. If someone is
arrested, albeit for a penalty charge notice, why is it that two years
applies, not three? What is the evidence behind the Government’s
conclusion that two years is an appropriate length of time in relation
to penalty notices and not three years as applies in other cases? The
Minister indicated a moment ago that the previous arrangement under the
2010 Act was that on arrest the six-year period applied. That was a
consistent approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000069">&#160;</a>

issue of concern emerging from the Bill, as was mentioned by Mr Chris
Sims when he gave evidence on behalf of ACPO, is that the system is
very complex. We have several tiers of retention: those who have their
DNA retained for three years, those who will now have it retained for
two years, those who will have it retained for five years with an
extension possible and young people under the age of 18 who will have
it retained for the length of their sentence plus an extra period. What
is emerging is a complex system for the police to
manage.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000070">&#160;</a>

retention period in the Bill, yet that would be a two-year retention
period because the police do not have the capacity to carry out the
reviews that are intended in the Bill—computer software or no
computer software. That is the concern about the complexity of the
system that we are being asked to approve. We would like to know how

                           </strong> Obviously, as the hon. Gentleman has
explained, the amendments would increase the retention period from two
to three years for DNA profiles taken following arrest where a fixed
penalty notice—a penalty notice for disorder—has been
issued. I suppose he is challenging us on why there is a different
regime here. I point him to the comments that he made during the
previous mini-debate we just had on the status of a penalty notice for
disorder and the summary nature. Obviously, in the Bill we
recognise—this was our starting point—the essence of
innocent until proven guilty and the need to put the guilty on the
national DNA database. We have sought to be pragmatic about evidence on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000076">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On penalty
notices for disorder, it is worth highlighting that the same
arrangements apply in Scotland by virtue of section 79 of the Criminal
Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010, under which DNA can be
retained for two years from those arrested for a recordable offence and
subsequently given a fixed penalty notice under the Antisocial
Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004. For those not familiar
with penalty notices for disorder, they were introduced by part 1 of
the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. According to the explanatory
notes to that Act, they are intended to be<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000077">&#160;</a>

                        <p>the
issuing of such a penalty notice none the less indicates that the
constable believes a criminal offence has been committed, albeit the
person receiving the penalty notice does not admit guilt in such
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So
the penalty notice for disorder has a different status, which is why it
is appropriate to take a different approach that recognises the
different status of the PND as a summary disposal. That reflects some
of the points made by the hon. Gentleman when he spoke to the previous
group of amendments, and it is why a two-year period is
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Again,
we are not taking the general starting point in relation to arrest,
which was the starting point of the previous Government’s Bill.
To seek to draw the same conclusion from both would be to make a false
comparison. We are clearly saying that some form of sanction has been
imposed as a consequence of the determination of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 254<a class="bkMark" name="Column254">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the constable in issuing the penalty notice. That
falls short of a conviction, which would otherwise see the
person’s DNA being retained indefinitely. That is why we believe
it is appropriate to have a somewhat different regime in respect of
fixed penalty
notices.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
tend to concur with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Wycombe: in such circumstances it is a question of drawing up an
appropriate algorithm for the relevant computer program to monitor the
DNA database, because it is a two-year retention period from the issue
of the fixed penalty ticket. Although the hon. Member for Eltham may
have some reasonable points on the exercise of discretion, in fairness,
as we have seen in other aspects of the Bill, some of those arguments
about complexity perhaps do not arise in this case because we are
simply talking about a fixed period of
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000083">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am still not clear why the Government have
chosen two years. They seem to be saying, “Well, it’s not
quite the same as other situations, so we’ll do it for a little
bit less.” The Scotland argument comes in again, and it will be
interesting to see whether in other areas of legislation the Government
are so keen to pray Scotland in
aid.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000084">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
problem with what the Government are doing—this has bedevilled
the entire debate not only on this Bill, but on previous occasions when
DNA profiles and samples have been discussed—is that being on
the national DNA database is seen as a punishment and as part of the
punishment process. This provision links to that and suggests that it
is the case. But DNA is not part of the judicial process, and it is not
something that is ruled on by courts. In effect it is similar to
someone being arrested by the police for a crime of which they are
perfectly innocent. Such an arrest is currently recorded and the police
will know that that person has been arrested if they are subsequently
rearrested. As part of a process, the DNA profile is treated in exactly
the same
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000085">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman makes the point that in
some way this is not connected to issues of innocence and guilt.
Therein lies the fundamental difference in our approach to adopting the
measures within the Bill. Why, therefore, is a distinction drawn in the
Crime and Security Act 2010 between conviction and non-conviction? In
the hon. Gentleman’s view for non-conviction, for arrest, there
should be a six-year retention, yet for those who are convicted it
should be indefinite retention. If he is saying there is no link, why
was there a link in the previous
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000086">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My point is not about the link. My point goes back
to our previous arguments about rearrest and the period between
rearrest and an initial arrest for which a person is not charged or
convicted of any crime. There is a clear indication that there is a
higher rate of rearrest among that section of the population than there
is among the general
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
argument aside, we are discussing the retention of the DNA of people
who have been issued with a penalty notice. To suggest that somehow it
is a lesser form of conviction and therefore that should be reflected
in the retention of the DNA, links the DNA to the type of crime and so
suggests that the retention of the DNA profile is somehow a punishment.
It is not. It is a device that the police use, just like their other
records, for the

accept that a fixed penalty notice is a lesser mechanism for dealing

Court of Human Rights, which is not an organisation that I regularly
quote, has talked about proportionality in dealing with matters such as
these? Therefore would he not agree that it is perfectly logical that
where there is summary justice by way of a fixed penalty notice, it is
only appropriate that the profile be retained on the database for a
lesser period of

Court talked about proportionality. That is why the blanket approach to
retention was indiscriminate and not acceptable. That is clearly
accepted by everybody and we start from that point. Again, the question
is whether the database is seen as a tool for the police and therefore
the retention period is there for that purpose, or whether the length
of time that a profile should be retained is regarded as an addition to
the punishment that is meted out. I think we need to keep those clearly
separate and keep the system simple. I do not accept that two years is
the appropriate time to retain the DNA. I am concerned that the
Government are linking the DNA profile to the type of punishment. That

                           </strong> I do not need to go over the arguments we have
just had on the amendment. We are not happy about penalty notices being
used as a means by which DNA material can be retained. Provisions in
the Bill and in various other pieces of legislation permit the
retention of DNA material or fingerprints of people who are of concern
to the police but who have not been convicted of or cautioned for an
offence. We therefore do not see that it is necessary to introduce this
link to penalty charge notices, albeit for disorder. If the offence is
serious enough, there are existing provisions. Our concern is that
people may have their material retained on the say-so of a police
officer issuing a penalty charge notice, and the possibility that young
people may find themselves in such a situation is very
worrying.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000111">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
does not seem to be any rationale for the period of two years. What
concerns us about the Minister’s response is the idea that the
two-year period somehow reflects the level of the crime; the Government
seem to see retention of DNA profiles and fingerprints as part of the
punishment process, rather than linked to its being a device for the
police to aid future investigation and detection of crime, particularly
of serious violent and sexual crime. Going down the slippery slope of
linking the length of time for which material is retained to the type
of conviction opens up that area of debate. Quite rightly, the public
will be very concerned about the stigmatisation of
people—particularly those who are innocent—who are on the
database and have their DNA retained. Because of the link with
punishment, it is of great concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000112">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the past,
the material retained was a matter for the person arrested, the police,
and anybody else who might be aware that the person had been arrested,
because it was assumed that material would be retained on arrest. Now
we are introducing different regimes, and being on the DNA database
suggests an element of guilt, which is a worrying step. Linking two
years to the type of conviction—in this case, a penalty charge
notice—opens up that area of debate. It will be a matter of
concern in future for the public, and I think that the Government are
making a serious error.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000113">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I think that the public will be more
concerned about the previous Government’s indiscriminate
retention regime, which has existed until now, and the fact that
information was taken on arrest, without innocence or guilt being part
of it. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways, frankly. If
somebody is arrested and issued with a penalty notice for disorder, he
implies that it is a terrible thing that there should be a retention
period. His Government, however, would have retained the information
for six years anyway, straight from arrest. The issue would not have
arisen and they would have retained the information for a much longer
period. I think that is what the public will be most concerned
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000114">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
we are proposing is appropriate, and the argument, again, returns to
the fundamental divide between the approaches of Government and Labour
Members. Their starting point would be to seek to retain DNA for ever
and a day, if they had the chance. That is what the previous Government
wanted to do. Our starting point is to view people as innocent until
proven guilty, which is why we think that our proposed regime is
proportionate. Clearly, there is a point of difference, which I
acknowledge and accept. However, I say to the hon. Gentleman that
people view retention as linked to guilt, regardless of whether it
comes from arrest. From my postbag and from the letters that I sign as
a Minister, I know that people object to having their DNA retained
following arrest, simply on the say-so of a constable. People believe
that it is a mark on their character. Although the hon. Gentleman may
not accept that, and while he may see the provision as trying to create
a link and somehow creating an artificial divide, I have to tell him
that the link is there. That is why the European Court made its
judgment, why the Information Commissioner sees the issue as
significant, and why a proportionate regime needs to be put in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000115">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This is a probing amendment, and it relates to
arguments similar to those that we have already made regarding the
length of time for which material can be retained. I am sorry if I have
overlooked something obvious, but will the Minister clarify this point
for me? I am assuming that the initial retention period for anyone who
has their material or profile retained under national security
provisions is three years, and that clause 9 refers to the extension
period for which the chief officer will have to apply to the biometric
commissioner. I assume that that is the case, but the amendment seeks
clarification on that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000141">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In relation to the hon. Gentleman’s
final point, a difference exists over whether the initial retention
period should be six years or three years. We have rehearsed that, and
I accept that in calling for a six-year period the hon. Gentleman is
consistent with the position that was adopted under the 2010
Act.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000143">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the question of two years and the national security determination, I am
pleased to note that the hon. Gentleman said that this is a probing
amendment. I was concerned that he was changing his position and
already turning his back on his leader’s liberalism in respect
of individual rights. I note that it is a probing amendment, but during
our deliberations on the Bill we shall see the hon. Gentleman’s
view on liberalism in respect of individual rights.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000144">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The police
and security services have consistently supported a two-year maximum
retention period for material that is retained for a national security
purpose. That provides a clear timetable for regular review and, as
proposed by the Bill, for independent oversight. I point the hon.
Gentleman to new section 64ZK of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984, which would have been inserted by section 14 of the 2010 Act. It
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000145">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“A
determination under subsection (1) has effect for a maximum of 2 years
beginning with the date on which the material would otherwise be
required to be destroyed, but a determination may be
renewed.”<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000337">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
essence, the two-year assessment of whether materials should be
retained for national security purposes is consistent with the approach
taken in the Crime and Security Act 2010. We will come to oversight
provisions later in the Bill, but we believe that a two-year
re-examination is the right period for examination and analysis to
confirm that retention is appropriate. It also ensures that new
information or assessments can be undertaken on a regular basis. Two
years was considered an appropriate period in respect of the 2010 Act,
with the support of the police and security services. We believe that
it is an appropriate period for that regular update. Given the probing
nature of the amendment, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be minded
to withdraw it on the basis of the information that I have
provided.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000146">&#160;</a>

balance in the process for people giving material voluntarily. Later
clauses refer to consent, and consent given in writing, but it is not
clear how the process is dealt with. When material is given
voluntarily, I assume it will be for a process of elimination in an
investigation. What would happen if somebody withdrew that permission
during the course of an investigation? What process would they go
through in order to say that they no longer wished their material be
retained and what information would they get when it was volunteered?
Would they be asked to fill in a form?

rights? What should they do if they become concerned? Who should they

checks and balances to give them the confidence to assist the police.

from participating and could create difficulties for the

Bill does not seem to indicate the process that people will sign up to

request that their information be destroyed. Nor does it indicate how,

other provisions. We want to find out exactly how the public will be

police, and so that they fully understand what will happen to their

                           </strong> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments
on the issue of material given voluntarily. Clause 10 inserts new
section 63M into the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which makes
it clear that material given voluntarily in connection with an
investigation may only be retained until it has fulfilled the purpose
for which it was taken—that is, until it has been compared with
the sample taken at the scene of the crime being investigated. In other
words, it is for that limited extent and limited period.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000155">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments 59
and 60 seek to amend subsection (1) of new section 63M of the Police
and Criminal Evidence Act so as to provide that the fingerprints and
DNA given voluntarily must be given with the written consent of the
person concerned. However, given that Clause 10 deals with retention
rather than taking, it is unclear what this amendment would do,
although I appreciate the probing nature of the amendment and the
manner in which the hon. Gentleman sought to highlight it.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000156">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman’s points would be unnecessary in any event. PACE code
of practice D deals with the taking of biometric material in connection
with the investigation of an offence and annex F to that code deals
specifically with the taking of material with consent. Annex F makes it
clear that consent must be given in writing; it provides sample
wordings for such consent and also requires that on the rare occasions
where volunteer material is intended to be kept beyond the particular
investigation, a separate signed consent must be obtained for that as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000157">&#160;</a>

the hon. Gentleman has made a fair point, we consider that those points
have been adequately dealt with pursuant to code of practice D under

accept his points and the guidance he has indicated. It is important
because, as we have discussed, there is public concern about how
details are treated and how profiles are retained. People are rightly
cautious about that. An important part of the police’s weaponry
against crime is public participation and assistance—people
coming forward and giving evidence. In this case it means people coming
forward and giving personal biometric data that allows them to be
eliminated from suspicion of having committed a crime and assists the
police in detection of crime. It is important that people have
confidence in that process. With all the best guidance in the world,
information giving people confidence at the early stage of that process
is important. Having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

themselves from those inquiries. I am conscious of the
Minister’s remarks on amendments 59 and 60, in which he
explained that the sense of the Bill is to remove a profile from the
database as soon as possible, as soon as a person has been eliminated
from inquiries. With that in mind, I offer the amendment to tauten
subsection (2) and to say simply that, in any event, the profile must
be destroyed within one year.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000163">&#160;</a>

the hon. Gentleman may need to hear from the Minister the circumstances
in which, after the initial investigation, DNA will be retained for a
purpose that the Minister did not spell out. I am sure that, when the

has to be retained beyond the one-year period that the hon. Gentleman
refers to in his

                           </div>amendment, therefore, just speaks to the specific
point of material being given voluntarily; in particular, to help

                        <p class="tabbed">The
driver for me here is that members of the public should have the
confidence to help the police with inquiries and have themselves
eliminated from those inquiries, knowing that their DNA profile would
be retained for the absolute minimum

arguments relating to amendment 47 are similar; it too is intended to
tidy up the Bill, which, as phrased, is rather open-ended. The purpose
of taking DNA was for transmission to the International Criminal Court.
Therefore, we should eliminate any vagueness and open-endedness by
removing subsection (2)(b) to ensure that any material is destroyed
before the end of the six-month period. Further to my hon.
Friend’s remarks, perhaps there are other circumstances that we
have not imagined and which the Minister might wish to
address.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000169">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank my hon. Friend for highlighting those
issues on the retention of material taken from volunteers and those
sampled at the request of the International Criminal Court. First,
clause 10 provides that material taken from volunteers may be held only
for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was
taken, as we have debated in the previous mini-debate. Secondly, clause
11 provides that material held with consent may only be retained for as
long as that consent remains in place. The interrelationship between
clause 10 and clause 11 is relevant on this point and, I hope, provides
context.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000171">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">While the
current legal position on volunteer material is that consent, once
given, cannot be withdrawn, I understand that the national DNA database
strategy board, which we will no doubt discuss further, has already
removed all volunteer profiles from the national database and is not
accepting any further volunteer profiles on to the database, except
when a volunteer makes a specific request to do so. Volunteer profiles
are now just held locally by the relevant police force and checked
against the crime scene sample in question. That question of consent
and knowledge—knowing why the consent provided, given the
current framework, does not allow for an opt-out—is why the
provisions in the Bill make that clear. No doubt we will discuss the
issue of withdrawal of consent in relation to the next group of
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000172">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This is an
issue that we are seeking to explore further with the police and Crown
Prosecution Service, as it affects, for example, a person’s wish
to have their profile retained on a long-term basis. They may wish to
ensure that they are eliminated from further inquiries and so their
consent should be considered in that context.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000173">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend makes an interesting suggestion that, as with samples, there
should be an absolute time limit of 12 months beyond which volunteer
material must not be held. I would want to explore this idea fully with
the police and Crown Prosecution Service before committing to introduce
such a time limit. I certainly am not

their material retained for a longer period. It is now a question of
seeing how that interrelationship fits together. I will certainly
reflect carefully on my hon. Friend’s amendment on the retention
of volunteer
samples.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000174">&#160;</a>

47 deals with material taken on behalf of the International Criminal
Court and it may assist the Committee if I say a little about that
procedure. The provisions of schedule 4 to the International Criminal
Court Act 2001 give police officers in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland powers to take DNA samples and fingerprints following a request
from the International Criminal Court in The Hague. The International
Criminal Court Act 2001 places tight restrictions on the use to which
DNA samples and fingerprints taken on behalf of the Court can be put,
and nothing in the Bill changes those restrictions, which in essence
prohibit the use of material taken at the request of the Court except
for purposes specified by the
Court.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000175">&#160;</a>

2 of schedule 1 to the Bill places a general six-month limit on the
retention of material once it has been transmitted to the Court; this
includes samples, DNA profiles and any copies. My hon. Friend’s
amendment would delete the second limb of new paragraph 8(2) of
schedule 4 to the 2001 Act, which would therefore require the deletion
of all material within six months of its transmission to the Court,
whether or not it had fulfilled the purpose for which such material was
taken. While we would not expect the police to need to retain the
material beyond the six-month point except in exceptional
circumstances, we none the less believe it to be right that they could
do so where there was an ongoing need to retain it on behalf of the
International Criminal Court. That is the important link there: the
Court has to need that
retention.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000176">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This is a similar debate to the one that we have
just had on the previous clause and it is about the process for
deletion and removal of profiles where people withdraw their consent. I
assume that the clause deals with people who have their profile taken
and then give permission for it to be retained and also those who
volunteer to be on the database. This is the process by which they give
that consent and it is not clear what happens if they change their
mind.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000183">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments introduce the possibility that somebody can withdraw consent
verbally by turning up at a police station, where presumably a record
is taken, and they can give proof of identity. There could be a
verification process—not just a phone call asking for it to be
done—by which they could request information be removed,
verbally while attending a police station, or by writing to the
appropriate body, which would presumably be the local chief
officer.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000184">&#160;</a>

                        <p>The
amendment seeks clarification on how someone who has given details with
consent can have them removed. It is again about the process of
ensuring that people have sufficient information to understand the
process, to know what they are getting into and how to get out if they
choose. What is the process? Where is the guidance on how the police
should deal with it? There has been controversy around deletions, where
they have been requested of police in the past. The Select Committee
looked into the matter and there was a degree of inconsistency in the
way that local chief officers dealt with it. I know that is slightly
different from information given by consent, but even so we do not want
a postcode lottery in the way that the matter is processed.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000186">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 11 deals with the retention of
material provided voluntarily, beyond the period of the purpose for
which it was taken or derived. The hon. Gentleman will note that
subsection (3)(a) requires consent to be given in writing. Therefore,
the withdrawal would need to be in writing. The hon. Gentleman’s
amendments seek to change that, so that withdrawal could be verbal or
in writing. I am not attracted to that proposal, as it is likely to
lead to uncertainty and confusion, about which my hon. Friend the
Member for Wycombe was concerned. It is easy to imagine a situation
where a person could claim to have withdrawn their consent orally, but
no record of that was held by the police. A match might be made and
issues could arise.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000188">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The approach
we sought to adopt was in language consistent with new section 64ZL
under the Crime and Security Act
2010:<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000189">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>That
points back to the written consent required for retention. Therefore,
the proposal simply reflects the drafting on consent in the Act passed
under the hon. Gentleman’s Government. We do not think that an
oral withdrawal would be appropriate due to concerns about clarity and
certainty. The issues of confusion and the postcode lottery arose in a
different situation when there was, and still is, indefinite retention
under the previous Government’s arrangements, which determined
the approach that chief officers of police had to take. Here, however,
we are discussing the process whereby written consent for the retention
of material can be withdrawn, which would also be in writing, so that
there is a documentary record that consent has been given, which would
mitigate any areas of dispute. Otherwise, someone could simply say that
they had told a police officer that they had withdrawn their consent.
It must be a written process. I am sure that we will have guidance
about where that might need to be
addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000190">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To
address the hon. Gentleman’s point about certainty and some of
the points that the Information Commissioner set out, we need clarity
about when written withdrawal should be given in the same way that
written consent is given. That would avoid the confusion that the hon.

highlight.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000191">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I shall not press the amendment. The issue is
about informing the public about the process and ensuring that they are
clear from the outset about what they are involved in. Does the
Minister intend to suggest to ACPO or the national DNA strategy board
that some sort of leaflet or written confirmation about the process
should be sent to everybody who gives their consent for their details
to be retained, so that there is clarity? I entirely accept that the
issue about the postcode lottery for removing people’s profiles
was in a different context. Nevertheless, there was a different
approach in different areas. Does the Minister think that it is
appropriate to ensure that people are clear about the process from the
outset?<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000192">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clearly, we are discussing information that
has been volunteered under clause 10 and that has been retained with
written consent under clause 11. There is a process for obtaining that
consent. As part of the implementation of the provisions, we will have
discussions with ACPO and the strategy board. As I have already
indicated, the strategy board is seized of the issue about volunteered
material and of providing assurance in that regard. I want to have
clarity, so that if people are giving consent, they know how that
consent can be withdrawn thereafter. It is a reasonable point to
highlight, but it is not something to address in the Bill. We will
examine it as part of the implementation
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000193">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the Minister for that response. I
entirely accept his point about verbal withdrawal of consent. It cannot
be claimed that consent has been withdrawn if the person is simply
walking past a police officer in the street and asks for it to be
removed. There would, of course, have to be some verification process.
I suggest that verbal withdrawal should mean going to a police station
and making a request that is recorded there. In some respects, that
would be more secure, in terms of identification, than even a letter,
but having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

gone back and destroyed all the information.” He said,
“How can you do that? You’ve just told me that all the
identifying information that linked me to the DNA material held by the
Forensic Science Service was disconnected?” There are public
concerns about the management of the information and the verification

done with it, where it goes and what will be stored. If the practice of
making copies continues, we will need some sort of commitment from the
Minister or the Government to ensure that the process is properly
managed. Although the clause is small, it hits the heart of many of
the concerns raised about these data, which are that people
have access to very sensitive information but we do not know who they

talking about the domain of the pointy heads. However, we might not be;
the flat heads might gain access. The information might be deep in the
bowels of some piece of software or hardware, or it might not. There is
not just one source of information. What will be done with the copies?
It is inevitable that when there is a match, copies from the database
will be made as part of the evidence for the case. Presumably the
police must give that information to a barrister when the case is
eventually presented in court. However, people are concerned about what
is done with the information once it is retained. The destruction of
copies is an important part of that process. That does not just relate
to existing material; it will be ongoing as copies are made, presumably
downloaded from the DNA
database.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000211">&#160;</a>

more detailed, information is held at the Forensic Science Service end
of the process, and the police can interrogate it once a match has been
made on the national database. Are there copies of that sort of
detailed information that need to be managed too? If members of the
public are to have confidence in the whole system—not just in
this process, but in any system, including previous Acts—the
process of making and retaining copies is a very important part of
keeping detailed information

could come tumbling down if the management of the

does not take many people suffering as a consequence of loose
management of information to create a great deal of public concern
about how it is handled. It is important that we hear

                           </strong> Amendment 63 would require the deletion of
all biometric material held by the police or in forensic science
laboratories, even when there was no biographical information to reveal
the identity of the individual from whom it was taken. We need to
consider the appropriate way to give assurance to the hon. Gentleman,
and others, in relation to the destruction, or putting the relevant
information in a way that does not cause harm. That is the key point
that we are seeking to address. Although the samples will be destroyed
once the laboratory’s quality processes are complete, the
laboratory management system needs to retain a record of the path of
the sample in and the profile out in order to meet the requirements of
the ISO 17025 accreditation process that all UK forensic science
providers must follow. As we discussed last week, the retained record
does not include the name and other details of the person from whom it
was taken.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000214">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I understand
that material held in laboratories is normally held against the
reference barcodes rather than the names. It will also include the
electro-pherograms, which plot results from the automated DNA
sequencing machine as an intermediate stage in producing the numerical
profile. Obviously the intent behind that is that the profile is
deleted, according to the provisions we have discussed previously.
However, certain records may be kept to ensure that the appropriate
accreditation standards are met.<em> </em>The clause seeks to enable the
retention of those records, but in a format that puts them beyond harm
by ensuring that the identification information is removed.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000215">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The provision
has been part of the discussions between ACPO and the Information
Commissioner and I understand from the chair of the national DNA
database strategy board that the Information Commissioner takes the
view that breaking that link reduces quite significantly issues of
privacy and compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998 on the
retention of what might be construed as personal details. In many ways
that is why we have taken the approach of doing something workable to
deal with the potential evil, if I can describe it like that, of having
records or information that might be tracked back to a particular
individual. That is why the provision makes it clear that any retained
data that is not destroyed must not include information that identifies
the person to whom it relates.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000216">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Governments
have consistently taken that view. The Crime and Security Act 2010
inserts section 64ZM(2) into
PACE:<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000217">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

a DNA profile is required to be destroyed by virtue of any of those

information which identifies the person to whom the DNA profile
relates.”<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000341">&#160;</a>

                        <p>We
are taking the same approach in the Bill as the Labour Government took
in the 2010 Act. We recognise the issues at stake about personal
identification and personal data, and the need for deletion. However,
there is also a requirement, for regulatory
purposes, to ensure trust and confidence in the
process, and to ensure that accreditation standards can be properly
checked and assessed, and information is retained in a form that does
not identify the individual. That was why the

proposals in the Crime and Security Act. That is why we, too, think

purposes in the ISO 17025 accreditation process to which I have
referred. In other words, it is to ensure that there is a check on
whether a laboratory meets the necessary standards, so that we have
trust and confidence in the process that it has adopted. That is why
certain records need to be retained, hence my earlier reference to
barcodes. It is important for trust and confidence. However, and this
is the most significant point, that information should be retained on
an anonymised basis, so that personal data, which might otherwise
rightly be a concern, are addressed in that different way, and in the
same way as under the previous
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000220">&#160;</a>

for verification—for the accreditation process, to ensure that
the standards are being met by the forensic science service
provider—are there not enough samples of material that is to be
retained for that need to be satisfied? We are dealing with information
that should be removed, yet an element of it is being retained. I am
not clear why that is happening, and why it is not being destroyed, if
possible, given that the Bill’s intention is that
people’s biometric profiles and all other details should be
removed.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000221">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman highlights an important
point, which is the need to ensure that there is deletion of the
samples of the original biometric material that created the profile.
There are various steps and documents that effectively show how a
profile is created from that sample. We are very clear about the
deletion of the profile on the DNA database; it gets deleted, so we are
not talking about that. My clear understanding is that the
electro-pherograms that are then created are equally a profile, so they
will be deleted. What we are seeking to capture is intermediate
information that may be required for accreditation purposes and may
provide a link. We want to anonymise that copy, so that the
accreditation purposes can be met by the forensic laboratory, but in a
manner that seeks to not offend the Information Commissioner, or ignore
some of the understandable concerns that might otherwise
exist.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000222">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister is, I think, referring to the fact that all information
identifying that data at the forensic science service end of the
process has to be removed in order for it not to be attributed to an
individual. However, as Dr Wallace pointed out in her
evidence, the information that is held at that point in the process is
extremely detailed. It is personal and therefore the individual, by the
very nature of the information that is being held, is identifiable,
because it is their DNA profile. The information is much more detailed
than what is on the national DNA database, which is only a string of
numbers.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000226">&#160;</a>

of that information is an important area of debate. Perhaps it is
something we can investigate further and return to at a later stage,
because I am still not clear why, in circumstances when information
needs to be deleted—other than the fact that it cannot be
deleted, which has been alluded to by others, including the Information
Commissioner—it needs to be retained and planned for. I assume
that those are the only copies that the clause refers to, and that
there are no other copies of the information, and that we are referring
to data held by the forensic science services and not to information
that may be downloaded from the national database and a copy kept, or
to other copies of information obtained directly from the forensic
science services that may be held in a file, in a police station or
electronically on someone’s

the relevant information about the individual concerned and therefore
would not be captured by the exemption that otherwise applies to
anonymous data under clause 13. Clearly, from an
implementation perspective, and from the practical perspective of
ensuring that information and any back-up thereof is properly removed
from the national DNA database, it is a relevant point, and one that I
note in the context of implementing the provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000234">&#160;</a>

the hon. Member for Eltham, let me say that copies would normally only
occur as part of the process of deriving the profile; they would not be
made at random during the course of an investigation. We are probably
talking the same language when it comes to the forensic process of
moving from having a sample to creating the profile, and to loading it

debate to make sure that there is clarity on the issue. If any
clarification is needed, I will certainly come back to the hon.
Gentleman on this point, but I have given my clear understanding of how
the process is intended to operate, why copies may arise as part of the
intermediate steps to get to the profile loaded on to the national DNA
database, why they are destroyed and why, during the intermediate
steps, there may be a need to retain those copies in an anonymised
form. Doing so ensures that appropriate accreditation can be maintained

                        </p>
                        <p>The reason why we want
to add those words to the clause that deals with the destruction of
samples relates to the discussion we have already had. The principle
behind the Bill is that when extremely personal and detailed
information, particularly biometric information, is removed from the
national DNA database, it should all be destroyed. Earlier, I read from
the Information Commissioner’s evidence; he was clearly of the
view that, in future, all information should be processed in a way that
allows that to happen. Every part of the process—from taking the
sample to processing it and downloading the information on
to the national DNA database as a profile—should be
deletable and removable.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000248">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If we are to
achieve what the legislation intends, and address the concerns of many
lobby groups about the retention process, that personal information
must be destroyed. During discussion of the previous clause about
copies, we proved that all we can achieve at this stage is to ensure
that the profile is removed from the national DNA database and that
physical samples taken from individuals are destroyed. We cannot deal
with the material held by the Forensic Science Service on an individual
basis because that is processed in batches; we have talked about that.
I visited the Forensic Science Service in Lambeth road. It has a
machine that processes information in batches of about 20. I am told
that the machine used in Birmingham processes in batches of around 96,
of which 16 or so are controls. It is impossible to remove pieces of
that information. If we are going to deliver what the Bill aims to
achieve, we have to plan for an arrangement that allows all biometric
information to be
removed.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000249">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Returning
to a point made in our debate on the previous clause, part of the
problem is that the issue also existed under the 2010 Act; it is not
unique to this legislation. The problem has arisen because the measure
builds on a procedure that was started on the assumption that all
information would be retained indefinitely. That has been thrown into
reverse by S. and Marper and the European Court of Human Rights, so we
now have to rethink the whole process. Dr Wallace spoke about the need
for people to have confidence in that process, and about the concern
that companies other than the Forensic Science Service, which is a
national body, will be holding that sort of information. People will
rightly be concerned 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 272<a class="bkMark" name="Column272">&#160;</a>
                           </div>about that. If we want people to have confidence that all their
information has been removed, the deletion and destruction of the
information must be complete, going all the way back through the
process. We have to start thinking that through in the Bill, if people
are to have confidence that if their profiles have been taken, none of
their personal details or information will be held in future.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000250">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Bearing in
mind that the Government intend to shut down the Forensic Science
Service, and that a great many more private providers might move into
this area of work, which is carried out on behalf of the police, people
will be a little more alarmed that private
companies—particularly those not based in the UK—might
carry out this work and this sort of profiling. The control and
oversight of biometric information has to be complete, so that people
can be confident that they cannot and will not be identified and, more
importantly, that the most personal items of their DNA profile are
removed absolutely.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In our debate
on clause 13, I referred to a letter that I received from an individual
who wanted his information removed. He was told that he had been
removed from the national database and all reference to him had been
eliminated, but when he complained further, he was told that as a
result of his complaint, his biometric details held by the Forensic
Science Service had been subsequently identified and
destroyed. That should not have been possible, as he pointed out in his
letter. That raises concerns about the process of deleting all
references that link an individual to the information that
has to be retained. If we are to have confidence and really
achieve the inspiration behind the Bill, not only should people be
removed from the national DNA database, but their personal
information should not be held by anyone, even anonymously. If that
that principle is to be achieved, we have to
start planning for that now.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000252">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">These probing
amendments, which I will not put to the vote, are designed to explore
the Government’s thinking about the management of that
information, and to explore whether they think that the proposals in
the Bill simply to remove the personal information that links people
with the data held in the Forensic Science Service providers’
databases are sufficient, or whether we should plan to go even
further.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000253">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This debate continues our discussion on the
amendments to clause 13. My understanding is that the hon.
Gentleman’s amendments seek to deal with the intermediate
material between the biological sample and the numerical profiles, such
as the electro-pherograms, which plot the results from the automated
DNA sequencing machines in an intermediate stage of the production of
the numerical profile. For further clarification, I point the hon.
Gentleman to clause 18, which inserts into section 65(1) of the Police
and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 a definition of “DNA
profile”, which
is:<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000254">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“any

                        </p>
                        <p>That
would cover intermediate material, as well as the final numerical
sample loaded on to the national DNA database. The material is
therefore covered by clause 13 and must be destroyed unless it is held
anonymously, reflecting the discussions we had on the previous group of
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000255">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman is right that DNA samples are processed by the forensic
suppliers in batches, and they will be destroyed in batches. To do
otherwise would greatly increase the cost, which is why the immediate
destruction provisions are framed as they are. Each batch contains 96
samples. The hon. Gentleman mentioned that that was the case in
Birmingham, so that is certainly consistent. A batch is normally
composed of 82 live and 14 control samples, as part of the quality
process. Until that quality process is complete, the 82 live profiles
will not have been satisfactorily derived, and it would be
inappropriate to destroy the samples until that process is
complete.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000256">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
14 deals with the destruction of the samples. We have discussed clause
13 and the destruction of copies that may arise in the intermediate
material. I underline the safeguards and certainty, and the point about
ensuring that there is trust and confidence that the forensic providers
are conducting their work appropriately. That is why the accreditation
steps are required.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000257">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I hear what
the hon. Gentleman says about wishing to delete all information, and
not relying on the anonymised data—the approach that we
previously discussed. However, if he does that, he may undermine trust
and confidence that forensic providers are doing their job properly.
There would be an inability to check—to verify that they had met
the relevant accreditation standards. There is an important issue in
seeking to provide that
balance.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000258">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the hon. Gentleman’s probing amendment to clause 14, which would
extend the provisions of the clause to all biometric material, not just
samples, he should be aware that that might have unintended
consequences. He spent most of last Tuesday arguing for a six-year
retention period, but in this group of amendments, it would appear that
he is, by contrast, requiring all biometric material, even that taken
from convicted murderers and rapists, to be destroyed within six
months. I do not think that is his intention, but it appears to be the
effect of his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000259">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that, on balance, and given the debate we had on the amendments to
clause 13, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his probing amendments to

14.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000260">&#160;</a>

probing. As we do not have access to Government lawyers to draft our
amendments, there may well be unintended consequences. None the less,
the principle applies. The Information Commissioner said in his
evidence that retention of that information, and the processing in
batches, should be avoided in future. As for the verification process,
I understand that the people at the forensic science services provide
their own DNA to be the check and balance, because they know their own
DNA and recognise it at the end of the process. That is how they verify
whether the process has been successful.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000261">&#160;</a>

those who have had their DNA taken, have not been convicted of anything

their DNA retained—should not have any of their information
retained at all. Some people have raised concerns about the issue. I
pointed to one individual

is for the Bill, but we will have to address it if we are to instil
public confidence in the process. With that in mind, I beg to ask leave

                           </strong> We have covered this point previously, but it is
relevant to the issue of samples. There was an article last week in

fully, as did ACPO, that there is a huge storage of old and historic
samples that need to be removed and destroyed. I note that the Scottish
system allows the retention of samples for 20 years; I do not know
whether the Minister is shocked that he is so inconsistent with
Scotland on that particular issue, but that is the case. The issue here
is about access to justice, even for people who are convicted and seek
to have a conviction overturned, or a sentence reduced.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000267">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Criminal
Cases Review Commission says clearly that it is repeatedly going back
to bodies such as the Forensic Science Service for samples and repeat
tests in order to develop a case for something that might have to go to
appeal. We all agree that we do not want the cost and inconvenience of
storing samples unnecessarily, but how do we determine when they are
necessary? If bodies such as the Criminal Cases Review Commission say
that access to samples is at times important, how can we be clear that

governed in clause 14 on the destruction of those samples in that way.
There is the fact that the sample is taken for the purposes of creating
a profile, and we have just had a debate about the loading of that

the forensic transition board, which is overseeing the managed

                        <p class="tabbed">Again,
this is a probing amendment, which we do not intend to push to a vote.
The clause relates to the use of information that may be on the
database. We have set a time scale after which the information cannot
be used if it is still on the database. That throws up a question about
the provision in the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000276">&#160;</a>

63S(2) says that the material must not be used after the date by which
it should have been destroyed and that all the identifying information
must be removed. The clause seems to say that information may be
retained on the database while awaiting removal. If I am wrong, I would
be grateful if the Minister could point it out, but new subsection (2)
seems to deal with information that might be thrown up if a search of
the database is done overnight and a match comes up identifying someone
who is on the database—but who should not be, because the
deadline has gone by. What happens in those circumstances? Who becomes
aware that that match is there? The clause deals with information that
is awaiting processing.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000277">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If I am
wrong, I stand to be corrected by the Minister, but I wonder whether it
might be appropriate to take a different approach in such
circumstances. If the information is still stuck on the system and a
match comes up, is it right to deny access to that information? Should
there be a cooling-off period after the deadline by which it should be
deleted? That is rather like the period suggested in an amendment on an
earlier clause to allow for the removal of information.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000278">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The engineers
among us might say that it is just a matter of pressing a few buttons
and that the information would go at midnight on the night that it
should be removed, but that process requires some sort of management
and oversight. Will a match show up in these circumstances? Am I
barking up completely the wrong tree? Or am I just barking? I have been
accused of that in the past.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000279">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If a match
were to show up in those circumstances, it would be extraordinary if
nothing could be done with it. If there were a match, and the police
were aware, would they have to pretend that they did not know? Who will
be aware? If such information comes to light, who will ensure that it
is not used in an inappropriate way? Who has oversight over this? What
can be done to prevent such things?<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000280">&#160;</a>

a clause that said, “All information must be removed by that

circumstances. I would be grateful if the Minister clarified what is

                           </strong> At its heart, the provision is intended to
add trust and to provide confidence on how we intend the Bill to
operate. New section 63S(2) makes it clear that where material is
required to be destroyed under clauses 1, 14 or 15, it must not be used
after that time either as evidence or as part of a criminal
investigation. That is an important safeguard to ensure that, where the
Bill provides for destruction, there is nothing to be gained by the
police, accidentally or otherwise, retaining material in the hope that
it might subsequently come in
useful.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000282">&#160;</a>

new section is an important addition to add trust and give confidence
that a robust approach should be taken on the provisions. Although I am
certainly not anticipating that material will be retained, the
provision assists further in gaining pubic confidence in the
police’s use of biometric material by saying that even if the
police do retain material when they should not, they cannot use it. I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that enhancing the
public’s trust in the police’s use of biometric material
is an important task for all of us in the House. That was part of the
problem with how the issues were dealt with
previously.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000283">&#160;</a>

the issue of a match being made inadvertently. The conviction was
quashed by the Court of Appeal, which ruled that the DNA evidence
should not have been admitted in the first place, so this is on the
same point in many ways. The judgment related to section 64 of the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which prohibited such use in the
investigation of any other

                        <p class="tabbed">The
House of Lords overturned the ruling of the Court of the Appeal, and,
effectively, left the decision to the discretion of the trial judge. It
said that although the failure to comply with the prohibition did not
necessarily make the evidence obtained completely inadmissible, a
further step was required of the trial judge to consider whether the
evidence should be
accepted.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000285">&#160;</a>

new subsection 63S(2) is different in drafting terms from the original
version of section 64 of PACE, it is similar. We accept that it is
likely that the courts would take a similar view if such a matter were
before them and would apply the judgment of the House of Lords in R
<em>v. </em>Weir. It might well be that if the circumstances that the
hon. Gentleman highlights arose, the court would need to consider
carefully the admissibility of the evidence in the context of the
provisions in the Bill and reflecting the case law adopted in relation
to section 64 of PACE.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000286">&#160;</a>

passed. That suggests that although they accept the principle that
there cannot be open-ended retention, the police can say,
“We’ll remove it when we get around to it, but as long as
it’s there we can use it.” Such an approach would not be
acceptable, so a deadline has to be introduced. But the Bill seems to
accept that the material will still be there after the three-year
deadline.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000288">&#160;</a>

inadvertence may arise. I think it is that issue that the hon.
Gentleman is addressing, but we would not wish it to arise. The Bill
makes clear what retention should mean, but there might be
circumstances in which, through mistake or failure, it might arise. We
want to ensure that that does not happen. I hope that I have clearly

                           </strong> The amendment highlights some of the
different regimes and the purposes for which material may be taken. I
am advised by the UK Border Agency that curtailing the provisions as
suggested in the amendment would impact on the agency’s ability
to continue to deliver and maintain the required level of integrity and
insurance when dealing with non-European economic area nationals for
whom we may otherwise be unable reliably to fix an identity. For
example, fingerprinting helps to deter the twin practice of applying
for asylum in multiple countries and not claiming asylum in the first
appropriate country. Such provisions under the Immigration Act provide
a practical and robust means of identification at our borders and
should be
maintained.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000300">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Subsection
3 of proposed new section 63T of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984, inserted by clause 17, explicitly excludes from the new retention
regime material taken under the Immigration Act 1971 and the
Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 and used to confirm the identity of
individuals for immigration and asylum purposes. The subsection
replicates an existing provision in PACE both as it currently applies
and as prospectively amended by the Crime and Security Act
2010.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000301">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
should point out that the word “biometrics” in an
immigration context refers primarily to fingerprints and face matching.
The UK Border Agency does not use DNA for the biometric identification
of foreign nationals. Fingerprints and face matching are the most
important biometric tool in identity management. The UK Border Agency
currently destroys the biometric records of individuals granted British
citizenship, but it retains the fingerprints of non-EEA nationals
subject to immigration
controls.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000302">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Biometrics
are a vital tool in ensuring that the Border Agency can maintain
effective border and immigration controls. Due to the nature of some
immigration applications and processes, which can span many years, it
is vital to maintain records for a relatively substantial period. For
robustness of the examination of immigration cases, it is appropriate
to have such a provision in the Immigration Act, as the previous
Government
acknowledged.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000303">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With
that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the
use of biometric data for criminal and immigration purposes is very
different and that it would be inappropriate to maintain a common
legislative framework. I, therefore, invite him to withdraw his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000304">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I indicated that this was a probing amendment to
seek clarity about the exclusion. I assume that it is possible to
retain biometric information for a longer period than otherwise applies
under the Act. The Minister said that DNA material is not used for
immigration purposes. Is there a reason behind that? It surprised me
that it is not used and that we rely on face recognition and
fingerprints, especially as DNA material is much more efficient in
identifying an individual than either of those methods. Is the
exclusion a matter of cost or is the process too
difficult?<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000305">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The retention of biometric information from
those who present the greatest risk to the public is at the heart of
the proposals in the Bill. The Government amendments in this group make
further provisions to ensure that those who pose high levels of risk
have their material retained. They will ensure that biometric material
can be retained indefinitely from those who have committed criminal
acts, but have either been found not guilty by reason of insanity or
have been unfit to plead at trial. In the latter category, material may
only be retained indefinitely when a court has made a finding that the
person carried out an act that would otherwise constitute an offence.
On that basis, I hope that the Committee will agree to the inclusion of
our
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11040563000313">&#160;</a>

people should be addressed and dealt with. I will certainly reflect on
the detailed technical points that he raised. He asked about the words
“responsible chief officer of police”. They are a
shorthand and apply to a chief constable who, under section 63F(10) of
the 1984 Act, can seek an extension of two years when a person has been
charged with a qualifying offence. That deals with the specific point
