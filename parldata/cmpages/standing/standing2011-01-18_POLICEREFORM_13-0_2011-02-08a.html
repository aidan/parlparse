the Committee. May I congratulate the hon. Member for Northampton North
on his elevation to the Select Committee on Home Affairs? It will be
interesting to see how much he charges them. I also congratulate the
hon. Member for Cannock Chase who, along with me, has been made a
trustee of the UK Youth Parliament, which is not particularly relevant
to this Committee, but young people are very important to any matter we
discuss, and the hon. Gentleman and I bring experience to that
role.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments go to the heart of our debate about the powers of the police
and crime commissioner and of the police and crime panel. The
amendments and schedule 8 are exceptionally important with respect to
the appointment, suspension and dismissal of a chief constable.
Amendment 234 simply states that the commissioner must act<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In
other words, we are trying to strengthen the role of the police and
crime panel so that it is involved at a much earlier stage in the
appointment process. It would be a joint process rather than the police
and crime commissioner acting alone and then coming to the police and
crime panel. I appreciate the point about confirmation hearings and the
veto powers that exist, but the debate is important and goes to the

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have said all along that the police and crime commissioner acts almost
as an omnipotent figure over the chief constable and over policing in
their area. With regard to the power of the commissioner and of the
panel over the chief constable, the checks and balances are not
correct. Many of our amendments and indeed some of the comments that I
will make regarding the submission that we have received from Paul West
lend power to that particular
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000038">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Turning
to amendment 232, I am interested in the Minister’s view of the
appointment of a chief constable by the police and crime commissioner.
Can the commissioner appoint anybody whom he thinks has the relevant
experience? Does he have to take account of the existing structures to
appoint a chief constable who he thinks has the necessary qualities?
The amendment lists the sorts of experience that I would expect of a
chief constable if they were thought appropriate by a commissioner and
appointed. Does the Minister expect a chief constable to have served as
a deputy chief constable or an assistant commissioner? How long would
the candidate have served in such a post? The same applies to the
Metropolitan police. Does the Minister expect candidates to have
attended both the course at the Senior Police National Assessment
Centre and the strategic command course? We are trying to find out what
process the police and crime commissioner will go through to determine
the appropriateness of a candidate for the post of chief constable, and
it is important that we have that
clarification.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Similarly,
how will the police and crime commissioner’s functions work on
such appointments? Will police and crime commissioners decide on their
own who is the appropriate person, or do they have to work with others?
There will be a confirmation hearing before the police and crime panel,
but what will be the initial process in deciding who is an appropriate
candidate for chief constable, before that confirmation hearing? Will

                           </div>police and crime commissioners sit alone or with somebody else to
determine that? What is the sifting and assessment process, and with
whom does the police and crime commissioner go through the various
candidates who might be appropriate for the position? Does the Minister
expect there to be a role for anybody else? Will there be any
role for the Secretary of State? I was not sure whether the Secretary
of State will have any say, or whether it will be a matter simply for
the police and crime commissioner. Will Her Majesty’s
inspectorate of constabulary have any
role?<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those
are important questions for the Minister. The amendments go to the
heart of the Bill, as we believe that the police and crime panel does
not have enough power vis-à-vis the police and crime
commissioner. It is not clear from my reading of the Bill and the
associated notes what the process is for the appointment of chief
constables. I have tabled amendment 232 to try to draw from the
Minister an explanation of what people will come forward and what sort
of process the police and crime commissioner will go through. Having
made those few opening remarks, I shall be interested to hear what the
Minister has to

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the wider questions raised by the hon. Member for Gedling, it is
important to understand the purpose of the legislation, which is to
change the current position of chief constable appointments having to
be approved by the Home Secretary to one reflecting the stronger local
accountability that the Bill will introduce, with the police and crime
commissioner being responsible for making those appointments. The hon.
Gentleman’s amendments attempt to reassert the role of the
Secretary of State, which we will resist, because a fundamental
proposition in the Bill is that those appointments should be made by
the police and crime commissioner. That is fundamental to our proposed
reforms.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
will be scrutiny by the police and crime panel, which is set out in
paragraphs 1 and 2 of schedule 8. The provision will apply only to
chief officers. It is important to note that we will change the
position, so that chief officers will have the power of appointing the
rest of their teams, and appointments below the rank of chief constable
will not be made by the elected police and crime commissioner. There
will be different arrangements for London, where the commissioner and
deputy commissioner will still be appointed by the Secretary of State,
because of its special circumstances, including the various procedures
over the effective agreement of the
Mayor.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
specific question asked by the hon. Gentleman was whether the police
and crime commissioner can appoint anyone. We must decide whether we
specify closely in the primary legislation the appointment criteria,
and there are several factors to be considered. First, we expect the
Association of Chief Police Officers to evolve and take on the
responsibility for leadership and professional development in policing.
It will become a more accountable body in that respect. ACPO will
supply the candidates for chief officer positions. ACPO or its
successor body will ensure that people who apply for such positions are
of a suitable standard and have attained the various qualifications and
so on. It is not possible to write that into primary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000045">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
there is an existing power to make regulations regarding appointments
under section 50 of the Police Act 1996. That will not be changed, and
will still apply, so it is possible for us to make regulations that
govern the nature of the appointments, thus enabling us to ensure a
proper process. It will mean that the role of the centre is not
eliminated entirely, but I think that the fundamental decision should
lie with the police and crime commissioner. I appreciate that amendment
232 is a probing amendment because it aims to set specific eligibility
requirements for the rank of chief constable. I do not suppose that the
hon. Gentleman wants such a proposal to be outlined in the Bill,
because it would extend the length of service at chief officer level
from two to three years, and would not achieve the result that he
seeks. I hope that I have explained why such procedures should not be
in the Bill, and that they can be dealt with through both the reform of
ACPO and the existing power of the Secretary of State to make
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000046">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for his helpful
clarification. It will be interesting to see what proposals ACPO
introduces regarding leadership and professional development, as
envisaged by the right hon. Gentleman. If I have understood him
correctly, the police and crime commissioner recruits essentially from
a pool of candidates drawn up by ACPO. Perhaps he will correct me if I
am
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000047">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The issue that we must determine is whether there
should be a legal prohibition preventing police and crime commissioners
from appointing anyone else or whether they should be able to appoint
only from the pool of approved people drawn up by ACPO. It would not be
appropriate that ACPO shortlists for such positions, but it may be
appropriate to specify that people must reach a certain level to
qualify for consideration by a police and crime commissioner. That is
the distinction. We will continue to discuss such matters with ACPO. We
do not disagree about the intent of the measure; we do not want
unsuitable people to be appointed, and they must be suitably qualified.
Equally, the decision should rest ultimately with the police and crime
commissioner, who will be held accountable for
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000048">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister has made an extremely interesting
point. I am sure he will correct me if I am wrong, because I am trying
to clarify the purpose of the Bill. The right hon. Gentleman said that
ACPO will draw up a pool of candidates although it would not be for
ACPO to shortlist them. It would be for the police and crime
commissioner to look at the pool of candidates and judge who is the
most suitable on the basis of local
knowledge.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister then said that we would not want a legal prohibition on anyone
else. What will happen is that people will test what he meant by such a
prohibition. It obviously means that it would be possible for someone
outside the pool of candidates to be selected for interview. Would that
person have to be a police officer? Would it have to be somebody of a
relatively senior rank? I accept the point that not everything in this
measure can be prescribed through regulations. There are some
fundamental points of principle to which the Minister will, at some
point, have to return, to clarify what legal prohibition on anybody
else means, to whom it applies and whether a civilian-type figure, who
has impressed

                           </div>everyone with their knowledge of policing, could run a police force.
Does the Minister want to clarify that? Does he expect the PCC to
appoint warranted officers only, and that there would not be the
prospect of a civilian being appointed by ACPO outside the pool of
candidates?<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000050">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We can all agree that it would be inconceivable
that a PCC would appoint a chief constable who was improperly qualified
for the job in the way that the hon. Gentleman describes. The key
question is the extent to which we have to prescribe that by
regulation, because it is related to the reform of ACPO itself, which
is why we cannot give all the answers at the moment. It is perfectly
fair to establish the view on all sides, which is that people should be
suitably qualified for the job of chief constable, but that the pool
should not be so narrow that PCCs are not given a choice over whom they
appoint, so the choice is made by existing chief constables. That would
not be acceptable. It is right that there should be a standard. We may
have to prescribe that standard by regulation—that is for
determination and discussion, including with ACPO—but we should
not narrow that decision too
much.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000051">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister’s clarification, that it is
not expected that a civilian could become chief constable—that
it would be a warranted officer with the relevant experience—is
helpful, although I still think that there will be some debate and
discussion on what it means for the PCC not to be legally prohibited
from going outside the ACPO pool of candidates. The Minister will
reflect on that point, and others, in reading our proceedings, will no
doubt seek
clarification.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000052">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
was not sure whether any reserve power will be kept by the Secretary of
State. The Minister said that there was a section of the Police Act
1996 which, if the Secretary of State feels there may be problems in an
individual force, or if an unintended consequence arises, allows them
to make or change regulations in respect of this process. The Minister,
the Home Secretary and the centre, notwithstanding the
Minister’s desire for localism, will clearly retain some power
of oversight. The Minister must think that that is important, otherwise
that provision would have been amended and removed from the Bill. I
have no intention of pressing any of these amendments to a vote,

of powers between the PCC and the PCP is sufficiently clear in clause
38, the related clauses or schedule 8. Moreover, the PCPs do not have
sufficient powers. No doubt we will return to that when we consider
schedule 8. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

be consulted, at the request of the panel, to guard against a decision

                           </strong> Again, I shall not press the amendments to a vote,
but will the Minister say whether the checks and balances in the system
are right, in terms of the power of the police and crime commissioner?
He said that the checks and balances on the PCC’s power in the
provision will be exactly the same as those on police authorities. If I
have got that wrong, perhaps the Minister will correct
me.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000066">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> To clarify, the system will be fundamentally
different from the existing one, because police and crime panels will
be separate from the police and crime commissioner. The panel will have
a scrutiny function and the ability to veto a

                           </strong> This is an important schedule in an important part
of the Bill. We started to have an interesting discussion, with the
Minister helpfully clarifying one or two points. In many respects, a
lot of the amendments are about clarification, although there are some
important points of
principle.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our
amendments 124 and 125 seek to increase the power of the police and
crime panel vis-à-vis the police and crime commissioner. I am
not only the one worried about the issue: one of the amendments on
police and crime panels and their powers vis-à-vis the
commissioner has been tabled by the Minister’s hon. Friends.
Clearly, although the Minister is confident about the balance of powers
between the panel and the commissioner, others are less
certain.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
refer the Committee to this month’s <em>Prospect</em> magazine, in
which Jessica de Grazia, the prosecutor in the Manhattan district
attorney’s office, has an interesting article. The Minister will
not agree with it, but it is interesting to read. She points out the
danger of having one person, an elected commissioner, responsible for
everything and the need for proper checks and balances—in terms
of the Bill, the need for us to enhance the powers of the police and
crime panels. I was interested to see that she, too, said that the
police and crime panels as drafted are toothless tigers. Labour Members
certainly agree with the description of the panels as toothless, but
Government Members also have doubts, as well as others outside the
Committee with broad experience of such matters. Our amendment 125
would therefore involve the police and crime panel in the appointment
of a chief constable, because that would give the panel the power to
work with the police and crime commissioner to bring about the best
resolution, deciding on the best candidate to be chief
constable.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
has been referred to in earlier debates, the police and crime panels
are made up of members from each local authority area and, in Wales, an
additional Assembly Member. All those people bring their experience to
the question of who is the best person to be the new chief constable.
The point being made in our amendments is that the involvement of the
police and crime panel in, for example, the appointment of a chief
constable should come at a much earlier stage than is currently
envisaged.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the Bill, the police and crime commissioner decides who the chief
constable should be, and then takes the decision to the police and
crime panel for confirmation. To be fair to the Minister, part of the
process allows the panel to veto that appointment. The issue is not
that there will be no confirmation hearing, or that the police and
crime panel will not have any power, but that the involvement of the
police and crime panel should come

                           </div>at a much earlier stage than currently envisaged. That is the reasoning
behind amendments 124 and 125, and some of the consequential
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000124">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">Associated
with that is an extremely important amendment—amendment 554. It
would give the police and crime panel the power to veto not only the
appointment of the chief constable, but the removal of the chief
constable. In other words, it would give the panel the power to say to
the police and crime commissioner, “Having reviewed your
decision to sack the chief constable, we do not believe that you should
be able to do so.” That is an extremely important point. The
unfettered power of a police and crime commissioner to sack the chief
constable—because of performance or misconduct issues, in the
mind of the commissioner—is significant.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have been
through the following point, but it is worth repeating it. We will have
a police and crime commissioner, elected directly by the people on a
mandate or a manifesto to do x, y or z. What if a chief constable says,
“In my professional opinion, I do not believe that that is the
most effective use of resources,” and the police and crime
commissioner says, “I am not satisfied with that. The standards
and the performance of the chief constable are such that I want them
sacked. I want them removed because they are not doing what I think
they should be doing”? What possible restraint is there on the
power of the police and crime commissioner to prevent them from doing
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
far as I can tell, there will be no involvement of HMIC or the
Independent Police Complaints Commission. The Minister, when he
responds, will hopefully correct me, say that I am wrong, and tell me
that if the police and crime commissioner says, “I am going to
sack a chief constable because they are not performing
adequately,” HMIC or the IPCC have to be involved.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 554
suggests that, in addition to HMIC or the IPCC, there should be a role
for the police and crime panel. One person should not be able to sack a
chief constable because they do not believe that the latter is
performing adequately. The police and crime panel, made up of local
representatives, people from various local authorities, independent
members and a Welsh Assembly Member, should be able to say to the
police and crime commissioner, “No, you have got it wrong. We do
not believe that what you are saying is either right or in the
interests of the policing of our community.” However, as the
Bill stands, the police and crime panel will have no power over the
matter. It will be able to look at the issue and make a recommendation,
but it will not be able to do anything. That is why not only I, but
many people outside, say that the police and crime panels will be
toothless and will not be able to do
anything.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
is an extremely serious matter. We are not talking about an
insignificant figure, but a chief constable, someone who is
operationally responsible for the safety of our communities, yet there
is no role that means anything for police and crime panels, and that is
not satisfactory. I do not think that people in this country believe
that that is right, which is why they are so worried about
politicisation and interference in operational matters. If a chief
constable was worried about the unfettered power of a police and crime
commissioner to sack them, why would they not be looking over their 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 451<a class="bkMark" name="Column451">&#160;</a>
                           </div>shoulder, thinking, “I have to be careful here”? The chief
constable may say, “If I don’t police in the way that the
police and crime commissioner wants, rather than in the way that I
think is best for an area, I’ll be sacked, and there’s
nothing that anyone can do about
it.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000129">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Chief
constables cannot go to HMIC, IPCC or the police and crime panel,
because they cannot do anything about it. Well, they can kick off, and
go to the papers and say, “the police and crime commissioner is
acting in an outrageous way”, but upsetting the police and crime
commissioner even more will not help, will it? We are debating one of
the most significant faults in the Bill. It cannot be right that one
individual has such unfettered
power.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
suspect that if the matter is not considered in Committee or on Report,
it will be discussed in another place. I cannot believe that people
will find the provision acceptable. It risks politicisation,
interference, and the police and crime commissioner acting in a
completely unfettered way. The checks and balances between the police
and crime commissioner, the chief constable and the police and crime
panel are
inadequate.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are using what the hon. Member for Edinburgh West regards as a proper
proportion of the panel—two thirds, not three quarters, as set
out in other parts of the Bill. We want a two-thirds majority for the
veto power. It would mean that the police and crime panel could not act
in an irresponsible way just because it did not like the police and
crime commissioner. There would have to be a two-thirds majority to
veto, so the police and crime panel could not act irrationally and
irresponsibly, and block what the police and crime commissioner was
doing. Given the need for a two-thirds majority, it would have to act
responsibly.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
554 goes to the heart of the contradictions in the Bill and the matters
that we are worried about. I will listen to what the Minister has to
say, but I caution him: to have no restraint is a dangerous mistake. I
do not expect him to say that the amendment is right, but the problem
needs to be not only reflected on, but acted on. With those opening
remarks, I wait to hear what other Committee members have to
say.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000134">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> May I first get out of the way the amendments
that the hon. Gentleman does not describe as key amendments? Amendments
124 to 147 would increase the power of the police and crime panel, to
the exclusion of the police and crime commissioner, with regard to the
appointment, suspension and removal of chief constables. They would
fundamentally change the position so that the power would be given to
the police and crime panel, and would undermine completely the purpose
of the reforms and the separation between the panel and the
commissioner.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000135">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
148 and 149 would make chief constables accountable to the police and
crime panels, not the commissioner, by making chief constables notify
the panel of suspensions and making them consult with the
panel on the removal of senior officers, rather than with the
commissioner. That would be giving the police and crime panel an
improper role. The police and crime commissioner should hold the chief
constable to account, and the panel should scrutinise the commissioner.
The amendments would cut across that arrangement
completely.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000136">&#160;</a>

amendment tabled by the hon. Gentleman is amendment 554, through which
he raises his concerns about the removal of a chief constable. I want
to challenge his characterisation of the powers under the Bill. The
police and crime commissioner will simply not be able to operate an
unfettered power. We have been serious about the checks and balances,
but we do not agree that they should go as far as the hon. Gentleman
suggests.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000137">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First,
the hon. Gentleman said that Her Majesty’s inspectorate of
constabulary was not involved, but that is not true. The Bill is clear,
and as I have already mentioned, paragraph 15(4) of the schedule
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000138">&#160;</a>

wanted to include that provision in the Bill following a meeting I had
with ACPO, in which it raised the issue of what continuing role
the inspectorate might have in the processes. I agreed that it was wise
for the panel to be able to consult the inspectorate. That view will,
of course, become known because of the transparency, and that is a
significant check on what the police and crime commissioner does. The
inspectorate could express a concern about the dismissal, and the panel
could have regard to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000139">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Not really, because of the circumstances. We are
presupposing that the panel has some concern about the dismissal, but
in some circumstances the panel might have absolutely no doubt, so
stating that it “must” consult the inspectorate is
unnecessary. If the panel has concerns, it is allowed to consult the
inspectorate. The provision brings the view of the inspectorate into
play. That safeguard is significant. It was not in our original
proposals, which went to consultation, but was added as a result of the
consultation, in order to address such
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to draw a concern that I have to the attention of the hon. Member
for Gedling. He said that the inspectorate had no role, and because of
what is being suggested and put about, I am concerned that, outside the
House, the view might be that there are no safeguards. Actually, I have
identified a safeguard in the Bill. With the greatest respect, he was
wrong: the inspectorate does have a
role.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the hon. Gentleman said that the police and crime panel should have a
role. However, the panel does have a role. That it should be able to
scrutinise such decisions is important. The schedule makes provision,
in paragraph 15(4), for the police and crime panel to hold a scrutiny
hearing. Indeed, paragraph after paragraph sets out the basis on which
suspension must take place, so the whole process has proper checks. We
must also realise that, in law, police and crime commissioners must
exercise their powers reasonably and fairly, as the holders of a public
office.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
central part of the case made by the hon. Member for Gedling was that
the panel ought to have a power of veto over a police and crime
commissioner’s decision to remove a chief constable, as it does
over appointment.

			Column number: 453<a class="bkMark" name="Column453">&#160;</a>
                           </div>However, I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider carefully whether that
would be a good idea, because of the difference between appointment and
removal. If the police and crime commissioner wished to remove a chief
constable and the inspectorate found no particular obstacle, would it
be wise to allow the police and crime panel, which has no mandate, to
cut across and say, “No, we insist that the chief constable
remains in office”, even though the relationship might have
broken down irretrievably? I do not think it is wise to allow a veto in
the case of dismissal; the circumstances are different from those in
the case of
appointment.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000144">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
checks and balances that we have put in—consultation with HMIC,
the role of the scrutiny hearing, and the fact that, in law, police and
crime commissioners must act reasonably—are sufficient to ensure
due process, with regard to removal. It is fundamental to the reforms
that a police and crime commissioner should have the power to appoint
chief constables and to remove them when there is a serious failure to
perform. I appreciate that chief constables may not like that idea.
Police authorities have the power to remove chief constables at the
moment. If we over-constrain that power, we will allow producer capture
and find ourselves in a position where chief constables cannot be
removed effectively. That would be a step in the wrong direction, and
it would mean that we failed to achieve what we need to
achieve—reforms that strengthen the link between the police and
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000145">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister and I differ, but I do not want to
repeat all our arguments. I will withdraw the amendment, but I want to
test the view of the Committee on amendment 554. It may be that there
is a need to look at the dismissal and removal of chief constables. My
contention is that there is too much power to bring about that removal
vested in one individual. The Minister pointed out that police
authorities have such power, but they comprise groups of people. In his
vision of the future, a directly elected police and crime commissioner
with a mandate has, as far as is reasonably possible, the power to do
certain things—to shake up the system, change it and reform it.
In the Minister’s view, as part of that, it should be easier for
the police and crime commissioner to remove the chief constable where
the PCC deems that to be appropriate. I think that the Minister has
gone too far, and there needs to be a check and a balance that is
currently not there. That is the point of difference between us. I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, but I want to test the
Committee’s view on amendment 554.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000146">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
42 would lower the threshold at which the police and crime panel could
exercise its veto over the commissioner’s proposed candidate for
chief constable, making the threshold a majority of two thirds, rather
than three quarters, as required in the Bill. We discussed this before
in relation to the veto power on setting up a precept, so I do not
intend to go over the same ground again and I will not detain the
Committee for too long. In our previous debate, we formed the view that
there was not a huge difference between the positions in the Bill and
in the amendment. However, we differed, in that the Minister’s
view was, “It isn’t a huge difference, so why make the
change?”, and our opinion was, “If it isn’t a huge
difference, why not make the change?” Since that debate, we have
discussed the composition of the panel’s membership and, despite
my amendment on co-opting members, the Minister expressed his fondness
for independent members. It is therefore worth while considering
whether that will affect the levels at which the veto may be
used.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the Bill stands, there must be a 75% majority for the panel to exercise
its power of veto. As we have discussed, that is nine members on a
12-member panel. If the worry is that political or geographical groups
might somehow band together against a police and crime commissioner of
another persuasion, that is surely less likely to affect the
independent members. The Minister has chosen to describe such members
not as “co-opted,” but as “independent”
members. If they are not independent—if they have been appointed
with some sort of sway that makes them vote more with one
group—that would be an argument against having independent
members in the first place. However, if they are independent, they are
less likely to vote with a particular group. In such circumstances, in
order to exercise a veto, there would effectively have to be nine votes
from the 10 members from local authorities; that is a 90% majority
rather than a 75% majority, which is a very significant hurdle to
jump.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000154">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Even
if the amendment is agreed to, the Bill would still require there to be
a 66% majority, which equates to eight members—there is the
small difference. That effectively means that there would have to be an
80% majority among the local authority members, which is still a
significant body of opinion among those elected members, to bring about
an exercise of the veto. That would still be a significant hurdle, and
a major protection against the police and crime panel being open to any
type of mischief making by any vested interest group on the
panel.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000155">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, a 66% majority would be a step forward. It would still
allow robust scrutiny of the commissioner’s decisions, and it
would still ensure that commissioners

proposing a candidate for chief constable, but it would also reinforce

either not vote for it, or not even test the view of the Committee. As

                        <p class="tabbed">Let me make
two points to the hon. Gentleman. First, he has moved plenty of
amendments that he has not pressed to a Division. He has described them
as probing amendments, often halfway through his speech, when he has
realised what their effect would be. It is perfectly usual to table
probing amendments. Secondly, I have already responded on the substance
of the question of the voting threshold for the PCP. I have already
indicated that I will reflect on it, because it is a serious issue. I
am entirely comfortable with my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh
West raising the issue and our debate was useful. I therefore do not
accept the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Gedling that this is
damaging or unhelpful. We are all adjusting to coalition politics, but
it is interesting that Opposition Members are finding it harder than we
are.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000168">&#160;</a>

he has far less to do on this Committee than I have, so he can work out
the percentages himself. I have already said that these are issues on
which I would like to reflect. I have, however, indicated that we
should treat the suggestion of lowering the threshold with considerable
caution because the police and crime panel is not elected and there is
a danger of cutting across the mandate. I have also questioned what the
force of changing the threshold from three quarters to two thirds would
be. We have had this debate fully when we considered a previous
amendment, so I do not think it is necessary to repeat it. I
ask my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh West to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000170">&#160;</a>

affect the reflections that he has already agreed to make on the veto

hon. Member for Gedling asked whether a vetoed candidate could be
appointed. Under paragraph 8(2), the police and crime commissioner must
not appoint a candidate who is vetoed as chief constable. The provision
is designed to make clear the force of the veto. However, it is subject
to regulations we make under paragraph 8(3). It is possible
to conceive of circumstances in which the panel might look again at an
appointment, especially if it related not to the individual, but to
remuneration that may be part of the reason for the veto. To have an
absolute prohibition written into the Bill once the veto has been
exercised means that the candidate could never come back again, even
though the panel might, on the second occasion, want to accept that
candidate, which would clearly be a
mistake.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000191">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
we discussed in relation to the precept, we have to deal with a
situation in which there might be deadlock between the commissioner and
the panel, which is why we have to make regulations. In general terms,
we will use the power given to the Secretary of State to provide for
the panel and the commissioner to resolve the situation amicably. The
regulations will be laid before Parliament in due course, and the
guiding principle will be that in any regulations to deal with deadlock
it will need to be borne in mind that the elected commissioner has a
mandate from the
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000192">&#160;</a>

about such matters, which will inform our consideration. However, I am
not in a position to describe the regulations in more detail at this

                           </strong> May I reflect for a second on whether we are
writing into the Bill a requirement that the reasons for rejection be
given? For the panel to have to offer a reason seems like common
sense—it would not remain silent about the reasons for rejection
and, clearly, the police and crime commissioner would have to know. Our
whole principle is to support transparency in all such decisions. The
public, therefore, are part of the process as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000198">&#160;</a>

a proper check and balance on, the police and crime commissioner
vis-à-vis the police and crime panel. The crucial amendment is
amendment 317. As the Bill stands, the commissioner may accept or
reject a recommendation, having considered it, but the amendment states
that the commissioner “must” accept the recommendations
of the

instead mean that both must be required to appear. Furthermore, the
Bill states that the requirement to appear before a scrutiny hearing
can include participating in the proceedings but not attending in
person. The amendments require that attendance in person is required to
ensure that the panel receives a fully rounded picture. The amendment
would give the chief constable the opportunity to make written
representations before the panel convenes a scrutiny hearing concerning

heard what the Minister said earlier. To be fair, in the spirit of the
Committee, when I suggested that it may be better to include a
requirement that the panel “must consult” rather than a
requirement “may consult” HMIC, the Minister said that if
it was obvious, perhaps it was not really necessary to consult HMIC. I
think the Minister should strengthen the role of HMIC, but I take the
point that we may not want consultations in 100% of cases. However, I
do not think that “may” is sufficiently strong with
respect to the role of HMIC. As I said, with the exception of amendment
554, it is not my intention to press the amendments to a vote. I simply
seek further clarification about the process from the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000224">&#160;</a>

inspectorate, so I will not return to that issue, but I will speak to
amendment 118. We have not included the Independent Police Complaints
Commission, as the hon. Gentleman does in his amendment, because it is
rightly independent from this whole process. Its remit is confined to
complaints against individual officers. I do not think that it would be
appropriate to bring in the IPCC. We already have a provision to bring
in HMIC, and that is sufficient.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000225">&#160;</a>

119, 120, 121 to 122, the Bill provides for either the police and crime
commissioner or the chief constable or both to attend the scrutiny
hearing. The decision on whether to invite one or the other or both and
how they are required to appear is for the panel to take. It is not for
the Bill to stipulate. There may of course be a case for both to attend
at the same time, but, depending on the reason for the proposed
removal, it may not always be appropriate. That decision is for the
panel to make on a case-by-case
basis.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000226">&#160;</a>

amendment 123 should be resisted on the grounds that it is not for the
Government or Parliament to seek to bind the panel on how it conducts
its scrutiny function. Different circumstances will call for different
procedures, and we must be careful of one-size-fits-all primary
legislation. As we have already had a significant debate about these

processes. For example, we are unsure as to the perceived benefits of
the PCP publishing a report in which up to eight of their members may
have objected to the appointment of the PCC’s preferred
candidate. Furthermore, we fail to see why a chief constable
confirmation hearing process should take up to three weeks as permitted
in the Bill and believe that, with proper planning, it could easily be
concluded on the day of the final interviews as at
present.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000389">&#160;</a>

1 of the schedule is completely silent in relation to the details of

                        <p class="hs_brev">“This
situation contrasts markedly with the well established procedures that
are currently followed by the vast majority of police authorities when
recruiting and selecting chief officers in accordance with the best
practice guidelines in chief officer selection jointly drawn up by Her

Office.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000391">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">For
example, chief officers are already wondering whether, in the case of
chief constable selection, any interviews undertaken will involve the
PCC sitting alone. Or will the PCC sit as the chair of a selection
panel, but with the ultimate freedom to select the candidate of their
choice (subject to their decision not being vetoed by a subsequent PCP
confirmation hearing)?<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000392">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">Similarly,
questions are also being asked in relation to what the proposed panel
membership for a DCC or an ACC selection process might be? Once more,
will these selections be undertaken by a Chief Constable sitting alone
or is it envisaged that they will be the chair of a panel, but still
retaining the freedom to select the candidate of their choice? In the
case of ACC recruitment processes, we anticipate that, if adopting a
‘panel’ approach, a Chief Constable may wish – at
very least – to have their DCC sitting alongside them during
interview. However, if this approach is taken, who is it envisaged will
sit alongside the Chief Constable in a DCC selection
process?<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000393">&#160;</a>

considers that any regulations made under section 50 of the Police Act
1996 and introduced in support of Part 1 of Schedule 8 of the Bill will
need to contain sufficient detail to ensure absolute clarity and
transparency in the selection procedures to be followed both by PCCs
and by Chief Constables, within which (other than in cases involving a
PCP veto) the power to offer promotion to and within the ACPO ranks
will solely be vested in a single individual.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000394">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“Part
2 of Schedule 8 describes in some detail the new arrangements that will
exist to enable the suspension and removal from office of a Chief
Constable by a PCC. Part 3 of Schedule 8 similarly refers to the new
arrangements that will enable the suspension and removal from office of
other chief officers by a Chief Constable, although the absence of
detailed procedures in Part 3 is quite
striking.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000395">&#160;</a>

contrast with the well established and transparent procedures that
currently exist to cater for such rare events, the absence of adequate

professional scrutiny in Parts 2 and 3 of Schedule 8 is a source of
great concern to CPOSA members of all

                        <p class="hs_brev">At
present, the power to remove Chief Constables in the interests of
efficiency or effectiveness, by requiring them either to retire or
resign, is contained within the relevant sections of the Police Act
1996 as amended by subsequent legislation (in particular Sections 30
– 33 of the Police Reform Act 2002). This same legislation also
makes it possible for action that may lead to the removal of a Chief
Constable in the interests of efficiency or effectiveness to be
initiated by the Home Secretary. Within both scenarios, there is clear
requirement for independent professional advice to be sought from Her
Majesty’s Inspector of Constabulary (or HMCIC in the case of the
Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police). Full details of the
procedures to be followed in respect of the removal of Chief Constables
are included in a protocol agreed by HMCIC, the Home Office, the
Association of Police Authorities and CPOSA in March 2004 and published
as an Annex to Police Negotiating Board Circular
04/05.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000397">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">CPOSA’s
concerns in relation to Parts 2 and 3 of Schedule 8 of the Bill as
currently drafted revolve around the fact that the proposed new
arrangements for all chief officers move towards a model of
accountability to a single individual rather than to a committee or
panel. Thus, as regards suspension and removal from office, the PCC is
effectively the final and only arbiter in relation to a Chief
Constable, and in the case of other CPOSA members the Chief Constable
is the final and only
arbiter.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000399">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">As
mentioned above, existing procedures include a clear and specific role
for HMIC throughout, in terms of providing independent professional
advice. Such a safeguard is not contained in the Bill as currently
drafted.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000400">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">Thus,
Part 2 of Schedule 8 makes no reference to a PCC needing to refer
either a decision to suspend a Chief Constable or to call for their
retirement or resignation to HMCIC. Furthermore, in scrutinising a
PCC’s decision to require a Chief Constable to retire or resign,
the Bill only indicates that the relevant Police and Crime Panel
‘may’ consult the chief inspector of
constabulary.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000401">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">In
Part 3 of Schedule 8 there is no reference at all to HMCIC playing any
role in respect of the suspension or removal from office of a DCC or an
ACC by their Chief
Constable.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000402">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">Additionally,
the powers of a Police and Crime Panel outlined in Part 2 of Schedule 8
are limited to making a recommendation as to whether or not their PCC
should call for the retirement or resignation of the Chief Constable.
The PCC needs only to consider this recommendation and is not in any
way bound by
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000403">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">In
summary, therefore, under the provisions of the Bill as currently
drafted a PCC can remove a Chief Constable from office without
obtaining any independent professional advice and could do so against
the recommendation of the PCP. Equally, the provisions of Part 3 of
Schedule 8 would seem to permit a Chief Constable to remove a DCC or an
ACC from office without reference to any external body, so long as
before doing so they have consulted their
PCC.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000404">&#160;</a>

alterations to the essential balance of the arrangements for
appointment and dismissal that CPOSA is seeking, but we recognise the
need for process, and that will be specified in regulations, as we have
previously discussed. I do not agree with CPOSA that there will be no
professional guidance or input on dismissal, because—this is
worth repeating—the police and crime panel will have the ability
to bring in the inspectorate, and to ask for a report. If any concern
is expressed by the panel, that process would be initiated, which

                           </strong> We can deal with the amendment briefly, as much of
what has been discussed on arrangements outside London relates to the
clause. The amendment is consistent with others that we have tabled
relating to London. The Minister does not like it, but we do not
approve of the downgrading of the role of assembly members, which will
turn them into mere bystanders. They will be able to ask questions, but
unable to do anything about any concerns
raised.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000279">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have a simple question on the amendments, and I would like the Minister
to put his answer on the record. Under schedule 8, there will be
confirmation hearings for the appointment of chief officers outside
London; in London there is no such arrangement. I appreciate that the
Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis has national responsibilities
for security and other matters, but there is still a local policing
role. Surely there should be a similar function for the police panel in
London as there is outside it to scrutinise the appointment of a chief
officer. Aside from all the arguments that my hon. Friend the Member
for Gedling has made about issues outside London, we want the Minister
to answer our key question so that we can make progress in the Bill.
Why will there be no role for the police panel in London to scrutinise
the appointment of a chief
officer?<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000280">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Member for Eltham has answered his own
question. There is a distinction between London and the rest of the
country in how appointments are made. Such a distinction is necessary
because of the national policing functions that the Metropolitan police
undertake. The Secretary of State continues to have the power to
appoint the Metropolitan Police Commissioner and the deputy
Commissioner, and the Mayor has a role, which is set out. Provision
already exists, therefore, for the balance between local input, which
comes from the elected Mayor, and the national decision on such
appointments. It would be a mistake to add a third level of approval by
the police and crime panel, the case for which has not been made. The

differing recommendations from the Mayor and from the police and crime
panel, which would add confusion and delay to the appointments
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000281">&#160;</a>

the Secretary of State must already have regard to recommendations and
representations made by the Mayor. The process set out in clauses 42
and 43 permits the residents of London to have their say through their
directly elected representative. The addition of the police and crime
panels to the process would not, therefore, have a discernible benefit.
I do not accept the hon. Gentleman’s characterisation of our
reform as downgrading the role of assembly members; it is they who will
form the police and crime panel, which is an upgrading of their
role.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000282">&#160;</a>

wrong? Outside London, a directly elected police and crime commissioner
makes a recommendation to the Secretary of State for the appointment of
a chief officer. Before such a recommendation is made, a confirmation
process involving the police and crime panel takes place. Will he
explain how applying such an arrangement inside London would add an
unnecessary level of scrutiny? That is all that we are asking

consideration—no one suggests that such a role should be
dismissed. However, 7.7 million people in the Metropolitan police area
are concerned about local policing, over which the chief officer will
have a great deal of influence. It follows, therefore, that the
directly elected Assembly panel should have some oversight—as is
the case outside London—of the appointment of the chief officer

for the Secretary of State to make the appointment, because it is the
highly significant appointment of a chief officer who has national
policing responsibilities. That is why the Home Secretary retains that
power of appointment. The local involvement already exists, and it is
expressed through the Mayor. I do not see what is added by the
introduction of a third level of de facto approval. The distinction
here is that the Mayor does not appoint the commissioner, so the Mayor
is effectively the local
consultee.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000287">&#160;</a>

			Column number: 469<a class="bkMark" name="Column469">&#160;</a>

questions of the Mayor’s office, but unfortunately those seem to
be retrospective questions. They certainly do not have any power to
influence decisions before they are taken, and they have very little
influence afterwards.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000294">&#160;</a>

that turns assembly members into mere bystanders and, as we have said,
paper tigers with absolutely no teeth. If we had been able to amend
clause 48, we would have given assembly members a scrutiny role over
the suspension of a commissioner and the oversight of that process. As
we have said in an earlier debate about police and crime commissioners
outside London, that would have given the panel influence and a
scrutiny role over the power to force chief officers to resign or
retire, and it would have put in place a process through which a case
could be made to the police and crime panel. That would have taken
place before any recommendations were made to the Secretary of
State.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000295">&#160;</a>

return to this area of scrutiny within the metropolis for further

listening to the representations of the wide body of people who have
serious misgivings about the proposed arrangements for scrutiny of the
Metropolitan police.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000296">&#160;</a>

continue to be the case. As for the hon. Gentleman’s wider
point, the powers of the police inquiry panel in London will almost
exactly mirror the general powers of the London assembly, in that it
will exercise a retrospective scrutiny of the Mayor’s decisions.
That is how the assembly works at the moment. There is no downgrading
in relation to the assembly powers. All we are doing is removing the
unnecessary tier of the MPA and ensuring a clearer line of democratic
accountability through the Mayor. We have had this discussion before

recommended that the Home Office establish a cross-departmental
steering group, including representatives from the Cabinet Office, to
co-ordinate planning and delivery. I wondered whether that had
happened. The Electoral Commission also wanted early engagement by the

turnout of 40 per cent. of the electorate in the force area is required
for a police and crime commissioner to be
elected.’.<p class="tabbed">The
amendment would introduce the concept of a threshold in the election.
An interesting argument can be made about thresholds, given what
happened yesterday in the House of Lords, where they clearly thought
that thresholds were important to a particular aspect of the Bill that
they were considering. I want to test the Minister’s opinions on
a threshold. What would he consider to be a good turnout? Going back to
an earlier debate, what are his views on encouraging people to vote in
the election? What will he do to discourage fringe or extremist
candidates from being
elected?<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000319">&#160;</a>

with your permission, Mr Benton, we can have something of a stand part
debate as part of our consideration of the amendment so that we can
find out how the Minister believes the supplementary vote system will
work and whether it will help to make a threshold unnecessary because
the system envisaged under the Bill will help to ensure that extremist
candidates are not elected, meaning that a threshold is unnecessary. Is
a threshold more unnecessary in a supplementary vote system or an
alternative vote system, as I note that the Liberal amendment that was
tabled related to the alternative vote system? Perhaps I will leave
that for our clause stand part debate, however, because I would like
the Minister to explain to us why he has preferred a supplementary vote
system to the alternative vote or first-past-the-post system. The
clause is very important, but we will stick at the moment to the issue
of the
threshold.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000320">&#160;</a>

Minister and the Home Secretary have dismissed the idea of extremist
candidates being elected as unlikely, saying, “Trust the
electorate” and so on. To a certain extent, I agree with that,
but I want to know what assessment the Minister has made of the
potential danger. What turnout does he expect? Does he believe that
there will be high turnout, that people will flock to the polls to do
their democratic duty and vote for police and crime commissioners? I am
not going to put it to a vote; I am just interested in the
Minister’s view. How do we intend to encourage participation?
That is my opening gambit. I particularly want to come back to the

                           </div>an election. A referendum is a one-off decision. If it is decided by
Parliament that there should be a threshold—there was much
debate about that in the referendums relating to devolution—and
the threshold is not reached, the change asked about in the referendum
does not happen. That is one issue, and I am not going into that
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000322">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
is an entirely different matter. The aim of the amendment is to set a
minimum turnout for an election that has to happen, because the
position has to be filled. The hon. Gentleman is yet again adding to
the cost of the proposals, just as he would with his policy for elected
police chairs. Now he is adding to the cost again, because if the
minimum threshold were not reached, there would have to be a rerun. His
amendment is silent about how that would happen. Is he suggesting that
if that turnout is not reached that there would be a rerun? What
happens if it is not reached on the second occasion? He is not saying
anything about that. It is a nonsensical amendment. No other election
for office in this country has a minimum turnout requirement. I cannot
believe he is serious about seeking to set a threshold, or that he has
thought about it very hard. It is clearly a nonsense.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000323">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Of course we
would like to ensure a high turnout for the election to this office. I
believe there will be considerable local public interest in it, just as
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would want to ensure a high turnout
for his directly elected chairs of police
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000324">&#160;</a>

with what I am minded to do on Report, in the Minister’s
suggestion that thresholds for elections to office are different from
thresholds for referendums about whether a change should be introduced.
That might be an interesting argument to explore on Report, on the
lines put by the hon. Member for Edinburgh West in his amendment on a
referendum in each local area to determine whether police and crime
commissioners should actually go ahead. That amendment was withdrawn,
but it may be an issue we return to on

happening. It has happened on numerous occasions and will no doubt
happen again. I do not want to delay the Committee. The Minister was
silent on the issue of how we will encourage participation. He was
silent on concerns about extremists or fringe candidates being elected
to this important post. It is a concern; many people say it is an issue
for them. We should not just dismiss that, we should reflect on it. One
of the ways of dealing with that would be through a threshold. I agree
with the Minister. I do not think a threshold is appropriate, but it is
appropriate to consider

important. The Minister will be enthralled—no doubt he will have
spent many hours considering the different models of election for this
particular proposal. But there must be a reason why the supplementary
vote has been chosen.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000333">&#160;</a>

patience of the hon. Member for Kenilworth and Southam finally wore
out, the hon. Member for Edinburgh West obviously saw his amendment
with respect to the alternative vote system withdrawn. The amendment
dealt with the alternative vote system. The hon. Gentleman went to
great lengths to write a couple of amendments, plus a new schedule,
which lay out a completely different electoral system. Unless the hon.
Gentleman did it for fun, thinking, “I know, I’ll make
this up, put it on the table and see what happens—no I
won’t, I’ll withdraw it”, I presume he thought
that it might be a better system for electing a police and crime
commissioner.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000334">&#160;</a>

perfectly proper for us all to say to the Minister, how does the
supplementary vote system work? Why is it better than the alternative
vote system? Why did the Minister discard first past the post? Did he
discard first past the post because it is undemocratic—which
would be difficult for any of us to say—or because he was
worried about particular people being elected? I think we need to hear
from the Minister for at least a few minutes. This is a very important

that the Minister could have chosen? For example, why does he think
that it is better than the alternative vote? Before I respond I want to
hear the Minister. It is also important that the Minister lays out what
happens under the supplementary vote system so that all of us properly
understand the differences between the electoral systems and can
understand why that system will lead to a better process in the
election of a police and crime commissioner. I leave the matter at
that, but I shall want to respond to what the Minister has to

Gentleman’s game and getting into a long debate about electoral
systems. It is quite straightforward: the supplementary vote system
already exists in the London mayoral elections and in elections for all
other directly elected mayors in England, which is why it is
appropriate to use it in relation to police and crime commissioners.
The Mayor who will have the responsibility in London is elected under
that system. There is no need for me to describe it, because it is
already in use, whereas the alternative vote system is
not.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000337">&#160;</a>

to justify the decisions that he has made and the policies that he is
pursuing. I respect that, and I think that that is good; the Minister
engages in the debate. However, now is the first time that I have felt
that he has failed to engage in the

am not playing games ; I am just anxious. I think people have a right
to know why the supplementary vote is preferable, other than a
statement saying, “As a couple of systems use it, it will be
used for police and crime commissioners”, and why the
alternative vote system, which would have been proposed by the hon.
Member for Edinburgh West, was dismissed. Why did the Minister feel
that first-past-the-post was not appropriate? With due respect to the
Minister, I think there is a need for a bit more of an explanation than
saying, “A couple of other elections do it, and we do not think
that AV is the right system” and then sitting down—it is
quite an important
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000339">&#160;</a>

mayors.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000341">&#160;</a>

have already said that the AV system does not exist for any of our

decision on an issue of principle, and it will be decided by the
people. I think the system would be wrong, and it would be a system
that is different to the one that is used in London. If we were to set
that up, we would have to change the existing system in London. I have
detect no public demand for that, so the straightforward and logical
thing to do is simply to use the same voting system that exists for
London. I am not sure that the hon. Member for Gedling is making a case
against that, but if he is, let’s hear

crime plan. The Government are clear that that is the correct balance.
Although the police and crime plan will be the embodiment of the
commissioner’s manifesto pledges, and so should not be altered
by anyone other than the elected commissioner, chief officer
appointments and dismissals and precept setting are essential functions
that may have to be discharged in the elected commissioner’s
absence. Of course, in London at the moment, it is possible for senior
people—in this case, the chief officer—to be absent for a
significant period, but that could also apply in relation to an elected
person.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000350">&#160;</a>

than to say why it was originally in the Bill—why varying the
police and crime plan would not be an appropriate function for an
acting commissioner. The Minister changed his mind, so that an acting
commissioner cannot issue or vary a police and crime plan, but can sack
a chief constable. I find that strange. Admittedly, the acting
commissioner can be there only for a maximum period of six
months—if I have got that wrong, the Minister will correct
me—but even in a six-month period, there may be a good reason to
vary a police and crime
plan.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000352">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given
the Minister’s earlier desire to ensure that a police and crime
plan could be varied at any time—to have flexibility, localism
and not get people trapped in bureaucracy—I wonder why an acting
commissioner cannot vary the plan but, fresh into the job, can sack a
chief constable or ask them to resign or, indeed, set a precept. It
seems odd that an acting commissioner can do the things that in most
people’s eyes are more serious, yet they cannot do the things
that might be regarded as less serious. I want a more in-depth
explanation from the Minister. The acting commissioner, if he suspends
the chief constable, will presumably be subject to the normal processes
and procedures as an ordinary police and crime
commissioner.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000353">&#160;</a>

it might be better for them not to appoint or sack a new chief
constable, but perhaps wait for a new police and crime commissioner. Is
there flexibility so that the powers would be exercisable only if the
post was moving towards six months, but not exercisable if there were a
small amount of time? Some clarification would be

                           </strong> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman’s
intention in probing this issue. It was our original view that the
acting commissioner would not be able to do these things, so the
exceptions were made for the appointment, suspension and removal of the
chief constable and for the setting of the precept. Following
representations and when we reflected further on the matter, however,
we appreciated that these functions are absolutely vital to the
operation of the force. They must be discharged if the business of
governance is not to grind to a halt. A police force needs to have a
chief officer. The hon. Gentleman is correct that the maximum period is
six months. That is a long period for these things not to be able to
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000355">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
a longer-term document, the police and crime plan is fundamental to the
mandate of the elected commissioner. These other functions have to be
exercised. Saying that they could not be exercised would result in a
paralysis in the governance of the force. That would not be desirable,
so it is important that the acting commissioner is able, if necessary,
to fulfil
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000356">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have no doubt that if, for instance, the commissioner was incapacitated
or unwell and it was towards the end of the recuperation period and
they were about to return, an acting commissioner would not make a
vital decision over an appointment unless it was absolutely necessary,
knowing that the suspended person may come back. There may be other
decisions that have to be made because of the timetable—precept
setting is a very good example. As the hon. Gentleman knows, that goes
to a timetable and decisions have to be made by certain periods. That
decision may not be avoidable, so that is why those powers are
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000357">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I understand the Minister’s point on the
necessity for the force to be able to carry on and that a block cannot
be put on everything, because important decisions will have to be made.
To be fair, issuing the precept may be one example. The Minister
discussed the PCC being incapacitated and the acting commissioner not
being expected to take decisions if the PCC was expected back within a
couple of months. Is that just an expression of hope? If an acting
commissioner is there for only a couple of months, they could sack a
chief constable and employ a new one. I am conscious that it is for six
months and the necessity of the force being able to carry on, but I
worry that, if it is only a month or two interregnum, the Minister may
want a little more control over what is happening, rather than just
saying, “Well, you wouldn’t expect a decision of that
magnitude to be made in those
circumstances.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000358">&#160;</a>

incapacitation of the elected commissioner could happen part way
through an appointment process. The PCP may have approved the
appointment, but it needs the PCC to make the appointment. Under what
we previously proposed, that would not have been possible. It is a good
example of where an acting commissioner should be able to appoint the
chief constable, because it is clearly the wish of his predecessor and
the panel had agreed it. Otherwise, six months might lapse before that
could take place. We need practical arrangements. We need not be
concerned about the operation of this, because we have the scrutiny of
the PCP at all
times.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000359">&#160;</a>

the police authority membership would need to be resigned. I would
welcome some clarification on why that role has been singled
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000367">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As my hon. Friend notes, the Bill will require a
police authority member to resign from the post if wishing to stand as
a police and crime commissioner—in the same way as a police
officer, a judge or a civil servant must—because we look to the
police authorities to continue overseeing policing during the
transition to police and crime commissioners. They will need to be
fully focused on that task, especially providing local political
leadership in driving value for money. That and the transition process
are particularly important for police authorities in the run-up to 2012
and the elections, and we would be concerned if police authority
members spent much of their time
campaigning.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000368">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
provision does not prevent any individual from standing; it merely
requires people to resign from their role—a role that brings
with it an allowance, paid for from public funds. I therefore think the
proposition is reasonable. I hope that, on reflection, my hon. Friend
will
agree.<a class="bkMark" name="11020838000369">&#160;</a>
