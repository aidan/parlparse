</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): On a point of order, Mr. Hood. This is the third time that I have been prepared to move amendment No. 297. I do not know whether other hon. Members heard on Radio 4 this morning that the Deputy Prime Minister is about to make an announcement about the United Kingdom having already achieved its Kyoto target of a 12.5 per cent. reduction in CO2. As many of the clauses that we are about to discuss relate directly to environmental controls, have you had any indication that the Minister wishes to make a statement this morning on that issue?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have had no indication from the Deputy Prime Minister about any announcement that he is about to make. It is not a matter for the Chair and not a valid point of order.
<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Guidance on social and environmental matters in relation to gas</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 297, in page 6, line 8, after ``contribution'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>, which in any event will not increase costs by more than 2.5 per cent.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 134, in page 6, line 9, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(1A) In preparing guidance under this section, the Secretary of State shall ensure that such guidance does not impose significant financial implications for consumers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 298, in clause 13, page 8, line 44, after ``contribution'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>, which in any event will not increase costs by more than 2.5 per cent.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 314, in clause 13, page 8, line 45, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(1A) In preparing guidance under this section, the Secretary of State shall ensure that such guidance does not impose significant financial implication for consumers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I was hoping for an intervention from a Minister, because it is difficult for myself and my hon. Friends to stay in order and talk about matters relating to the Bill in a fast-changing situation.
<P>
The amendments would place controls on the amount that would be spent by the authority in using its licence fees and put a check on the cost that the clauses would add to electricity and gas bills.
<P>
The figure of 2.5 per cent. may seem strange, and in many ways it is too high a figure. When Parliament was considering a tax on normal domestic fuel, the previous Government first announced that it would put a full 15 per cent. value added tax on it. In the previous Parliament there was a considerable rebellion among Conservative Members and in the end Parliament decided not to give permission for the second 7.5 per cent. increase, so VAT was limited to 7.5 per cent.
<P>
When this Government came to power, 7.5 per cent. VAT was already levied on domestic fuel. One of their achievements, as they would describe it, was to reduce that to 5 per cent. They made a great deal of noise about it. Indeed, if Ministers are challenged about keeping prices down, they constantly say ``Ah, but we reduced VAT on fuel to the lowest possible level at 5 per cent.''
<P>
The amendments would simply limit the authority's ability to fiddle about with environment and social matters and reduce the amount by which they can increase prices to the consumer by 2.5 per cent. They are a signal that we are trying to keep prices down for consumers. The Government have clearly decided that they want mechanisms in place that allow the authority to fiddle around on the margins, transferring funds from better-off consumers to less well-off consumers, and the Bill should contain a limit to how much they can do that. As I read the Bill, it gives the authority an unlimited and unfettered power to change the amount that can be transferred from one set of people to another.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): The amendments and the clause relate to social and environmental guidance that will be issued by the Secretary of State and to which the regulator must have regard.
<P>
I shall begin by quoting from a recent, and critical, Electricity Association parliamentary briefing. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the light of recent events—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
by which it means the withdrawal from the Bill of telecoms and water—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the electricity industry believes that there is a strong case for a much simpler Energy Utilities Bill concentrating only on those provisions necessary to implement the new electricity trading arrangements, business separation and essential reforms of regulatory structure.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Like the telecoms and water industries, the electricity industry is demanding that, apart from minimal elements, its segments be removed from the Bill. The brief continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Other provisions of the Bill go well beyond the broad objectives of regulatory stability, fairness and accountability which the Government earlier set itself to seek. As drafted these provisions have the potential to destabilise the regulatory regime and this underlines the case for a fundamental review of the broader provisions of the Bill including the penalties regime, the powers of the regulators, and social and enviornmental guidance.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is that last element that we are debating this morning. That is a fairly damning indictment of the Bill, and it echoes criticisms made by the telecommunications and water industries.
<P>
An Electricity Association press release, issued on 7 March, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As the Utilities Bill returns to the House of Commons Standing Committee  to be shorn of its telecoms and water provisions, the Electricity Association is seeking a meeting with DTI Ministers to raise industry concerns about ``over-regulation'' in some of the Bill's remaning measures.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Has such a meeting been held, and if not, when will it be held? Has the meeting even been scheduled, and if not, why not?
<P>
The amendment, which would add to the clause a phrase with which the Minister should be familiar, would ensure that guidance issued by the Secretary of State on social and environmental matters does not impose significant financial implications for consumers.
<P>
The passing on of costs associated with the regulatory offices and their staff to the consumer has been our constant worry. We have discussed in detail the likely level of those costs in the light of the expansionist tendencies, to which the regulators are not immune, of most state organisations. However, it is not merely the administration costs suffered by the utilities in responding to requests for information and other administrative compliance matters that will be passed on to consumers. The largest extra cost to the consumer will arise from the cost to the utilities of implementing the requirement set out in guidances, which will be issued by the Secretary of State to the regulatory authority. Those guidances are important because, as the Bill states,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Authority shall, in carrying out its functions ... have regard to
guidances issued by the Secretary of State.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The draft guidance to the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Authority should have regard to the Government's objective of improving the health of everyone.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems a broad target for utility companies to meet. So far as the authority is concerned, those so-called guidances will amount to more than an indication of one or two factors. In effect, they will be orders, which the regulatory authorities will try to turn into guidances, and which they will then have to turn into specific licence conditions or regulations for the utility companies. The requirement on the authority to have regard to the Government's objective of improving everyone's health is very broad. I dread to think what effect it will have on the licence conditions of the electricity and gas companies.
<P>
The draft guidance reflects the rhetoric of the Government's social policy agenda. They clearly expect their social objectives to be addressed through the delivery mechanisms of the private sector utility companies and their competitors. The electricity industry does not object to the merging of the two regulators into Ofgem, the consumer council being one body for both industries or the new electricity trading arrangements. In fact, it is positively in favour of NETA, as are Conservative Members. What it objects to is the broader policy of seeking to make the utilities deliver the Government's social and environmental agenda.
<P>
However worthy the Government's objectives may be, this is not the correct delivery mechanism to achieve them. The wording of the guidance is vague and uncertain. Paragraph 5.2, on page 5, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government is committed to the creation of a fairer society, through social progress which recognises the needs of everyone. To this end it has set five broad objectives. The task of regulating the energy sector appears to the Government to be relevant to three of these.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Thank goodness that it is only three. They are:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to tackle poverty and social exclusion;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to improve the health of the population overall;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to reduce the proportion of unfit housing stock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is staggering that the utility companies should be given such broad targets. I do not know why the Government did not add ``to end world hunger''. [Hon. Members: ``Hear, hear.''] Labour Members seem to think that that would be worthy of inclusion in the guidance. Perhaps they would also include ``end world famine'', ``bring about world peace'' and ``end all known diseases''. Given that the utilities are faced with such open and wide guidances, it stretches credibility to the limit for the Minister to claim that the Bill increases the certainty of regulation.
<P>
The CBI is not clear about what it all means, which is why it has said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We look forward to the opportunity to comment on the development of this guidance, and feel that it is important that it is subject to affirmative procedure, to ensure all parties are clear about the full implications of the interaction between social and environmental guidance and the primary duty.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, the primary duty is to protect the interests of consumers. It will be difficult for the utility companies to deliver world peace and the end of all known diseases—or, more seriously, the three objectives set out on page 5 of the draft guidance—while at the same time keeping control of prices and minimising costs to the consumer.
<P>
Last week, Ofgem issued its social action plan, which reflects much of what is in the Government's draft guidance. The press release that accompanies the plan states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A plan of action which Ofgem will undertake with others to tackle fuel poverty is published today, following wide consultation with consumer groups, industry and government.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So Ofgem has already consulted widely to produce the plan—which is a plan, not a draft plan. The Government's guidance is still in draft. It has still to be consulted on, let alone laid before Parliament, as required by subsection (5), after which there must be a period of 40 days during which it can be objected to. The Bill is still a Bill—it has not yet passed through the Committee, let alone received Royal Assent, and will not survive the Committee in its current form, even though the telecoms and water sections have been excised.
<P>
Ofgem appears, yet again, to be acting as a law unto itself. That is not surprising; it is in the nature of such organisations when they are given such wide remits. I am concerned about the cost implications of the extent of what will ultimately be required of utilities by Ofgem. Page 2 of its press release states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Ofgem has also appointed a 10 member review panel bringing together consumer groups, government and representatives of the energy and banking industries. Regular reports on progress against the plan will also be published.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The press release goes on to quote Callum McCarthy, the Director General of Gas and Electricity Markets, who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are many customers who either because of low income or poor housing find it difficult to afford heat and light for their homes. This is a big and complex problem, which requires many parts of government and the industry to contribute to solutions. Through the Social Action Plan Ofgem will concentrate on taking effective action to tackle this problem to make a difference for low income and disadvantaged customers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those words will have far reaching financial implications.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The concern about such implications was discussed in the Green Paper, which stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If the Government concludes that its social and environmental policy objectives require action which would have significant financial implications for consumers or for the regulated companies, such action should be taken forward by means of new, specific provision in primary or secondary legislation rather than through guidance to the regulators.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have used some of that clear wording in amendments Nos. 134, 314 and what was amendment No. 135, which related to the telecommunications industry and has been withdrawn. The amendments would add to the subsection enabling the Secretary of State to issue guidance the provision that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In preparing guidance under this section, the Secretary of State shall ensure that such guidance does not impose significant financial implications for consumers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That final phrase has been lifted word for word from the Government's Green Paper. I have every confidence, therefore, that the Minister will accept the amendments. If he does not, he will expose yet again the fact that the Government do not care about the financial implications of the Bill, despite the fact that the Green Paper—and other documents published during the preparation of the Bill—expressed concern about financial implications.
<P>
The guidance says that one objective should be to improve the health of everyone. If that does not have significant financial implications for consumers, I do not know what does. Consequently, such objectives—which the Government seek to place on the regulators, who would then pass them to the utilities—should be made through primary or secondary legislation, rather than through guidance issued to the regulator. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on those points.

<P>

<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> I want to stress that all decisions as to when and how the policies and objectives are realised will be taken by the authority. It will be the authority's decisions that will have the potential to increase costs for consumers or for regulated companies. The guidance will neither increase nor impose costs.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe will meet representatives of the Electricity Association at lunchtime today. I have met its representatives at least as many times as I have met representatives of consumer bodies over the past fews years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> What, none?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> On the contrary, I have encountered the Electricity Association on a great many occasions in one venue or another. Callum McCarthy and Ofgem have been very sensible in bringing together representatives of the various key sectors to formulate how best to tackle such problems as fuel poverty, which blight so many lives and communities.
<P>
The only way in which the Secretary of State would be able to comply with the amendments would be to omit all policies and objectives, the attainment of which could conceivably increase costs by more than 2.5 per cent. or have significant financial implications for consumers. The amendments would thus curtail the scope of the guidance to the point at which it would barely be worth the paper that it was written on. They would undermine the purpose of the guidance and prevent the Government from putting the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority in a position to consider and give due weight to all the social and environmental policies relevant to its statutory functions. The existence of the guidance makes it impossible to place an artificial cap on the costs that could result from actions that the authority took on the policies and objectives that it contains. For those reasons, I urge the Committee to reject amendments Nos. 297, 134, 298 and 314.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am delighted that the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe will meet the Electricity Association at lunchtime today, and I hope that she will take its concerns seriously. With the exception of the procedural points about the appearance of the White Paper on communications in October, and the water Bill, which will be published later this year, the Electricity Association's concerns are not fundamentally different from those of the telecommunications and water industries. Those concerns are of greater importance to the industries than the procedural points or the need to go through the regulatory change twice. On Tuesday, the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs acknowledged the procedural points and the fundamental issues that had been raised about the Bill's regulatory framework.
<P>
I am concerned about the Minister's response to the amendments. He said that they would curtail the scope of the guidance and that that would mean that they were hardly worth the paper that they were written on. The requirement that the authority should have regard for the financial implications on consumers was lifted word for word from the Green Paper. We are concerned that the Minister's response to the guidance is an admission that it will have significant financial implications for the utility companies and consumers.
<P>
The social and environmental objectives are worthy, but the way in which they will be implemented will foist a significant financial burden on consumers—they will involve a form of stealth taxation. If the Government want to implement social objectives that will improve people's health, they should do so through the normal parliamentary methods—they should introduce higher levels of taxation and spend that money on their social programmes. They should not insist that the regulators change the conditions of the utility companies' licences, forcing those companies to implement social programmes and pass on associated costs to consumers through higher electricity charges.
<P>
The Minister said that it would be impossible to impose an artificial cap on the associated 2.5 per cent. expenditure. That is an admission that all the concerns that we raised in previous sittings were right. The proposals mean that the expenditure of the regulatory authorities and the utility companies will be significant and will affect the Bill's implementation. The Minister should consider the situation carefully. I shall press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am rather surprised by the Minister's comments. We are trying to get used to the signals that are sent out by the Government Front-Bench team. In a statement about a week ago, the Minister said that the Government were taking careful note of the comments of the telecommunication operators. The way in which he said it suggested to me that the Government were about to make a U-turn in their telecommunications policy, and that proved to be right. His comments this morning on meeting the Electricity Association were not so easy to read. Although we have considered much of the Bill, the Minister has belatedly said that he is willing to speak to the Electricity Association about its specific concerns. It is not clear whether the amendments will be worth the paper that they are written on by this afternoon's sitting. They, too, may amend clauses that will disappear.
<P>
We have had a short but useful debate, during which we have highlighted the fact that the Government said that the requirements and guidance that will apply to the authority may involve its taxing the general consumer by more than 2.5 per cent. That is an artificial and—I believe—a high level. Key meters might cost the general consumer more in order to allow those affected by fuel poverty to be able to budget for their electricity and gas more easily. Opposition Members believe that that is an appropriate mechanism, or at least not an inappropriate one.
<P>
In most cases, companies could be persuaded that a cross-subsidy was in their commercial interests. The worst cross-subsidy to affect consumers is the payment of artificially high bills because other people are not paying theirs at all. Such people are either unwilling to pay or are genuinely unable to do so. There is no point in utilities chasing people who have no money; one cannot get blood out of stone. I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) said that he would press the matter to a vote, because it will mean Government Members announcing that they believe in stealth taxes on electricity and gas. If the clauses are still in the Bill when the Committee returns for its afternoon sitting, we will have them—although it is not parliamentary language—by the short and curlies. Their opponents will certainly have ammunition for their election addresses, when the time comes, in relation to stealth taxes and what the Labour Government are willing to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunnell:</B> I did not intend to speak in this debate. If there is to be a vote, however, it is appropriate for me to say that I shall not support the amendments, which are entirely misconceived.
<P>
I am taking part in an Industry and Parliament Trust fellowship, with which the Electricity Association has been exceptionally generous and helpful. I valued that contact. I was also interested to receive its briefing, although I think that it is wrong. It is not wrong from the industry's point of view, because it represents producers in electricity supply and generation. It is doing exactly what it is supposed to do, and not providing the Committee with the full, rounded picture. Conservative Members are completely wrong to pursue that line of argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman not read the Green Paper? Does he not see that the phrase used in the amendment is lifted, word for word, from that Green Paper, which sets out the broad policy thrust of the Bill? To include it in an amendment therefore seems perfectly reasonable. Not to support an amendment that would incorporate the wording of the Green Paper in the Bill seems extraordinary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I have an advantage that Labour Members and, apparently, Conservative Members do not have: I was not the publisher of that advice and paper, and I am not committed to its content. Labour Members may feel that they msut die in the ditch for it, although I gather that that is not going to happen. Conservative Members apparently want to die in the ditch for it. Liberal Democrats do not have to die in that ditch.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I think that the Liberal Democrat document was called ``Costing the Earth''. Brian Ellis, the Liberal Democrat candidate who stood against me at the election, who is now Liberal Democrat leader of Weymouth and Portland district council, said clearly—clarity is what we seek from the Government and from Liberal Democrats today—that, as a minimum, the full VAT should be paid on domestic fuel. I know that people have changed their minds since then, but I wonder where the Liberal Democrats now stand on how much extra they believe people should pay for environmental and social reasons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. It is the second time that he has tried to get free from me advice that I have offered to sell to him. I published the Liberal Democrat policy paper on energy in September last year. I repeat my offer to sell it to him; then he will know the answers to his questions.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that that document is in the Library. It is his document. I should have thought that he would want to tell the Committee about it for free, giving us the benefit of the advice in it. I am sorry that he feels that he should declare a financial interest in it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Unlike Conservative Members, I am a late convert to market forces, but I remain a convert.
<P>
To deal with the specifics, it is more important to pay some attention to the needs of consumers, particularly the poorest, and to the needs of the planet, rather than to the profits and convenience of those who supply electricity. Not only should the amendments be resisted, but later amendments in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker) are much to be supported. We want things to move in exactly the opposite direction to that proposed in the amendments before us.
<P>
As to the earlier point that the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) made about the alleged announcement that the United Kingdom has already achieved its 12.5 per cent. carbon reduction target, he knows—and I know—that that is baloney and that there is a great deal more to be done. I am sure that he is no more taken in by that piece of Labour spin doctoring than he is by all the other pieces that he has commented on so eloquently. I shall certainly vote against the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I think that we are about to come to a vote on the amendment; I am seeking guidance from my hon. Friends. I am happy to seek to withdraw my amendment, but I hope that we can vote on amendment No. 134, in order to record our extreme concern. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 291, in page 6, line 8, leave out ``social or''.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> with this we may take the following amendments: No. 292, in page 6, line 8, leave out ``or environmental''.
<P>
No. 293, in clause 13, page 8, line 44, leave out ``social or''.
<P>
No. 294, in page 8, line 44, leave out ``or environmental''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> These are probing amendments, to enable us to discuss the conflict between social and environmental issues. We want the Government to tell us how they expect the authority to deal with the serious issues of, for instance, an elderly fuel-poor invalid. He may have social qualities that give him lower fuel bills, but he will be clobbered from the other side because, environmentally, the authority is trying to achieve a reduction in the use of gas and electricity.
<P>
Some models have demonstrated that a tax of 10, 20 or 30 per cent. on the use of fuel is insufficient to persuade people to change their behaviour. That is why a carbon tax is an extraordinarily dangerous route. The authority does not have a limit of 2.5 per cent. and may decide that the only way to stop people using more electricity and gas is to impose enormous hidden taxes on consumers in general, but at the same time it will have a social requirement to keep down the fuel bills of the four groups of people listed in the Bill.
<P>
The amendments simply illustrate the dichotomy that the authority is likely to face. We want to hear from Ministers what they expect the authority to do when faced with impossible requirements. The Government said that Parliament would require ``social or environmental policies'', but those may clash. We need to know which will have priority and whether the authority will be breaking the law if it puts up general bills for environmental reasons when social reasons require them to be reduced.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> As the draft guidance that we have already published makes clear, the Government's intention is that utility regulation should make an appropriate contribution to the attainment of sustainable development, which has three limbs: economic, social and environmental. We have limited the field of guidance to the latter two because we do not want to breach the fundamental principle that economic regulation should be conducted by the regulators at arm's length from the Government. Further to restrict the scope of the guidance, whether by omitting its social or its environmental dimension, would remove the formal statutory means whereby utility regulation can contribute to an integrated policy embracing all the limbs of sustainable development. Moreover, as drafted, the provisions serve to make it clear that it is for elected Members and Ministers to set the social and environmental aims of policy to which utility regulators are to have regard. The amendments would prevent the Bill from giving that clarification. It is important to have provision for both social and environmental guidance.
<P>
If all four amendments were accepted, the guidance to the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority could cover any policy that the Secretary of State wished to include. It hardly needs saying that so vague a provision, which would not preclude guidance on economic matters, could only increase uncertainty to the detriment of both industry and consumers.
<P>
I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I think that I said at the outset that I did not intend to press the amendments to a vote. The Minister is right in saying that they are contradictory and would cause confusion in the clause, but the Government have not explained the direction of the authority. I am grateful to the Minister for suggesting that this may be the wrong place in which to impose some control, because he is saying effectively that Parliament will provide the guidance and explain the social and environmental policies to the authority. To the extent that the Government will tell the authority where the priorities lie and whether the old, the sick and the fuel-poor should receive any benefit from the Bill, because the Treasury wants to take large amounts of carbon tax, they show a certain amount of honesty. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 241, in page 6, line 9, after ``policies'', insert

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> One of the amendments relates to clause 9, and the other to clause 13. They move in the opposite direction to those tabled by Conservative Members.
<P>
In reply to the previous debate, the Minister said that setting the policy framework for the regulatory system was a matter for Ministers and Parliament. Clearly, that is right. That was part of his defence of the Bill, and refutation of the amendments. I agree with him that Ministers and Parliament should set the policy framework. We need to establish the nature of that framework and not to be left with unspecific and open-ended set of guidance which, as he said, could be used for a variety of purposes, on the whim of successive Secretaries of State. Opposition Members acknowledge that the current Secretary of State is entirely sensible, and would never do anything random or silly, but the Bill would apply to successive Secretaries of State, and successive ministerial teams, not all of whom will be imbued with the same generosity of spirit, intelligence quotient and desire for the common good.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman wants to convince hon. Members with his arguments but, for the convenience of the Committee, will he tell us whether his peerage is in the post?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I accept the hon. Gentleman's intervention in the spirit in which it was made. I have not heard whether my peerage is in the post, and do not expect to do so in future.
<P>
The Minister often appeals to the assumption of innate good sense on the part of Secretaries of State and those who will be given powers. It is assumed that they are such reasonable people that it is unnecessary to provide further instructions. It was interesting and instructive that he did not deploy that argument when dealing with the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for South Dorset. He said that they would give a future Secretary of State, who did not have good will to all men in his or her heart, the ability to do all kinds of things in the economic sphere. He was wide-ranging on the threat that the amendments posed to the industry and, more broadly, the universe.
<P>
 I accept everything that the Minister said on those amendments, but will he go further and be prepared for a more specific Bill? The Committee should reclaim from the Minister and Secretary of State some of the discretion on how social and environmental guidelines will be interpreted in the future. In relation to the environmental aspect of the regulatory authority, there should be a requirement to have regard to the Government's expressed intentions about the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. It may not be the most popular suggestion from the Minister's point of view, but it would be sensible if the Government built that goal into the provisions. That should be done not only because it is the Government's policy but because it is a highly desirable policy in its own right that will be difficult to achieve. Previously, the absence of such guidance meant that regulators were reluctant to support the goal or to try to achieve it.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government want to achieve a desirable target that has national and international strategic importance. There is no divide, so far as I am aware, between Departments, or between Government Front Benchers and Back Benchers, over the target's desirability. The previous regulatory framework was not able to deliver that objective because the legislation was not sufficiently clear. Various regulators chose to interpret their duties in different ways, and some specifically rejected the idea of moving in that direction. The Bill should give clear guidance to the regulators and to subsequent Secretaries of State and Governments.
<P>
It may be useful to examine one of the defences that the Government may use in this context. They might argue that they have produced draft guidance and that nothing more specific is needed. Paragraph 3.3 of that guidance states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>economic regulation should be conducted in a way which is alert to the Government's wider social and environmental goals—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
so far, so good—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and where possible supportive of them.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The document is only a draft, and the phrase ``where possible'' may be removed from the final version. Has the Minister received any representations in that regard?
<P>
This desirable—perhaps essential—national strategic policy should be supported and reinforced wherever possible. Previously, the absence of clear guidance made that goal more difficult to achieve. The draft guidance might be regarded as the fallback position on which the Government might pin their defence of the current wording. However, the draft guidance states only that ``where possible'' the regulatory system should be supportive of those essential policy guidelines. The amendment would further the national interest and help the Government to achieve their goals.
<P>
During our debate on amendment No. 291, we talked about the debate about whether various carbon dioxide emission limits would be met by 2010. The second and third-hand reports that I have heard of what was or was not said in that regard are contradictory, but whatever the time scale or level of achievement, the relevant figure is 12.5 per cent.—that figure was agreed internationally after the Kyoto conference. The 20 per cent. figure was described by the Prime Minister as a clear manifesto commitment.
<P>
We can dance on the head of a pin and discuss what a clear manifesto commitment means, or does not mean, and all kinds of substitute wordings have been used. This is an opportunity for the Government to empower the regulatory authorities to have regard to a clear manifesto commitment. Most objective and professional observers of the environmental and energy scene would say that that 12.5 per cent. will be difficult to achieve—let alone that it has already been achieved—and that without significant new policy initiatives 20 per cent. will be very hard to achieve. The Government should therefore take every possible opportunity to drive their policy forward in the direction in which they have said that they want it to go.
<P>
I hope that I have demonstrated that the amendment is not only in accordance with the Government's policy, but necessary in order to achieve the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions that are required nationally. Wider issues are at stake than the profits and convenience of producers.
<P>
Much of this country's environmental policy is based on achieving specific targets, with the current time horizon of 2010. It is inevitable—and highly desirable—that as each decade rolls forward those targets will increase in severity. The 2010 target is not a one-off event, but the first step up a long staircase. In setting the legislative framework, the Government should put in place provisions such as those suggested by the amendment. By doing so, they would not only meet a manifesto commitment but place the industry in a favourable long-term position to meet the subsequent international targets that will be set for 2015, 2020 and so on.
<P>
The amendment should not be seen as a penal imposition on the energy industry, but a signal for the future, which would take it in the right direction and allow it to plan in a more strategic and long-term way than merely taking account of what has to be achieved by 2010. The industry's investment timetables and time horizons already stretch well beyond that year. One has only to consider what is to replace the dying and defunct nuclear industry to realise that decisions that are taken now will affect power generation in 20, 30 and 40 years' time. This is not merely a question of meeting a manifesto commitment or achieving a target by 2010; it is also about sending a clear, long-term signal on investment strategy in the energy industry. I hope that the amendment will find favour with the Government.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) for the amendment, which gives us the opportunity to signal the great importance that Labour, Liberal and, I am sure, Government members of the Committee, attach to environmental sustainability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Government members?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Did I say that? I must be overtired.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> No. I have already given the hon. Gentleman enough scope to have fun at the Government's expense.
<P>
I thank the hon. Member for Hazel Grove for describing exactly the excellent qualities of my right hon. Friend the Minister. I take it that he was referring to her, rather than to the Secretary of State. He, too, is a sensible person.
<P>
The amendment would give the statutory guidance to the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority the specific focus of environmental targets and, more specifically, the Government's domestic target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. by 2010. I recognise that the target of reducing this country's carbon dioxide emissions is extremely important, but I resist the attempt to make a specific reference to it in clauses 9 and 13 in the way suggested in the amendments.
<P>
The issue is not our commitment to achieving reductions but how that commitment is best integrated with our social and environmental objectives within the overall aim of achieving sustainable development. Elsewhere in the House I have heard Liberal Members extolling the Government's attempts to ensure that prices of other commodities in the rural areas do not go through the roof. I know that they are past masters at running with the hounds and the hares, but they cannot have it both ways. The right way for the hon. Member for Hazel Grove to express his views about the way in which the guidance treats the emissions reduction target is to respond to our consultation on the draft guidance that we published on 7 February.
<P>
It is for Ministers to determine what the guidance should say. Ministers are accountable to Parliament for that—we have provided for either House of Parliament to be able to vote down the guidance—just as they are accountable more generally to Parliament for social and enviornmental policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I was hoping that the Minister might address one of the points raised by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove about the Government's nuclear power policy. It is clear that in 2012 we shall meet our Kyoto target for CO2 emissions, and possibly even the Deputy Prime Minister's target, but once the nuclear power stations begin to be decommissioned, the CO2 emissions from electricity generation will soar. What is the Government's policy on replacing decommissioned nuclear power stations?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> There has been considerable discussion about that, and I have made my views about it very clear. There is a real dilemma about how we replace the huge tranches of electricity currently generated by nuclear power stations. It is a problem not simply for this Government but for Governments around the world. Indeed, some countries depend much more on nuclear power than we do—France, for example. This group of amendments is not the right place to discuss that important policy. I know that it was a barbed intervention, aimed perhaps at extracting information not only from the Government but also from the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. It is one of those issues that are all too frequently ignored or swept under the carpet. We would have to cover the nation in windmills to generate the amount of electricity generated by some of the bigger nuclear plants in this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> No, I shall not give way. I have said enough on the matter.
<P>
The amendments are over-presciptive. Paragraph 6.2 of the draft statutory guidance to GEMA refers both to the domestic objective of reducing carbon dioxide emissions and to the Government's Kyoto commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For those reasons I am opposed to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Minister for his kind tone, but I do not feel that he has responded satisfactorily to my points. However, he has given us the opportunity to focus on the need for a longer-term UK energy policy, including the issues that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton raised with him. Those are significant issues that must be faced, but probably not in the context of the amendment. The amendments would achieve a number of objectives that seem to be consistent with the Government's stated policy, as well as the further objective of setting a framework for the future beyond 2010.
<P>
One of our problems is that even such a simple-sounding concept as the interest of the consumer has short-term, middle-term and long-term elements, and different elements of policy may be required to protect the consumer in each case. One must consider what the investment policy for electricity generation should be for the long-term protection of the consumer: the matter that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton raised, to which the Minister responded.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
By sending out small signals in the Bill, the Government and Parliament can affect the outcomes of decisions that will be taken in the next five or 10 years. Consideration of previous legislation has shown that it is often the unitended long-term consequences of such regulatory activity that lead to profound structural changes. The Government might claim that they have achieved carbon dioxide reductions through the dash for gas. However, the dash for gas had nothing to do with meeting environmental guidelines: it was driven by the market and price, and its effect was entirely incidental. Nor was it triggered by the present Government.
<P>
We must recognise that, as in this case, changes sometimes lead to unintended and beneficial results.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The hon. Gentleman is on a strong point, which he should perhaps emphasise further. Not only were this Government not responsible for the dash for gas: they tried to cut it off. If the 12.5 per cent. reduction is real, credit for it must be claimed by the previous, Conservative Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> That would be all the more convincing if the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), whom the Conservatives exiled, still had anything still to do with Conservative policy on the environment. As Secretary of State for the Environment, he perhaps did something for the Conservatives' image in that regard, but he had nothing to do with the dash for gas policy.
<P>
I shall be open and say that the previous Conservative Government and the Labour Government adopted environmental policies that produced improvements. I am not someone who says that nothing has been done and everything is a complete disaster, but the one significant change to carbon dioxide emissions has been achieved without planning or prediction. I too, would try to take credit for that after the event, but it is my job in opposition to point out that to do so is a bit of a fraud.
<P>
There are working models of small policy changes that produce massive unintended consequences, and the Government should consider the amendment because its consequences would be intended and predictable. I doubt whether members of this Committee will be considering carbon emission figures in this Room in 10 years' time, but I suspect that our successors will wonder, ``How did they come to do that? How could they imagine that those policies would produce the result that they predicted?'' There is a disconnection between what people want to achieve and what the policies will achieve, and the amendment is a small attempt to correct that balance.
<P>
This is an important and substantial issue, but it is perhaps a minority interest in the wider world, and one seldom has a full and proper debate on it. I realise that, within the fairly narrow confines of the amendment, it is not possible to deploy all the arguments, but we have sighted dimly through the fog a very large iceberg, and I would like to believe that Committee members are prepared to make a small change of course to miss it. I shall be most unhappy if the Government disregard the amendments. It would have been my wish to press the matter to a vote, but I might be a lone voice in expressing that view, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> It has been an interesting morning, although perhaps more entertaining than enlightening. We have just had a wonderful example of the kind of behaviour once attributed to Lord Owen by one of his constituents. She had informed me that his nickname down in Plymouth was ``Splinterbum''. I wondered what the heck she meant by that, and she explained that he was known as ``Splinterbum'' because he was always sitting on the fence and wriggling about. That was how he got the splinters. We have just witnessed the hon. Member for Hazel Grove giving an admirable example of such behaviour.
<P>
Surprisingly, I find that the amendments in this group have links with some of those tabled by the Liberal Democrats, who are trying, as I am, to broaden the categories of bodies that the Secretary of State should consult before issuing guidance. The amendments mirror the provisions for gas and electricity already in the Bill. Subsection (3) contains the following provisions relating to gas:
<P>
Before issuing guidance under this section the Secretary of State shall consult—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the Authority;
<P>
(b) the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council (in this Act referred to as ``the Council'');
<P>
(c) licence holders; and
<P>
(d) such other persons as the Secretary of State considers it appropriate to consult in relation to the guidance.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall allow the Liberal Democrats to make their own speeches on the issue. My amendment simply proposes the addition of appropriate Select Committees.
<P>
At the beginning of this Parliament, a deal was struck between the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats, although everyone denies that such deals exist. However, this deal was designed to ensure that an Environmental Audit Committee would examine certain issues. It is appropriate that, if we have such a Committee, it should be consulted.
<P>
A letter from the Secretary of State to the appropriate Select Committees—for example, the Trade and Industry Committee, and the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee—would also be an appropriate way of approaching this. That would ensure that Members of Parliament—Back Benchers on Select Committees, which are very valuable to the way in which we work—will have a statutory right at least to receive a letter from the Secretary of State asking for their views before issuing the guidance.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I support amendment No. 242, as well as amendment No. 288. We have common cause on some issues but not on others, which illustrates the differences in approach between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats and between the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats. That is what a multi-party system is all about, although it is something of a novelty to the hon. Member for South Dorset.
<P>
The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Before issuing guidance under this section, the Secretary of State shall consult.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A list of people then follows and it is a sensible list: the authority, the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council, the licence holders and, in the Frank Dobson paragraph, anyone else whom
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Secretary of State considers it appropriate to consult in relation to the guidance, <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or enough people on the Secretary of State's side of the argument to swing the decision to the one first thought of. Subsection (3)(d) allows the Secretary of State to consult whomever he wants to make up the numbers. The hon. Member for South Dorset seems to be suggesting in his amendment that we should ensure that not everyone whom the Secretary of State consults shares his opinion from the outset and that a Select Committee or two should be consulted. That is right. There should be consultation with Select Committees and that might not be a bad thing from the Government's point of view.<P>

<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to a reply from the Leader of the House during business questions last week. She said that taking Bills through a draft procedure was often beneficial and, with hindsight, might have been a good idea for the Utilities Bill. If guidance is to be issued, it might be sensible for the Secretary of State to try it out on a Select Committee or two to see whether any bugs have become apparent.
<P>
Amendment No. 242 is broader than, but not exclusive of, amendment No. 288. It would ensure that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>other persons or organisations with an interest in the matters contained within the guidance<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
are consulted and not just a group of people selected by the Secretary of State entirely without boundaries.
<P>
The Minister said earlier, when seeing off some amendments, that if we remove all the control systems, a future Secretary of State could do something for economic reasons rather than social and environmental reasons. That is why he did not want to accept amendments deleting certain controls on what a future Secretary of State could do. The provision includes a wide-ranging power without boundaries and I suggest to the Minister that with the benefit of time to consider the matter, he may think it appropriate to accept these two amendments. One course that he could follow might meet the views of both sides. He could agree to accept the amendments if they did not delete the existing provision in the Bill. I could live with that, but it is important that the decision on which bodies and organisations are consulted should not be dependent on the Secretary of State's unfettered discretion and will. If he wants to retain that, that is fine, but we must ensure that he does not exclude people. We are concerned about the people he might exclude, not those he might include. We should make sure that we specifically include Select Committees, and on that I support the hon. Member for South Dorset, and other interested persons and organisations. I hope that the Minister can accept the amendments, if not as substitutions, at least as additions to the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The current list of mandatory consultees has been deliberately limited to parties with a working interest in the guidance—the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority, the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council and licence holders. Those who may be directly affected by the guidance form a distinct category and should have an express right to be consulted before the Secretary of State can issue guidance. Although we value highly the input of any Select Committee and would welcome its comments on guidance, I would resist an attempt to make Select Committees mandatory consultees.
<P>
I firmly resist the amendments, which would make the process of issuing guidance almost inoperable. How could the Secretary of State be expected to consult with individuals or groups that he does not know have an interest? All interested parties will have an opportunity to comment. There should be no doubt about that.
<P>
<B>Mrs Linda Gilroy </B>(Plymouth, Sutton): My hon. Friend the Minister may be interested to know, in preparation for the House's consideration of the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill tomorrow, that the Football Association has expressed its support for that Bill. That reinforces what my hon. Friend is saying. Will he assure me that the Energy Saving Trust Ltd. will be among those that are always consulted on such matters? It prepared a good response to the initial guidance, and I hope that he will consider that seriously.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I can certainly give my hon. Friend that assurance. The trust is enthusiastically supported by my right hon. Friend the energy Minister.
<P>
It would hardly be sensible to carry out a consultation that prevented anyone with an interest from commenting. We could not get away with it, nor would we want to. For all those reasons, I resist amendments Nos. 242 and 245.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I understand that the Committee wants to move rapidly onwards and I am disappointed by the Government's response. I hope that the Minister saw the press release from the blue green initiative. My environmentally friendly hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Norman) has just set up a commission to ensure that the Conservative party helps to achieve the Government's aims in that regard. I hope that the Minister will give careful consideration to consulting that body before proceeding with guidance. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 345, in page 6, line 25, leave out ``forty'' and insert ``sixty''.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 346, in page 6, line 34, leave out ``forty'' and insert ``sixty''.
<P>
No. 347, in clause 13, page 9, line 16, leave out ``forty'' and insert ``sixty''.
<P>
No. 348, in page 9, line 25, leave out ``forty'' and insert ``sixty''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> These amendments would allow the Government to avoid the embarrassment that they have so far experienced in relation to this futilities Bill. Allowing only 40 days for people to be consulted is not practical, in terms of the parliamentary timetable or the consultation of Committees. Sixty days would be more sensible. I hope that the Minister will mirror the generosity of Opposition Members and accept the amendment as a sensible way forward.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned the blue green initiative of the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells. If the hon. Gentleman had had time to examine section 4 of the Environment Act 1995—which was passed under the previous Conservative Government—he would have seen that we have drawn extensively on that legislation in drafting the procedures for issuing statutory guidance on social and environmental matters in the Bill. Indeed, I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman has chosen to object to the 40-day period, given that his party set the precedent. I therefore oppose the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> What a persuasive argument the Minister has made. The Conservatives must have been right. I must agree with him wholeheartedly; clearly everything that was done in our 18 years was commendable and I should not press the amendment to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

In the past, 30 pieces of legislation, including the Gas Act 1986, referred to the executive rather than the commission, but more recent non-health and safety legislation has mirrored the structure of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974, which places the commission at the heart of advice to Ministers, not the executive.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 316, in Clause 15, page 10, line 33, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Advice from Competition Commission.<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3E.—In the exercise of its functions under this Act, the Authority may seek the advice of the Competition Commission on such matters relating to the generation, transmission, distribution or supply of electricity as it considered appropriate.<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The amendments enable the regulatory authority to seek the advice of the Competition Commission as it considers appropriate. The concern is to avoid the regulatory regime becoming too parochial and inward-looking, thus failing to consider the wider implications of their actions and the effect of that on the public interest generally.
<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for explaining the purpose behind his amendments, but the Government have tabled amendments clarifying the obligation on each authority to include in its annual report an assessment of the development of competition in the relevant markets. I therefore urge the on. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 370, in page 7, line 34, at end insert—
<P>
(4) The Authority when acting as above will ensure that investigation will not duplicate other regulator's investigations and not allow the parties investigated to be put in double jeopardy.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 371, in clause 15, page 10, line 33, at end insert—
<P>
(5) The Authority when acting as above will ensure that investigations will not duplicate other regulators' investigations and not allow the parties investigated to be put in double jeopardy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The amendments would prevent duplication. When a complaint is received by the consumer council, it is investigated by it, even though it is a partisan, pro-consumer group. The complaint is then passed to the authority to take action. The concern is that the authority will not be able to rely on the objectivity of the report submitted. The amendment would make unnecessary two separate investigations by the two authorities.
<P>
It being twenty-five minutes past Eleven o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
