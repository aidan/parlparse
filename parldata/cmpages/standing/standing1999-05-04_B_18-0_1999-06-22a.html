<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
Question proposed [17 June], That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Heald </B>(North-East Hertfordshire): On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. As one of the silent ones in the Committee--although I am not totally silent--I must pay tribute to the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth), who has dealt considerately with the Committee's affairs. I am sure that Committee members will join me in congratulating him and his wife on their 25th wedding anniversary, which they celebrate today.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Butterfill. I want to make a quick comment on behalf of my hon. Friends. As a Whip, my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East has taken a vow of silence. I thank the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) for his courteous and kindly meant comments, which are appreciated on both sides of the Committee. At the risk of embarrassing my hon. Friend, we all wish him and his wife well on their anniversary. He is extremely popular--if one can use such words to describe a Whip--among Government and Opposition Members.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Let us get back to the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): First, may I second the good wishes to the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East? Whips and ex-Whips form a silent brotherhood, and, speaking as an ex-Whip, I recognise that the hon. Gentleman is a good Whip. For some time now he has helped the Committee to make progress.
<P>
However, perhaps I should stop this outbreak of good will from persisting for too long by suggesting that we get back to the new clause. I shall not repeat the points that we made last week but, by way of summary, I point out that some of the poorest groups in the country, especially those who have modest savings and who are in old age--some 300,000 people fall into that category--face a continuing injustice. From this April, they will receive no repayment of dividend tax credits on their equity investments. They may have inherited a small portfolio of privatised shares on the death of their husband or wife, and it is most unfair that they will not receive the repayment. They may not yet know that they will not receive the repayment because it is often only at the end of the tax year that people become aware that repayments have been blocked.
<P>
I point out to the Financial Secretary that she has not replied to the points that we made last week, and I remind her that last week I said that the Government's proposals involve a generalised attack on savings. It is not surprising that the savings ratio--the aggregate of savings in the economy as a proportion of gross domestic product--is falling. To reverse the injustice and the decline in savings, I urge the Government to give sympathetic consideration to the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): I have sat for too long listening to the Opposition's crocodile tears. They inflicted poverty on the more mature members of the population through taxation on fuel; they also introduced eye test charges and short-changed the national health service.
<P>
We should separate tax policies with a redistributive, welfare edge from those that are about economic and competitive efficiency, and not mix the two up in an opportunist way, as both the Tory party and the Liberal Democrats have done. Specific strategies are needed to give more money to elderly people who do not have a great deal. Those strategies should not be confused with those that distort investment decisions in companies that generate more research and development to make UK plc more competitive.
<P>
The Government made those tax changes to get more investment back into our industrial infrastructure, to make it more competitive. A by-product of the changes is that some tax benefits for pensioners no longer exist. However, against that, one must ask whether the Government are doing nothing. The answer is no. They have introduced a long list of measures: the winter fuel allowance of £100; a minimum income of £75 for poorer pensioners, which is indexed to wages; the reduction of value added tax on fuel, which had been inflicted by the previous Government; the introduction of free eye tests; and the opportunity for pensioners to switch to individual savings accounts. In addition, we have introduced a minimum tax guarantee, resulting in some 200,000 pensioners moving out of the taxable income bracket.
<P>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) is not in Committee. At the crescendo of his speech, he spoke of a poor pensioner couple with savings of £100,000. It was only at that level of savings that he could begin to make a case, which was that those pensioners would have only £80 a week from this benefit, on which they would depend. I have sympathy for those people, but they could get that £80 a week by living off their capital over 25 years, if they received 3 to 5 per cent. interest. That estimate is not unreasonable. Indeed, they should be able to do better with £100,000 invested in the equity market, where it would appreciate quickly. The hon. Member for Twickenham therefore gave a distorted version of the case of a couple with £100,000 of equity. He missed the point, either intentionally or unintentionally.
<P>
The Government are separating the social agenda from the economic agenda, There is a long list of measures that will benefit pensioners, for which we receive no applause from the Opposition. Instead, we get a negative response--the crocodile tears to which we have become used over the years. I would like to put the clause into that perspective and encourage the Committee to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The subject of the clause was discussed extensively last year in Standing Committee, on Report and in a debate on the Floor of the House on 18 January this year.
<P>
Let me remind the Committee why we withdrew payable tax credits on dividends. We made the change to remove a distortion in the corporation tax system that encouraged companies to distribute their profits as dividends rather than reinvesting them in the business. Reinvestment is essential to the growth in the economy that we want to encourage. The withdrawal is an essential part of our wider reform of the corporation tax system, which includes the widely welcomed abolition of advance corporation tax. It will lead to more and better quality investment and growth.
<P>
Payable tax credits were abolished immediately for most companies and for pension funds. However, we recognised that other shareholders needed time to adjust to the change. That is why we delayed the withdrawal of tax credits for individuals and charities for two years, until this April. That also meant that we could ensure that the withdrawal of payable credits coincided with the introduction of the individual savings account.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) referred several times to ISAs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): Before the Financial Secretary moves on from her justification of the Government's policy, I should point out that the financial statement contains a graph that illustrates that the level of private investment during the next two or three years will decline as a percentage of GDP. If the policy is so successful, why does the graph predict a downward trend?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The right hon. Gentleman makes my point. When the Government took office, this country had a very bad record on investment in business and the economy, particularly manufacturing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Financial Secretary again prays in aid her analysis of the past, but I asked about future years. The graph shows that private investment as a percentage of GDP will decline when the policy is supposed to take effect. Why?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Because, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, it takes time to redress the balance. He may laugh, but that will do no good. I was looking forward to reminding the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) that, as Financial Secretary, he presided over a reduction in the value of the tax credit from 25 per cent. to 20 per cent., but he is not here this morning. The right hon. Member for Fylde should show some consistency on the subject.
<P>
It is important to look at the picture in the round. We are putting in place many measures to encourage re-investment in business. We are considering not only the reform of corporation tax, but all the measures in this Budget and the previous Budgets of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> My third point is that the United States, which has a classical corporation tax system, also has higher levels of profit distribution. US investment levels are often contrasted favourably with the United Kingdom's because they are higher. Given that our system is now closer to the American system, why does the Financial Secretary advance the argument that she does?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I agree that comparisons with the US are interesting, but there is more to learn than how to run a corporation tax system. For example, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, there is a greater culture of, and access to, venture capital investment, which we would seek to emulate. Such comparisons are sometimes instructive, but one should look at systems in the round rather than compare a single system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> My hon. Friend will know that page 141 of the financial statement clearly illustrates a rising trend in investment. Contrary to the suggestion made by the right hon. Member for Wells, during a boom, when confidence increases, the private savings ratio declines. People increase their savings ratios only during a Tory recession. In fact, things are looking very good indeed.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. Of course, the savings ratio is affected by many economic factors. The corporation tax package will not work through until 2003-04. It is very difficult to predict the investment profile, but it is important to take all possible measures to encourage investment, which this measure does.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I had moved on to talk about ISAs and to answer the points raised by the right hon. Member for Wells. I am pleased that he has given me the opportunity to let the Committee know how successful ISAs have been so far. I want to pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary for her work promoting ISAs. One provider alone opened more ISAs in the first few weeks of the scheme than the total number of PEPs opened by all managers during 1987, the first year of PEPs. Other providers have reported similar successes, opening hundreds of ISAs each day. We should be very pleased because that measure will encourage savings.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells was concerned about the costs of ISAs. The ISA aims to encourage savings among people on modest incomes. As I have said, ISAs are already available from a wide variety of institutions, including banks, building societies and friendly societies, which should keep charges low.
<P>
The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), who is not in his place this morning, referred to the fact that the new 10p rate of income tax will not apply to income from savings. I should have thought that he would welcome the new 10p rate, which has been introduced to increase work incentives and to help make work pay. The rate is available to pensioners who pay tax on their earnings or pensions. As was mentioned in a previous debate, savings income is already favourably taxed. Savers continue to enjoy the benefit of the lower rate of 20p on their savings income, rather than the basic rate of 23p. The new individual savings accounts are generous and flexible, and they allow all savers, including pensioners, to invest substantial amounts each year with a tax-free return.
<P>
Of course, Opposition Members failed to mention that the Chancellor announced a generous Budget package for pensioners, including minimum income and tax guarantees, and a five-fold increase in the winter fuel allowance. From speaking to my colleagues and from contacts in my constituency, I know how well that package was received by pensioners. As a result of measures that we have introduced, only about one third of pensioners will now pay tax.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) reminded us just a few moments ago, that can be contrasted with the record of the previous Government, who introduced VAT on fuel, abolished free eye tests and presided over pensions mis-selling on a grand scale. It is no use Opposition Members now posing as the pensioners' friend when they had such a deplorable record in Government. They fail to mention that our package of measures will lift some 200,000 pensioners out of tax altogether and provide help to those who most need it. We have committed further funds to the national health service, on which so many pensioners depend.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) also mentioned the effect on charities of the withdrawal of payable credits. We, too, were concerned about charities, which is why we announced a generous compensation package for charities to be met from public expenditure. The compensation will take the form of a payment to the charity of a percentage of the dividends that it receives and will be phased out over five years from April 1999. Charities will therefore have had more than seven years to adjust to the loss of payable credits. The hon. Member for Twickenham, who is not in Committee this morning, was worried about the length of time taken to consider individual non-taxpayers. I know that the hon. Gentleman will consult Hansard on this matter, and I can assure the Committee that we gave serious consideration to individuals affected, and made sure that we listened to all representations on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I have listened carefully to the Financial Secretary's argument. Would she consider monitoring the effect on investment in companies of the policy that she espouses? Would she also consider publishing a report before the end of this Parliament, so that we can judge whether her predictions have come true?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> As I said in response to the right hon. Gentleman's earlier remarks, individual changes cannot be considered in isolation--the system must be looked at as a whole. The Chancellor keeps all fiscal policies under review to ensure that the Government's economic objectives are met. That will continue in this area, as in all others.
<P>
I have addressed the points made by Committee members. They are not new points; they have been extensively canvassed, not only in deliberations on a previous Finance Bill, but on the Floor of the House recently. I urge my hon. Friends to reject the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The more I listen to those on the Government Front Bench, the more the message of the Government's policies seems to be ``Don't bother to save''. Those with pensions have already suffered from the Government's first Budget, which took £5 billion a year out of pension funds. They abolished PEPs and TESSAs, which were a successful and popular way for people to build up assets for their old age. They introduced a 10p starting rate of income tax, but were careful not to apply it to savings income, although that was disguised on Budget day. Now they are persisting in hitting the poorest savers by withdrawing the repayment of dividend tax credit. The only excuse they can offer for doing so is that of a big change to company tax, which will improve or increase business investment. That is contradicted on page 140 of the Red Book, which, after referring to the strong business investment figures of recent years, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Manufacturing investment has already turned, falling in each of the past three quarters''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The chart at the bottom of that page records business investment as having risen by 11 per cent. in 1998, and forecasts it to collapse to between 1 and 1.75 per cent. in the current year, and to barely increase beyond that next year and the year after. The Government's investment policy has therefore failed.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde has pointed out, no correlation exists between dividend distributions and investment in the companies concerned. That is the experience in the United States, which is the most dynamic and successful economy in the world. It is often companies with generous dividend distributions that can afford high levels of internal investment. The Government's excuse is therefore hollow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that the United States does not have dividend tax credits?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am making a different point. The experience in the United States--I hesitate to weary the Committee by repeating the point--is that no correlation exists between generous dividend distributions and investment. Companies that pay high dividends often have high levels of internal investment. To repeat my argument, any attempt to restrict dividend distributions by making tax changes will not, by the Government's logic, affect the level of investment in a company. That is demonstrated by the fact that, although changes have been introduced in the United Kingdom, according to the Government's own figures, business investment has not improved.
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): Can the right hon. Gentleman cite examples that show that companies that have high dividend payouts also have high levels of investment? Does he accept that our proposals are part of the changing culture of business and investment? To expect to introduce changes one year and to see all the results in the next is, frankly, a bit ridiculous. It will take time for people and companies to change their attitudes. We shall see results in the years to come, but to expect results in year one is a bit naive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I did better than to give examples of companies--I gave the example of a country, the United States, which has a high level of dividend distribution and a high level of investment.
<P>
On the hon. Lady's other point, the way to improve business investment is not to increase the level of business taxation. I make another prediction: that the £25 billion extra corporate taxation that the Government announced will be raised during the course of this Parliament will devastate the prospects for company investment. The Government have not proposed a clever way to improve investment, if that is what they wish to do.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> No. I have answered the hon. Lady's point.
<P>
I want to conclude by criticising the Government's attitude that the unfortunate low-income savers can simply switch their investments to other products such as an individual savings account. For the moment we might leave aside the fact that ISAs are untried and untested and that they are regarded with intense suspicion by the savings public, but we cannot ignore the fact that charges are attached to the switching of investments. If a saver followed the Government's suggestion and switched his dividend holdings to ISAs, he would continue to shelter his investments from tax but the Treasury would not get any extra revenue. Our suggestion, which is that dividend tax credits should be retained, would have, by the Government's own logic, a zero cost. If the savings public do what the Government suggest, no extra revenue will be raised. We believe that one should accept the Government's logic at the start and remove the need for people to switch investments, which incurs charges and involves uncertainty. We should help people in the way that the new clause proposes.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I agree totally with the right hon. Gentleman's argument, but is not the situation worse than he suggests? Many of those who will be affected by the proposal are not financially sophisticated and do not have financial advisers. They will not make the switch and will, therefore, be penalised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes. We raised that matter earlier. We are dealing with the least sophisticated segment of the savings population, who are not well advised. To suggest that, at the end of their lives, they should take out another government savings product--they may have read about it in the newspapers and suspect that the rules will be changed further--is, frankly, an insult to them.
<P>
We know that the Labour party has only recently grasped the importance of a market economy, but Labour Members have been carried away in their enthusiasm. They assume that every constituent and every member of the public has an army of advisers who suggest portfolio changes and recommend new products that come on to the market, and they say that costs do not matter because they will be recouped in the longer term. That is a fantasy world, and the Labour party should re-engage with the electors. Recently, we heard that the Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. McCartney) is to conduct a study into the Labour party's debacle in the European Parliament elections as a result of concern that the party has lost touch with its natural supporters. I can give him a bit of free advice, which is that by accepting our new clause, the Government will signal to some of their traditional supporters that they are listening to them and want to do something for the poorest segment of the population. Therefore, I seek to divide the Committee on this important new clause.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause relates to personal pensions and certain self-administered occupational pension schemes. Under a defined contributions pension scheme--rather than a defined benefits scheme, where the pension is ultimately paid out of the pension fund itself, for example, a final salaries scheme--there is a requirement to purchase an annuity on retirement. In 1995, that requirement was mitigated by changing the law to permit income draw-down directly from the pension fund until the pensioner reaches the age of 75. That allows the pensioner to defer the purchase of an annuity for 10 years or more.
<P>
That reform was deemed to be necessary by the previous Government because of falling annuity rates. Annuity rates have continued to fall and, in January 1999, they reached a 30-year low. Seven years ago, a £100,000 pension fund could have purchased an annuity giving an income of £15,823 a year. A year ago, the same fund would have purchased an annuity giving about £9,700 a year. Today, it would purchase an annuity giving £9,494 a year, and even lower figures are derived from annuities that have an escalator or are index-linked. The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds report, ``Income in Retirement--are Annuities the Answer?'', which was published in April this year, shows that a male aged 65 who is a stalwart smoker can expect £9,948 a year from a £100,000 annuity, a non-smoker can expect £9,104 a year, but an annuity with a 5 per cent. escalator will yield merely £5,925. The previous Government's decision to give pensioners the flexibility of being able to delay the purchase of an annuity until the age of 75 was welcome, and continues to be so. That is not merely because it enables pensioners to wait until annuity rates rise, which is a gamble. As events have turned out, such a gamble would not have paid off because annuity rates have continued to fall, and all the predictions are that they may fall even further. A more significant aspect of delaying the purchase of annuities, according to Clifford German, writing in The Independent, is that an annuity will be about 40 per cent. higher if taken out at the age of 75 than at the age of 65. That is because of lower life expectancy at the age of 75 than at 65. That has an even greater impact than being able to gamble on future annuity rates.
<P>
I represent a constituency with a large retired population, and I receive many letters urging the Government to remove the age limit of 75. Life expectancy has increased enormously over the past 20 years, and is expected to rise even further in the years ahead. That is welcome, and a great tribute to the success of this country. It therefore seems arbitrary to insist on an age limit of 75 for pensioners purchasing annuities. The new clause would remove that age limit altogether. One of my constituents wrote to me recently to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I am one of very many pensioners who is unable to secure a satisfactory pension from my pension fund which I have worked hard to build up during a lifetime of continuous employment. As I have never enjoyed a Company Pension Scheme all my payments have been made into a Personal Pension Scheme which has been invested wisely, mainly in equities, to provide growth which has produced quite a large fund for me.
<P>
However, I am now 68 years old, and would like to draw a pension but I have been informed...that with the present appallingly low rates of return in annuities I am best advised not to buy a pension at the present time.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Under present legislation, I will be forced to purchase an annuity...before I reach the age of 75. This will mean that my investment strategy will then be dictated by the Inland Revenue with my annuity invested in gilts and involving the total loss of capital.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He concludes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This seems particularly unfair for older pensioners as in my case as the larger part of my pension plan will be lost to my family irretrievably if I were to die after the age of 75.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That raises the secondary point about removing the upper age limit--buying an annuity means that the capital is lost and that the pensioner takes a gamble that he will live for a sufficiently long period to gain more than the amortisation of the capital would deliver in normal circumstances. Many pensioners want to leave their capital to their children, and would be prepared to take a small reduction in income to enable them to do so. Other pensioners do not want to take such a risk, and would rather enjoy a higher income and not leave the capital to their children. That should be a matter for pensioners, and the new clause would provide the necessary flexibility without any jeopardy of creating a liability for the state as a result of pensioners squandering all their capital on a world cruise. That would not be possible, even under the current rules, as pensioners can only draw down an amount of income that enables the fund to maintain its value.
<P>
Another constituent wrote to me to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We would appreciate it if you could press for better treatment for those in small self-administered schemes and those who defer taking annuities.<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As you know, the annuity rates are very low at the moment and show little sign of improving. Pensioners in most cases can obtain more income by managing their own affairs especially as they still have their capital sum intact.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Pensioners are finding that they can achieve a better return by leaving their capital in the pension fund than by taking it out and purchasing an annuity.
<P>
That may seem odd, given that an annuity has the advantage of having an amortisation element in the capital, whereas the money left in the pension fund does not. There are circumstances, with which other members of the Committee will be more familiar than I am, in which annuity rates have risen not only because of low interest rates but because of an attempt by the annuity industry to recover margins following past mistakes, and because the annuity industry is probably under-supplied in relation to the level of demand. There are also worries about 20-year gilt rates in the marketplace, because of excess demand by the annuity industry for annuities for 20-year gilts. The constituent goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``As the law stands, at the age of 75, pensioners must hand over the capital sum to an insurance company and take whatever the annuity rate is at that time and say goodbye to the capital sum.''<P>

He concludes by saying that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the bulk of the fund has been saved by the pensioner and is truly his money. It does not seem just to take this away from him or his family.''<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Love </B>(Edmonton): I listened with great interest to the points made by the hon. Gentleman. The fund will continue to build up as long as the stock market provides the sizeable returns that it is currently providing. Would the hon. Gentleman's constituents be of a different mind if the stock market were not to deliver at its present levels?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I think that he is right. If the stock market were not delivering sufficient returns to the pension fund, no doubt many of the constituents who have written to me would be happy to take out an annuity. However, it should be up to them to make that decision, at the right time, taking into account prevailing conditions on the stock market and the level of interest rates. The point at which they take out an annuity should not be dictated by legislation.
<P>
The new clause would not prevent them from taking out an annuity; it would simply give them flexibility. I can see no argument against that, as I believe that the case is unassailable. It is wrong to presume that pensioners are profligate and irresponsible, and that they should not take responsibility for those decisions. The current law is carefully drafted to ensure that there is no profligacy. The income draw-down rules are specific and do not allow pensioners to withdraw  vast sums from their pension fund and squander them on a world cruise, so that they would then be forced to claim income support from the state. The Government's response to my constituents' concerns has been measured and sympathetic, but firm in their support for annuities.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): I am somewhat confused. Is not the hon. Gentleman being inconsistent? Did he not support his own Government's measures when they were in office?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> No, my views are entirely consistent with what the Conservative Government did in 1995. They extended the rule to enable pensioners to delay taking an annuity, from the age of 65 to the age of 75. They extended the period by 10 years. That was the first stepping-stone towards what should be done now. Were the Conservative party in power today, I believe that it would take the next step and remove the upper age-limit as well. I do not believe that this is a party political issue and I hope that the Government will be sympathetic. The clamour for this change in the law comes from the industry and from pensioners' groups. There is a widespread feeling among pensioners approaching the age of 75 that they should have that flexibility. The Paymaster General, in her responses to my constituents, has been sympathetic to the case. Nevertheless, she has been firm in her support for annuities. In one such response, beautifully signed by the hon. Lady herself, she said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``An annuity is the only financial product currently available that will guarantee an income for life. Without annuities, the majority of pensioners would probably be prudent when investing and drawing on their pension fund. But, no matter how sensible they are, there would always be the danger that the fund would run out if they enjoy a long life.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Lady went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We recognise the concerns that people have over annuity rates. But many commentators do not mention that low inflation is the best protection for pensioners''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That view is slightly complacent. Many people are concerned that they may not get best value for the funds that they have saved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Love:</B> The letter from the Paymaster General mentioned low inflation. Annuities are based on long-term gilt rates, which are directly related to long-term inflation rates. The Government have created a low-inflation environment. Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that that environment has created the current low annuity rates?
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Yes and no. The low-inflation and interest rate environment will affect all aspects of investment portfolios and products. However, certain factors--higher margins in the annuity industry and the skewing of period gilts such as 20-year gilts--are out of kilter with the rest of the market and may not affect annuities in the longer term. It is vital that we give pensioners the flexibility to avoid such market distortions, so that they can make the best use of their accumulated capital. That view is also shared by Age Concern.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Let us imagine that a large number of prospective pensioners defer annuities, draw down and gamble on the stock market. Subsequently, the south-east Asian crisis contaminates the world economy and stock markets plummet. Those pensioners would not have sustainable lifetime incomes, even though pensioners' life expectancy is increasing. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that, in a circumstance where the UK economy, like other economies, was weak, the Government should bail out such pensioners?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> These issues apply to people who contribute to pension funds, because all the money is invested in stocks and shares and other assets that carry a degree of risk. However, as pension funds reach maturity, they are increasingly invested in gilts, which are lower-risk assets. The hon. Gentleman's point is not valid, because exposure to risks such as the collapse of the Asian stock market is fundamentally reduced.
<P>
With each passing day, more pensioners are being forced to purchase annuities against their better judgment. That is scant reward for those who have saved prudently for their retirement, and does little to advance the Government's policy of encouraging younger people to take out pensions. The Government should abolish the rule that forces people to buy an annuity before they are 75 by accepting the amendment or tabling a similar amendment on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> In the light of the hon. Gentleman's unfortunate scenario--in which, because of improvements in health, people live longer than their funds will allow--has he projected the cost to the Government of the new clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> There should be no cost to the Government until the end, because the current rules on income draw-down are strict and do not allow pensioners to draw down more income, which would depreciate the fund's value. The policy is perfectly valid and I believe that the Government will ultimately adopt it. I urge them to adopt it sooner rather than later because, with each passing day, more and more people are being forced to buy annuities against their better judgment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Before today, I had not undertaken much research on this subject, but I should say that I find the arguments of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) compelling and convincing, and I can reassure him that he has the support of the Liberal Democrats. I hope that Government members of the Committee will realise that the issue is not party political but one that would almost certainly have carried cross-party support in the 1995 Finance Bill Standing Committee. Similarly, the fact that the new clause has been tabled by the Opposition should not deter Ministers and other Labour members of the Committee from supporting it.
<P>
The new clause would give pensioners who have saved throughout their lives greater choice and freedom in the use of their money. That should receive support from Members on both sides of the Committee. The Government should be pleased that the success with which their economic policies have delivered low inflation has brought the matter to light. We hope that low inflation will continue and that it will be locked in by the Government's macro-economic strategy. In that climate, it is likely that, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton argued, the low yields that are associated with annuities will continue. The changes are sensible and they are in line with the Government's macro-economic policy and their attempts to maintain stability in that context.
<P>
When the Economic Secretary replies, I hope that she will not rule out the option or rubbish the new clause and that her mind is not closed. If she is not prepared to accept the new clause, I hope that she will give it serious consideration and perhaps include it in next year's Budget.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I, too, welcome the new clause. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton on explaining Conservative party policy and on formulating Liberal Democrat policy on that party's behalf. That involves inclusive politics of a new kind. I am sure that he will do the same for the Liberal Democrats many times in the future.
<P>
The fundamental problem with annuities is that they are tied to rates on gilts, which constitute a secure investment. However, we take many risks in life, and the unquantifiable risk with gilt investments is inflation. It is anomalous for the Government to say that it is right for pensioners to lock into a fixed income that carries an unquantifiable risk of future inflation but that it is not right for them to lock into an investment strategy that carries an unquantifiable risk of, for example, a stock market collapse. In relation to stock market investments, more secure investments--for example, in utilities, and in less dynamic but growing companies--have a lower risk profile than that which is associated with, in effect, locking oneself into the return on gilts at any particular time.
<P>
The gilts market reflects the fact that it is a liquid market. An annuity is the opposite--it is a totally illiquid investment. Insurance companies and other providers of annuities investments finance investments in a liquid product, but it is anomalous of the Government to lock people into totally illiquid investments. That involves old-fashioned thinking, which has no place in a modern, forward-looking society.
<P>
I was interested to read in this morning's Financial Times that the Minister with responsibility for housing was considering introducing property investment trusts in this country. It was pointed out that in the United States during the past 10 years those trusts have provided a much wider pool in investment funds and that residential housing is involved. We should all welcome a broader choice in relation to rented residential housing. Such an investment might be well suited to those who are retired. In the long run, housing prices and rent will rise broadly in line with income, and growth may result. However, the volatility of those prices and values in the long run will be far less than that which is associated with the stock market, for example, and the yield will be far higher than that which is associated with gilt market investments or with products such as annuities, which are linked to the gilt market.
<P>
A long-standing rule among pension funds is that they should not invest in residential housing. Understandably, that was primarily an avoidance consideration because pension funds may have been abused by executives who used a pension fund to finance their own home. None of us wants the system to be abused in that way.
<P>
The Government should consider relaxing the rules. If investment funds can invest in residential housing, pension funds should also be allowed to invest in that area. The nature of the investment is well suited to the needs of the pension fund, which are to provide a long-term, secure income for those who are retired. It is possible for people to set up their own pension fund--a non-approved fund--that can abide by its own investment rules and strategies. The problem is that our tax system imposes a triple tax penalty.
<P>
A penalty is imposed on taxable earnings when they are put into the fund; once in the fund, the money is taxed further; and it is taxed again when the pension is withdrawn. Until the Government came to power, approved schemes taxed the money only when it was withdrawn as a pension. By introducing a pension funds tax through the withdrawal of the tax credit on share income in their first Budget, the Government introduced double taxation. Pension funds will need to be flexible, but the Government will, in effect, force treble taxation on pension funds.
<P>
More people are realising the fair advantages of the approved scheme, which avoids treble taxation. If a scheme obliges them to pour money into an annuity for their retirement that makes no long-term sense, they will put less money into their personal pension schemes and build up savings in other forms. If the Government reject the new clause, they will increasingly force people to accept treble taxation of money put aside for old age.
<P>
The Government may have a residual concern that people will reduce the fund available after the age of 75 by more than is prudent, and contemplate setting a later age at which the fund must be used for an annuity. Of course, it is possible for someone to buy a forward annuity at a prudent age such as 65 or 75, to allow for the possibility that he or she may live to an exceptionally old age--perhaps for a further 10 or 15 years beyond 75. At that point, he or she can buy a forward annuity for a modest cost and invest the rest of the capital more wisely to provide a secure income during the anticipated remainder of his or her life. We need that flexibility, and I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton on proposing the new clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner </B>(Brent, North): The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said that he believed that his proposals were ``unassailable''. If so, I counsel Labour members of the Committee never to go a-sailing with him. We must contemplate why the Government encourage people to take the prudent step of investing in pension funds. Tax relief is given on investments in pension funds so that, at the end of a person's working life, there will be a period of financial security and stability.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) referred to what might happen if a pensioner were to reduce the fund by more than was prudent. That is precisely the problem that the new clause would create. It would ask people to bet against their own survival, and to bet that they will die sooner rather than later.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The hon. Gentleman has completely misinterpreted my argument. I said that people are concerned about how long they may live beyond the average expectation. They can buy what might be termed a ``backstop annuity''. If they were to live beyond the age of 85 or 90, the annuity would be paid to them. Because the chances of that happening are relatively low, the cost of that ``backstop annuity'' would be a small part of the cost of a full annuity at the age of 75,
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct. Such people could purchase a backstop annuity, but that does not form part of the amendment. There is no insistence in the amendment that a backstop annuity should be purchased at a fixed time in order to take advantage of the provision not to carry a continuing annuity forward.
<H4><center>[MR. MICHAEL JACK in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
All that the hon. Gentleman is saying is that there is a measure that individuals, if prudent in their investment strategy, could take at that time, given the problems that the amendment might create for them. Otherwise there would be no reason to have a backstop annuity.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The problem is that the hon. Gentleman does not trust people to mind for their own futures. This is a liberalising amendment that recognises that people, especially in old age, are wise and careful with their money. They would have the opportunity to choose between all those provisions. That is precisely why there are few risks attached to the amendment. There is a real cost attached to the current proposal, whereby people will be forced into buying annuities and taking the risk of inflation eating away at their value.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> I profoundly disagree with the hon. Gentleman. The tax relief granted to premiums paid into a pension fund is deemed to return to the Exchequer on the income stream that comes back through the purchase of the annuity. That income is then taxed.
<P>
Opposition Members want to encourage pensioners to live off their capital fund for a period of time--beyond a length of time that may be prudent, as the hon. Member for Guildford has admitted--and in so doing, reduce the revenue stream coming back to the Exchequer. The crux of the hon. Gentleman's argument was revealed when he said that some pensioners might prefer to take a lower annual income and leave the capital fund to their children. That is the real motivation for the amendment. It is another way in which the Conservative party believes that it can foresee wealth cascading down the generations, to the disadvantage of the taxpayer.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B> Thank you, Mr. Jack. I had not realised that you had taken the Chair.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am very versatile.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> You are, indeed, Mr. Jack. I look forward to receiving your guidance.
<P>
The hon. Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)--who admitted that he had not previously thought about the matter--both referred to the climate of low inflation created by the Government's extremely successful monetary policy framework. It is high time that I reminded the Committee of our success, using that framework, in bringing to an end the years of boom and bust from which elderly people, homebuyers and others have suffered during the Conservative years. We are now in a period of low inflation and low interest rates that we intend to sustain well into the future. That environment is good for business investment and for wealth creation, and thus benefits us all.
<P>
The move from an era of boom and bust--I shall get that phrase in twice today--to an era of macroeconomic stability and low inflation creates problems of adjustment. This country has not been used to a period of sustained low inflation and low interest rates--with all the benefits that that brings for business investment--for a very long time. Neither were elderly people used to it, therefore they had not planned for their retirement on that assumption. Although low inflation brings real benefits to elderly people--directly, because their income and capital is not eaten away by inflation, and indirectly, because of the greater economic benefits that it brings--low inflation and low interest rates bring with them the problem of low annuity rates, which the hon. Member for Guildford mentioned.
<H4><center>[MR. JOHN BUTTERFILL in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Paymaster General and I have said that we want to consider whether the current arrangements for income withdrawal from personal pension funds can be improved, and the Inland Revenue has begun a review of the issue. I expect that review to conclude in the autumn, when we shall be in a position to decide sensibly whether changes can be made to improve pensioners' access and choice, while still protecting the security of benefits and their income in older age.
<P>
I have asked the Inland Revenue specifically to consider whether the age limit of 75 is still appropriate. I have also said that we shall be happy to consider any innovative products that the financial services sector might develop, as long as they retain the guarantee of a secure income for life. A combination of capital fund and income draw-down, together with the purchase at some point of a forward annuity, as the hon. Member for Guildford suggested, might provide an adequate alternative to the present arrangements. I do not know, but I would certainly urge financial services providers and others who have an interest in the matter to provide evidence to that review, so that we can carry out a thorough analysis. I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Member for Guildford, but that does not mean that I am prepared to accept the new clause.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North (Mr. Gardiner) stressed, the main purpose of a pension scheme, supported by extremely extensive and expensive tax reliefs, is to provide a secure income for scheme members for the whole of their retirement and to enable them to protect themselves against possible variations in interest rates and inflation. A key feature of an annuity is that it guarantees an income for the remainder of the pensioner's life, however long that is.
<P>
There are variations on the basic product, such as with-profits annuities, but they all retain the essential characteristics of a guaranteed income. By contrast with the purchase of an annuity, income draw-down, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton explained, has been permitted as an alternative to the immediate purchase of an annuity since 1995. The generally accepted wisdom of the financial services sector is that that arrangement is suitable only for people with relatively large funds, probably in excess of £100,000, who can afford to bear the associated risks. That already means that the issue is of concern to a minority of elderly people, rather than to the majority, who simply do not have funds that large.
<P>
Depending on the investment returns that are achieved, those people who have chosen to defer purchase of an annuity and take the maximum permitted income in their fund might see an increase in the income that they receive at 75, compared with that which they might have been able to secure by buying an annuity at, for example, 60, or they might see a substantial reduction in their income.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> That would occur only if the trend that has continued for 20 years, of real returns on equity investments running at about 10 per cent., were to end. What is the Treasury's view on that? Is the Economic Secretary saying that net returns on equity investments may decline sharply over the next few years? If so, why?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am not saying that at all; I am simply saying that the proposal involves risks and that the balance of advantage depends on the investment strategy that is chosen. Much will depend on what happens to equities. The charges access terms state, in relation to ISAs and many other products, that the value of investments can go down as well as up. I was making a general point, not a prediction.
<P>
It is sensible to make the proposed option available at least to people under 75. We should not assume that income draw-down as opposed to annuities is a panacea for all concerned. If we allow the current arrangements to continue beyond the age of 75 and put no other requirements in their place, we should increase the risk that personal pension funds will run out. Scheme members would be left destitute and have to fall back on means-tested benefits. That approach fails to meet our objective, which I hope Opposition Members share, of providing a secure income throughout retirement.
<P>
Unless I misunderstood him, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton suggested that the limits on income draw-down mean that the value of a capital fund will be preserved. However, income draw-down mirrors the annuity rules. What a person is permitted to take is a combination of the income that is earned by a fund and capital from the fund. In relation to income draw-down, the fund is personal to the individual pensioner--it is not pooled, as it would be under the annuity arrangements--and there is a real risk that it will become exhausted.
<P>
Finally, I turn to a significant problem with the new clause--

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The Economic Secretary said that there was a real risk that funds will run out. Is not it true that if the net equity returns continue to perform in the way that they have done during the past 20 years, and if the Government set the income withdrawal rules prudently--one would expect them to do so--no risk would be involved? There will be a problem only if equity returns decline.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The hon. Gentleman ignores the fact that an income draw-down arrangement normally involves dividend payments from a fund and depletion of it--some of the original capital will be withdrawn. One cannot assume that everyone will pursue the same prudent draw-down strategy, and there is a risk of depleting the fund.
<P>
I should also point out--although this is not stated in the new clause--that proposals have been advanced for planned draw-down of pension funds over, for example, 20 years. Such schemes are designed to reduce the fund to zero at the end of the specified period. That raises the risk that, although the fund may have reached zero, the pensioner may still have another five, 10 or 15 years to live, although he will have no fund and no income to support him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire suggested that if the Government's rules were set prudently it might be possible to continue with one's own fund. Does my hon. Friend agree that that completely ignores the fact that insurance is being purchased? Such insurance is based on the fact that some funds will continue for longer than is expected and others will continue for shorter than is expected. When an individual's fund comes to the end of its life, he will be supported by insurance from other funds whose members died earlier. That is why the annuities system is so important. To suggest that the matter can be considered only in relation to one fund is absolute nonsense.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely important point. We need to bear in mind the fact that security comes from pooling risks in relation to annuities. We have invited the industry to suggest better ways of achieving that end, if it believes that they exist.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Does the Minister nevertheless agree that, provided that sensible rules can be developed, the gist of the proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton would involve no loss of revenue to the Inland Revenue?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am about to come to that point. I certainly do not accept that suggestion, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will suggest ideas, if he wishes to elaborate, on how the security element of an annuity can be achieved.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The final difficulty with the new clause is that, by removing the upper age at which a tax-approved scheme has to start paying retirement benefits, it enables personal pension schemes to become tax-efficient inheritance planning vehicles for the very wealthy. My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North referred accurately to the expensive tax reliefs that are available to encourage people to save for their retirement. The clause, however, would allow someone of substantial means to benefit from all the tax reliefs that are given for the purposes of saving for a retirement income, and to maintain intact, with no purchase of an annuity and no income draw-down whatever, a substantial tax-relieved capital fund. That fund could be passed on--through the ingenuity of tax planners--as part of the individual's estate. It would neither incur the tax charge normally levied on a pension fund where there is a residue and no annuity is purchased, nor become liable to inheritance tax. The new clause presents the real danger of a completely open-ended tax avoidance vehicle being created, and of tax relief financed by the many being made available to benefit the few.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I have learned a great deal from my hon. Friend's speech. Given that Liberal members of the Committee thought about this matter only this morning, should they not now reconsider their support for the new clause?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I am shocked by Liberal members of the Committee, who were influenced to vote for the measure on the basis of one speech. Having heard a reasoned response, and an explanation that we are already reviewing the issue and will make our conclusions in the autumn, I hope that they will think better of their original hasty decision.
<P>
In the light of my remarks, I hope that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will withdraw the new clause. If not, I urge my hon. Friends--and constructive Opposition Members--to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I apologise to the Committee, as I had intended to declare an interest in this matter as a trustee of a personal pension scheme, from which I might benefit.
<P>
I am struck by the Economic Secretary's extraordinarily tortuous arguments. The idea that the new clause is some kind of tax avoidance scheme is absurd. The simplest way to avoid inheritance tax is to pass on assets early. The sort of person that the Economic Secretary described is well able to do that; it is those whose main asset is their family home who get penalised by inheritance tax. The Economic Secretary is being naive. Moreover, I noticed that she could come up with no figures on cost.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the tiny risk that exists can be met by a forward annuity? On tax avoidance, it would be the easiest thing in the world to produce anti-avoidance measures.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. The presumption is that, at the end of the fund, the rules will require it to pay out. Any amount paid out of an approved pension scheme suffers tax at the full rate, and if it must be paid into the person's estate, it will also be subject to inheritance tax. The Economic Secretary's argument is merely a sop to Labour Back Benchers, who do not begin to understand the implications of the proposal for some of the oldest and most vulnerable members of society. That is our concern, which is why the new clause has been tabled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> There will be great disappointment with the Economic Secretary's response. I had hoped--as had many people outside the House--for a more positive response to the genuine concern--[Interruption.] I do not regard the promise of an inquiry due to report in September, with legislation following next April, as a sympathetic response. That is because a year will have elapsed by then, during which people approaching the age of 75 will have been forced to buy an annuity at unfavourable rates, which will produce a rate of return much lower than that currently achieved by their pension fund. They will have done that against their better judgment, and would not have done it if they had had flexibility and freedom of choice.
<P>
The Economic Secretary talked about inheritance tax planning. As my hon. Friends have said, that issue could be dealt with simply through anti-avoidance legislation, and to use it as an excuse for failing to act on this gross injustice is pitiful. The hon. Lady is talking about cases affecting only a small minority of people, whereas this injustice applies to many more.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brent, North seems to rest his case on the potential loss of Exchequer revenue, and on his opposition to inherited wealth. I think that we can leave those arguments aside. The Economic Secretary talked about a period of adjustment to a low-inflation era, but it is this legislation that needs adjustment, because it needs to be more flexible in a period of low inflation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): As my hon. Friend says, the inquiry will take a year. Will he ask the Minister if she will table a simple amendment on Report, amending the age from 75 to 76? In that way, people approaching that age would not have to buy a one-off annuity, which might penalise them for the rest of their life, and the status quo could be maintained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point, and had I his imagination, I would have tabled such an amendment today. I hope that the Minister will take on board that point, and will table such an amendment on Report. I do not believe that all the issues that she raised would affect people within the year in question.
<P>
The Economic Secretary said that this issue will affect only a minority of elderly people, and that the Government act for the many and not for the few. She implies thereby that the minority affected are the wealthy in society. That is not the case. Having a pension fund of £100,000 does not necessarily denote wealth. It denotes people who are not part of a company pension scheme, and who have had to make other arrangements. That is why they might have a personal pension of £100,000, which, as I have said, would generate an income of only £5,000 to £8,000, depending on the type of annuity. Those are not staggering income figures for people to retire on, and I do not regard such people as being part of the rich minority of society. The people whom I described are a minority, but a significant minority; they are a minority who have not had the safety of a company pension scheme.
<P>
The Economic Secretary also mentioned the likelihood of the pension fund diminishing. As my hon. Friends said, that would be the case only if the stock market did not continue to perform as it has over the past 20 or 30 years. If the hon. Lady has evidence that that is likely to be a feature of the stock market under this Government, it would be helpful if she could disclose those risks today. Of course there are risks, but this is a question of balancing the risks. What we have at the moment is beyond risk. It is not a question of a risk of damage being done; damage is being done today by people approaching the age of 75 who are being forced to take out an annuity that will give them a significantly diminished income, for which they had not planned. It would be just for the Committee to pass the new clause, to give those people the flexibility to provide themselves with a greater income in retirement.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause has been tabled to deal with an important aspect of the Inland Revenue's powers, and this is not the first time that we have debated such matters. There is growing concern in some quarters that the Government, and specifically the Treasury, are too uncritical in accepting the argument for extending the Revenue's powers. I am sure that we all accept that a balance is necessary. The Revenue must have proper powers in order to ascertain tax liabilities and prevent tax evasion, wherever possible. However, that must be offset by proper concern for the requirements of justice and the principles of common law.
<P>
In parallel with the deliberations of this Committee, an interesting issue is evolving--about which the Economic Secretary knows a great deal--in relation to the Financial Services and Markets Bill. It is important that that Bill complies with the European convention on human rights. I think that all hon. Members would agree that the first financial services Bill, published last summer, did not fully measure up to the requirements of the convention. In that respect, I congratulate the Government on responding to concerns that have been raised We hope that the redrafted Bill will comply with the European convention on human rights.
<P>
I mention that only to draw attention to the importance of getting the balance right, which is not easy. However, there will be serious consequences if basic requirements of justice are overlooked as a result of any Government's concern to maximise tax revenue and to give Departments powers to achieve that. I believe that, in the area of legal privilege, the Government are in danger of ignoring the warning bells about extending Executive power. The question before the Committee is whether the Inland Revenue should be able to obtain documents that are legally privileged. Our new clause would make it clear in statute that the Revenue cannot obtain such documents.
<P>
For many years, it has been a feature of common law that a person who faces legal proceedings can take advice from a solicitor or a barrister in the certain knowledge that what he says to his lawyer, and the advice that he receives, will not be obtained by other parties to the proceedings and cannot be used against him. That is a longstanding principle, but statute law on the matter is somewhat unclear. However, nothing in existing statutes appears explicitly to remove that privilege.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Until now, the slightly ambiguous state of statute law has not mattered, because the Inland Revenue appeared to accept the principle that I have annunciated. However, there has been a recent hardening of its assumptions. In challenging the convention, it was assisted by a recent special commissioners case, which held that the Inland Revenue's statutory powers override the principle of professional privilege, and enable it to obtain correspondence and advice that passes between a taxpayer and his legal adviser. That is a significant development.
<P>
To obtain a glimpse of Parliament's intention, we must return to 1976, when the matter was last debated at length, in the Finance Bill Standing Committee. Regrettably, although the present Chief Secretary is a member of this Committee, he has yet to attend. In those days, the matter was deemed sufficiently important for the Chief Secretary, Joel Barnett, to participate in extensive debates in Standing Committee. He explained where the law stood and where the powers of the Inland Revenue should rest. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I should make it quite clear . . . that the purpose of this part of the schedule is not to require privileged and confidential documents, to be handed over to the Inland Revenue.'.--[Official Report, Standing Committee E, 10 June 1976; c. 686.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The schedule to which he refers is now schedule 20, which is a familiar part of statute law. His words put the Government of the day's intention beyond doubt, but, unfortunately, they were never properly incorporated into statute law. As I said, that did not really matter, because the Inland Revenue agreed to abide by the thinking behind them.
<P>
The next significant event was the setting up in 1983 of the Keith committee, chaired by Lord Keith of Kinkel, to consider the powers--particularly the enforcement powers--of the Revenue departments. It received representations not only from the Inland Revenue but from the professions, the Law Society and, presumably, the Government of the day. It considered the pros and cons of the legal privilege, and recommended that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Legal advice given in connection with a client's tax affairs should be protected from disclosure''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It felt--and it was advised--that the situation was not clear cut. Much factual information that passes between a taxpayer and a legal adviser could properly be obtained by the Inland Revenue to ascertain the taxpayer's liability. However, the Keith committee was firm on the question of advice, and recommended that any proposals to restrict or exclude legal professional privilege should be specifically stated in legislation. However, that has never been done.
<P>
The Keith committee also said that the taxpayer should be represented at any hearing that establishes which category a document or piece of information falls into. If the Revenue claimed that a piece of correspondence that it wanted to obtain between a law firm and a taxpayer was factual, but a taxpayer's lawyer argued that it contained advice and was covered by privilege, the matter should be decided not by the Revenue but at a hearing at which the taxpayer is represented. That important requirement has never been stated in legislation, and the situation is extremely confusing.
<P>
We should add certainty to the statute book. Such provisions should conform to the assurances that were given by Ministers and by the Keith committee, which deliberated on the matter. It concluded that what Lord Keith regarded as the status quo should persist and be given statutory backing. If the Government do not accept the new clause or propose an alternative, there will be damaging side effects. If lawyers know that the advice that they tender to a taxpayer could be obtained against their client's wishes, they might not commit their thoughts to paper. The requirement is an inefficient and unnecessary restriction on the way in which lawyers do business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My right hon. Friend makes a very important point. The situation is inefficient and might lead to professional negligence cases. There might be a dispute between what the professional adviser advised orally and what the taxpayer thought he had been advised to do. It would be better if the situation were straightened out and clarified in legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend makes an additional and compelling point.
<P>
We should also consider the fact that those who seek to evade tax by contrivances or dishonesty will probably not be caught--they will ensure that the relevant papers remain in their lawyer's possession and cannot therefore be obtained by the Inland Revenue, or they will obtain advice from lawyers who are based in other jurisdictions, a course that is not open to small companies or to taxpayers who are less well off. The well advised and the rich will almost certainly find a way round any restrictions.
<P>
For those reasons, clarity is highly desirable. We make the modest request that the proposal that Parliament previously intended, and which was urged on us by the Keith committee, should be enacted.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Wells for his remarks about our concern to ensure that all our legislation complies with the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European convention on human rights. That applies in this matter, as in all others.
<P>
As the right hon. Gentleman explained, the new clause would extend the existing protection given by a section 20 notice to legally privileged material in the hands of a lawyer to any such material. I understand the concern behind the new clause: a taxpayer who is one party to prospective litigation should not be compelled to disclose to the other--the Inland Revenue--the doubts that he may harbour about the strengths of his case. That would be contrary to the principle that one party to the proceedings should not enjoy an unfair advantage over the other. There should be ``equality of arms'' in litigation.
<P>
Nevertheless, I cannot accept or commend the clause to the Committee for two reasons. First, the existing legislation does not provide the Revenue with carte blanche to obtain legally privileged documents from taxpayers as the right hon. Gentleman seems to suggest. Secondly, the new clause would have consequences which Committee members would agree would be highly undesirable. It would obstruct the Inland Revenue's efforts to obtain the facts that it needs to ensure that tax law is applied correctly and would be tantamount to a charter for avoiders and evaders, who would be able to hide away crucial facts in communication with their lawyers. I shall explain that in a little more detail.
<P>
We do not intend to change the situation that has existed since 1976, when section 20 began to be used. Any information required under a section 20 notice has to pass the test that it may be relevant to a taxpayer's liabilities. A tax appeal commissioner must be satisfied on that score before an inspector of taxes can issue a notice. That test is already enough to deny the Inland Revenue access to most legal advice, whoever is holding it. That is because the view that a lawyer expresses about the tax consequences of a transaction, whether undertaken or merely proposed, is not relevant to the taxpayer's liability. It is ultimately for the courts to apply the law as they understand it to the facts as they find them. The views of others--in this case, the taxpayer's lawyer--on the application of the law is irrelevant.
<P>
Section 20 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 is generally no threat to legal privilege. In exceptional cases, however, it may be right for the Inland Revenue to obtain access to exchanges between lawyer and client. The clause would deny such access.
<P>
Exchanges between a lawyer and a client may occasionally be relevant to the client's tax liability because they may set out--perhaps exclusively--the full facts about a transaction. Clearly, the full facts are always needed properly to apply tax law to transactions. For example, the exchanges between lawyer and client may disclose the real purpose of a transaction in circumstances where the Inland Revenue needs to make up its own mind about whether anti-avoidance legislation, which turns on the purpose of the transaction, applies.
<P>
It is not reasonable to hide such factual information from the Revenue simply because it has been put in a document sent to a lawyer, but that is what the new clause would allow. As I said, section 20 has been in use since 1976. A recent decision by the presiding special commissioner, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, supports the view that the Inland Revenue has always taken--that it does not constitute a change in the law or an extension of the law, but supports the status quo.
<P>
The Inland Revenue's view of section 20 has caused no difficulties in the past, except to those who seek to avoid or evade tax by hiding the facts. Indeed, in the few cases that have arisen in which legally privileged material is relevant to tax liability, section 20 has been used to obtain the documents informally without recourse to the formalities of a notice. That has happened because the advisers in those cases have recognised that, under section 20, the Inland Revenue could obtain the papers by way of a formal notice, if it had to.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Why does my hon. Friend think that nothing was done about this during the 18 years of Conservative Government, but that the Opposition now say that we should change the law?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> My hon. Friend raises a pertinent question. Perhaps the right hon. Member for Wells, who tabled the new clause, will reply to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Member for Croydon, Central was obviously taking a nap during my introductory remarks. The changes are necessary because the Inland Revenue has changed its attitude and the special commissioners have passed an important judgment. So there have been changes to the position that obtained throughout the 1980s.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman has not noticed what has been happening since section 20 was introduced. The Inland Revenue has been able to rely on the threat of a possible use of its formal powers under section 20 to obtain legally privileged material informally, where that is relevant to the taxpayers' liability.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman referred to statements made by the then Chief Secretary, Joel Barnett, when section 20 was introduced in its current form in 1976. Mr. Barnett said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the purpose of this part of the schedule is not to require privileged and confidential documents to be handed over to the Inland Revenue.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I should certainly be happy to look at this to make sure that we do not infringe this particular type of confidentiality.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee E, 10 June 1976; c.686{**nrl**}7.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was in reply to an amendment tabled by Mr. Peter Rees to exempt from section 20 documents relating to the conduct of an appeal. It was not in the context of a proposed general exemption for all or any privileged material. In fact, Mr. Rees defined ``privileged documents'' for the purpose of that debate as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``opinions or confidential correspondence passing between him and his professional advisers for the purpose of an appeal or an intended appeal.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee E, 10 June 1976; c.685.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Following that exchange, the Government of the day introduced their own amendment modelled on Mr. Rees' proposal, which stands today as section 20B(2). That section gives protection to privileged documents relating to the conduct of a pending appeal.
<P>
Interestingly, at a later stage in the Committee debate on the Finance Bill 1976, the Opposition sought to go further and to introduce an amendment similar to the proposed new clause. That amendment would have extended exemption to all privileged documents, no matter who they were held by or whether they related to the conduct of an appeal. The then Chief Secretary, Joel Barnett, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I believe that Amendment (c) goes rather further than the hon. and learned Gentleman claims. I believe that he is claiming rather more privilege for the lay client than should be written into the Bill.''--[Official Report, 14 July 1976; Vol. 915, c.863.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That extension was not included in the Bill.
<P>
As the right hon. Member for Wells has also said, this matter was then reviewed in considerable detail by the Committee on Enforcement Powers of the Revenue Departments, chaired by the right hon. and noble Lord Keith of Kinkel. That committee was established in 1983 by the then Conservative Government. Lord Keith recognised that although professional privilege should generally apply for tax purposes, the Revenue should have access to privileged documents where it is necessary in order to ascertain the facts. It may assist the Committee if I quote from the conclusions of the Keith committee. They say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``As we have observed, the relationship between revenue gathering Department and taxpayer is materially different from that which prevails between two potential litigants. The Department starts with the disadvantage that it knows nothing about the affairs of the taxpayer except what the latter chooses to tell it. The Department's information powers exist to secure that it can get to know matters which, in some instances at least, the taxpayer would prefer it not to know. Legal professional privilege is capable of being manipulated so as to assist in keeping the Department in a state of ignorance, and there is some evidence that this does occur in connection with tax avoidance schemes. We consider that in certain cases the privilege in its broader aspect can have the effect of denying to the Departments access to factual material which it is reasonable that they should be permitted to know about.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I should say that the documents were instructions to a barrister from a firm of solicitors employed by the taxpayer, in which details of a possible scheme were set out. They also contained written advice to the solicitors, which explained his views on whether the scheme would successfully avoid tax. Is the Economic Secretary saying that, under the provision, those documents, which are subject to legal and professional privilege of a high order, might be disclosed to the Inland Revenue?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am grateful to the Conservative Whip for answering that question. Where a document, whether instructions from a solicitor or advice from counsel, contains facts and legal advice, the Inland Revenue would not insist--under the terms of section 20, it could not insist--on disclosure of that advice, provided that it does not form part of the relevant facts. For example, the purpose test in anti-avoidance legislation might be relevant. It would be possible, and perfectly reasonable, to delete those parts of the documents in submitted copies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Let us suppose that the barrister advises, ``Well, you couldn't do it that way, but you might like to try this.'' What would happen then?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am not an Inland Revenue officer or a presiding special commissioner. As always in such matters, the final decision rests on the facts of the individual case. However, if the taxpayer resisted an informal approach to disclose information that, in the Inland Revenue's opinion, was material to the taxpayer's liability and that, in the taxpayer's view, was professionally privileged legal advice, the matter would of course be dealt with through the tax commissioner.
<P>
In seeking to enforce taxpayers' liability as established in legislation, the Inland Revenue must not be thwarted by a small minority of tax evaders and avoiders who try to ensure that the relevant details of their activities are always and only contained in exchanges with their lawyers, and never disclosed to the Inland Revenue under any circumstances, regardless of who holds the documents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Taking the example of my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire, if we are not careful, the provision will lead to some pretty daft anomalies. In practice, the lawyer will say to his client, ``This is my advice, but I won't put it in writing for fear that it might be disclosed to the Inland Revenue.'' That is highly unsatisfactory.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Opposition Members are getting a little too worked up about the matter. The provision has formed part of the statute since 1976. If the terrible things that they describe were going to happen, we would have found out by now. Their party has not always been so concerned about protecting legal privilege and other confidential exchanges. As General Secretary of the National Council for Civil Liberties, I organised a campaign to protect the confidentiality of exchanges--between not only lawyers and clients but priests and their flocks--from the then Conservative Government's proposal to empower the police to raid without warrant and remove any and all material.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the latest interventions from the Opposition about the fear of disclosure of advice are rather worrying? There may be advice and discussions, in terms of tax avoidance, that are at the margins of legality. The Inland Revenue should have access to the advice that has been given, which should be legal and no one should be frightened of seeing it. Some of the interventions that we have heard are very telling.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> My hon. Friend makes his point well. However, legal advice will not generally be within the scope of the disclosure power conferred by section 20. Those fears are, therefore, unfounded and I hope that the right hon. Member for Wells will agree to withdraw the motion. If he does not, I shall urge my hon. Friends to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Minister's first line of response is to say that, because the matter has remained the same since 1976, there is no problem. That is a bizarre defence, because it overlooks the changes that have taken place since that first change to the law was made, both in the attitude of the Inland Revenue and its unwillingness to abide by that convention, and in the evolution of case law in the hands of the special commissioners. The combination of those factors has altered the situation. It is not a strong defence for the Government to say that change is unnecessary because it has been unnecessary in the past.
<P>
We are faced with new circumstances, and I understand that several court cases are either pending or in prospect. This is an ambiguous area, and it is therefore important that Parliament--the supreme law-making body in the country--should lay down the principles, in order to provide certainty for taxpayers and for the revenue departments. That is surely the purpose of a Finance Bill. That part of the hon. Lady's speech was a little weak.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The right hon. Gentleman suggested that there had been a change in approach by the Inland Revenue. I am advised that the Inland Revenue's internal instructions to its inspectors, which are published, have always made the position clear. There has been no change on the part of the Inland Revenue, and as I said earlier, the special commissioner in the decision to which the hon. Gentleman referred upheld the view that the Inland Revenue has always taken. There has been no change. Section 20 is quite clear.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Now we are getting nearer to the issue. The Economic Secretary helpfully said that there had been no change in the Inland Revenue's position on the matter, and no change in the challenge that it mounts to the question of professional privilege. That is a helpful clarification, although it would have been better if she had made it earlier. However, her view is not shared by practitioners who deal with those tax matters. Given those differences of view, what is wrong with an attempt to put the matter beyond doubt in statute law?
<P>
The Economic Secretary also argued that the new clause goes too far. She relied heavily on the importance of allowing the Inland Revenue to obtain the facts behind a tax case, in order to ascertain the proper liability of a taxpayer. I referred to that in my opening remarks, saying not only that it made sense but that it was what the Keith committee said. It drew a distinction between communications that are purely factual, which it would be proper for the Inland Revenue to obtain, and matters of advice, which it would not be proper for it to obtain. The Keith committee made two recommendations: first, that the taxpayer should be represented at any hearing that considers which category of information is involved; and, secondly, that if it were necessary to exclude any category of information from professional privilege, that should be done by statute. That is what we are seeking to do.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the new clause does not make it sufficiently clear what sort of information is involved, I shall happily withdraw it, but only if the Economic Secretary assures us that she will bring back a similar or improved proposal on Report. I have no interest in going against the recommendations of the Keith committee; I am simply pursuing its recommendation that the position should be made clear in statute. Unless she gives a commitment to return to the matter, we shall press the new clause to a Division. An important matter is involved, namely, the entire balance of power between revenue departments and the taxpayer.
<P>
Our efforts to seek clarity are in line with Parliament's intentions when the matter was last debated, and with the comments of Joel Barnett, He may have been responding to different amendments or new clauses, but he said that the conventions that underlie professional privilege should be observed by the Inland Revenue. It is to be regretted that that was not fully clarified at the time. We have an opportunity to clarify the position, and I hope that the Committee will take it.

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
Throughout our proceedings, we have heard much about stealth taxes. Conservative Members tried to argue that almost every change  in the Bill is some kind of stealth tax. Labour Members sometimes countered that by listing stealth taxes introduced by the previous Government. Given such opposition to the principle of stealth taxes, I hope that the new clause will receive the support of both sides of the Committee. The intention is to remove the structural flaw of personal allowances not being uprated by earnings, which allows stealth tax increases in the income tax system.
<P>
An important change in the income tax system was introduced in the Finance Bill Committee of 1977, when the so-called Rooker-Wise amendment was accepted. The amendment uprated income tax allowances by the retail price index to ensure that they maintained their real value. That was an important change, especially in a period of such high inflation. It ensured that all income tax payers, especially those on low incomes, did not see their real tax burden increase. The amendment had all-party support, and the former right hon. Member for Blaby, the noble Lord Lawson, was instrumental in promoting the debate on indexation of allowances. The amendment was taken up by then Government Back Benchers against the advice of Government Front Benchers.
<P>
The new clause seeks to build on that important change to ensure that the automatic uprating introduced by the Rooker-Wise amendment is not by the RPI, but by either the RPI or the average earnings index, whichever is higher. As earnings tend to rise more than prices--I believe that the Treasury assumes that they rise by 1.5 per cent. per annum more than the RPI--many people are brought into the tax system and have a higher proportion of their earnings taxed every year because allowances increase only, by the RPI. That is known, in the jargon, as the real fiscal drag. It is good news for Chancellors preparing their Budgets, because if average earnings are rising more than inflation they can seem to give away money, even though they have not increased taxes elsewhere. That is a positive sum gain for Chancellors--they can be a father Christmas without having to make a raid elsewhere.
<P>
That is stealth. The Treasury is collecting extra tax revenue without having to account for it. Unless personal allowances increase by average earnings, that will continue. Over a long period, the value of the personal allowance has fallen in relation to average earnings. The Rooker-Wise amendment maintained real value, which has been good, but the fall in relation to average earnings is worrying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Roger Casale </B>(Wimbledon): I think I am right in saying that the hon. Gentleman's party is keen to put an extra penny on income tax, which would increase the total tax paid. He now seems to be arguing for an increase in allowances, which would reduce the total and neutralise the effect of the extra penny. Is he suggesting that a second penny should be put on income tax? Alternatively, if the extra penny is to be neutralised, would the Liberal Democrats not be better advised to drop both policies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has not been following the development of Liberal Democrat policy, which has been published in documents and alternative Budgets, and discussed in this Committee. We have set out our aim of increasing the personal allowance to £10,000 over the course of two Parliaments, and we have explained where that money would come from. We have had exchanges with the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie), who always produces tedious Library briefs and assumes that they prove something. Our proposal is more modest than our official party policy. We have tabled the new clause in this very modest form to try to win cross-party support. Had I tabled an amendment to ensure that the personal income tax allowance went up to £10,000 over the next eight to 10 years, I am sure that I would not have won the support of Labour Members. However, this proposal is far more modest, and I hope that they will support it for that reason and because of the need to prevent stealth taxes, on which Labour Members sometimes seem rather keen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Love:</B> Increases can also be calculated by the increase in the level of affluence in society, rather than by the increase in the level of inflation. That relates to whether benefits such as social security and the old-age pension should be calculated in relation to increasing affluence in society. Which of those two would take priority for the Opposition?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. In times past, the basic state pension increased in line with prices or earnings, whichever was the higher. The Conservative party broke that link--I think it was in the 1980 Budget--and I remember Labour Members on the stump in later years being critical of the breaking of that link. In many ways, it would be good to see it restored. The hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) has a point. However, we are debating how that should relate to the tax system.
<P>
It is important that the personal income tax allowance, the fairest and most progressive part of the tax system, should be increased every year according to earnings. Let me remind hon. Members of the progressive nature of the personal income tax allowance. This is best encapsulated in a phrase used by a member of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, who described it as the poll tax in reverse. The poll tax was unfair because it was a lump sum tax that everyone paid. The personal income tax allowance is the opposite, because everyone gets a lump sum of tax-free income. Therefore, one should concentrate on this area if one wants to promote a fair tax system and to use the tax system to promote social justice. That is why Liberal Democrat policy seeks to channel resources into this area, and that is why we tabled the new clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain why a lump sum that everyone, including the wealthiest in society, receives is necessarily the fairest conceivable tax system? I do not think that the one necessarily follows from the other.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Unless the hon. Gentleman wants personal income tax allowances to be tapered away as income rises--as is the case with age-related allowances, although never with personal income tax allowances--one could not have the sorts of policies that he implies. I have always considered it to be the received wisdom and the view of all parties that the personal income tax allowance was the fairest part of the system. That is why the Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food--then simply the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker)--and the hon. Member for Preston (Audrey Wise)--then the hon. Member for Coventry, South-West--tabled their amendment, years ago. They realised how the personal tax allowance brought fairness into the tax system and protected the poor. In the deliberations on the 1977 Finance Bill, the hon. Member for Preston said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is convenient for Governments to allow the tax allowances to be eroded but not convenient for people at what members of the Government are so fond of calling the sharp end''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in other words, the poorest people. She went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In practice it is a rather dishonest system from which we should escape.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 14 June 1977; c. 457.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She was right, and the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr was right to index allowances. We are seeking to build on the progressive advance that they led. The proposal is important, because it would ensure that the House can debate occasions when Governments try to move away from this automatic uprating, as they have sometimes done despite the Rooker-Wise amendment.
<P>
The previous Government uprated allowances by more than the rate of inflation on a number of occasions. That was a welcome and progressive move. They did not make many such moves, but they made some in respect of allowances. However, the freezing of allowances in the 1981-82, 1993-94 and 1994-95 Budgets created a great deal of hardship, particularly the former.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In the 1993 Finance Bill, the Conservative Government wanted to freeze allowances, but the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``There must be no taxation by stealth.''--[Official Report, 12 May 1993; Vol. 224, c. 842.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He was right then, and the new clause, which is modest and would protect the poorest in society, is right now.
<P>
The House of Commons Library, which provides statistics not just for the hon. Member for Shipley but for others, informs me that, in the next financial year, the provision would cost £0.4 billion. That is a relatively modest sum, which would gradually and progressively increase over time. I would expect Ministers to support such a measure, and I recommend the new clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> This is another typically irresponsible Liberal provision. It does not resemble the Rooker-Wise amendment in any way--it is more like the Morecambe and Wise amendment. In 1977, the Rooker-Wise amendment enabled people to retain real purchasing power in tax allowance terms, but the new clause would constitute a stealth tax. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said that he would like to jack up--I am not alluding to the right hon. Member for Fylde--allowances to £10,000. However, he has accepted that such a proposal is ridiculous, and could not be funded through his proposed remedy of an environmental tax without causing economic collapse. Instead, he proposes the indexing of allowances to wages and tells the Committee, ``Don't worry, it would cost only £400 million, and we have a few pounds in the Exchequer.'' In reality, by 2009-10, the proposal would cost £5 billion a year. The difference between wages and inflation is 1.5 per cent; at low levels of inflation, the rate of real growth is enormous. The provision is quite irresponsible,
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I recognise the hon. Gentleman's figures. He is describing the stealth taxes to which those who fail to support the new clause will have signed up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My point is that the Rooker-Wise amendment ensures that the allowance maintains the same real purchasing power. The new clause is a stealth tax that would cost £5 billion. We should not give away such sums in the glib manner to which the Liberals are prone.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> As the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said, unless Parliament decides otherwise, income tax allowances are uprated automatically each year, in line with increases in the retail prices index. As a result of the new clause, allowances would instead be uprated in line with the retail prices index increase or the average earnings index increase, whichever was higher. The new clause would be inconsistent with other provisions in the Taxes Act, and would not be an efficient or sensible use of resources.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer made it clear that the Government want tax cuts to target areas in which resources are most needed. That is what the package of reforms announced in the Budget is carefully designed to do. This proposal risks unbalancing that package. The provisions of new clause 9 would apply only to income tax allowances. As the hon. Gentleman and the Committee will know, statutory indexation based on the retail price index is currently used in other parts of the Taxes Act. The most obvious example is the indexation of the limits for income tax bands. There is no reason to retain one set of rules for uprating rate band limits while introducing a new set for uprating allowances. I am sure that the Committee does not want to increase the complexity of the income tax rules by introducing such differences. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton may laugh, but that has been a feature of some of the discussions in Committee and on the Floor of the House. Indeed, Liberal Democrat Members have made points about complexity, so they have a duty to ensure that such a new clause would not add to it.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central and others spoke about the true cost of the new clause. The Government estimate that new clause 9 would result in an additional cost of about £570 million. Uprating allowances and rate bands according to the proposed new formula would cost about £750 million annually.
<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for figures on how much the implementation of the proposal would cost. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton wants not only the uprating of allowances in line with earnings, but a starting point of £10,000, which would add further to the cost of the proposal. I presume that the hon. Gentleman's party would want allowances to continue to be raised in line with earnings thereafter, so the costs would be astronomical.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Indeed. I had not followed the Liberal Democrat party's policy development, but development has clearly taken place. It proposes such policies time and again, not only on fiscal matters but on expenditure, and never reconciles the consequences. It is not direct with the electorate about how its policies would work in the round.
<P>
In delivering a Budget package, any Government should try to strike a reasonable balance in terms of matching resources to need. We have done that. Income tax rates have been cut to improve work incentives and help make work pay. Increases in child benefit have been announced for families with children. The working families tax credit and children's tax credit are being introduced. We are helping families whether they pay tax or not, and targeting help on those with lower incomes. I have outlined what the Government are doing for pensioners.
<P>
That package of targeted tax and benefit reforms means that those who most need help will get it. At the same time, allowing statutory indexation to apply to income tax allowances and rate bands limits for 1999-2000 prevents the value of those allowances and limits from being eroded by inflation. New clause 9 would tend to lead to higher increases in the value of allowances each year. That may be no bad thing in itself, but it is badly targeted. The Committee will be aware of two points. First, any increase in tax allowances only helps those with enough income to pay tax. Unlike measures in the Budget, some of which I have outlined, such an increase does nothing for those families and pensioners who are too poor to pay any income tax. Secondly, increasing the personal allowance gives the biggest cash gain to higher rate taxpayers.
<P>
Indeed, such increases would give a higher-rate taxpayer four times more than someone who pays tax only at the starting rate. That argument has not been propounded by Liberal Democrat Members in this context.
<P>
I have explained why the new clause would get the balance wrong and how it would damage the effective and efficient use of resources. My hon. Friends and I pointed out that the associated costs would be high, and I urge the Committee to resist it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I am extremely disappointed that the Government will not take this opportunity to ensure that fairness is enshrined in the tax system. The Financial Secretary said that a targeted approach was not involved, but the contrary is the case. That has been accepted by the Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the hon. Member for Preston, and by most commentators.
<P>
The Financial Secretary said that the new clause would complicate the tax rules and that that was inconsistent with Opposition Members criticisms about the extra complexities that the Bill will introduce into the tax system. However, the new clause's complexities would apply to the Inland Revenue and to the Government but not to individual taxpayers. The Government have made the income tax system far more complicated for the poor taxpayers who are trying to fill in a tax return. The new clause would not affect the individual taxpayer, and the Government's argument in this context does not hold water.
<P>
We shall seek to divide the Committee on the new clause. I hope that Committee members who want greater fairness in the tax system will support it.
