Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): On a point of order,
Mr. Cook. I welcome you to the Chair of the Committee. You
will probably be aware that there is a ways and means resolution
relating to the Bill scheduled for debate on the Floor of the House on
Thursday. However, it appears that, if there were a statement on the
Floor of the House, members of the Committee would not be able to take
part in the discussion of  the ways and means resolution. Have
you received  any representations on the timing of that debate,
or any other aspect, in terms of the ability for members of the
Committee to participate, given that the matter is directly relevant to
the Bill? It seems strange that the debate is scheduled at potentially
the same time as the Committee is sitting, with members of the
Committee unable to participate in one or the
other.</div><a name="10020254000013"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000314"></a>The

whatever is necessary to try to discover what the position is. I have
to say, as one who has been here for 27 years, that that is not a novel
situation&#151;it has happened on many occasions in the past. I will
do whatever I can to discover the
circumstances.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000317"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr. Cook. We have a number of matters to
debate, some of which, I am sure, Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition will
scrutinise in a very productive and positive way. Certain provisions
later in the Bill are likely to prove much more controversial, and we
look forward to those important debates.</div>
<a name="10020254000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 1 and
amendment 1 deal with powers of stop- and-search. Government
changes to the requirements on recording information from stops and
searches reflect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>their understandable desire to reduce police bureaucracy in an
appropriate way. That is part of the wider issue of the police&#146;s
ability to get on with their job, with the elements of discretion and
flexibility they need to protect our communities in an appropriate
fashion. Clearly, the police cannot get on with that job if the Home
Department is always breathing down their neck and if they are tied up
with bureaucracy, paperwork and red tape that prevent them from
actively carrying on with their duties. That is a concern in the light
of the fact that the police spend more of their time filling in forms
and doing paperwork than on the beat: just 14 per cent. of police
officers&#146; time is spent on patrol compared with 22 per cent. of
their time spent on paperwork.</div>
<a name="10020254000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The culture
of bureaucracy that has grown up under this Government is clearly a big
issue. It was interesting to note the evidence given to the Committee
last week by Paul McKeever, the chairman of the Police Federation, who
said:</div><a name="10020254000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
you look at police bureaucracy generally, there is an awful lot of it
out there, and it would take an awful lot more than just dealing with
stop-and-search to put it
right.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Crime and
Security Public Bill Committee, </i>26 January 2010; c. 13,
Q30.]</div><a name="10020254000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
we are dealing with stop-and-search specifically in clause 1. It is
important that steps are taken to deal with some of the
bureaucracy&#151;the form-filling requirements and the
paperwork&#151;that sits alongside powers of stop-and-search under
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the associated regulatory
burden. The Conservatives would go further than the Government propose.
That is part of the reason for tabling the amendment. We also believe
that the bureaucratic requirements and the paperwork relating to
stop-and-account are too onerous and question whether they add a great
deal in terms of police intelligence information, or the need for
proper assessments on how the police utilise those
powers.</div><a name="10020254000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a clear need for the police to have the right to stop and search
someone for stolen or prohibited items if they have reasonable
suspicion, which is what the powers under section 1 of PACE allow.
Carrying out searches to identify whether people are carrying drugs or
weapons in our community is clearly useful. It is certainly a
significant power and is heavily utilised: in 2007-08, 1,035,438 people
were stopped and searched under section 1 of PACE and connected powers
under the Firearms Act 1968 and the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Thinking
about the regulatory burden and the attached paperwork, we note that
Sir Ronnie Flanagan&#146;s interim report on policing suggested that
the total recording and administration time for a stop-and-search form
was 25 minutes. In that context, we also have to consider that about 11
per cent. of those stopped and searched are arrested as a result of the
search. It is interesting to consider the important role that
technology can play in recording information taken on
stops-and-searches.</div>
<a name="10020254000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I have
patrolled with the police, it has been interesting to see the powers
used in connection with drugs dogs, for example: if a drugs dog
indicates that someone might be in possession of an illicit substance,
obviously a stop-and-search should be conducted because that is
reasonable suspicion. Therefore, on such operations, it is
understandable that there is significant use of stop-and-search if
grounds for reasonable suspicion 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>have been identified. However, there needs to be clear trust and
confidence on the part of the community in how the power is
used.</div>
<a name="10020254000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 1 of
PACE was, in part, a response to the Scarman report on the Brixton
riots and, therefore,  the need to retain trust and confidence
in how the police use the powers, which are obviously potentially
intrusive. Knife arches and other electronic scanners may have made
them slightly less intrusive in terms of avoiding the necessity for a
pat-down search, but such searches are still utilised and still needed,
so there is a need for trust and confidence in how the police organise
searches and how they utilise their powers. That feeds into how data
are recorded and utilised. The practice of recording stop-and-account
was developed after the Macpherson report into the killing of Stephen
Lawrence, and there is a similar desire to give trust and confidence to
the community on the levels of information recorded to ensure that
those powers are used
appropriately.</div><a name="10020254000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
is the appropriate level of reporting on stops-and-searches to provide
that confidence and how can reporting be conducted so as not to impede
operational police requirements unnecessarily? The balance is reflected
in clause 1 and amendment 1. The concept is recognised in Sir Ronnie
Flanagan&#146;s report on policing and Jan Berry&#146;s review on
reducing police bureaucracy. She gave evidence to the Committee last
week and is the Government&#146;s police bureaucracy tsar.
Information relating to stops-and-searches needs to be recorded, but
the current process is simply too
bureaucratic.</div><a name="10020254000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
1 would ensure that the information may be recorded by means other than
written notification&#151;the completion of a form. In other words,
it clearly and explicitly provides for the utilisation of technology. I
am aware that the British Transport police, for example, are starting
to use personal digital assistants&#151;PDAs&#151;to record some of
the information required for a stop-and-search. The relevant
information can be recorded and retained by, for example, an officer
radioing through the basic details of the search to create a digitally
taped or transcribed police log at the centre with no forms. That would
ensure that stops-and-searches would still be recorded but without the
burden of having to fill in a form at the scene and a further form back
at the police
station.</div><a name="10020254000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Flanagan review contemplated stop-and-search information being recorded
in that way and amendment 1 provides the necessary level of flexibility
to enable that to happen. Obviously the introduction of new Airwave
technology across police forces makes that more readily achievable. We
believe that that would be a practical means of ensuring that
information is recorded. It would provide reassurance to communities
and reduce bureaucracy, thereby freeing up officers&#146; time to
remain in communities, to be proactive in their policing and to ensure
that evidence is gathered in an appropriate
way.</div><a name="10020254000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham
made the case last week for modifying the information requirements as
proposed in amendments 51 and 52. We will listen closely to the points
he makes on those amendments. On the question of recording the identity
of the person searched, I heard the Minister&#146;s statement last
week that the information does not have to be provided by the person
searched, which in part explains why it was felt that making the
requirement mandatory might not be
appropriate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div><a name="10020254000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020254000318"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Douglas Hogg</b> (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con): My hon.
Friend will see that the word &#147;stated&#148; appears before
&#147;name and address&#148; in amendment 51. It would not be a
mandatory requirement to supply it, but if it were supplied then it
should be
recorded.</div><a name="10020254000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000319"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My right hon. and learned Friend makes an
important point. It was clear from what Jan Berry told the Committee
that if information is given and if intelligence is provided to the
police that may be relevant and useful, it should be retained in some
way. Even if that amendment were not accepted by the Minister, I take
it that that information would be recorded in some other way, such as a
note in the police officer&#146;s record. Jan Berry made a clear
point when she
said:</div><a name="10020254000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
would not want them to see the lack of requirement to record details as
a reason not to collect
intelligence.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Crime
and Security Public Bill Committee, </i>26 January 2010; c. 5,
Q9.]</div><a name="10020254000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a question of balancing the statutory requirements in the Bill and
the amendments to PACE regarding the mandated requirements for the
types of information to be recorded, against the need to ensure that
relevant intelligence is protected. If there is information that a
suspect was in a particular area at a particular time, that may be
useful intelligence that could be captured. I suppose that how the
police might seek to use that intelligence is a question of judgment
and degree. It will be interesting to hear not only what my right hon.
and learned Friend says in support of his amendments, but how the
Minister of State envisages the intelligence being retained, which may
not be specifically set down in the
statute.</div><a name="10020254000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister of State has made a number of claims about the time that will
be saved by the proposals in the Bill. Any reduction in police
bureaucracy is certainly extremely welcome, given the way that it has
burgeoned over the past 12 years, but would the full extent of the time
savings be realised if intelligence information were being collated in
a different way? If the names that are given and perhaps other details
are to be recorded, will that fully utilise the amount of time saved to
which the right hon. Gentleman alluded last week? It would be useful to
understand how he arrived at the calculation of the time saved. Did the
calculation take account of the need to collect certain intelligence
over and above the statutory requirements that may be set out in
the Bill?</div>
<a name="10020254000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">This will be
a useful debate, putting into the frame the pressures and bureaucracy
that the police have to deal with. As the Police Federation said, this
is a small step. Clearly there is much further to go in dealing with
the wider bureaucracy and paperwork that the police
face.</div><a name="10020254000285"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000320"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> First, Mr. Cook, let me declare a
personal interest, in that I am a criminal barrister practising in the
criminal courts. Might I declare that now and not again? Secondly, it
is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. You reminded me that we
last appeared on a Committee together a long time ago, on the Firearms
(Amendment) Bill in 1987. A further bit of background information is
that I happened to be the Whip on the second Committee stage of the
Bill that became the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, which this Bill
amends in a number of respects. I recall that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>there were two considerations of that Bill by Committee; first David
Mellor was the Whip on duty, and thereafter I was, taking the Bill
through to enactment. I make that point by way of a preamble; it only
suggests that I have been here a very long
time.</div><a name="10020254000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
1, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch, makes a lot of
good sense but it does not need to go in the Bill. It is about
modalities, and I am in favour of not putting in the Bill a modality
that may be overtaken in time by technology. However, he is clearly
right in the substance of his suggestion: the police should, wherever
possible, try to use modem technology to reduce the bureaucratic burden
that they
face.</div><a name="10020254000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point before I come to my two amendments is that I have served
as a special constable on the beat in the metropolitan area. I was
attached to Cannon Row police station in the mid 1970s, and patrolled
around Trafalgar and Parliament squares and up to Waterloo place. Also,
the Committee will appreciate that as a criminal barrister, I have been
in many courts and seen many clients.</div>
<a name="10020254000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">One has to be
ware of the police. I believe that even today there is a certain amount
of abuse, generally defined. As a special constable and as a junior
barrister, I saw and became conscious of a lot of abuse. Therefore,
when one says that one has to do away with bureaucracy, in one sense
that is right&#151;of course one must. But one must also keep in mind
that the police are capable of abusing their power and not so relax the
restrictions and constraints that abuse of power is not
identifiable.</div><a name="10020254000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
always say in Committee and on the Floor of the House that when one
gives power to the agents of the state, one has to recognise that
inevitably, in time and on occasion, that power will be abused.
Consequently, one gives away as little power as one reasonably can,
and, when one gives it away, one hedges it about with restrictions and
constraints, because we owe that duty to the citizen. Therefore, beware
of bureaucracy of course, but remember too that the restrictions are
often for the protection of the citizen&#151;including the young
citizen. When I first entered Parliament in 1979-80, there was a
tremendous continuing row about the Vagrancy Act 1824, which contained
the old stop-and-search powers. It caused immense rows on the streets
of London, especially among the ethnic minorities. We must be careful
not to so relax the restrictions that real anxiety about the use of
stop-and-search breaks out again among the ethnic
minorities.</div><a name="10020254000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have two brief points about my own amendments. Amendment 51 goes to
name and address. I accept that there is no requirement, as a general
proposition, for a citizen to furnish his name and address to a police
officer who stops him in the street. There are circumstances when he
has to, but generally speaking I believe there is no requirement.
However, it is often desirable to find out the name and address, and
there is nothing to stop a police officer saying, &#147;Excuse me
sir, do you mind giving me your name and address?&#148; If the person
gives it, there is merit in recording it. It is not a great burden to
record it. Indeed, I noticed in the first evidence session that
Mr. McKeever said that he had no particular problem with the
suggestion.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div><a name="10020254000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why does one
need the information? Perhaps for intelligence&#151;perhaps someone
has given the wrong name and one subsequently checks it. It is quite
interesting that he has given the wrong name. Why? What if he
complains? An officer may know exactly with whom he is dealing. I see
merit, if the name is volunteered, in recording it&#151;that is no
great shakes. If my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch is right
about the method of recording it, down it goes through the radio
communication and that is that. I would have the measure, on the sort
of terms that I have suggested.</div>
<a name="10020254000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
point, about ethnicity, is quite different. I worry about that, insofar
as the Bill suggests that it is the officer stopping the person who is
required to state that person&#146;s ethnic origins. New subsection
(6A)(a) of section 3 of PACE refers
to</div><a name="10020254000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
ethnic origins of the person as described by the
person&#148;.</div><a name="10020254000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
clearly indicates to me that the constable says to the chap he has
stopped, &#147;What is your ethnic origin?&#148;  I would
be chary about that. I walked the streets as  a special
constable and I do not think that that is a prudent question to ask. It
is potentially confrontational. What happens if he replies,
&#147;Human race.&#148;? The officer is not going to be very happy
with that. There would be that kind of answer, let me tell you,
Mr. Cook. That is certainly the sort of answer one might get
from a lad on the street. What does one do then? Take it further? If
the officer asks, &#147;What is your origin?&#148; the answer could
be, &#147;What the hell has it got to do with you, officer?&#148;
What does one say then? Or it could be, &#147;Look&#151;make up
your own mind, officer.&#148; There are lots of variations. Why
introduce a confrontational note? The truth is that when an officer
stops somebody, he can make his own assessment as to ethnic origins and
record it.</div>
<a name="10020254000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I was
standing at Trafalgar square as a special constable, there would often
be a radio message up from Parliament, but it was not very
praiseworthy. It was, &#147;RC3&#151;where&#146;s the
stop?&#148; RC3 in those days had a meaning, although I forget what
it was. I was being told by a constable down in Parliament square that
I might stop somebody coming up in a beaten old Vauxhall. An officer on
the street can well identify ethnic origins and record them for him or
herself, without there being any confrontation between that officer and
the person
stopped.</div><a name="10020254000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020254000321"></a><b class="B">Tom

human race,&#148; to fill in the form in the way that he wants them

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000322"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> That is possible. &#147;I am a member of the human
race&#148; is not a very informative reply, but it potentially causes
aggro and confrontation. My last point, unless anyone else intervenes,
is that we would be well advised not to put in the requirement for the
constable to initiate the question; better to leave it to the
constable&#146;s perception and
judgment.</div><a name="10020254000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000323"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Amendment 1 has some merit. I will listen carefully
to what the Minister says in response. We would probably all support
the use of electronic means to log details, as a way of reducing the
amount of time that officers spend on paperwork and the number of
double entries required when manual records are taken and subsequently
entered at a later date.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div><a name="10020254000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000324"></a>The
Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism (Mr.
David Hanson):</b> Welcome to the Chair, Mr. Cook,
following your co-Chairman, Sir Nicholas. I wish you a successful time.
You will be chairing for the majority of the week, and I look forward
to it a great deal.</div>
<a name="10020254000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I say
to the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham
that I am sure that I would also have been on the Committee in 1987
with him and you, Mr. Cook, had I not failed to get elected
in that year&#146;s election in the constituency in which I currently
reside. I would have loved to have served on that Committee and will
certainly look at the PACE proceedings in <i class="I">Hansard</i> when I have a
quiet
moment.</div><a name="10020254000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is consensus on this Committee. We all wish to reduce police
bureaucracy and to improve the use of technology to record what we need
to record if we are  to have the information we need. I
genuinely offer the hand of friendship to the hon. Member for
Hornchurch and say that the Government do not disagree with the
Opposition on those issues. We need to look at whether our proposals in
the Bill will meet those obligations and whether the amendments will
help to improve the situation. That is what we are all jointly trying
to
achieve.</div><a name="10020254000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman will be aware that Jan Berry not only gave evidence to
the Committee last week, but produced a report for the Government
before Christmas, which we incorporated into the White Paper. There are
some 39 recommendations to reduce bureaucracy; we have accepted 13 and
are working on the others. We have also commissioned Jan to do a second
year&#146;s work, so we are trying to adopt a general direction of
travel.</div><a name="10020254000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the amendment will be withdrawn, because it and amendments 51
and 52, tabled by the right hon. and learned Gentleman, would add to
police work and to bureaucracy for officers on the front line. The
existing requirement for the record of a stop-and-search to be made in
writing does not preclude electronic records in any way, shape or form.
Indeed, the PACE code of practice already provides guidance on the use
of electronic records for stop and search, such as those made on
BlackBerrys and PDAs, by forces that wish to use such technology. As of
today, nine forces are recording relevant encounters through electronic
means.</div>
<a name="10020254000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would not
be appropriate for a record to be made solely by means of a voice
message, as it needs to be possible for individuals to be able to
obtain a written record of the stop-and-search after the event.
Technology is being explored that would turn voice messages into
electronic or written records. That is not possible at present, but
PACE would not preclude it, should we develop the technology further,
as I hope we will. Only one force has looked into the practicality of
voice messaging. I am not against that in principle and we will
consider it in due
course.</div><a name="10020254000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000325"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My question arises from Sir Ronnie
Flanagan&#146;s review, Jan Berry&#146;s recommendations on
stop-and-account, and the guidance proposals that stop-and-account
information should be retained and recorded via a radio message. How is
that practice developing and how is it being utilised? There are some
parallels with stop-and-search, and Sir Ronnie Flanagan&#146;s report
flagged it up as a future
development.</div><a name="10020254000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000326"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> We continue to work on that recommendation. Sir
Ronnie Flanagan&#146;s report was published in February 2008 and
recommended using 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div>Airwave, the police radio system, to record stop-and-account encounters.
Some 24 forces are using it at present, and as I said during my
evidence to the Committee, we want to continue to develop that
recommendation, not only through the Airwave system, but through other
electronic
technology.</div><a name="10020254000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no disagreement in the Committee about the desire to improve the use
of technology to speed up the automatic collection of information.
Indeed, I indicated during my evidence last Thursday that the Bill
reduces the number of items to be recorded from 12 to seven. Of those
seven items, three can already be automatically recorded by a number of
forces, and all forces will be able to record them through Airwave when
it is fully utilised in the near future. The date, time and place of
the stop-and-search will therefore be recorded by automatic use of the
Airwave
system.</div><a name="10020254000286"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="10020254000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Included
in the provisions of clause 1 are the four remaining items: ethnicity,
object of search, grounds for search and identity of the officer
carrying out the stop-and-search. There is certainly no disagreement
between us. Mobile technological solutions using both Airwave and
electronic devices are being explored further as part of our concerted
effort to reduce the bureaucracy faced by front-line officers, and
ultimately to improve the service to the public at large&#151;a
concern that we  all
share.</div><a name="10020254000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000327"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> The Minister of State will recall that last
Thursday he was not able to give the Committee details about the
assumptions that were made in arriving at the figure of a saving of
200,000 hours each year. Is he now in a position to fill in Committee
members on precisely what assumptions were made about the number of
times that officers would perhaps capture the whole data because they
felt that they were necessary for possible future
investigations?</div><a name="10020254000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000328"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> That question was also raised by other members of
the Committee in the initial debate. I was going to refer to it later,
but I might as well do so now. I hope the hon. Member for Carshalton
and Wallington accepts that the figure is an assumption, which may be
out or may be right. We have estimated that 12 minutes is saved by
reducing the recording of the information. We have based that estimate
on the savings that have been made on stop-and-account timings. We have
assessed officer time at about 12 minutes per stop, and have multiplied
that by the number of stops and searches conducted in 2007-08. It is
not an exact science because there may be more or fewer searches this
year than in 2007-08, but it gives us a simple mathematical conclusion
of 200,000 hours. It is never an exact science; we  can but
try.</div><a name="10020254000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
has been mentioned, we have via the Home Office and the National
Policing Improvement Agency invested &#163;80 million in 32,000
mobile devices, bringing to almost 42,000 the number of such devices in
operational use by the police. They are used to carry out checks on the
police national computer and to send information back and forth. I wish
to see that use of technology continued. I do not believe that the
amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hornchurch would add to where
we are, because we are already travelling in that direction. Amending
the Bill in that way would not change anything, and would potentially
add to the time taken.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 149</div><a name="10020254000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 51
would increase the recording requirements of the search, to include a
person&#146;s stated name and address. I am repeating myself, in the
sense that I said to the Committee last Thursday that there is no
requirement for that at present, which was acknowledged by the right
hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham in his
contribution. However, there is a requirement to record a
person&#146;s name if the constable knows it, and/or, if he so
wishes, a description of the person. As the Committee discussed last
week, it might be of value in some stop-and-search encounters if it
were open to the officer to ask for the information and, if required by
the circumstances, to record it. However, it is important to reflect on
what Jan Berry said in her submission to the Committee last
week&#151;that those matters are best left to the discretion of the
officer involved. There is an option to record the information, but it
is down to the discretion of the officer involved. Making that a
requirement would ensure that we were not achieving what we were trying
to do, which is to reduce the bureaucracy involved in having that
information to hand. The discretion to record it is still there.
Self-evidently, when a person is arrested and taken to a police station
following a stop-and-search, their name and address will be established
and recorded in the custody suite, as is normal
practice.</div><a name="10020254000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
52 deals with the question of self-defined ethnicity. The amendment
requires only the officer to record the self-defined ethnicity of the
individual. We are not at this stage simply by chance. We are at this
stage because recommendation 61 of the Macpherson report into the death
of Stephen Lawrence requires the self-determined ethnicity of the
individual to be recorded. If I accepted the amendment tabled by the
right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham, I would
be moving away from a core recommendation of that report. I do not
think that would be welcomed by the ethnic minority communities, or
give them extra confidence in the police and how they
operate.</div>
<a name="10020254000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is already
a requirement to record self-defined ethnicity. There is a code that a
constable can use when a person refuses to state their ethnic origin. I
wholeheartedly accept the many practical examples presented by the
right hon. and learned Gentleman. I am sure that they will be common
practice on the several days of the week and several months of the year
when those things happen. I accept that entirely. In the event of that
occurring, the officer can currently record the ethnic origin as
&#147;not stated&#148;.</div>
<a name="10020254000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000329"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I have some difficulty in seeing why an officer
should ask that question. What is the merit in asking that question
when one could look at the person stopped and form one&#146;s own
judgment? Why ask the person who has been stopped to state what he or
she thinks is their ethnic origin?</div>
<a name="10020254000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000330"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I go back to first principles. A person&#146;s
ethnic perception is in the ownership of that individual. It is their
judgment. If I was asked to describe myself, I would describe what I
believe I am. It is not for someone else to make a judgment on my
ethnic perception. We should remember that the Macpherson report is
about confidence for black and minority ethnic communities. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>If I accepted the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s proposition,
I would undoubtedly face criticism, discussion, and a failure of
confidence, from many people in ethnic communities, in policing in the
wider world. We would have overturned a key recommendation of the
Macpherson report on Stephen Lawrence&#151;that the self-defined
ethnicity of an individual is the key to defining their ethnic
background.</div>
<a name="10020254000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">There may be
honest disagreement about that, and I can see that the right hon. and
learned Gentleman does not agree with that proposition, but I will
stick to the recommendations of the Macpherson report. The perception
of the officer is not the crucial aspect; it is the perception of the
individual who is stopped and searched. That ethnicity and ethnic
background belongs to them, not to the
officer.</div>
<a name="10020254000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000331"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Clearly, there are merits in the police knowing, in
general terms, the racial background of the people they stop, so that
when they construct statistics they can say that of the people they
stopped, x proportion came from the ethnic minorities. There may well
be merit in that, and that flows from the officer&#146;s perception
of the ethnic origin. I do not see that the person&#146;s personal
identification of his or her ethnic origins adds to that one
jot.</div>
<a name="10020254000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000332"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> It boils down to the determination of what an
individual thinks they are, and what a police officer thinks they are.
Let me just put one other point to the right hon. and learned
Gentleman. Shortly, in the next eighteen months or so, a further census
will be undertaken. We do not allow people to have what the police or
the census officer believe is their
ethnic&#151;</div><a name="10020254000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000333"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> They do not see
them.</div><a name="10020254000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000334"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The point is that it is the individual who defines
their ethnic background on the census form, because that is how they
define themselves. I have fairly swarthy colouring; I could be defined
as something that might not be the same as an officer might
think.</div><a name="10020254000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020254000335"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Simon Burns</b> (West Chelmsford) (Con): Like
what?</div><a name="10020254000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000336"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I do not know, I am simply saying that I would
define myself as one thing and an officer might define me as something
else. The situation is down to an individual&#146;s
self-definition.</div><a name="10020254000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020254000337"></a><b class="B">Shona
McIsaac</b> (Cleethorpes) (Lab): If it assists my right hon.
Friend, my husband has been variously described by others as Pakistani,
Iranian, Italian, Turkish and Spanish. In fact, he was born and brought
up in Northern Ireland. That shows that people&#146;s perceptions can
be wide of the
mark.</div><a name="10020254000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000338"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> My hon. Friend makes a very fair point. The point
I was making about myself is that I am British-born and British-bred
but I suspect that somewhere downstream there might have been someone
from the Spanish armada or a Roman soldier in my family to give me my
colouring. A police officer&#146;s judgment of the colour of an
individual&#151;as my hon. Friend mentioned&#151;might differ from
the individual&#146;s perception of their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div>ethnicity. Macpherson&#146;s recommendation 61 is about
self-definition of ethnicity and I wish to maintain that
principle.</div><a name="10020254000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000339"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I would like to go back to the point that I made to
the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham. If an
officer is given the response, &#147;I am a member of the human
race&#148;, he might choose to enter the ethnic minority category he
thinks appropriate. In practice, no one would be able to stop that
officer&#151;apart from ensuring that he has training&#151;entering
a definition that he has chosen
himself.</div>
<a name="10020254000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000340"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The crucial point is that numbers recorded as a
result of ethnic assessment by the officer or the individual in cases
such as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, are reflected in statistics on
the numbers of that particular ethnic group who are stopped and
searched.</div>
<a name="10020254000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
danger of officers entering what they believe to be the ethnic origin
of an individual. I would much rather have self-defined ethnic origins
recorded as x number of white Caucasians, x number of Chinese, 
x number of Asians, x number of whatever people determine, and a
percentage &#147;not stated&#148;. That could be anything from
white to deepest black. I would rather have that, than an officer
making a judgment that bumps up the calculations of an ethnic minority
on those forms.</div>
<a name="10020254000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
honest disagreement. I always try to seek consensus in these matters
and the Government will, as I am sure will the Opposition, continue to
drive down bureaucracy and use electronic and new technology to improve
the collection of information. However, I cannot accept the amendments
and I hope they will not be
pressed.</div><a name="10020254000077"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000341"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> This has been a helpful and useful debate in
setting out where the Government and police are in the use of
technology to assist in the process of maintaining information and
recording details where required. It was interesting that the Minister
rightly alighted on Jan Berry&#146;s point about giving the police
greater discretion. That is very important, not simply in this debate,
but more generally in relation to police activities.</div>
<a name="10020254000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
slightly glossed over Jan Berry&#146;s corollary point that if
something was not prescribed, would it mean that intelligence was not
gathered? I am not in favour of a box-ticking culture but because of
the way in which process, form-filling and bureaucracy have become a
day-to-day part of policing, there is a wider need to change the
culture. That was perhaps what Jan Berry&#146;s comments
addressed&#151;the need for giving discretion but also for a cultural
shift. She expressed concern that there should not, as a consequence of
the change, be any loss or lack of intelligence as a result of the
pervasive box-ticking mentality. Intelligence will still be required,
where appropriate. The use of technology and the development of systems
for recording information are important steps forward in day-to-day
policing and in freeing up police time. It was helpful to hear what the
Minister said about rolling out certain technologies and that speed can
be adopted while preserving relevant information for those who wish to
analyse the data obtained and providing those who have been searched
with a proper record of the events and circumstances that
transpired.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div><a name="10020254000287"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div>
<a name="10020254000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue of
ethnicity is extremely important, particularly in the utilisation of
stop-and-search powers by the police. We will come on to that in a
later debate on changes to the Terrorism Act 2000 and the proportion of
people from minority ethnic communities subject to those powers as
contrasted with the rest of the population. I understand the
Government&#146;s desire to ensure that information is recorded
properly so that assurance can be given on how the powers are being
used. We do not want to return to the days when it was almost felt that
the police were unable to use certain powers, although they might have
been needed or justified, because of concerns over community cohesion
and how the use of the powers might be perceived. It is important that
information on ethnicity is provided in relation to
stops-and-searches.</div><a name="10020254000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand, on some levels, the points that the my right hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham makes about
perception and how we get the most accurate information but, on
balance, I agree that the approach taken, on self-determination by an
individual as to how they wish their information to be recorded, is a
fair one. However, I would not like to get to a situation in which
trust and confidence are eroded so that no information is provided. It
is obviously up to an individual whether they wish to respond to that
question.</div><a name="10020254000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have to be vigilant and continue to monitor how the powers are used and
what proportion of minority ethnic communities are subject to such
potentially intrusive powers as contrasted with other communities.
However, in light of the Minister of State&#146;s comments and this
useful debate, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000344"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> My purpose with the amendment is to relax slightly
the requirement as to when the records in question have to be made. The
Committee will appreciate that there is a distinction between
&#147;practicable&#148; and &#147;reasonably practicable&#148;.
Some things are practicable that are not reasonably practicable. For
these purposes, we should not set the bar too high. May I give an
example, not from police work, but from the experience of somebody who
likes the
countryside?</div><a name="10020254000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is often practicable to cross a stream in spate but it is not
necessarily reasonably practicable, because one may very well fall in
and perhaps drown. I like going up mountains a lot, and it is often
practicable to get to the top of a snow peak in a blizzard but that
does not mean to say that it is reasonably practicable. One would be
ill advised to do it, but one can do it. There is a difference in
meaning between &#147;practicable&#148;, which means achievable, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div>and &#147;reasonably practicable&#148;, which means reasonably
achievable in the circumstances that one
faces.</div><a name="10020254000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to create obligations that set the bar too high, because
that may give rise to complaints. Although I wish to ensure that powers
given to the police are properly restricted and constrained, I do not
believe that the concept of reasonableness, in this context, is in any
way prejudicial to the liberty of the citizen. My purpose is to set the
bar a little lower than the Bill requires. I can imagine that, in the
turmoil of police work, an officer would in some circumstances decide
that the issue was not reasonably practical because of the other
burdens upon him or her at that particular time, whereas the individual
citizen might say that it was practicable. Let us not have the bar too
high; that is the only purpose of the
amendment.</div><a name="10020254000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000345"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I shall comment briefly on the amendments. As
a learned legal practitioner, my right hon. and learned Friend has a
good insight into the implications of getting the drafting and the
detail right and how the relevant factors may be interpreted by the
courts. The key issue is ensuring that the police have discretion in
relation to the way in which information is recorded. If the conditions
are not practicable and a contemporaneous record cannot be made due to
operational circumstances, the police should have discretion to record
the information as soon as is it is reasonable to do so after the
event. The important thing is that the information is recorded
correctly and appropriately. At the same time, however, the way in
which the information is recorded should not fetter the operational
requirements of the police. I agree with my right hon. and learned
Friend&#146;s view on the need to change the bar. The important thing
is that there is sufficient operational flexibility in relation to the
utilisation of the power so that we have the correct information while
not fettering officers too much. Live and ongoing requirements should
not be prejudiced, so the information may need to be recorded at a
slightly later
point.</div><a name="10020254000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000346"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I shall be short and to the point. My main concern
about the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s amendment boils
down to the fact that, in the event of the officer not completing the
stop-and-search form on the spot, as planned under clause 1, there is a
danger that a later completion will lead to more errors, more
inconsistency and, ultimately, more complaints to the police about the
procedures. The amendment would increase the risk of incomplete or
inaccurate records being submitted. We are also concerned that it would
reduce the number of occasions on which an individual could receive the
form at the time of the stop-and-search. The amendment would therefore
lead to more difficulties for the police and would not be practical for
either the person who is stopped and searched or the police.
Ultimately, it would be of greater difficulty to the system as a whole,
so I urge the right hon. and learned Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10020254000093"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000349"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> A number of different issues are wrapped up
in this clause stand part debate. So far, our discussions on
stop-and-search have focused on levels of bureaucracy, the utilisation
of the accurate recording of information, and the role of technology.
However, there is also a need to focus on the implications of the
clause for the effective use of stop-and-search more
generally.</div><a name="10020254000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
her report on reducing police bureaucracy, Jan Berry
said:</div><a name="10020254000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
too many places, police officers&#146; knowledge and understanding of
their powers in respect of stops is poor. Yet there is clear evidence
that&#151;where knowledge and understanding is coupled with local
intelligence and strong supervision&#151;the quality of stops
increases&#148;.</div><a name="10020254000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to reflect on that point. If we are seeking to re-codify
the information that police officers are to record as part of their
stops-and-searches, we should also look at how these powers can be used
more intelligently and how police officers&#146; time can be focused
and how we can achieve more effective utilisation of police time more
generally. We should take a more focused look at the use of the power.
Factors that might militate against this more effective, more
intelligence-led use of stop-and-search powers include targets, as well
as other bureaucracy and measurement devices.</div>
<a name="10020254000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Jan Berry
highlighted that in her report at paragraph 5.103, which
stated
that</div><a name="10020254000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;some
forces continue to include the number of stops as personal performance
indicators. Not only can this encourage unnecessary stops, but it also
harms community
relations.&#148;</div><a name="10020254000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">She
made a recommendation that such personal indicators for individual
forces should be removed immediately because it created the perverse
incentive to conduct more stops-and-searches than necessary. If we are
looking  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>at bureaucracy and the utilisation of time, actions undertaken simply to
meet a given target would not appear to be an effective use of
time.</div><a name="10020254000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
steps are the Government taking to implement Jan Berry&#146;s
recommendation? What discussions have taken place with individual
police forces? What assessment has the Home Office made of the number
of police forces that may be applying some sort of target for the
number of stops-and-searches that police officers conduct? Clearly it
would not be an appropriate or effective way of targeting police
resources on intelligence if they were simply tasked with conducting a
fixed number of searches and their performance were assessed against
that
measure.</div><a name="10020254000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also the issue of Ministers&#146; confidence that the changes
outlined in the Bill will be implemented on the ground. In other words,
notwithstanding the target culture that may persist in certain forces
at a local level, will individual police forces seek to adopt the
measures that are contained in the Bill? It was interesting that in his
speech to the police superintendents conference last September, which
the Minister and I both attended, the Home Secretary stated:</div>
<a name="10020254000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Local
requirements are often equally, if not more burdensome, and these need
to be addressed too. To give one example, while the stop and account
form has been abolished, I have heard of instances where neighbourhood
police officers are still filling in the form even though it&#146;s
no longer
required.&#148;</div><a name="10020254000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
related to stop-and-account, but what confidence does the Minister have
that police forces will not simply choose to ignore the revised
reporting requirements in the Bill, which gives the types of
information that are  to be recorded? What if&#151;the Home
Secretary alluded to this at the police superintendents&#146;
conference&#151;police forces continue to record all the data sets
that previously subsisted, even though the Bill, to free up police time
and reduce bureaucracy, may prescribe that a reduced number of fields
are to be
recorded?</div><a name="10020254000288"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="10020254000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be interesting to hear the Minister&#146;s thoughts on how that
measure might be rolled out, and to hear whether he accepts that a
culture of bureaucracy and form-filling has grown up under this
Government. What measures will the Minister introduce, alongside the
proposals in the Bill, to bring about the cultural shift that
apparently even the Home Secretary appears to accept will be
needed?</div><a name="10020254000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister confirm whether the details of any unlawful item found
during a search will be recorded, notwithstanding the provisions in the
Bill? That goes back to the issue of recording intelligence more
generally. I accept what the Minister said about his best estimate, in
relation to the 12 minutes that might be saved in the exercise of the
powers set out in the Bill. Will there be an obligation in such
circumstances to record such information about unlawful items in a
suspect&#146;s arrest record? In other words, if a search is
conducted and an unlawful item is found, whether it be drugs or a
weapon, and an arrest is made, presumably there would be a record of
that unlawful item in the arrest record. I seek to understand clearly
how all those aspects interrelate.</div>
<a name="10020254000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000350"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> If it will save time, the answer is yes.
Self-evidently, that item would be evidential in any future charge
before the courts. Such a record would be made&#151;at the police
station, undoubtedly, rather than at the stop-and-search
location.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div><a name="10020254000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000351"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I thank the Minister. The only reason for
touching on that point is that it relates to the 12-minute saving that
has been identified with regard to not recording certain fields. There
is an issue about the analysis undertaken of that 12-minute figure.
Obviously, some additional information for intelligence or arrest
purposes might have to be recorded in a different way. The issue was
whether that had been factored into the calculation of the 12-minute
figure.</div><a name="10020254000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000352"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The 12 minutes relates to stop-and-search. That
does not involve moving to the police station for an arrest or for a
charge, so the stop-and-search is where the saving is
made.</div>
<a name="10020254000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000353"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
clarification on the bureaucracy saving and the assessment. I still
have some questions on whether 12 minutes fully represents
the savings, but I hear what he says and I do not intend to labour that
point.</div>
<a name="10020254000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
requires the recording of ethnicity when a person has been stopped and
searched. That is understandable for the reasons discussed in the
previous debate, and I do not intend to go back over all those points,
but there is the understandable issue of the disproportionate impact of
stop-and-search on minority ethnic communities, with the impact
particularly marked for black and Asian communities. Will the Minister
say what the requirement in the Bill adds to the existing obligation in
code A of PACE? There seems to be some overlap. Is additional
information required? Has there been a change? My understanding is that
there are already some requirements to record ethnicity in code A of
PACE. Does this provision put a new requirement or duty on officers, or
are we recodifying or adding to the Bill to give emphasis to what is
already covered in the
code?</div><a name="10020254000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will be aware of concerns about the use of stop-and-search on
very young children. While there is no intention to introduce a formal
requirement in the Bill, as I understand it, will the Minister give any
indication on whether the issue is being monitored or reviewed? If so,
what guidance is being provided to police officers? I recognise that,
sadly, many very serious crimes are committed by very young children,
so searches of children need to be conducted to assess whether they are
carrying knives and other weapons or drugs.</div>
<a name="10020254000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the
Minister tell us how many stops-and-searches of children there are?
Concerns have been highlighted as to whether children are
disproportionately affected, although that may be indicative of
patterns of offending in an area. As concerns about very young children
being stopped and searched have been highlighted, it would be helpful
if the Minister responded to them and gave some indication of the use
of stop-and-search in relation to young
children.</div>
<a name="10020254000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000354"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. We want
assurances that stop-and-search is not being applied arbitrarily to
young people. What does he hope that the Minister will say in response
to his query about monitoring and the frequency with which young people
are stopped and searched?</div>
<a name="10020254000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000355"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Obviously, it is for the Minister to respond,
but it would be helpful to get an indication of whether there has been
any assessment of the targeting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div>of stop-and-search. The reports on 10 and 11-year-olds have highlighted
the most concern on whether the powers are being used proportionately.
What discussions has the Minister had on the matter, what assessment
has he made and what guidance exists on whether there are additional
sensitivities or requirements that should be applied when a
stop-and-search is being conducted of, particularly, very young
children?</div>
<a name="10020254000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the
amendment and new clauses in my name and the name of my hon. Friend the
Member for Romford. Amendment 21 and new clause 1 relate, in essence,
to a modification of the section 60 power in the Criminal Justice and
Public Order Act 1994. Section 1 of PACE allows a police officer to
stop and search a person in a public place for offensive weapons and
other items. However, the power applies only where that police officer
has a reasonable suspicion that he or she will find such unlawful
items.</div><a name="10020254000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
section 60, an officer of or above the rank of inspector has the right
to authorise officers to stop and search people and vehicles within a
specific locality for a period of up to 24 hours, if they reasonably
believe that crimes of serious violence may occur or that someone is
carrying an offensive weapon. That authorisation can be extended for a
further 24 hours with the consent of an officer of superintendent rank
or above. The power may be exercised without the requirement of
reasonable suspicion that would be needed under
PACE.</div><a name="10020254000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have believed for some time that there is a need to change those
powers. The utility of the powers is clear, especially when we consider
the Metropolitan police&#146;s Operations Blunt and Blunt 2, and how
section 60 powers have been used to prevent weapons being carried, to
provide reassurance and to arrest those who are carrying knives and
other weapons in their community, where there has been intelligence and
reasonable suspicion that weapons were being carried in a locality. No
one in the Committee can be in any doubt about the tragic implications
of these issues, which have affected our constituents and many families
around the country. A person who carries a knife or another weapon is
at more risk of being the victim of a violent
offence.</div><a name="10020254000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue is about using the powers intelligently. I recognise the concerns
highlighted about section 60, and there is a desire, as Jan Berry said
in her report, to ensure that the powers are used appropriately,
sensibly, proportionately and on the basis of intelligence. It is
important to reflect on whether there are ways in which the power could
be brought closer to
communities.</div><a name="10020254000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 1 would create a right for officers of the full rank of sergeant
to authorise stop-and-search of pedestrians and vehicles in a specific
area for up to six hours, if they reasonably believed that incidents of
serious violence might occur in that area, or that people were carrying
guns, knives or other offensive weapons. That authorisation could be
extended to a maximum of 48 hours by further direction of an officer of
the rank of superintendent or
above.</div><a name="10020254000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
some ways, the proposal intends to bring the section 60 authorisation
closer to communities on the ground. Its intention is threefold: first,
to provide a new preventive power to law enforcement to help to stamp
out the possession of illegal weapons and prevent violent crime;
secondly, to give police at the operational level greater flexibility
to respond to intelligence and potentially fast-moving situations; and
thirdly, to underline the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 161</div>importance of community policing, anchored by the police sergeant, and
to help to develop confidence within neighbourhoods and areas served by
local police
teams.</div><a name="10020254000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
focus on police sergeants because they are often at the absolute core
of community policing in the safer neighbourhood teams around the
country. They are most likely to pick up the intelligence on the
ground, to hear what is happening in the community and to need to
provide community reassurance. The new clause would ensure that they
were properly empowered by giving them a limited window of time in
which to  carry out stop-and-search in their locality. The
change is practical, proportionate and common sense, and  would
help the police to combat violent crime in local
communities.</div><a name="10020254000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000356"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I know that the hon. Gentleman and possibly all
other Members here will have been out on patrol with their safer
neighbourhood teams, which are ably led by sergeants. When I have been
on patrol with teams, sergeants have not suggested that they would like
such a power at their fingertips. Has the hon. Gentleman received
representations from sergeants about the
power?</div><a name="10020254000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000357"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We have held our view on the modification of
section 60 for some time, and when we were considering stop-and-search
we discussed the matter with a number of police officers and with the
Police Federation, which supported our proposals. That organisation
speaks more generally for sergeants and police who are very much at
that operational level. We believe that the measure would be useful and
practical, and would strengthen the role of community policing on the
ground, where the beat or neighbourhood sergeant has a key role. It is
about ensuring that practical aspect, but it is also about
strengthening and recognising the role that sergeants have at the core
of their safer neighbourhood or community police teams, so that they
are seen to respond quickly if information is  given to them.
It would make clear their status and position as the anchor at the
centre of a community police
team.</div><a name="10020254000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certainly,
sergeants are likely to have a closer connection to local issues and
people because of the relationship between the community police and the
community that they serve, and that should be recognised in the
framework, constraints and protection of the existing stop-and-search
power under section 60. Trust and greater confidence should be fostered
in public police
actions.</div><a name="10020254000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
should be an emphasis on being intelligence-led, recognising the points
that Jan Berry made to the Committee about that, and about bureaucracy
more generally. One way to provide greater linkage to the intelligence
base would be to make the connection with the police sergeant being
given the restricted power  that we propose. That underlines
the importance of community-based solutions as part of wider measures
to tackle violent crime and social
breakdown.</div><a name="10020254000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
six-hour authorisation for sergeants is therefore appropriate and
proportionate. It would give greater assurance to the public with
regard to the fight to stamp out illegal weapons on our streets, and in
so doing, to reduce the scourge of violent crime that continues to
claim far too many lives and blight far too many 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div>communities. The power is one part of an overall package of measures
that it might be appropriate to use to address our understandable and
significant
concerns.</div>
<a name="10020254000289"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="10020254000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
next point relates to section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and new
clause 2. I emphasise that this is a probing provision and that I
recognise the need for the police to retain the right to use
stop-and-search as a means of preventing terrorism. The purpose of the
new clause is to facilitate a debate on the issue, and my hon. Friends
and I are very clear about that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000358"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> Does that mean that in the event that the hon.
Gentleman and I swap positions in the next few months, the Conservative
party would not repeal section 44 of the Terrorism
Act?</div>
<a name="10020254000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000359"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Yes, we are clear that we would not repeal
section 44. The new clause is a probing provision to facilitate a
debate in the light of the European Court of Human Rights judgment. We
seek to promote a debate and to hear what the Minister says about that
important judgment, which I will come to in due course. As Lord Carlile
said, there is a need for careful consideration of the stop-and-search
powers under section 44, and I hope that the Committee&#146;s
proceedings, including this debate, will be the start of a move to
address the concerns that have been identified following the Gillan and
Quinton judgment, as well as other points that have arisen over the
past few years. As I said, the purpose of the new clause is to
facilitate a debate on the important issue of modifying the law in the
light of the European Court of Human Rights judgment in the case of
Gillan and Quinton against the United Kingdom, which was delivered just
a couple of weeks ago.</div>
<a name="10020254000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
little doubt about the continuing threat of international terrorism and
there is no indication that it will diminish any time soon. Following
the events of 2007, with the attempted terrorist attack in the
Haymarket in London and the attack at Glasgow airport, there has been a
marked increase in the use of section 44 powers. In 2008-09, 256,027
stops and searches were made under those powers&#151;a 36 per cent.
increase since 2007-08. However, it is the way in which the power has
been used, with whole police force areas designated as potential search
areas, that has raised serious
concerns.</div><a name="10020254000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
his last report to Parliament, Lord Carlile, the Government&#146;s
own reviewer of terrorism legislation, was highly critical, noting that
the use of section 44 had attracted particular criticism because it had
a negative effect on good community relations; that its purpose and
deployment were poorly understood; and that it was totally wrong that
any person should be stopped to produce a racial balance, but that
there was ample evidence that was happening. In that respect, he
said:</div>
<a name="10020254000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
also an invasion of the civil liberties of the person who has been
stopped, simply to &#145;balance&#146; the
statistics.&#148;</div><a name="10020254000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
noted that there was no need to use the power where existing
stop-and-search powers were adequate and that
the</div><a name="10020254000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;figures,
and a little analysis of them, show that section 44 is being used as an
instrument to aid non-terrorism policing on some occasions, and this is
unacceptable.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div><a name="10020254000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Carlile therefore
made some pretty significant criticisms of the use of section 44 in his
last report to Parliament. That relates not only to the civil liberties
arguments that he highlighted, but to the question of whether section
44 was being used inappropriately.</div>
<a name="10020254000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Putting aside
the Court&#146;s judgment in the Gillan and Quinton case for a
moment&#151;I am sure the Minister will tell us that the Government
intend to appeal it&#151;will the Minister tell us whether he shares
Lord Carlile&#146;s concerns and, if so, what practical measures the
Government have taken, or intend to take, to address the points raised
by Lord Carlile? Does he also agree with the statement of Assistant
Commissioner John Yates in the paper he put to the Metropolitan Police
Authority? Following consultation with community groups, he said
that</div><a name="10020254000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
power is seen as controversial and has the potential to have a negative
impact, particularly on minority
communities.&#148;</div><a name="10020254000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
assistant commissioner recognised the sensitivities attached to the use
of this power and, to be fair, I think the Minister does,
too.</div>
<a name="10020254000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
Home Office has provided guidance on the use of section 44
stop-and-search powers in its circular 027/2008, will the Minister
consider updating the guidance, reflecting the comments made by Lord
Carlile and the Gillan and Quinton judgment? The circular notes that
advice on the geographical extent of an authorisation is provided but
suggests, for example, that the boundaries of the authorisation could
be as wide as a divisional area or a borough boundary, and that this
may be sufficient. Will the Minister give some guidance on whether he
has taken a different approach with regard to the authorisation of
section 44 powers since Lord Carlile&#146;s comments, or since the
case of Gillan and Quinton? There is a requirement under section 44 for
the authorisation of the Secretary of State, which is something that
the Minister in his role uses and fulfils daily. It would be helpful to
hear in the Minister&#146;s response whether there has been any
change in emphasis or approach, and whether any greater scrutiny,
examination or review has taken place as a consequence of the
recommendations and comments made by Lord Carlile and the judgment in
Gillan and
Quinton.</div><a name="10020254000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
judgment in that case has brought the issue even more to the fore. The
Court
noted:</div><a name="10020254000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
available statistics show that black and Asian persons are
disproportionately affected by the powers, although the Independent
Reviewer has also noted, in his most recent report, that there has also
been a practice of stopping and searching white people purely to
produce greater racial balance in the statistics...There is,
furthermore, a risk that such a widely framed power could be misused
against demonstrators and protestors in breach of Article 10 and/or 11
of the
Convention.&#148;</div><a name="10020254000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
the way the powers have been used was a factor for the Court in
reaching its judgment that section 44, as currently framed, was outside
the convention rights. Has the Minister taken steps to analyse the
claims and assessments that section 44 powers are being used to provide
greater ethnic balance in their use across different communities? What
steps are being taken to examine that claim, assess it further or deal
with it?</div>
<a name="10020254000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Court
also concluded
that</div><a name="10020254000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
powers of authorisation and confirmation as well as those of stop and
search under sections 44 and 45 of the 2000 Act are neither
sufficiently circumscribed nor subject to adequate legal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>safeguards against abuse. They are not therefore &#145;in accordance
with the law&#146; and it follows that there has been a violation of
Article 8 of the
Convention.&#148;</div><a name="10020254000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was the nub&#151;the conclusion of the European Court of Human Rights
in relation to section 44. The Government have said that they are
examining options for a potential appeal against the judgment. Although
an appeal is not certain&#151;as we heard from the Minister last
week&#151;legal advice is being sought in relation to section 44. The
Minister suggested during last week&#146;s evidence session that the
Court judgment was out of date, that its assessment was based on the
historical use of section 44, that use had changed since the
circumstances giving rise to the judgment and that the case in point
related to events and circumstances in 2003.</div>
<a name="10020254000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
certainly true that the Metropolitan police have adopted a new,
three-layered tactical deployment model for using Terrorism Act powers,
with section 44 powers focused on sites across London that are
of</div><a name="10020254000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an
iconic nature and/or key strategic
importance&#148;.</div><a name="10020254000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stops
and searches in the Metropolitan police area during the first quarter
of 2009-10 were down by 37 per cent. compared with the same quarter in
2008-09.</div><a name="10020254000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the judgment is specific that the Act&#146;s sections are not
sufficiently circumscribed and do not provide sufficient safeguards.
Therefore, according to my reading of the Court&#146;s judgment,
along with the legal advice that has been provided to various Members
and other inputs to the Committee, even if the practice may have
changed, it does not address the specific points made by the Court. In
other words, the focus was very much on section 44 as written in law,
rather than the use of that power on a practical basis, although that
may have informed the Court&#146;s judgment on whether the powers as
drawn were sufficiently circumscribed to be within the ambit of the
convention
rights.</div><a name="10020254000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that the Government should accept the Court&#146;s decision
and start an urgent review and consultation process on appropriate
changes to the provisions of the Terrorism Act to address the issues
highlighted by the Court. There is clear uncertainty, and the period of
that uncertainty should be minimised. In that context, I welcome
Liberty&#146;s contribution to the debate and its suggestions on
authorisation requirements, duration, geographical extent and other
proposed amendments to section 44. Liberty&#146;s proposals are in
large measure reflected in new clauses 4 and 5, tabled by the Liberal
Democrats.</div><a name="10020254000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
proposals require greater scrutiny and consideration to ensure that the
powers are proportionate and circumscribed in relation to the
operational requirements of the police, who need to ensure that we
remain protected against the pervasive terrorist threat, which, sadly,
we will continue to be subject to in this country for some time. I will
listen carefully to the Minister&#146;s thoughts about why the
Government feel that Liberty&#146;s proposals are not appropriate,
reasonable or in compliance with the European convention rights, and
about why they think that the proposals may not work. In the light of
the Court judgment, careful and sensible reflection is needed on the
section 44 powers to ensure that they are suitably
circumscribed.</div><a name="10020254000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that there is urgent consultation with relevant
stakeholders on all sides&#151;the police, security services, civil
liberty groups and the community as a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div>whole&#151;to assess what changes are appropriate and proportionate,
taking account of the need to strike the right balance between personal
freedoms and public protection. It is clear that some change to the law
is necessary. The Government should accept that and start the process
of reform. Inaction will simply further erode confidence in this
important tool and, in so doing, make us all that little bit more
unsafe.</div><a name="10020254000290"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000360"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I rise to speak briefly to new clause 1, tabled by
the official Opposition. The hon. Member for Hornchurch has made a
coherent case, as always, for giving additional powers to sergeants.
However, it is also possible to make a coherent case against giving
those additional powers. Judges have ruled that there is a risk of
arbitrariness in relation to section 44.</div>
<a name="10020254000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman proposes to extend stop-and-search powers. Earlier, he
rightly flagged up possible concerns about the use of stop-and-search
as it relates to young people, and he posed a list of sensible
questions for the Minister about the monitoring of that system. My
concern is that without a review of stop-and-search that encompasses
not only section 44 but goes wider, his proposals might lead to more
rather than fewer concerns about the way stop-and-search operates.
Again, I shall listen to what the Minister has to say, but at the
moment I am agnostic about the
proposal.</div><a name="10020254000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Hornchurch pointed out, Liberty has been keen to
promote the proposals in new clauses 4 and 5, which were tabled by
Liberal Democrat Members. When we debated the matter on Thursday I
expressed concern that the Bill was not being used as an opportunity to
deal with the section 44 issue&#151;the clear risk identified by
judges of arbitrariness in the deployment of those provisions. The new
clauses would constrain, or at least contain more effectively, the
stop-and-search powers currently deployed under section 44 of the
Terrorism Act. I hope they would address the concerns identified in the
ruling in question.</div>
<a name="10020254000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
rightly pointed out that the area in which stop-and-search is being
deployed has been reduced. It is not applied as widely as it was.
Perhaps the problem that presents to the Minister is that it underlines
the fact that the provision was previously applied in a blanket way, or
a less contained way. Can he be entirely confident about how the
section is being applied, even though the area of application is more
restricted? It is still perhaps being applied more generously than
required. The Minister has said that he considers each case
individually, and I am sure that he does so very carefully, but so far
he has not, I think, refused any applications.</div>
<a name="10020254000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clauses are intended to constrain and contain, and to define more
precisely the area over which stop-and-search can be operated, as well
as the length of time over which it can be applied. I hope the Minister
will respond to them as sensible proposals. He may be able to deal with
my concerns about the current arbitrariness, but he will have to work
hard to convince me that the powers as they are now being applied are
innocent of any degree of arbitrariness.</div>
<a name="10020254000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the
Minister accepts that the new clauses would enable section 44 to be
applied more rigorously, and would address the issue of arbitrariness,
which the Government will have to do at some point. They give 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>the Minister an opportunity to deal with the issue in the Bill, rather
than at a later date. Probably all hon. Members&#151;and certainly
all Opposition Members&#151;accept that it will have to be dealt with
at some point in the near
future.</div><a name="10020254000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020254000361"></a><b class="B">Tony
Baldry</b> (Banbury) (Con): From time to time I get a
telephone call that goes something like this: &#147;Hi, Dad. What do
you know about the Terrorism Act 2000?&#148; I say, &#147;Well, I
probably voted for it. Why?&#148; &#147; Well, Dad, I&#146;ve
just been stopped yet again under the Terrorism
Act.&#148;</div><a name="10020254000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
slight concern, in a debate on stop-and-search, applies particularly, I
think, to the Metropolitan police. There is confusion about using the
Terrorism Act to deal with terrorism or suspected terrorism and its use
to deal with public order offences or public order matters. As Members
of Parliament, all members of the Committee are, by definition,
political activists and I suspect that there is not a single one of us
who has not taken part in a demonstration during our political career.
Even my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford must at some stage
have taken part in a
demonstration.</div><a name="10020254000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000362"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I took part in the Countryside Alliance
march.</div><a name="10020254000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000363"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> Indeed. My right hon. and learned Friend took part
in the Countryside Alliance march. I demonstrated outside the Russian
embassy complaining about the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia. It is
difficult to see why, for example, everyone at the climate change camp
was stopped, searched and processed under the Terrorism Act. I shall
give the Minister a present&#151;a book published by my son and some
others entitled &#147;Excessive Force&#148;. If the Terrorism Act
is overused to deal with public order matters and policing
demonstrations and protests, my first concern is that it is not a
particularly effective use of that power and, secondly, that it
alienates large numbers of young people, not just from the police but
from the whole democratic and political process.</div>
<a name="10020254000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Hornchurch has made a number of extremely good
points. If one does not get stop-and-search under terrorism legislation
into a proper sense of proportion, as opposed to stop-and-search under
other legislation for other needs, it will lead to sloppy policing. The
police will rely too heavily on terrorism legislation and use it as a
sledgehammer when they should be using other legislation. It will also
lead to alienation. We all rely on policing by consent, and all
sections of the community should believe that they are policed properly
and in a way that commands their support.</div>
<a name="10020254000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000364"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I rise to support the general points made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Banbury with whom I have worked many times,
including at the Ministry of Agriculture, as it then was, but I shall
also express some caution about new clause 1. I am always on the civil
libertarian wing of any argument, because I am conscious of the degree
to which powers are abused. I have said this before to the Committee
and I fear that I shall say it again: we must be very careful about
giving away powers and hedging them about with
restrictions.</div><a name="10020254000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
I look at new clause 1, I have to ask whether we are showing the
necessary degree of caution. Under subsection 5, a constable may stop
any person or make any search</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div><a name="10020254000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;whether or not
he has any grounds for suspecting that the person or vehicle is
carrying weapons or articles&#148;.</div>
<a name="10020254000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words, you
could be strolling down the road entirely innocently, Mr.
Cook, as I am sure you would be, but the subsection gives the constable
powers to search you. What is more, under subsection (7), should you
not stop and oblige&#151;although I am sure you would&#151;you are
committing an offence in respect of which you can be sent to
prison.</div>
<a name="10020254000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are the
effects of subsections (5) and (7). Who can give that extended power to
search and stop, and in what circumstances? It is a police officer with
the rank of sergeant. I do not intend to be rude about people, but that
is not an elevated rank. Sergeant is an important rank, but it is not a
senior officer. It is perfectly true that a sergeant could give that
power only for a period of six hours, but should you be caught during
that period, Mr. Cook, you would be pretty cross if you knew
that the authority stemmed from a sergeant.</div>
<a name="10020254000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">In what
circumstances could a sergeant reasonably believe that a dangerous
instrument was being carried? Come, come, what is a dangerous
instrument? Someone who goes to the ironmonger to buy a carving knife
or to John Lewis to buy a fork will, in theory, have a dangerous
instrument. I tend to go to the Alps every year. When I come back, I
will be carrying an ice axe and crampons, which are dangerous
instruments. I do not like giving sergeants the power to say,
&#147;Mr. Hogg has got himself a crampon and an ice axe.
Those are dangerous instruments. I think it&#146;s expedient to
extend the powers of search.&#148; Well, that is not the kind of
society I want to live in.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000365"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I will not labour the point, but I think there is
general agreement that clause 1 will ultimately help to reduce
bureaucracy. If the Committee and the other place agree to the clause,
we intend to pilot changes with a representative number of forces for
at least three months, and clause 45, which we will deal with later,
makes provision for that. I hope that we will ultimately be able to
agree that clause 1 should stand part of the Bill.</div>
<a name="10020254000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept the
points that the hon. Member for Hornchurch made about the
implementation of the stop-and-account form to date. He will be aware
that we changed the stop-and-account requirements 12 months ago, and
the number of stops made should not be used as a performance measure
for individual officers. That change should be implemented in our 43
forces and in the British Transport police.</div>
<a name="10020254000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
disappointed that not all our objectives have been met. We rely on
implementation by chief officers, and implementation is very much
supported by the Association of Chief Police Officers. However, I fully
accept that delivery on the ground is lagging in some areas. I hope
that the hon. Gentleman recognises that problem and shares our
objective of solving it in due course.</div>
<a name="10020254000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">ACPO is fully
supportive of the measures before us. The pilot that we intend to carry
out to implement the changes will look at the real-world impact and
will wrap up the concerns about stop-and-account forms.</div>
<a name="10020254000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should also
tell the hon. Gentleman that the target we have set for increasing
public confidence in policing reflects operational practice on issues
such as the implementation in due course of clause 1, if it is
approved, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div>and the implementation to date of the changes to stop-and-account forms.
I want us to reduce use and to agree quickly to abolish the
stop-and-account form in practice as well as in theory. I hope that
that reassures the hon. Gentleman.</div>
<a name="10020254000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman commented on the use of stop-and-search powers in relation to
young people. I am afraid that I cannot give him any figures today to
indicate exactly how often stop-and-search or stop-and-account powers
have been used against people under 18, but they will be
used for the simple reason that there are, sadly, people under 18 who
carry knives or guns and who are involved in drugs. The police make,
and will continue to make, operational judgments at a local level about
whether to exercise their powers accordingly. Although we do not have
the figures, these powers will remain a valuable tool to enable the
police to secure protection for the community and sometimes for
individuals under 18.</div>
<a name="10020254000291"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="10020254000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000366"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> In some ways, I am not surprised by the
Minister&#146;s response. There is concern about the utilisation of
the powers, particularly where very young children are involved, which
is the point I emphasised. Can the Minister give any indication of
whether the Department provides guidance on stops and searches of very
young people? Sadly, I recognise his point about the carrying of
weapons. In some cases, gang members may use a younger child to carry a
weapon on their behalf because the child is below the age of criminal
responsibility. That is a serious issue that can be exploited by those
with severe criminal intent. It would be helpful to hear the
Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="10020254000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000367"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> Self-evidently, there are people under the age of
18 who may carry weapons or other equipment for use in criminal
activity. That is precisely the reason why the stop-and-search power
has to be used by police on an operational basis under both current
and&#151;if the clause is accepted&#151;new legislation. We cannot
give the figures, but use of the power is judged locally and the police
wish to continue to use it. I hope, therefore, that the Committee
accepts the principle of the
clause.</div><a name="10020254000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 1 was tabled by the hon. Member for Hornchurch and would replace
section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which
enables an inspector or above to authorise the stop-and-search of
persons or vehicles when there is a reasonable belief that incidents
involving serious violence may, or have, occurred and it is expedient
to give that authorisation. I cannot do better than endorse the
comments of the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham. He explained that the reason why an inspector authorises
section 60 searches is that we want to ensure that the public have
confidence that the decision is taken at a senior level in the force.
Moreover, with no disrespect to sergeants or to officers of lower rank,
we want to ensure that the authorisation is not something that is done
routinely, but requires senior-level
endorsement.</div><a name="10020254000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
fear, which I hope the hon. Member for Hornchurch will reflect upon, is
that new clause 1 could reduce public confidence in the use of searches
and give rise to searches that will not receive the serious, high-level
endorsement that the rank of inspector would give 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div>them. There is no evidence to date that the involvement of an inspector
in authorising searches has given rise to slowness or to any
criminality that would not have occurred anyway. That level of rank is
not, according to the evidence, a bar to undertaking effective searches
under section 60. Indeed, it is common practice for inspectors orally
to approve their authorisation&#151;as do I sometimes on section 44
applications&#151;before later issuing a written confirmation. There
may be concerns about the use of stops and searches, but diluting the
authorisations and lowering the grade of the officer who can authorise
them is not a productive suggestion. I hope the hon. Gentleman will
reflect upon that, listen to the advice of his right hon. and learned
Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham, and not press the new
clause to a
vote.</div><a name="10020254000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000368"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Does the Minister, like me, think it appropriate
that the hon. Member for Hornchurch should make some estimate of how
many additional stops and searches might arise if the change was
implemented?</div><a name="10020254000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000369"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. The issue
is about reducing bureaucracy and removing measures so that the police
have more time for activities that are more productive for the public.
We may well encourage further use of the powers if we devolve them to
the front line. Current legislation ensures that someone has to justify
a request to an inspector who then has to authorise it, so it is done
at a senior level. The points made by the right hon. and learned Member
for Sleaford and North Hykeham are therefore extremely
valid.</div><a name="10020254000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a serious debate on section 44, and amendments have been tabled by
both the official Opposition and the Liberal Democrats in relation to
it. We need to address some of the concerns. Section 44 is an important
tool that we have encouraged and used, and it provides a definitive,
clear accountability line for the approval of stop-and-search powers,
through Parliament and external
scrutiny.</div><a name="10020254000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
Committee members know, any section 44 agreement must first be approved
by a member of ACPO&#151;a senior officer&#151;and that approval
must be applied to requests for such operational activity to be
undertaken. Those requests are submitted and looked at by officials in
the Home Office, through the Office for Security and Counter Terrorism,
and reported to me. As I mentioned in my evidence to the Committee last
week, I have to scrutinise an application and ultimately sanction it
within 48 hours or it does not apply. That process is open to public
scrutiny by Lord Carlile of Berriew, who undertakes regular scrutiny
and is continually looking at the extent, usage and proportionality of
the boundary. An appeal is currently being considered on a judgment
made on the use of that power generally. All those things aside, there
is real parliamentary and independent oversight on the use of section
44. Its proportionate use is justified as part of a deterrent for
individuals who potentially could undertake terrorist activity in the
United
Kingdom.</div><a name="10020254000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000370"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister mentioned the
Government&#146;s reviewer of terrorism legislation, Lord Carlile.
Following the Gillan and Quinton judgment,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div>Lord Carlile gave an interview to the BBC, suggesting that a change to
the law may be required and, reflecting on his previous comments, again
expressed concern that section 44 was still used far too randomly
without any reasoning. What response would the Minister give to the
concerns expressed by Lord Carlile in the context of the latest
judgment? There are some serious issues to
consider.</div><a name="10020254000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000371"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> There are indeed. The terror threat in the United
Kingdom is currently rated severe: that threat level was raised by the
independent Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which makes
recommendations about the level of threat and Ministers have to respond
to that. JTAC independently decided the threat level a week ago last
Friday. There are serious issues to do with the terrorist threat, and
the use of section 44 is part of our proportionate response to
that.</div><a name="10020254000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Self-evidently,
we are disappointed with the ECHR ruling in the Gillan case, which the
hon. Member for Hornchurch mentioned. We won challenges in that regard
in the UK courts, including in the House of Lords, and we have sought
the referral of the case to the Grand Chamber for an appeal, on the
basis that we believe that the provisions are
proportionate.</div><a name="10020254000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Carlile regularly raises a number of issues with the Government, on
which we reflect and which, as has been shown, we have considered
carefully over the past 12 months. The totals for section 44 power
usage over the final quarter of 2009-08 show that there has been a 42
per cent. quarterly decrease in their use over the previous quarter.
That does not get away from the fact that 256,000 people were stopped
by the police under section 44 in 2008-09 in Great Britain, but it is
still a decrease over time and the decrease is continuing. At the level
of officials and the police, and including Lord Carlile and myself as
Minister, we are continually ensuring that the use of that power is
proportionate. I defend the use of that power to the nth degree,
because it acts as a deterrent for potential terrorists, it can provide
security to our communities and it proves a valuable tool for the
police to help to prevent the type of atrocity that every Committee
member would not wish to see in London or
elsewhere.</div><a name="10020254000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Banbury raised legitimate concerns about the experience
of young Baldry. I look forward to receiving the present of the book,
and I will find time on my three-hour train journey home to flick
through its pages. I appreciate the way in which he expressed his view.
Professional practice guidance entitled &#147;Practical Advice on
Stop and Search in Relation to the Terrorism Act&#148; has been
produced by the National Policing Improvement Agency. I have a copy of
the guidance, which I understand is a public document, before me for
ease of reference, and page 14
states:</div><a name="10020254000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Officers
should always use objective criteria to select people for search.
Criteria could be related to...The individual themselves; To the
location the person is in; A combination of the two. Every person
searched under section 44 should be told explicitly that they are not
suspected of being a
terrorist.&#148;</div><a name="10020254000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
searches that are undertaken are random. Operationally, police may make
judgments and I will happily consider the experiences of the family of
the hon. Member for Banbury. However, there is clear guidance
throughout that document about how this power should be used. I commend
those considerations to the
Committee.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div><a name="10020254000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000372"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> On the guidance, the Minister will note that
I also referred to a Home Office document that sought to prescribe
certain information on extent and utilisation of power. What are his
thoughts on applications under section 44 that might specify, for
example, an entire police force area as an area requiring authorisation
to search? The Metropolitan police have moved away from that in their
refocused objectives in relation to section 44, but clearly those
applications might be coming before the Minister and it would be
helpful to understand his reading of the guidance and whether he is
looking more carefully at applications that have such a huge
geographical coverage in relation to certain police force
areas.</div><a name="10020254000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000373"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> Without giving away too many secrets in a public
place, very few whole-force applications come before me as Minister.
Most of the applications are related to specific geographical areas or
a location in a geographical area where a specific individual might be
at a particular time. So I think that the whole-force approach is being
reduced. The hon. Gentleman will know that we have taken a keen
interest in the matter at an official level through Lord Carlile and
myself, as Minister, to ensure that we reduce the number of whole-force
applications. That has been shown to work in relation to the police
themselves making fewer such applications, certainly over the past year
and noticeably in the Metropolitan area.</div>
<a name="10020254000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000374"></a>Tom
Brake</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="10020254000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000375"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> That neatly segues me into the amendments of the
hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington. I will give way to him
before I proceed
further.</div><a name="10020254000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000376"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Before the Minister segues, without breaching
confidences or referring to a specific case, can he explain in what
circumstances a whole-force application is appropriate and in what way
it is useful for the police to have a whole-force application in
force?</div><a name="10020254000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000377"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> Again, without giving away specific confidences, I
cannot recall the last time I agreed a whole-force application. Such
applications are now targeted around specific areas and locations that
I do not need to go through, but that will be self-evident to hon.
Members. Whole-force applications are restricted to a small number of
forces, which have asked the Government via their senior officers for
section 44 applications. There are a number of key areas where we have
done that in specific forces, but many forces have not applied at all
for a section 44 during the course of their consideration of these
matters.</div>
<a name="10020254000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">That leads me
to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington, which deal with two specific issues. First, limiting the
geographical extent to a designated 1 km area would again be very
difficult. Let me give a concrete and practical example. There could be
a threat to a geographical area, such as the City of London. If we have
a 1 km application, there may need to be searches in a range of areas
outside the 1 km that covers, for example, the City  of London.
I can think of numerous examples  where a wider stop-and-search
would be necessary to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div>proportionate and to ensure that the objective is achieved. The
objective is effectively not necessarily even to catch terrorists,
although that might be a by-product, but to ensure that people who
might be committing terrorist offences know that there is potentially
an opportunity for them to be stopped. That is a deterrent. The way to
stop terrorist activity ultimately is through intelligence-led activity
and a range of other measures downstream, and the provision remains a
valuable and important tool. In key areas around Westminster, central
London, airports, military sites and so on, geographical restriction
would cause severe difficulty for operational flexibility, and it would
not be supported by the police or the
Government.</div><a name="10020254000292"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="10020254000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Revised
guidance has been issued, and there is guidance on how the power should
be used. We will certainly reflect, as we must do ultimately, on the
judgment of the European Court of Human Rights. We must consider
whether we can appeal against it and, if we cannot or we lose, whether
to amend the legislation at some future stage. At the moment, we must
consider the operational capability of forces for my officials and I to
make those judgments. The police must be aware that there is public
concern about ensuring that we are not undertaking extraneous stops and
searches.</div>
<a name="10020254000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I accepted
the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hornchurch, the power would
stop tomorrow, and if I accepted the amendment tabled by the hon.
Member for Carshalton and Wallington, I would restrict the power
severely. I do not want to do either, because my objective is to ensure
that people enjoy this great city and other iconic and important areas
without the threat of being killed by random terrorist
violence.</div><a name="10020254000197"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000378"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> In case the Minister was not intending to touch on
new clause 5, and following his specific comment on the 1 sq km issue,
will he comment on the new clause, which relates to the time over which
section 44 may
apply?</div><a name="10020254000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000379"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> Indeed, I will. Reducing the duration of the
authorisation from 28 days to 24 hours could be damaging.
Counter-terrorism operations may continue beyond 24 hours.
Ministerially, at official and police level, I might be signing 28 or
29 section 44 agreements in a month, instead of a fixed time. I do not
believe that new clause 5 is practical. At the moment, I sign a
reasonable number of section 44 agreements during a week. During that
28-day period, the police may have to undertake stops-and-searches
around some ordinary, established, fixed sites. I need not go into
details, but there are locations where people live and work, and
locations with critical national infrastructure. When I sign a 28-day
section 44 application for such areas, I am giving the police the power
to undertake searches during that 28-day period. I do not want to have
an application in my red box every night, much as I love getting it,
for a section 44 agreement for the same location, which must be signed
every day because it is a key, iconic location or an individual resides
there. The amendment is not practical, and I ask the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw
it.</div><a name="10020254000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000380"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Can the Minister say anything about the typical or
average duration&#151;I know that there will not be a typical section
44 application&#151;for which it applies? That might give hon.
Members a better idea, if 24 hours 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div>is not appropriate, of another time frame that addresses what the
Minister is saying about not having to deal repeatedly with section 44
issues?</div><a name="10020254000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000381"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I continually renew some section 44s at the end of
every 28-day period because they are effectively permanent section 44
agreements, but under the legislation they must be renewed every 28
days. Again, they self-evidently involve areas or matters that need to
be covered, but I do not want to go into detail because that needs to
be done securely. I cannot accept that we should limit a section 44 to
a specific period, because there are areas that the police advise me
need regular monitoring and section 44 stops because they are
iconic.</div><a name="10020254000262"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000382"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I think the Minister accepts that reasonable
concerns have been highlighted. For example, there is concern about
stopping and searching individuals&#151;knowing that that individual
is not under suspicion of terrorism and that there is no likelihood or
probability of anything being revealed by a stop-and-search&#151;on
the basis of trying to achieve a different ethnic balance in the number
of stops-and-searches that are being undertaken. Indeed, some reports
on the use of stop-and-search powers have been widely publicised; for
example, stopping photographers from taking photographs and various
other things. The Minister seemed to suggest that he may take further
steps, or that further arrangements may be in place at a practical
level, to try to address that with individual police forces. Did I
understand him correctly, or is there some other step or action to
which he was
alluding?</div><a name="10020254000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000383"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> We keep the use of section 44 under constant
review. Any section 44 application that I receive has been authorised
by the ACPO-level official. It will contain the usage of that section
44 agreement in previous months. That gives me some indication of how
many stops-and-searches there have been.</div>
<a name="10020254000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000384"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> It is not the number, but the way they have
been
used.</div><a name="10020254000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000385"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The stop-and-search application is very
comprehensive under section 44. It gives me an awful lot of detail
about a range of issues that I cannot go into in Committee, in the sort
of open sitting that we have today. However, under that legislation, we
discuss at official level with the police ministerial questions about
the application and, ultimately, once it has been agreed, it receives
external scrutiny from Lord Carlile. That external scrutiny is
ultimately published, with his comments on both individual
force&#146;s applications and general applications. In my view,
therefore, there is scrutiny.</div>
<a name="10020254000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
considering the current judgment, and looking to appeal against it. We
will reflect on the outcome of that in due course and may well make
changes accordingly in operation and/or in legislation, depending on
that outcome. However, at the moment I am satisfied that there are
sufficient scrutiny powers available to Ministers and externally to
ensure that we do that in a positive way. Indeed, the Met police have
worked with Lord 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>Carlile since the last report in summer 2009 to change the practice
around authorisations so that we do not have a patchwork system and we
only authorise, as I have said, iconic sites, crowded places and
particular events.</div>
<a name="10020254000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
possible for a section 44 to be authorised for one day. I am not
denying that that could be the case. There could be a section 44
agreement around an iconic event like the Notting Hill carnival. There
could be a three-day section 44 agreement around the Labour party
conference in Brighton because, self-evidently, that is a potential
area of concern. However, that does not mean that we have to have that
as a maximum and have to renew it every time. The application could be
for a certain number of days. We just need to bear that in mind and
remember that this is all done for a purpose, and the purpose is to
ensure that we do not have terrorist activity. I therefore urge the
Committee to accept the clause, and reject the amendments in the name

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000386"></a>The
Chairman:</b> If a Member seeks the attention of the Chair,
then indicate it clearly by
standing.</div><a name="10020254000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000387"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> With the leave of the Committee, I rise to
respond briefly to the Minister. As I said from the outset, it is not
my intention to press the new clause relating to section 44. The debate
on the Terrorism Act 2000 has been helpful in obtaining further
information on the Government&#146;s thinking on the response to the
Gillan and Quinton judgment. However, there are issues about the
application of the section 44 power. There will need to be careful
reflection on that judgment&#151;I believe that some changes to the
law are an inevitable consequence of it. Therefore, rather than seeking
to appeal, the Government should reflect on that to ensure that
confidence and certainty are applied to the use of the section 44
powers.</div>
<a name="10020254000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was also
helpful to hear how the Minister of State intends to pilot the changes
to the stop-and-search powers that have been identified in clause 1,
and that he accepts both the problems that were identified in the
implementation of the changes to stop-and-account some 12 months ago,
and the problems that remain. That goes back to the cultural changes
that I talked about earlier, and to how the burdensome bureaucracy
under this Government will have an impact on making the changes needed
to speed up police operations and reduce the effect of forms and
recording
requirements.</div><a name="10020254000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have heard what the Minister of State and other members of the
Committee have said on the modification to section 60 proposed in new
clause 1. In response to the point made by the hon. Member for
Carshalton and Wallington, the measure might reduce the number of
searches by being more intelligence led, and focusing on the
intelligence-based approach. It would push powers down to the community
level and therefore be more responsive to the community&#146;s needs,
rather than adopting a blanket
approach.</div><a name="10020254000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have heard the strongly held views of my right hon. and learned Friend
the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham on certain aspects of the new
clause and on police sergeants, but I do not share them. I imagine that
he would have been party to the discussions on the Criminal Justice and
Public Order Act 1994. Some of the provisions that he has mentioned are
simply a mirror of those in that Act, which I presume he may have
debated, considered or approved at that
time.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div><a name="10020254000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000388"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I may have voted for the provisions, but I certainly
was not party to the discussions; I was then working in the Foreign
Office.</div><a name="10020254000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000389"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am pleased to hear of my right hon. and
learned Friend&#146;s work at that time in the Foreign
Office&#151;I am sure that he was doing a sterling job. It is
interesting, therefore, if his views on section 60 have changed since
he voted at that time.</div>
<a name="10020254000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
listened to the debate. We believe that the power proposed in new
clause 1 could be a helpful addition. However, in the interests of
promoting discussion on other areas, I will not seek to press the new
clause to a
vote.</div><a name="10020254000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000390"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Clearly, I am disappointed that the Bill has not
been used to address the arbitrary application of section 44, but I
recognise that that was never going to be the case because the
Government are considering an appeal against the European Court. I am
sure that we will return to the content of new clauses 4 and 5 at some
point, when the Government inevitably have to consider making changes
to section
44.</div><a name="10020254000215"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

clause 3, page 6, line 10, leave
out from &#145;Wales&#146; to end of line

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000393"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> My amendments fall into two groups. The first three
propose the omission of the words &#147;before or&#148;, and the
last four are directed at clause 3. I shall speak briefly on both
clauses.</div><a name="10020254000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
far as the removal of &#147;before or&#148; is concerned in
amendments 53, 56 and 57, I shall use as an example proposed new
section (5A) in clause 2, which similarly applies to other provisions.
It
states:</div><a name="10020254000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
fingerprints of a person may be taken without the appropriate consent
if (before or after the coming into force of this
subsection)&#148;.</div><a name="10020254000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
say, strike out &#147;before or&#148;. In other words, I want to
disallow the provision that enables fingerprints to be taken in respect
of matters that have occurred before the proposed new section comes
into force. In the end,  it is a matter of judgment. There is
an element of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>retrospectivity in enabling the police to take fingerprints where the
right to do so has arisen before the provision comes into force. I can
see the pragmatic arguments for allowing that to happen, but I am
rather against it because it involves some retrospectivity, and that is
the justification for the removal of those two words by the
amendment.</div>
<a name="10020254000293"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="10020254000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other amendments&#151;amendments 60 to 63&#151;are more serious.
Here we need to consider clause 3(1) and proposed new subsection (6D)
of section 61 of PACE. In section 61, on fingerprinting, the following
is to be inserted:</div>
<a name="10020254000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subject
to this section, the fingerprints of a person who is a United Kingdom
national or resident may be taken without the appropriate consent
if&#151;&#148;</div><a name="10020254000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Here
we come to the bit that I object to. I will first indicate what I
object to, and then I will indicate what I want to happen, which my
amendments would bring about if they are voted for. What I object to is
the following:</div>
<a name="10020254000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;under the law
in force in a country or territory outside England and Wales the person
has been convicted of an offence under that law (whether
before&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10020254000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
object to
that&#151;</div><a name="10020254000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or
after the coming into force of this subsection and whether or not he
has been punished for
it)&#148;.</div><a name="10020254000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new subsection continues:</div>
<a name="10020254000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the act
constituting the offence would constitute a qualifying offence if done
in England and Wales (whether or not it constituted such an offence
when the person was convicted)&#148;.</div>
<a name="10020254000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pause
there. Clause 3(1), to which I have objected, involves a degree of
retrospectivity. The phrase in clause
3(1),</div><a name="10020254000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;whether
or not he has been punished for
it&#148;,</div><a name="10020254000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">means
that the power to take fingerprints is attached to some pretty minor
things. In addition, so far as proposed new subsection (5A)(b) of
section 61 is
concerned,</div><a name="10020254000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;whether
or not it constituted such an offence when the person was
convicted&#148;</div><a name="10020254000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">means,
in fact, that a person could be convicted of an offence abroad and,
notwithstanding the fact that such conduct was not at that time an
offence under the law of England and Wales, the power to take
fingerprints arises.</div>
<a name="10020254000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I say, I
always stand on the liberal wing of these arguments. I am in favour of
civil rights; I do not like to see them being encroached on, although
that sometimes puts me in a position contrary to that of my hon.
Friends and others. I am against the powers of the police being
extended in the ways that are proposed. I ask myself whether there is a
good justification for this extension of police powers. Well, if I were
a policeman, no doubt I would think that there was some justification,
but I am not a policeman. I represent the citizen, and I do not want
the power of the police, as against the power of the citizen, extended
willy-nilly whenever the opportunity arises. I want to protect the
citizen.</div>
<a name="10020254000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
being personal about the officials on the Treasury Bench; I assume that
this measure is none of their responsibility. But I know full well that
Government Departments will take every opportunity to extend the powers
of the law enforcement agencies. People like us need to resist that
continually and protest, saying, &#147;This is
wrong&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div><a name="10020254000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why I
am drawing attention to what I think are the defects in the Bill. I
have no doubt that the Government will say, &#147;Oh, it&#146;s
only Mr. Hogg; he&#146;s trying to frustrate the natural
desires of police to extend security,&#148; and all the rest of it. I
jolly well am. I know full well that the police will always seek to
extend their powers when they get the opportunity to do so. This is a
Christmas tree Bill&#151;we know that. It has one or two important
clauses, but the Home Office has come forward with lots of others that
it has, no doubt, had in its back locker for a long time, and people
like us ought to say, &#147;What is your justification? What is the
protection offered? Why do you want to do this? Is the power
retrospective? Does it infringe natural justice?&#148; If the answer
to any of those questions is that we should not be introducing the
power, we should not do
so.</div><a name="10020254000237"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000394"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I rise in response to the understandably
impassioned speech of my right hon. and learned Friend. I know what
strong views he holds on the need to protect civil liberties. Perhaps
there are distinctions that need to be drawn between the three
different characteristics that are dealt with in clauses 2 and 3. They
are the distinctions between arrest, charge and
conviction&#151;</div><a name="10020254000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000395"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am sure that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s enunciation and pronunciation are perfectly clear to
everyone, but comments should be made through the Chair and, I suggest,
that means to the
Chair.</div><a name="10020254000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000396"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Thank you, Mr. Cook. I will
certainly take your advice on that issue.</div>
<a name="10020254000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
need to focus on the three different aspects covered in the clauses:
arrest, charge and conviction. The case for retrospection is clear
where someone has been convicted of an offence. One criticism that we
have made is that because of the previous blanket approach to taking
DNA data and creating profiles, there has not been sufficient focus on
achieving safety and security. Those are some of the debates that we
will have in relation to various aspects of the Bill.</div>
<a name="10020254000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking at
patterns of offending and persistent, prolific offenders, there are
strong arguments that in not taking the DNA of a person who has been
convicted of an offence, one is not following through on solving crime
and bringing offenders to justice. One makes a distinction; we are
subject to the rule of law, and we as a democracy and a Parliament take
the view that if a person commits an offence, that creates a slightly
different status for them in civil society, in terms of the way in
which the law relates to them.</div>
<a name="10020254000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hear the
wider concerns about retrospection that might otherwise apply. I agree
with my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham that we need to be careful in the use of retrospection in
legislation. For the purposes of preventing crime or bringing crimes to
justice, it is accepted that there is a preventive effect in addressing
crime by focusing on persons convicted of an offence, whether they are
in prison or have been released.</div>
<a name="10020254000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
and learned Friend has a point in connection with persons who have
merely been arrested; it would be beneficial to hear from the Minister
about the application of retrospection to persons arrested. It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div>seems odd that retrospection could be applied even if no charges were
brought, and could apply even further back than it would do under other
provisions&#151;even including those contemplated by the Government
in the Bill&#151;under which the DNA or sample retained at the time
of the arrest is to be destroyed or disposed of. It is essential to get
the interrelationship between the three categories right, so that there
is clarity about how the relevant parts fit together, and so that we do
not give an open-ended power, by virtue of retrospection, in relation
to arrest. That is a legitimate and reasonable point made by my right
hon. and learned
Friend.</div><a name="10020254000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000397"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> My hon. Friend persuades me on the point arising
from conviction. As I understand it, he broadly agrees with me about
arrest. What does he say about charging? Where a chap has been charged,
but not convicted, does he agree with the retrospectivity point that I
have
advanced?</div><a name="10020254000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000398"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My right hon. and learned Friend will see in
further debates, and amendments that I have tabled, that there needs to
be consideration of the timing. The matter should not be completely
open-ended. If a charge has been brought and someone has been acquitted
or the charges were dropped, it is legitimate to ask why the police
should be able to take, in a broad swathe, the person&#146;s sample
or fingerprints. We shall need to come back to that in a future
debate.</div>
<a name="10020254000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power
needs to be properly circumscribed, and it does not appear to me from
the clause that it is. Perhaps there are other provisions in the Police
and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which are not referred to because the
Bill does not affect them, that might address the issue. However, I am
not aware of any such provisions, and on my reading of the clause, that
does not seem to be contemplated, even if one were to take the
Government&#146;s approach to six-year retention of DNA profiles and
the destruction of DNA material. The issue is the interrelationship of
all the powers. It is important to get that right. We need to
understand the intention behind the provisions, and what the ambit or
extent is of the power that the Government intend to give the police
for the taking of samples in this
context.</div><a name="10020254000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other important point made by my right hon. and learned Friend was
about the interrelationship between what might be unlawful in this
country and what might be unlawful in a different jurisdiction. He
highlighted the question of whether retrospection might apply, and
whether under the clause that would mean that an event that was
unlawful overseas would, at that time, also have been unlawful in this
country. That is a question of the drafting making the intention
clear.</div>
<a name="10020254000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
important points have been made, and my right hon. and learned
Friend&#146;s amendments are useful in teasing out some of the
detail. There are still question marks about the drafting of the
clauses, and it would be highly beneficial to hear from the Minister
about their intention and
scope.</div><a name="10020254000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000399"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I shall try to complete my remarks before 1
o&#146;clock, so that we can resolve the issue. It might surprise the
right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham to know
that I, too, am on the side of the citizen, and that the clauses are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 179</div>framed as they are to ensure that we help to protect citizens through
the collection of samples from individuals who are convicted.</div>
<a name="10020254000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Hornchurch spoke about the amendments to clause
3&#151;amendments 60 and 61, I think. Basically, individuals who have
serious convictions may well be in prison overseas&#151;or in
Scotland or Northern Ireland. I think that there was acceptance in
that, and I am pleased to hear
it.</div><a name="10020254000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
clause 2, I should reassure the Committee that the extent to which the
police will be able to take fingerprints and samples from people who
were arrested in the past is limited. Either the person must still be
on bail for the offence or, in relation to cases where the fingerprints
or sample were inadequate, the police can require attendance at a
police station for the purposes of taking biometric data only for six
months after being informed of the inadequacy of the fingerprints or
sample. That will, I hope, limit the extent to which the powers are
used retrospectively. The provision is included so that the police will
use the power only in limited circumstances following the commencement
of the Bill, and that will, ultimately, not apply. Clause 3, however,
is extremely valuable, and I ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman
to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10020254000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020254000400"></a>Mr.
