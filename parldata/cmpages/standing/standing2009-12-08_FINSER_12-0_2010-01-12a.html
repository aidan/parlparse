again proposed,</i> That the amendment be
made.</div><a name="1001138000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000331"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I remind the Committee that with this we are
taking clauses 18, 19 and 20 stand
part.</div><a name="1001138000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000332"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> As I was
saying before the Committee rose, existing provisions for collective
litigation are rarely used. That is because they are open only to a
person who has a claim themselves, and they can represent others only
where their claims are the same. Claims that differ, even in minor
respects, cannot be represented. Consumers must therefore make
individual claims and firms may have to defend thousands of similar
actions. For example, complaints about bank overdraft charges generated
some 47,000 court cases. It is expensive, time-consuming and
inefficient, and there is a risk that the courts will make different
and conflicting rulings. As the hon. Member for Fareham acknowledged,
the ombudsman service is not a suitable vehicle for dealing with mass
claims. For example, the ombudsman cannot make judgments that are
binding on both sides, and cannot deal with complex points of law. The
ombudsman is not a court, nor should we attempt to convert the service
into a court.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 376</div><a name="1001138000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 18
provides for the first time a court procedure that will enable
financial services claims to be resolved for a group of persons without
the need for group members to bring their own claims. A representative
may apply to court to bring the collective claim on behalf of the
group. The court will then consider whether to authorise collective
proceedings.</div><a name="1001138000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
dealing with the amendment, I will say something in relation to the
points that the hon. Member for Fareham raised this morning. The
Government do not support the introduction of a generic right of
collective action. We believe that such rights should be considered for
specific sectors. They should be introduced only where needed. It
should be a last resort after regulatory options have been considered.
That was set out in the Government&#146;s response to the Civil
Justice Council report, &#147;Improving Access to Justice through
Collective Actions&#148;, which was published in July 2009. That is
the approach we are taking here. Financial services have a history of
mis-selling and other scandals that throw up mass claims. When
regulatory action is not appropriate&#151;because a legal point needs
to be settled, for example&#151;collective proceedings will provide
an efficient way to deal with claims that would otherwise have to be
considered individually.</div>
<a name="1001138000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1001138000333"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): I agree entirely
with that. However, as the Minister will be aware, the
problem&#151;if that is what it is&#151;with bank charges was that
a number of people had their claims dealt with and some got their money
back and some did not. Then there was the collective action and a
decision was made, but that did not include all the people who settled
before the collective action. How do the Government propose to deal
with that situation so that a substantial number of cases have not
already been dealt with before collective action
commences?</div><a name="1001138000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000334"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a good point. We will
have to see how it works in practice. Perhaps in some cases there will
be individual actions and then collective action will be authorised by
the court. It will be for the courts to judge when a collective action
is right under the powers that we are providing.</div>
<a name="1001138000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any case that
involves generic issues that affect a number of consumers may be
appropriate for collective proceedings. There have been instances of
widespread mis-selling, for example, of endowment mortgages and payment
protection insurance. As the hon. Gentleman has mentioned, consumers
have had to pursue individual complaints. They might have benefited if
they had had the ability to launch a collective
action.</div><a name="1001138000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the recent bank charges case to which the hon. Gentleman referred, the
Supreme Court held that overdraft and similar charges could not be
assessed for fairness under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts
Regulation on the basis of the adequacy of the price paid as against
the service provided. In that case, the possibility of collective
proceedings would not have made a substantive difference to the
position of consumers.</div>
<a name="1001138000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The two
measures that we propose complement each other, and are for use in
different circumstances. The FSA will have the option of using a
redress scheme when, for example, the law is clear. A large number of
consumers will benefit without having to go to court, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 377</div>which might also be most cost-effective for the industry. Alternatively,
consumers will be able to proceed collectively where the FSA chooses
not to take action. Typically, the FSA will not want to act where the
law is unclear. There may be other reasons why it will not want to act.
It is important to stress the complementary nature of what we are
proposing.</div><a name="1001138000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an element of choice for consumers and their representatives in
determining the best way forward. The representative is free to apply
for authorisation of the proceedings.</div>
<a name="1001138000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1001138000335"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): My concern is that, as the
Minister says, the FSA might not wish to pursue an issue where the law
is unclear, and we will be dependent on consumers taking their own
legal action to enforce their rights. If the FSA&#146;s rules are
unclear, would one not expect it to sort that out and ensure that
consumers do not need to take action through the courts? Does the
Minister draw a distinction between the FSA&#146;s rules and the
broader contractual law?</div>
<a name="1001138000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000336"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It is the hon. Gentleman who draws a distinction.
I hope that it is never the case that the law is not clear. If the
FSA&#146;s rules are not clear, the direct answer is that I would
expect it to make them clear. In general, as the hon. Gentleman will be
aware, the court would be reluctant to authorise collective proceedings
if litigation would be less efficient than regulatory action. He made a
number of points about getting regulatory action right in the first
instance.</div>
<a name="1001138000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is intended
that the FSA, the FOS and the OFT will have a right to be heard by the
court to explain the possible alternatives. The court will have an
opportunity to assess what is likely to be the best course of action.
It will be able to require the representative to explain what it has
done to work with the regulators, and whether it has pursued
alternative dispute resolution.</div>
<a name="1001138000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regardless of
how the FSA performs its functions, consumers might need to bring legal
proceedings in a number of circumstances, and it is right that they
have that opportunity. I do not accept that the provisions constitute
any recognition that the FSA is not doing its job properly. Consumers
who enter into legal relations with financial services providers may
sometimes need&#151;and want&#151;to bring legal proceedings. The
provisions for collective proceedings enable claims to be combined
where that is appropriate.</div>
<a name="1001138000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">We propose
that a representative will be able to act on behalf of a group of
consumers where claims contain the same, similar or a related issue of
fact or law. As part of that, we do not intend to make changes that
move us towards a US-style system. Some have portrayed this provision
as doing that. We do not want to see the development of a US-style
litigation culture, and there are a number of major differences between
the US and UK legal systems which lead me to conclude that that is not
likely to happen. In the UK, it is not the case that parties normally
bear their own costs. The &#147;loser pays&#148; principle applies
in the UK, which is an effective deterrent to spurious claims. There is
no provision for US-style punitive awards or treble damages, and the
legal system is not used as a sort of private regulator to allow
individuals to hold companies to account. There is no burden of
extensive up-front disclosure, no provision for lawyers to take a share
of the damages, and no jury trials in which juries can make awards that
are exceptional.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 378</div><a name="1001138000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000337"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister says that there is no provision for
lawyers to take a share of the damages, but what about no-win, no-fee
cases?</div>
<a name="1001138000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000338"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to point to that.
What I am trying to explain is that the system here is very different
from the one in the United States. We are certainly not signalling in
the collective proceedings proposals that we should move in that
direction, but we believe that the proposals will be a useful addition
and will give consumers more
power.</div><a name="1001138000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1001138000339"></a><b class="B">Rob
Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): In
non-contentious cases, it is true that lawyers can take a share of the
damages, but the cases that we are discussing will all be contentious.
In contentious cases, if the successful party is acting under a no-win,
no-fee agreement, the lawyer charges what is called a success fee. This
Government introduced recoverable success fees so that additional costs
are paid by the losing party and do not come out of the
damages.</div><a name="1001138000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000340"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I welcome my hon. Friend&#146;s contribution.
He clearly knows a great deal about legal proceedings. I am
not legally qualified and am happy to rely on his words of
wisdom.</div><a name="1001138000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to make it clear that significant safeguards are built into our
proposals, and that nuisance or speculative claims will not be
acceptable. The safeguards are, first, that the clauses are designed to
stand alongside clause 26, which confers a new power on the FSA to
provide for consumer redress schemes so that only cases that cannot be
settled by the regulator will proceed to the courts. Secondly, a group
action is a serious matter, and the &#147;loser pays&#148;
principle applies. A representative will need to be able to attract
adequate funding. I therefore expect only the strongest cases to be
taken forward. Thirdly, there must be strict threshold criteria for
authorising a class action. They will be set out in court rules, as I
have said. However, as I mentioned, I have also asked for a backstop
power to enable the Treasury to set out additional criteria that can be
tailored to financial
services.</div><a name="1001138000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can see the case for restricting the types of body that can bring
claims. We will consult on the nature of any restrictions and, for
example, the position of claims management companies and other
professional representatives. I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of
that consultation, but I am prepared to consider restricting
representatives to public interest bodies, consumer groups and those
who will not earn a fee for their
services.</div><a name="1001138000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first part of amendment 58 calls for the eligibility criteria for
authorising a representative to be spelled out in court rules. The
Government believe that that is unnecessary. Clause 24(2) states that
the court rules will contain the requirements applicable to the
representative. I understand that the rules are already being drafted
by the civil procedure rules sub-committee in England and Wales, and it
is expected that the rules committee will consult on them later this
year.</div><a name="1001138000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second part of the amendment creates a designation procedure so that a
representative can apply to be authorised before applying to bring an
action. I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the fact that the
court 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 379</div>itself will be able to approve a representative in accordance with the
rules, so an additional designation procedure seems unduly
bureaucratic. If collective proceedings are to work properly, the court
will always need to appoint an appropriate representative to represent
the group. The suitability of a representative will vary from case to
case, so a standardised form of prior approval may be
counter-productive.</div><a name="1001138000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with the hon. Member for Fareham that it is vital that only
suitably qualified persons of appropriate standing should be allowed to
bring a class action, and I believe that that should be set out
principally in court rules. Subsection (2) of clause 24 gives detailed
examples of the kinds of rule that can be made&#151;notably to govern
the procedure and content of an application to bring a group action and
the criteria for the court to apply in deciding whether to grant
it.</div><a name="1001138000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
expect the minimum criteria to be either that a representative has a
claim or that they are considered by the court to be an appropriate
person to act as a representative. The representative will need to
satisfy the court that they are suitably qualified. That means that
they will probably need to have a litigation plan, which is to say that
they will need to have a plan for effectively managing the case and
communicating with claimants. We expect that there will need to be
strong governance and consultation arrangements that match the size and
nature of the class of complainants. Those are the sort of issues that
are currently being considered by the Rules Committee and will be
consulted on in due
course.</div><a name="1001138000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, as I hope to set out in more detail when we debate clause 22,
the Treasury will have powers to set more detailed eligibility
criteria. I expect them to limit eligibility only to appropriate
individuals or bodies that have a direct claim of their own, and to
bodies of a prescribed type that do not themselves have a direct claim.
The Government intend to consult on the nature of any restrictions and,
for example, the position of claims management companies and other
professional
representatives.</div><a name="1001138000303"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="1001138000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to move on and refer briefly to the other clauses that have been
grouped with clause 18. The Committee will be aware that the clause,
together with clauses 19 to 25, introduces a new form of group action
into United Kingdom law. We believe that it is an efficient way to deal
with mass claims that currently have to be dealt with individually by
the Financial Ombudsman Service and the courts. Many good claims are
currently not being dealt with at all because consumers regard
complaints and litigation as too difficult. There is a real risk of a
multitude of cases being pursued individually, which is why we are
dealing with matters under
legislation.</div><a name="1001138000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
19 creates two bases for collective proceedings, a matter raised by the
hon. Member for Fareham. After making a collective proceedings order,
the court must decide whether proceedings should be on an opt-in basis
or an opt-out basis. In an opt-in case, the claimants who want to take
part must identify themselves and agree to be represented. In an
opt-out case, all those  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 380</div>with an eligible claim will be included automatically without the need
to identify themselves. They will be able to opt out of the group
within a certain
period.</div><a name="1001138000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to recognise that financial services cases can differ
enormously, for example in their size and complexity and in the legal
basis for the claim. That is why it is essential that the court has
wide case management powers to deal with claims in a way that suits the
particular circumstances of the claims. That includes allowing the
court to determine whether collective proceedings should take place
and, if so, on what basis&#151;whether it is an opt-in case or an
opt-out case. That is why clause 19 makes provision for both opt-in and
opt-out proceedings and gives the court the responsibility of deciding
the most appropriate, which is the right way to
operate.</div><a name="1001138000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
20 is more technical. It provides that, when giving a judgment or
making an order in collective proceedings, the court must direct
whether or not to bind some or all represented persons. For the
proposed collective proceedings procedure to work efficiently and
fairly, it is necessary that judgments or orders can bind group
members. Otherwise, group members will be able to bring individual
proceedings even though the judgment in the collective proceedings has
gone against
them.</div><a name="1001138000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
someone has opted in to collective proceedings or has failed to opt out
of the proceedings, it is only right that they should be prepared to
accept the consequences of the actions of the representative in the
proceedings. If collective proceedings are to be an effective tool for
resolving cases&#151;as we want them to be&#151;involving large
numbers of claims, it is essential for the court to decide that
judgments or orders are binding on some or all represented persons or
representatives, as appropriate.</div>
<a name="1001138000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses 18, 19
and 20, together with the other clauses that we shall be debating soon,
introduce a new form of group action into UK law. It is an efficient
way of dealing with mass claims that currently have to be dealt with
individually. It will help to improve access to justice; many good
claims are currently not dealt with at
all.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000341"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I start with the general argument that the Minister
made about why collective proceedings orders are necessary. The
starting point was the Ministry of Justice response to the Civil
Justice Council report about collective actions. The Ministry&#146;s
response was that such actions should be used only in particular
sectors. I can see a clear argument why the financial services sector,
given the number of mis-selling claims in recent years, is appropriate,
with a group of cases with similar threads running through
them.</div>
<a name="1001138000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said that, in reality, such actions should be used only when the law
was unclear. I thought that an interesting argument, because the law
may be unclear in many areas of consumer activity. To pick on that
sector spoiled his argument, which supported a more generic right
rather than one tailored to the sector, particularly given the degree
of regulation involved. I am not sure that he made the most robust case
for why the sector should be the one highlighted as the
guinea
pig.</div><a name="1001138000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
same theme came out in the Ministry report. The legislation exists, but
we are some way off the detailed rules that will provide the safeguards
for which industry is looking. The Minister said that work on them
would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 381</div>conclude towards the end of the year, when they will be consulted upon.
Later clauses, such as clause 22, give the Treasury regulation-making
powers, but we have not seen the draft regulations. The Government have
used the Bill&#151;as the Treasury so often does&#151;as enabling
legislation, leaving everyone to trust in secondary legislation that
will be brought forward. That position is not satisfactory. The
Minister has not given the warmest of reassurances to those who pay
attention to our
proceedings.</div><a name="1001138000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that where the law is clear, the consumer redress
provisions should be used. I shall talk about the subject when we come
to clause 26, but that is not the impression that the general counsel
for the Financial Services Authority gave in his evidence to us before
Christmas. He indicated that the power could be used in cases in which
the law was unclear. There needs to be a safeguard to reflect that, but
I shall deal with that point at another
time.</div><a name="1001138000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister is setting out in the clause, and in other clauses in the
group dealing with collective proceedings orders, a framework that will
be filled in at a later stage, through either secondary legislation or
court rules. I suspect we shall hear that refrain a lot as I
talk through the amendments I have tabled. I hope he will go further
than saying simply, &#147;It has been consulted upon&#148;, because
there is a lot of concern about the measures, arising from the lack of
detailed information about the
rules.</div><a name="1001138000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West suggested that he was
surprised I was giving some responsibility to a politician&#151;in
this case, the Lord Chancellor. My amendment 58 follows the proposals
set out by the Civil Justice Council, which produced a draft Bill, and
this is one of its clauses. That point was reached by a group of
lawyers&#151;some judges and some practising barristers and
solicitors&#151;who had thought through the matter clearly. I assumed
that the Government would be rather keener than the Minister has
suggested to adopt something of the nature that the group had put
forward.</div><a name="1001138000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I make more substantive comments on clause 19, I take note
of the Minister&#146;s comments about the implications of clause 20.
One of the challenges in such cases is to create certainty of
treatment. That issue was in the minds of many people when the bank
charges case was going through court. How do we ensure certainty for
both claimants and defendants? It is right that measures are in place
to fix that, so people know exactly what their position
is.</div><a name="1001138000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Minister said, clause 19 gives some flexibility in choosing between
opt-in and opt-out. Arguments have been made in favour of both a pure
opt-in and a pure opt-out system; there is no universal consensus.
Under an opt-in scheme, consumers would have to identify themselves to
a representative bringing a claim; under opt-out, they would be
considered automatically unless they said otherwise. The court has
responsibility for directing whether proceedings will be brought on an
opt-in or opt-out basis.</div>
<a name="1001138000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
flexibility is reflected in the Civil Justice Council&#146;s
conclusions where the Government choose to follow its thoughts. Lord
Woolf wrote in
1996:</div><a name="1001138000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
court should have power to
progress&#148;</div><a name="1001138000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">a
multi-party situation</div>
<a name="1001138000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on an
&#145;opt-out&#146; or &#145;opt-in&#146; basis, whichever
contributes best to the effective and efficient disposition of the
case.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column382" />Column number: 382</div><a name="1001138000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an important
point.</div><a name="1001138000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Civil Justice Council wrote in its report
that</div><a name="1001138000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
large number of small claims arising out of a common contractual
dispute, holiday claims etc., may be better suited to resolution via an
opt-out collective action. If however a consumer claim appears to be
inherently suited to individualised litigation that is case managed as
a collective action of unitary actions (because, say, the size of the
class is very small, and each class member has indicated a wish to sue
individually and would probably opt-out to do so, were the proceedings
to be brought under an opt-out model), then the certification court
could appropriately order that the action be certified as a
GLO&#148;,</div><a name="1001138000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">or
group litigation order.</div>
<a name="1001138000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">In essence,
the Civil Justice Council is arguing that if the loss is likely to be
the same for all claimants, opt-out is the most appropriate mechanism
to deliver justice for those claimants, but if the loss, although
subject to common factors, is likely to be highly differentiated among
claimants, an opt-in arrangement is more appropriate.</div>
<a name="1001138000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have heard
a number of examples of cases in which that argument might be applied.
Equitable Life policyholders have been subject to the same regulatory
administrative failures, but the circumstances and nature of each
individual&#146;s losses are different. Anyone who reads Sir John
Chadwick&#146;s interim report can see how the different groups might
be affected. An opt-out case brought for Equitable Life might not
result in an efficient and effective disposition of the case, given the
varied interests involved. However, I suspect that the mis-selling of
payment protection insurance products would lend itself well to an
opt-out system due to the nature of the products and the scale of the
loss.</div><a name="1001138000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000342"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I am listening carefully, because that is an
interesting aspect that I had not considered. Does the hon. Gentleman
consider that there might be multiple collective actions representing
different complaints or series of complaints against the same company?
In other words, different class actions could go on at the same time in
the context of the same complaint, because different complainants would
be treated
differently.</div><a name="1001138000304"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="1001138000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000343"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Yes, I think that that is right. It is always
dangerous to use examples, as they never quite fit the precise
circumstances, but in the case of Equitable Life, there are different
groups of policyholders. Some people were late joiners. Their complaint
against Equitable Life or the regulator would be different from that of
the trapped annuitants, who could not leave Equitable Life
voluntarily.</div>
<a name="1001138000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that case,
a collective action covering all Equitable Life policyholders would not
seem to be the right process, even though they were all subject to
problems with Equitable Life and regulatory failure. We can see that an
event might trigger not one case but a multitude of cases, whether that
is because the policyholders&#146; circumstances are different,
because they are affected in particular ways, or because the problem
has a differential impact on different groups. Therefore, a series of
smaller collective actions might be a better way to proceed, rather
than a single action that covered all policyholders. That is one of the
issues on which we need flexibility on whether to opt in or out.
Recognising that need for flexibility, the Civil Justice Council
concluded that</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column383" />Column number: 383</div><a name="1001138000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
approach is one that does not therefore recommend the introduction of
any form of presumption as to whether a collective action should
operate on an opt-in or opt-out basis. It is an approach which places
the responsibility for designation with the court at the certification
stage.&#148;</div><a name="1001138000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is, we should leave it to the court to decide whether that is
appropriate.</div><a name="1001138000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the prospect of opt-out triggered concerns among lawyers and others,
who felt that it could lead to US-style litigation. Slaughter and May
said:</div><a name="1001138000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
development heralds the arrival on UK shores of a procedure for
consumer litigation, which is in some respects similar, at least in its
&#145;opt-out&#146; form, to the US &#145;class action&#146;
procedure. The result would likely be that large numbers of relatively
small claims which individual consumers might currently be unlikely to
pursue on an individual basis could be aggregated and brought through
collective
proceedings.&#148;</div><a name="1001138000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the concern that some have about the opt-out process. However, it is
not a universal concern, because the four consumer groups said in their
submission:</div><a name="1001138000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
do not believe industry concerns that an opt-out process will lead to
the development of a US-style class action culture are justified.
Opt-out is also a feature of collective redress systems in Portugal and
Scandinavia but these countries have not experienced the same problems
as the
US.&#148;</div><a name="1001138000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">They
went on to echo a point that the Minister has
made:</div><a name="1001138000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is the particular features of the American legal system, rather than
the nature of the opt-out system per se, that have led to the class
action culture. In contrast to the US, our legal system is
characterised by close judicial supervision and the Bill rightly builds
on this tradition by ensuring judicial checks and
balances.&#148;</div><a name="1001138000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Industry&#146;s
concern is that if the checks and balances are meant to ensure that the
opt-out system does not become a US class action process, it would like
to see what those checks and balances are more clearly.</div>
<a name="1001138000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the one
hand, consumer groups say that opt-out is necessary and not something
to be feared, while on the other hand, industry claims the opposite. So
what is the case for a purely opt-out situation? Those who argue in
favour of the opt-out must make the case for moving away from the
flexibility.</div><a name="1001138000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
criticism of restricting the measures to opt-in is that it does not
move us very far from the existing set-up. There is already provision
to bring a group litigation order; to the minds of some, that is
already an opt-in procedure. The Courts Service says:</div>
<a name="1001138000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
group litigation order can be made in any claim where there are
multiple parties or claimants to the same cause of action. The order
will provide for the case management of claims which give rise to
common or related issues of fact or
law.&#148;</div><a name="1001138000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
it was a group litigation order that Which? used to initiate
proceedings against JJB for the price-fixing of football shirts. That
gives rise to a further possible argument: in such cases, the amount
lost per customer is so minimal as to discourage any complainant from
actively becoming involved, and that allows the company to escape
justice. The loss per person might be relatively small, although a
large number of people are involved. In situations where it is not
worth pursuing the case, organisations such as JJB would escape
justice. Provided that the authorised person is properly approved, is
there any reason why they could not draft more complainants in on an
opt-out basis?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column384" />Column number: 384</div><a name="1001138000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
there are reasons other than the monetary amount that discourage people
from involving themselves on an opt-in basis, such as fear of the legal
system or simple human inertia. The Association of British Insurers
said:</div><a name="1001138000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
these reasons act as a disincentive for a consumer to opt-in to joining
a CCR action, why should the same consumer with the same social and
psychological issues be forced by default to participate in litigation
on an opt-out
basis?&#148;</div><a name="1001138000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the ABI, clearly one of the arguments on opting in is that it makes
sure that everyone possible is involved in the measure. One of the
criticisms of opting in is that it requires people to overcome their
inertia and reluctance to engage. If people are automatically assumed
to be part of a class action, will they really volunteer to opt out? It
is almost the reverse of the nudge
argument.</div><a name="1001138000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want the default position to be right for the person, so that it gets
them to do what is instinctively right. I sense that one of the reasons
for an opt-out process is that it automatically assumes that the
individual would like to be part of litigation and to pursue their
case, and that they should therefore be in a position to pursue that
litigation, even if they are not actively engaged. That assumes that
the right safeguards are in place in cases where opt-out is
appropriate. It is a strong argument for universal application of an
opt-out. In the evidence sessions, Jane Vass from Age Concern and Help
the Aged said:</div>
<a name="1001138000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
particularly welcome the proposal for collective proceedings with an
opt-out procedure, which will redress a great imbalance for older
people, who often are not in a position to make a complaint themselves
if they are socially isolated, if they do not have support, if they are
immobile, or if they just do not have access to the available forms of
information.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Financial Services Public Bill Committee, </i>8 December 2009; c. 50,
Q140.]</div><a name="1001138000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
ABI suggested that an opt-out system would be a dramatic shift in the
process of law in the United Kingdom that raised serious constitutional
and human rights issues. In the first instance, it felt that the impact
of opt-out systems on the due process rules, as enshrined in the
European convention on human rights, was unclear. It felt that
individuals should not be made to be claimants without their knowledge
or explicit consent. It also said that defendants have a fundamental
right to know who is accusing them of unlawful conduct, so the creation
of an opt-out consumer collective redress is likely to give rise to
fundamental reconsiderations of the philosophical basis for European
legal traditions. I suspect that that fundamental reconsideration is
outside the scope of the Committee, but the ABI&#146;s response
demonstrates our concern about making significant moves to change the
legal framework for bringing such actions in a narrow sector, when
there are wider considerations to be thought about. It is also a
reminder of why we are worried about the lack of evidence on what
safeguards will be in
place.</div><a name="1001138000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
there is to be such a fundamental change, we need to move with caution
and ensure that there are adequate safeguards. If the fears about
US-style litigious culture are well founded, we must make sure that
proper safeguards are in place. The European Justice Forum, which I
spoke about this morning, said in its representation on the
subject:</div><a name="1001138000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Class
actions are an exceptionally powerful and potentially dangerous
instrument, as evidenced by the experience of other countries. If they
are to be used at all they must be contained within carefully designed
provisions that will avoid abusive claims and ill founded
litigation.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column385" />Column number: 385</div><a name="1001138000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">My conclusion
is that while there are some strong arguments for a pure opt-out, there
are valid concerns about why it would be inappropriate to allow only
opt-outs, given our legal system and the safeguards. The Civil Justice
Council has got it about right: it says that there should some
flexibility, and that that flexibility should be determined by the
court, based on the circumstances of each individual
case.</div><a name="1001138000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
rehearsing the arguments on whether there should be an opt-in or an
opt-out system, we have demonstrated some of the tensions underlying
the introduction of such actions, and reinforced the need for further
safeguards. That was the point of amendment
58.</div><a name="1001138000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister says that the issue will be part of the consultation on the
court rules, and I welcome that. However, there is a lack of
transparency about the process at the moment, although the Minister has
shed some light on it. It would be helpful if more information were
shared with the Committee on how the legislation will go forward and
how the details will be filled in. That would be helpful, and might
provide reassurance to those who take an interest in such
matters.</div><a name="1001138000087"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000344"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> In the course of debate in Committee, we shall
provide additional detail, which may help those who follow our
proceedings. However, as I said a few moments ago, there will be court
rules, which will be consulted on. That is
important.</div><a name="1001138000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to go back to two points made by the hon. Member for Fareham.
First, I want to make it clear that financial services is a sector in
which there has been a history of mis-selling and other scandals, and
that is why the Government think the sector appropriate for collective
proceedings. Consumer complaints, for instance, have risen from 31,000
in 2001 to 128,000 in the year to March 2009. It is intended that
collective proceedings will be appropriate not just where the law is
unclear, although obviously, where the law is unclear, collective
proceedings will definitely be
relevant.</div><a name="1001138000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000345"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Where the law is clear, should we not expect the
regulator to take action and not require consumers to go through the
court
process?</div><a name="1001138000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000346"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The hon. Gentleman talked about defaults, and the
default position is that we have effective regulation, which should
sort out problems. However, in real life, in some areas individuals
will always have complaints, which they may feel have not been
adequately addressed. We should not circumscribe the rights of
individuals who want to take legal action. In the Bill, we are helping
the action to take place on a collective rather than an individual
basis.</div><a name="1001138000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman made a number of points on both sides of the argument.
He gave the views of the consumer advocacy groups, which are strongly
in favour; and mentioned some of the concerns felt by people in the
industry about how the system might operate. I think that he came down
on the side of saying that we ought to have the provisions in the Bill.
It is important that we have both opt-in and opt-out. I want to
emphasise that there is no necessary, once-and-for-all division between
having an opt-in case and an opt-out case; cases may need elements of
either procedure. The hon. Gentleman gave some examples of why
different approaches 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column386" />Column number: 386</div>might be necessary. Certainly, clause 19 provides for the court to be
able to change the basis from opt-out to opt-in as issues and
circumstances
arise.</div><a name="1001138000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, after the generic issues have been determined, it might be
helpful if the court could require group members to opt in. The court
could then deal with individual distinctions and issues for the
purposes of making different awards and categories. We can all foresee
instances in which cases might continue on one basis, but we can also
envisage situations in which one might need to switch during the course
of the case. Having the flexibility to do so is important, and giving
that power to the court is the right thing to do. I think that that
answers the broad thrust of the last of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
arguments, and I hope that the Committee can agree to clauses 18, 19
and
20.</div><a name="1001138000093"></a>

withdraw his amendment.</div>
<a name="1001138000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000349"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> As the Minister helpfully prompts from a sedentary
position, I think I was about to withdraw my
amendment.</div><a name="1001138000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not expect the Minister to respond on this point, because we have a
difference of view on the subject, but my concern is still that the
regulator should be in a position to take action where the law is clear
and where a regulatory matter has given rise to the concerns. There is
a danger that the regulators will be able to push to one side their
responsibility for consumer redress and for ensuring that the consumer
problem is resolved by saying, &#147;It&#146;s okay; if they are
that concerned, they can take it to court.&#148; That is not the
position that we should be
in.</div><a name="1001138000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
highlights a gap that has emerged since the introduction of FSMA. The
Financial Ombudsman Service, which is the alternative dispute
resolution mechanism and point of contact for individual consumers
seeking to resolve a dispute that they have with a provider, has filled
a vacuum. In large group actions where there is widespread evidence of
mis-selling, whether of mortgages or of PPI, the FOS seems to be taking
on a role in resolving those complaints, which, in a way, is outside
its remit. However, if it had not filled that vacuum, I am not sure
what would have happened. There would certainly have been a pressing
need for a collective action order.</div>
<a name="1001138000305"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="1001138000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a weakness in the regulatory structure. That issue might be
addressed when we discuss consumer redress under clause 26, but it
remains my nagging doubt that we still have not tackled it properly.
The Ministry of Justice said that we need to look at individual
sectors, and the Civil Justice Council said that we must look at the
alternative procedures. I do not think that we have properly looked at
alternative procedures that would improve the regulatory system and
ensure that consumers did not need to have recourse to law to resolve
their rights. Having made that point again, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000352"></a>Mr.

person; authorised person who is an investment firm or credit

<a name="1001138000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to ensure that
the redress or collective proceedings process covers not only people
who are authorised by the FSA, but those who have undertaken consumer
credit action. We know that those who are provided with consumer credit
fall outside the remit of the FSA. However, we do not have a definition
of who brings the complaint&#151;the claimant&#151;in this process.
Amendment 59 would introduce a new paragraph (c), while new subsection
(8) defines a consumer.</div>
<a name="1001138000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">That creates
further clarity regarding who is bringing the complaint and what the
process is. Without defining who has suffered the loss, it is difficult
to say what a complaint actually is. We need symmetry. We have
identified the defendants, but should we not identify who is in a
position to make claims? It is a relatively straightforward
amendment.</div><a name="1001138000107"></a>

&#147;consumer&#148; given by the hon. Member for Fareham in
amendment 60. I will explain why we believe it right to include in the
scope of class actions businesses, especially small businesses, as well
as charities, the self-employed and individuals acting in a
professional
capacity.</div><a name="1001138000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
definition of those whose claims can be represented is related closely
to the definition of &#147;consumer&#148; in the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000. I consider it important to maintain the
relationship between those who may benefit from regulation and those
who may benefit from collective proceedings. It is advisable and
desirable to avoid a situation in which a firm and an individual are
protected by the same regulation, but the individual has access to
greater or better routes of redress. I also do not see any reason why
court proceedings brought by large businesses should not benefit from
the more effective group litigation procedures, although for small
businesses, charities and the self-employed, the scope to act in that
way is clearly highly
important.</div><a name="1001138000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
collective proceedings procedure does not create new liabilities or
claims; it is simply a more efficient way of dealing with a number of
similar claims. If a group 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 388</div>of firms or professionals have valid claims, it seems to me that they
should be able to apply for a class action if that is the most
efficient way of handling those claims. For their claim to be valid,
businesses will have to show that they have cases with generic issues
that can be dealt with on a group basis by a representative. The court
will be able to authorise the action only if that is the most
appropriate way of disposing of the issues. To my mind and the
Government&#146;s, the same logic applies to businesses and to
individuals.</div><a name="1001138000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
the hon. Gentleman is concerned that the clause would allow commercial
creditors to apply for a class action against a financial services
provider. I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the definition in
clause 21(1) of what types of claim they might be able to
make through a class action. It is limited to cases in which they could
show that their claim was connected with carrying on a regulated
activity or dealing with the authorised person in the course of a
regulated
activity.</div><a name="1001138000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ultimately,
of course, it is for the court to decide the most appropriate way to
manage a large number of claims. I believe that our approach is
preferable to excluding a whole category of potential claimants, as the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment would. I hope that I have persuaded
him not to press his amendment.</div>
<a name="1001138000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000354"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> It is an interesting interpretation of my
amendment. I would not say that it prevented a plumbing company that
took part in a regulated transaction, for example, from pursuing a
claim. I certainly expect that it would prevent a bank from suing
another bank or a group of professional investors from suing another
institution. I do not think that it would stop most businesses from
taking part in a class action.</div>
<a name="1001138000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment
is targeted predominantly at consumers: ordinary people in the street
who buy financial services products. My impression was that it aims not
to enable a string of corporates to take part in actions but to help
people who might feel that they were not properly represented or could
not afford to bring an action. The Minister&#146;s explanation seems
to have widened the scope of who could bring an action beyond what I
think most people reading the Bill would assume.</div>
<a name="1001138000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tabled the
amendment to tease out who the Government expect to benefit from the
provisions. It seems that anyone, whether they are wholly unfamiliar
with the legal system or a large multinational, can use them. They are
presented as a measure to help consumers rather than corporates, so the
Minister&#146;s response indicates how wide the group of claimants
can be. It is much wider than I think people assumed before he
responded.</div><a name="1001138000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I will withdraw the amendment, tabling it has clarified who the
Government expect to take part in the process. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="1001138000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000355"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment 61, in clause
22, page 25, line 19, leave out from &#145;Authority&#146; to
&#145;are&#146; in line 20 and
insert</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0">&#145;and the Office of Fair

<div class="Column"><a name="Column389" />Column number: 389</div><a name="1001138000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
the amendment is to tease out the rationale behind the inclusion of the
financial ombudsman in the list of parties in subsection (2)(a) that
are entitled to be heard on an application for a collective proceedings
order. Given that the Bill applies to transactions regulated by either
the FSA or the Office for Fair Trading, it is clear why they have the
right to be heard on an application, but the ombudsman is not a
regulator; the ombudsman is an alternative dispute resolution
body.</div>
<a name="1001138000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of including the ombudsman is not clear. Is it now deemed to be
a quasi-regulator? I know that some people in the industry see it as
such. Is it because the ombudsman is in a position to collect data
through the number of claims that it receives? The Minister gave us
figures earlier about how many complaints it receives. Is it because
the ombudsman can identify when large numbers of claims are being made
about a particular firm, product or service? Is it there to provide
insight into the development or generation of a claim made to the
courts? It would be helpful if the Minister explained the purpose of
including the ombudsman.</div>
<a name="1001138000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000356"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> The hon. Gentleman might be reading the clause
slightly differently from me. It does not give the ombudsman the right
to be heard in the claim itself; it gives the ombudsman the right to be
heard on an application for a collective proceedings order, which is
rather
different.</div><a name="1001138000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000357"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Yes, but my point remains. Why is the ombudsman
there, given that the two other bodies are regulators and the ombudsman
is a way of resolving disputes? What standing has the ombudsman been
given in the
process?</div><a name="1001138000306"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5pm</div><a name="1001138000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000358"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Let me clarify the Government&#146;s
intentions. I will say at the outset that it is always preferable to
find a regulatory solution, and the changes that we are making to the
FSA&#146;s redress powers in clause 26 are designed to make it more
likely that a regulatory solution will happen. However, that will not
always be possible. It will be for the court to determine in the light
of evidence from the OFT, the FSA and the Financial Ombudsman Service,
as appropriate, whether collective proceedings are the most suitable
means of dealing with the case.</div>
<a name="1001138000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
invites debate about why the financial ombudsman should be included,
given its different status. Clearly, the FSA and OFT have variable
information. I note that the hon. Gentleman does not dispute that they
should be heard when the court is deciding whether such proceedings
should take
place.</div><a name="1001138000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Admittedly,
the Financial Ombudsman Service is in a somewhat different position.
The ombudsman cannot offer a collective alternative to collective
proceedings and can only hear cases on an individual basis, and its
determinations are not automatically binding on the consumer. However,
the Financial Ombudsman Service will be able to make representations to
the court about such things as the suitability of the ombudsman to deal
with the cases. It may also tell the court about the volume of
complaints that it has received and what it plans to do with them. It
will also be important for the court to know whether the ombudsman has
resolved any cases.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column390" />Column number: 390</div><a name="1001138000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
information should assist the court in making its decision. For
example, the court will need to decide whether the ombudsman and the
county courts would offer a better solution. The court would also need
to decide whether collective proceedings and complaints to the
ombudsman can continue in tandem. Finally, the court will need to know
whether the ombudsman is planning to dismiss the cases and whether that
is dependent on a collective proceedings order being made. It is to be
expected that in many cases the ombudsman may well be preferred over
collective proceedings, because it may be able to offer a cheap and
informal solution for all or for a significant number of the claims.
For such reasons, we believe that it is important that the voice of the
ombudsman is heard and that the information it is able to provide can
be made available to the courts. I hope that provides helpful
clarification to the hon. Member for
Fareham.</div><a name="1001138000126"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000359"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I certainly agree with the Minister. If the court
is to be assisted, potentially, why is the court not to be given the
power to require such bodies to attend? The provision simply says words
to the effect, in lay terms, that they can come along if they want to.
If they are to be of so much assistance to the court, which I agree
they would be, why does the Bill not say that the court can require
them to come
along?</div><a name="1001138000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000360"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I cannot answer my hon. Friend immediately about
the legal drafting of the clause, but I can tell him about the policy
effect. We want the FSA, the Office of Fair Trading and the Financial
Ombudsman Service to be able to provide information to the courts that
enables them to make decisions. I do not think that there will be any
reluctance to do so. That is clearly the policy intention, which I
believe the legislation before us is effective in achieving, but if
there are any drafting points, I shall go back to my officials and make
sure that the legislation does what we want it to do in policy
terms.</div><a name="1001138000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000361"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his response. He
clarifies ably the purpose of having the Financial Ombudsman Service
here&#151;it is not because it is a regulator, but because it will
have access to information that will help the court decide whether such
a case may proceed. I am sure that the ombudsman&#146;s work will
help inform some of the conclusions that a court may wish to reach
about the best process for resolving such
matters.</div><a name="1001138000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
recent years the ombudsman has become more involved in the resolution
of multiple claims with a single cause, moving away from its position
of simply looking at individual, isolated cases. For the court to be
able to use that knowledge in determining how a case should be managed
is right. I suspect that there would be no need to compel the ombudsman
or the others to take part in such proceedings, because regulators
should be jealous of their role in trying to resolve the
issues&#151;they would see a court solution as a welcome one. They
would all want a resolution, even through the ombudsman&#146;s
alternative dispute resolution vehicle, while the OFT or FSA would want
to demonstrate to the court what they can do to resolve the matter.
Otherwise, increasingly, questions would be asked about the
effectiveness of the regulators, so they would want to be in the court
to say 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column391" />Column number: 391</div>what they have done and how they can resolve it. Compelling those bodies
to attend the court would probably not add much to the process. Having
heard the Minister&#146;s explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000362"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment 62, clause 22, page 25,
leave out lines 22 to
29.</div><a name="1001138000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
22 sets out the Treasury&#146;s regulation-making power in the Bill,
in connection with collective proceedings. There is an issue about who
should determine the ground rules for such cases. I expect the hon.
Member for Wolverhampton, South-West fully to support the amendment, on
the basis of his comments on amendment 58, where he accused me of
giving power to politicians. In this case, I want to take power away
from politicians by restricting the Treasury&#146;s right to make
regulations in three areas. Those areas are: what matters the court
should have regard to; the circumstances under which the court may make
an order; and in paragraph (d), I do not believe that the regulations
should provide for what collective proceedings may or may not include.
I argue that that should be done by court rules rather than by
regulation-making powers. The risk is that the Treasury will get too
involved in the detail of what happens in court and the way that the
cases are handled, and I am not sure that that would be entirely
appropriate.</div>
<a name="1001138000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000363"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I do not anticipate supporting the amendments, and
I say to the hon. Member for Fareham that they are different from
amendment 58. Amendment 58 set up a politician, the Lord
Chancellor, as a gatekeeper regarding who would have access to exercise
their legal rights. The subsections that the hon. Gentleman seeks to
delete do not set up a politician as a gatekeeper in individual
cases.</div>
<a name="1001138000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000364"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It might be helpful to the Committee if I
explained what we seek to do in the lines that the hon. Member for
Fareham proposes to delete with his amendment. The idea is to have a
reserve power to make regulations that set out extra criteria for the
court to take into account. I will explain why we feel that reserve
power to be necessary. First, I agree with the hon. Gentleman in that I
expect the main criteria to be in the court rules. Those will be
generic in nature, and are intended to apply to class actions
generally. It may be necessary to tailor the effect of the court
rules&#151;once they have been finished&#151;to the characteristics
of financial services. That might mean adding supplementary
requirements to those set out in the court rules, which is why a
reserve power may be necessary.</div>
<a name="1001138000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am confident
that the court rules will be comprehensive and contain the necessary
safeguards to prevent nuisance claims. The rules will also seek to
eliminate any possibility of the new process being open to abuse.
However, if any additional safeguards are needed for financial
services, the clause allows the Treasury to supply them. For example,
we expect that the court rules will have tests to ensure that
litigation is a last resort, that costs are addressed, that the
representative is appropriate and that a class action is the most
appropriate way to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column392" />Column number: 392</div>resolve the issues that claimants have in common. Looking beyond that,
it may be necessary or desirable to put into Treasury regulations a
requirement for the court to examine the merits of a case before
authorising it; or for the court to have regard to any particular
action being taken by the regulator.</div>
<a name="1001138000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another area
that may be addressed by the Treasury via the power is the criteria for
eligibility to bring an action. For example, the Treasury might wish to
use the power to restrict the category of persons who can act as
representatives, something that we touched on earlier when we said that
we would want to consult. We will want to consider carefully whether
representatives should be restricted to public interest bodies or those
who would not earn a fee for their services, a point that we have also
mentioned
before.</div><a name="1001138000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate the point made by the hon. Member for Fareham when he said
that the court rules are not yet in existence and that we are talking
about a framework. The rules committee is expected to consult on the
draft rules in due course, so it is not possible to say exactly what
the Treasury might want to specify in our regulations as we first want
to look at the court rules to see whether they provide sufficient
safeguards and then consider whether further or different provision is
needed for class actions relating specifically to financial services.
It is prudent that we have a reserve power, and accepting the amendment
would reduce the flexibility of the Treasury to tailor collective
proceedings to the particular features of financial services. Both
consumer groups and the industry would want to make sure that our
approach is properly
tailored.</div><a name="1001138000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
is the normal procedure, we would, of course, consult on the
regulations if we decide that it is necessary for them to be introduced
to ensure that they work well in conjunction with the court rules.
Because the amendment will remove potentially needed flexibility, I
hope that the hon. Member for Fareham will withdraw
it.</div><a name="1001138000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000365"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I have to say that, as the debate continues, I have
become more wary and perhaps uneasy about the measures. That is not
necessarily because I disagree with their principle, but because no one
is actually sure where they will end up. The Minister referred to the
powers as reserve powers to tighten up the rules made by the court, but
I am interested to know whether reserve powers will be needed because
the rules committee has not come up with the draft rules yet and,
because we do not have them, we cannot have draft regulations. It
sounds as though we are in a territory where the Government want as
much power as possible just in case the court does not do what they
expect it to
do.</div><a name="1001138000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman talked about tightening up the eligibility criteria or
changing the rules governing who can be a representative, but if the
Treasury believes that it needs to override the rules committee, are
there adequate safeguards to ensure that there is proper parliamentary
scrutiny of the Treasury&#146;s ability to take such action? Under
subsection (6) of clause 22, the regulatory-making powers are subject
to the negative resolution procedure. If the power is a reserve power
to tackle what the Government regard as being inappropriately loose
rules drawn up by a court, why should they be able to interfere with
those rules simply by issuing an order that goes through the negative
resolution procedure?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column393" />Column number: 393</div><a name="1001138000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">There should be
much greater safeguards governing the exercise of the use of what are
apparently reserve powers under the Bill than is currently set out in
the clause. There is nothing in the provisions that tells me that the
powers are secondary to the court rules. There could be circumstances
in which the Government say that the powers take precedence over court
rules. What provisions in the Bill will ensure that the powers are
reserve powers, to which the Minister referred? Nothing tells me that
that is the case. There is a weakness in the drafting of the clause as
it seems to give the main power to the Treasury, not the court. We
should receive greater clarification of the matter in the Bill.
However, as that proposal does not relate to my amendment, which would
delete paragraphs (b), (c) and (d), I cannot press it further. I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="1001138000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

power
to</div><a name="1001138000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;modify
the effect of any limitation

64 gives more detail about what the regulations might be able to cover.
The origin of the two amendments goes back to the recommendations of
the Civil Justice Council. They probe why the Government seem to have
strayed from the CJC&#146;s recommendations on collective
proceedings. We have here the power to change the effect of limitation
provision. The explanatory note tells us that the powers could be
used</div><a name="1001138000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to

(e) currently allows the Treasury
to</div><a name="1001138000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;modify
the effect of any limitation provision&#148;.</div>
<a name="1001138000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (3) gives
some detail on what the modifications might entail. They can prescribe
cases where no account is taken of any limitation provision and, among
other things, enable the court to take no account of any specified
period.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div><a name="1001138000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Civil
Justice Council outlined the principle on limitation provisions in its
report. It
says:</div><a name="1001138000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is recommended that limitation should be suspended when a putative
representative party issues a claim which seeks certification as an
opt-out collective action. At that point all the members of the
represented class are potentially before the court by way of
representation and have therefore potentially issued a claim by
representation. The suspension of limitation should be lifted and time
should start running for the class members where certification is
refused or they opt-out of the
action.&#148;</div><a name="1001138000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a sense, it says that, while the action is taking place, while cases
are being heard within the collective action, the limitation should
stop. The time should not tick on the clock. However, if a party
decides for some reason to opt out during the case, or the
certification is refused, the limitation should continue to run. The
recommendations
continue:</div><a name="1001138000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Equally,
the suspension should be lifted if the claim once certified is then at
a future stage decertified or if on certification the court draws the
boundaries of the class on a narrower basis than the representative
party had originally drawn them in the claim as issued or the class
member for some other reason ceases to be part of the
class.&#148;</div><a name="1001138000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is therefore looking for more detailed guidance about the circumstances
in which the limitation can be suspended. When that suspension stops,
it looks at examples from overseas and gives an example from the
Australian federal collective action scheme, which
reads:</div><a name="1001138000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Suspension
of limitation
periods</div><a name="1001138000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">(1)
Upon the commencement of a representative proceeding, the running of
any limitation period that applies to the claim of a group member to
which the proceeding relates is
suspended.</div><a name="1001138000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">(2)
The limitation period does not begin to run again unless either the
member opts out of the proceeding under section 33J or the proceeding,
and any appeals arising from the proceeding, are determined without
finally disposing of the group member&#146;s
claim.&#148;</div><a name="1001138000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
breadth of the drafting in the Bill gives the Treasury the discretion
to depart from the principles. My amendments take the Bill closer to
the safeguards set out by the Civil Justice Council. It would appear
that the council&#146;s recommended safeguards reflect best practice
elsewhere, so I am keen to understand why the Government have sought to
move away from them.</div>

Pearson:</b> First, on amendment 63, I am not sure that it is
necessary to clarify that the provision applies to members of a class
action, as that is self-evident. I think that the main bone
of contention is amendment 64. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman
recognises that it might be necessary to preserve an
individual&#146;s right of action if their claim would be timed out
before a group action concludes. That is one reason why subsection
(2)(e) is needed. It will deal with claimants who began their
individual claim before a class action began. They should not be
exposed to hitting a time bar while a class action proceeds, and they
might need a grace period before resuming action on their
claims.</div>
<a name="1001138000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">There might be
other circumstances not reflected in the proposed amendments in which
it is appropriate to suspend limitation: for example, when a class
action ends before a final judgment. Separate claims represented may
then be brought in their own right. Limitation could be suspended for a
period to allow represented claims to begin separately in their own
right. Again, they might need a grace period before resuming 
action.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column395" />Column number: 395</div><a name="1001138000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
do not cover all the possible circumstances in which limitation might
need to be varied for strictly technical purposes. Instead of
specifying a list of circumstances in which limitation may be varied,
it seems more effective and flexible to have a general provision. That
is what we propose. It is clear on the face of the Bill. If we were to
specify in the Bill the circumstances in which limitation can be
modified, we might find in future circumstances in which it is
appropriate to suspend limitation that we cannot do so. That is why I
am reluctant to put more detail into the Bill, although I recognise the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s points.</div>
<a name="1001138000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
reassure the Committee that the power can be used only in connection
with collective proceedings. It cannot be used to disregard periods of
limitation for any other purpose than securing an effective and fair
consideration of a collective proceeding. For those reasons, I believe
that the amendments are not necessary, and I urge the hon. Gentleman
not to press them.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000370"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Part of the problem is that the Government, in
trying to maximise their flexibility and avoid too much constraint, are
deploying that flexibility at the expense of greater clarity and
certainty. It is a dull point to return to, but if the process had been
further along the track before the Bill came along, it might have
clarified a number of doubts about the operation of the provisions. The
timing is not great, frankly. We are introducing legislative proposals
that create huge uncertainty while the safeguards are not yet in such a
state that people can refer to and gain comfort and reassurance from
them. That is part of the challenge with which we are dealing. Some are
demanding greater certainty and clarity about the use of the powers
than is available in the Bill. That is what the amendments aim to tease
out from the
Minister.</div><a name="1001138000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not press amendments 63 and 64, but there is a challenge here that
must be addressed. The clauses are creating debate and concern because
the process is taking place in a vacuum and we do not have sight of
draft rules or regulations. That is the problem that we are going to
have. The Minister&#146;s remarks might be sufficient to satisfy
people outside the House, but we will have to consider the provisions
again on Report or during proceedings in the other place. I beg to ask

insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0">&#145;(a) to make a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000372"></a>The

amendment 66, in clause 23, page 26, line 25, at end

<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 396</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0">&#145;(3A) The regulations must require the court,
before making an order under subsection (3), to provide the defendant
with an opportunity to make submissions to the court in respect of any
matter relating to a proposed aggregate damages
award.&#146;.</div><a name="1001138000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000373"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The amendments are to clause 23, which gives the
Treasury the power to make regulations concerning damages. I am not
clear about the interaction between the regulation-making power and the
court rules, whether the powers are reserve powers, or whether we will
see regulations that will drive the court rule process. Perhaps the
Minister can provide some clarification on that. In clause 22(2)(f),
the Treasury is enabled to make regulations about the award of damages,
and clause 23 sets out the scope of the regulations in more detail. The
key part is subsection (2), which
says:</div><a name="1001138000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
regulations may enable the court to make an award of damages without
undertaking an assessment of the amount of damages recoverable in
respect of each claim comprised in the
proceedings.&#148;</div><a name="1001138000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
collective proceedings, what happens when we get to the end of the
case? What sort of ruling does the court make on the damages that are
to be awarded against the defendant, and how does that reflect the
experiences of each claimant? That method will be useful in dealing
with a lot of claims all at once, and it would be particularly helpful
in dealing with opt-out
proceedings.</div><a name="1001138000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two approaches in clause 23. Subsection (3)(a) says that the court
can make a total estimate of damages, based on the damages likely to be
awarded to individual complainants. It can think about the loss that
each individual claimant might have made, and use that as the basis for
calculating the total estimate of damages. If the court knows that
everybody lost &#163;5 as a consequence of a policy being mis-sold,
it would be relatively straightforward to determine the total estimate
of losses. Alternatively, in subsection (3)(b) a formula specified by
the court is used to calculate the level of damages.</div>
<a name="1001138000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another issue
is the departure from the principles laid down by the CJC. In its
recommendations, the CJC called for the Lord Chancellor to conduct a
wider policy debate on the issues, given the interaction of this law
with substantive law. Will the Minister tell the Committee whether that
wider policy debate has taken place and what its outcome was? Has that
recommendation been ignored, and if so, why?</div>
<a name="1001138000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
proposals, the CJC endorses something along the lines of what is
written in subsection (3)(a), which is a principle known as damage
aggregation. Damage aggregation is characterised
by</div><a name="1001138000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a computation of
damages that does not depend upon the summation of the class
members&#146; actual loss and damage. It is a means of quantifying
and proving loss not by reference to an individual claimant but by
treating the entire class as a unitary entity and assessing the global
damage suffered by the entire class. In that respect, an aggregate
assessment can practically occur by either a global or lump sum awarded
against the defendant, or it may be achieved by a formula applied on a
class-wide basis that determines individual class members&#146;
entitlements. Once the aggregate award is made then it is either for
the court to assess individual class members&#146; entitlement to a
share of the global sum or it is for the individual class members to
prove their entitlement to a
share.&#148;</div><a name="1001138000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
can see an attempt at the damage aggregation principle in subsection
(3), but the wording is different from that used by the CJC, which says
that the principle</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column397" />Column number: 397</div><a name="1001138000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;does not depend
on the summation of the class members&#146; actual
loss&#148;,</div><a name="1001138000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
is a means of calculating the
loss</div><a name="1001138000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not
by reference to an individual
claimant&#148;.</div><a name="1001138000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is divergence here: subsection (3)(a) seems to be a summation rather
than an aggregation, whereas the principle set out in the Civil Justice
Council paper was an aggregation. I am interested to know why the
Government have decided to go down the summation route rather than the
aggregation
route.</div><a name="1001138000308"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="1001138000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue about aggregation is not just about a claimant&#146;s
perspective but about the defendant&#146;s perspective. The Civil
Justice Council made the point about providing greater certainty for
defendants:</div><a name="1001138000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Damage
aggregation...ensures that the defendant has certainty and
finality in terms of their liability to all claimants who have suffered
detriment, especially where class members who have not yet joined the
beneficiaries have an opportunity to opt-in to the award or court
approved settlement; the award ensures that each claimant will get fair
compensation predicated on the totality of harm caused both by the
defendant per se and to each claimant on an individual basis; it thus
serves to ensure that claimants are properly compensated and that
defendants are not left in possession of any financial benefit derived
from their unjust conduct; it thus through its primarily compensatory
basis serves to assist and complement public regulatory
action.&#148;</div><a name="1001138000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
such a case, the defendants will know the total amount that they have
to pay, and the money is then allocated to each claimant on the basis
determined by the court. Subsection (3)(a) suggests simply totalling up
the losses that each individual has suffered. We have tabled amendments
65 and 66 to move away from summation to the aggregation approach
proposed by the Civil Justice
Council.</div><a name="1001138000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000374"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The amendments relate to a Treasury power to make
regulations about damages. I think that the hon. Gentleman accepts the
necessity of enabling the court to award damages without undertaking an
assessment of each individual claim. Instead, the court may make an
estimate of the damages for the whole group of claimants, or set out a
formula for assessing the damages for each claimant. That will enable
the courts to deal quickly and efficiently with cases involving
detriment to large numbers of consumers. It is an essential component
of the ability to manage a class
action.</div><a name="1001138000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause sets out some illustrative examples of what the regulations may
cover. The list is not exhaustive. The proposed amendments clarify that
a court may make an award to all or some claimants, provided that
liability can be assessed reasonably accurately and without proof from
individual members. The language in the example in the clause does not
exclude a power for the Treasury to permit aggregated damages for a
subgroup of persons. The clause refers to an award in respect of
different kinds of claims in a class action. As I say, the list is
illustrative. It would be consistent if an award could be made to a
subgroup of cases. Clause 24, which we shall come on to, envisages
subgroups being
formed.</div><a name="1001138000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would also give defendants the right to make submissions to
the court about an aggregate damages award. Providing a specific right
for the defendant to make submissions is not necessary, because
defendants 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column398" />Column number: 398</div>have a right to be heard throughout the proceedings. However, I agree
with the hon. Member for Fareham that a court should be able to make an
award to some and not all claimants, if that is the right thing to do,
but there is a danger of the amendments straying on to territory
covered by generic court
rules.</div><a name="1001138000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
fear that the hon. Gentleman will not be satisfied with the response
that the issue will be covered in the rules, but my general point,
which I have made in previous debates on such matters, is that the
measures will not come into force until the court rules and the
Treasury regulations have been consulted on and put in place. There
will be ample opportunity for the industry, consumer groups and others
to make representations on them. The court rules are highly likely to
provide for the management of subclasses of claimants and may provide
for a specific right to make submissions about damages to the
court.</div><a name="1001138000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assure the hon. Gentleman that his concerns, as set out in the
amendments, will be taken on board when developing the rules. As he is
aware, we have set out our sectoral approach to collective proceedings,
and we will consult on the regulations. Our response to the CJC
recommendations has been to say that further work will be done on
damages by the Lord Chancellor. We have worked closely with the
Ministry of Justice and will continue to do so to co-ordinate policy on
aggregated damages. We have sought to ensure broad consistency with
Civil Justice Council thinking on such issues, and there will be
opportunity for individuals, the industry and consumer groups to
comment on the detail of the regulations. It is for those reasons that
I do not believe that the amendments are necessary, and I urge the hon.
Gentleman to withdraw
them.</div><a name="1001138000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000375"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his response, in
which he gently reminded me that I had not spoken much at all about
amendment 66, which is about the right for the defendant to be heard
before an award is made for aggregated damages. I am pleased by his
reassurance that the defendant will have a right to be heard throughout
the case, including on the important issue that we are
discussing.</div><a name="1001138000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a way, the debate is taking place in a vacuum. We have had the
opportunity in this and previous debates to identify some of the issues
to do with safeguards in the Bill that are causing people concern.
Knowing that the rules committee will examine the matter is helpful. It
will be a challenge to ensure that the Bill makes clear the
relationship between the court rules and the regulations, and makes it
clear that the powers are reserve powers, a matter to which I shall
return on Report. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="1001138000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000376"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment 67, in clause
23, page 26, line 38, leave out from &#145;applied&#146; to end of
line 39 and insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0">&#145;in a

members.&#146;.</div><a name="1001138000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment deals with a further aspect of the clause and relates to
matters arising from an opt-out basis. What happens when the court
produces the award of damages and not everyone comes forward to claim
their share of the damages? We have an opt-out court process, but how
do we know that the final award will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column399" />Column number: 399</div>be distributed to all the potential claimants? Some balance might be
left at the end. Under subsection (5)(b), there is</div>
<a name="1001138000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provision about
the purposes for which any money not paid to represented persons is to
be
applied&#148;.</div><a name="1001138000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment would modify the wording that follows in brackets. It would

include charitable or other

make the provision more specific,

a manner that may reasonably be expected to benefit class
members&#148;,</div><a name="1001138000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">because
there is concern about what purpose the residual money will be used
for. Should we try to find a way to use any unclaimed money to benefit
the people who have been part of the collective proceedings
order?</div>
<a name="1001138000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The vagueness
of &#147;other purposes&#148; causes concern. There is also a legal
principle at issue involving the pursuit of something called a
cy-près distribution, where aggregate damages result in unpaid
moneys remaining when all payment has been satisfied. What will happen
to the
excess?</div><a name="1001138000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Civil Justice Council
says:</div><a name="1001138000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
collective actions are pursued on an opt-out basis experience shows
that there is the likelihood that there will remain an unclaimed
residue of the judgment damages award, especially where damage
aggregation occurs, or the settlement
award.&#148;</div><a name="1001138000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question then is: what is a fair and just use for such money? Which?
says:</div><a name="1001138000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
&#145;cy-près&#146; distribution of damages is needed: This
ensures any money left over from damages paid out to eligible consumers
can be used in a way specifically related to the claim, for example to
fund financial education or some other specific consumer-based project,
rather than returned to the
defendant.&#148;</div><a name="1001138000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
means that the court can determine what damages the defendant should
pay to reflect the gravity of the case, and that the defendant should
not benefit if money is left over at the end of the day, but should pay
the full price to the subject of the claim.</div>
<a name="1001138000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Civil
Justice Council recommended
that</div><a name="1001138000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
trustee be appointed to administer any judgment or settlement award or
alternatively that the representative party hold such a sum as trustee
for the class, and that where after a proper period of time with proper
and proportionate notice given to the class an unclaimed residue
remains that residue be applied by the trustee according to general
trust law principles. In appropriate cases, this unclaimed residue
could on this basis be distributed to a Foundation or
Trust.&#148;</div><a name="1001138000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment draws the uses to which the unclaimed residue could be put
rather more tightly than the Bill does; the Bill
says:</div><a name="1001138000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(which
may include charitable or other
purposes)&#148;.</div><a name="1001138000261"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Amendment
67 would tweak the rules back, so that the process was closer to that
which the Civil Justice Council thought ought to take place when it

class members. I understand and appreciate the sentiment, but the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment would create practical difficulties if
approved. Suggesting that a surplus can be applied only in the
interests of class members could cause problems, depending on who those
class members might be.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 400</div><a name="1001138000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us say, for

it, could be handed back to the defendants, but it could also go to a
charity, to an organisation such as the proposed consumer financial
education body, or to the social fund to improve access to affordable
credit for those on low incomes. It seems premature to the Government

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000381"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Amendment 68 leads into the proposed new
subsections that would be added by amendment 69, which is a lengthy
amendment.</div><a name="1001138000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
24 concerns the rules of court. In previous debates, we have discussed
what those rules should be, their importance, and the way in which they
will have primacy over the regulations that are referred to in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column402" />Column number: 402</div>clause 22. It would be welcome if there were a number of safeguards in
the Bill to help to give further structure to those court
rules.</div><a name="1001138000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
rules give the court the power to make provision on, among other
things, collective proceedings orders, the determination of whether a
person is treated as having opted in or out, and arrangements for
authorised persons. Again, it appears that the cautious approach of the
Civil Justice Council has been ignored, as the Bill departs from that
significantly. Let me be clear, however, that the council endorses the
approach of using rules of court. Its report
says:</div><a name="1001138000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
majority of the proposed procedural reforms could be introduced by
Rules of Court...developing existing procedure and principles laid
down in case
law.&#148;</div><a name="1001138000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
doing that, however, it is important that there are adequate
safeguards, but they are conspicuous in their absence from the
Bill&#146;s provisions on rules of court. Amendments 68 and 69 would
insert additional safeguards into the
Bill.</div><a name="1001138000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
68 would ensure that the rules of court would make provision about not
only evidence, but the proper disclosure of that evidence.
Additionally, proposed new subsection (8), which is in amendment 69,
would add safeguards on the approval of a collective proceedings
orders, while proposed new subsection (8)(a) would ensure that that was
used as a last resort. The Minister made the point earlier that it
should be a last resort, and that the other regulatory
routes&#151;either the FSA or the Financial Ombudsman
Service&#151;should be exhausted first. Solutions driven by
regulators or firms will always be preferable to using the courts. That
is the intent behind proposed subsection (8)(a).</div>
<a name="1001138000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
subsection (8)(b) is to ensure that there is a suitable representative
waiting to take up the case. Proposed subsection (8)(c) is to ensure
that there is a real point behind the collective proceeding and that
there is a prospect of success. They reflect the recommendations of the
Civil Justice Council. It wrote in its
report:</div><a name="1001138000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is apparent from a comparative analysis that a certification stage is
an essential element of any mature collective action mechanism.
Certification ensures that the court, consistently with the requirement
to manage actively cases consistently with the overriding objective, is
able to assess and decide on the most appropriate mechanism through
which a claim should progress i.e., as an opt-in, opt-out, traditional
unitary action, or through a group litigation order. It enables the
court to ensure that any claim progresses in a fashion which best
facilitates effective use of court resources and best facilitates
effective access to justice for both claimants and defendants
alike.&#148;</div><a name="1001138000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new subsection (9) adds safeguards to the representative person
provisions, stipulating in particular that they have a proper plan, no
conflicts of interest and that they are adequately resourced to carry
the process through. It reflects one of the concerns mentioned in the
council&#146;s report, to ensure that the process was not used for
non-meritorious, vexatious or spurious claims. By ensuring that it is
built into the court rules, it gives added protection about the use to
which the new process will be
put.</div><a name="1001138000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new subsection (10) introduces some rules around costs. It adds
safeguards that the representative is responsible for the
claimants&#146; costs and enshrines the &#147;loser pays&#148;
principle. The Civil Justice Council had this to say about
&#147;loser pays&#148; or so-called &#147;cost
shifting&#148;:</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column403" />Column number: 403</div><a name="1001138000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Cost-shifting
is a deterrent against speculative or so-called blackmail litigation,
unless the claimants are impecunious, in which case the court&#146;s
existing powers to award security for cost should provide protection
for defendants against such blackmail claims. Where the court
determines that there should be full or substantial part cost-shifting,
parties will need to demonstrate to the court that they are good for
the money, or are adequately
insured.&#148;</div><a name="1001138000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
it is a further safeguard to ensure that sensible claims are brought.
It also ensures there is a balance so that claimants who do not have
sufficient financial resources are covered in some
way.</div><a name="1001138000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new subsection (11) ensures that there is proper disclosure of
documents to include those held by individual claimants, not just the
representative. Proposed new subsection (12) allows the court to
conduct a hearing into a settlement of collective proceedings to ensure
that it is fair. On this the Civil Justice Council
said:</div><a name="1001138000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
a settlement is proposed and achieved, and experience in other
jurisdictions strongly supports the conclusion, it is recommended that
such a settlement should not be valid and binding unless it is approved
by the court following a &#145;fairness hearing&#146;. The
court&#146;s approval is necessary in order to protect the interests
of the absent claimants, who will be bound by the settlement. The
fairness hearing should not simply review the terms of the settlement
for fairness but also determine how absent claimants should opt in to
the settlement, what reasonable steps should be taken to advertise for
absent claimants to notify them of the settlement,, what evidence is
required to claim a share of the settlement, what the limitation period
should be set to claim a share and to determine who should administer
the
judgment.&#148;</div><a name="1001138000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
reflects the situation where there is an opt-out proceeding where the
court might award the damages on an aggregate damages basis, but we
then need to ensure that the right mechanism is in place to facilitate
the claims being made by people whose circumstances are covered by the
case. Clearly, on an opt-in basis, we will know who the individuals
are, and the allocation of damages can therefore be much more
straightforward.</div><a name="1001138000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new subsection (13) is about who can act as a representative. It
states:</div><a name="1001138000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
rules may not permit a person to substitute as a representative in
proceedings brought on an &#145;opt-out&#146; basis unless such
person is a body exercising public functions and is authorised to act
as representative by the Lord Chancellor under section
18(7)(b).&#148;</div>
<a name="1001138000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is to say that some
bodies will have a legitimate public interest in bringing such cases.
Again, to return to the JJB Sports group litigation order, Which? was
seen as a body that had a legitimate public interest. What we are
trying to tackle is how claims management companies may hijack that
process for their commercial interest, and not have a public interest
in acting as a representative. In a discussion on an earlier set of
amendments, the Minister referred to the way in which the rules would
be developed to deal with who can be a
representative.</div><a name="1001138000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
68 and 69 are to provide some safeguards around what will be in the
court rules to tackle some of the concerns that have been raised by
bodies interested in such proposals. They are also to ensure that one
of the concerns of the Civil Justice Council&#151;that the measure
should not be used to encourage vexatious, spurious or indeed blackmail
claims&#151;is reflected in the detail of the
rules.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div><a name="1001138000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000382"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Just to clarify for the Committee, I should say
that we are taking amendments 68 and 69 together. Amendment 68 becomes
the lead amendment, which has been duly
proposed.</div><a name="1001138000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000383"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> On amendment 69, let me say briefly to the hon.
Member for Fareham that I am not sure who his scriptwriter
is&#151;but I suggest that he gets a new one, in spite of his
reference to the Civil Justice Council. Almost all amendment 69 is
covered either by existing rules of the court, whether in a county
court or in the High Court, or by equity.</div>
<a name="1001138000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
in proposed new subsection (8)(a) in amendment 69, it is pretty obvious
whether a judge would allow representative proceedings if they were not
satisfied with the most appropriate means&#151;of course the judge
would not. The amendment goes on like that, and I urge the hon.
Gentleman to withdraw it because someone has led him up the garden
path.</div><a name="1001138000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000384"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> We are making excellent progress this afternoon,
and I am happy to give the Government&#146;s response to amendments
68 and 69 together. The hon. Member for Fareham spoke mostly about the
latter, but let me first cover the former, which adds to the list of
points that may be covered in civil procedure
rules.</div><a name="1001138000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
rules about disclosure and inspection of documents are in the civil
procedure rules. Disclosure is an ordinary part of any trial process.
The parties will disclose the documents that they have or have had in
their possession in accordance with court directions. Disclosure is
intended to ensure that all relevant evidence can be put before the
court. The question is whether the power to make court rules will be
used to modify the rules on disclosure for the purposes of collective
proceedings. For example, there might be a need to ensure that class
members are deemed to be parties to the action for the purposes of
disclosure.</div>
<a name="1001138000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there
are already sufficient rules in the existing civil procedure rules.
Disclosure orders can be made against third parties, and if more rules
are needed, there is already a power in primary legislation to make
them in this context. The amendment is therefore unnecessary.</div>
<a name="1001138000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 69,
as the hon. Gentleman explained, sets out some detail, practice and
procedure for court rules. It contains a sensible set of options,
including many provisions of the kind that the rule committee of
England and Wales will consider. Indeed, some of them are already
common, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West
pointed out. No doubt the rule-making bodies in Scotland and Northern
Ireland will also work through such safeguards. They will need to
consider carefully how they should be expressed and whether there are
any unintended
consequences.</div><a name="1001138000310"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="1001138000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not take issue with the need for many of the procedures in amendment
69. However, I do not agree with hardening requirements for court rules
in primary legislation in a way that could cut across the careful work
of the rule-making bodies. That is why we have illustrated in clause 24
what the rules can cover without putting that into the Bill. We have
done so for three reasons.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column405" />Column number: 405</div><a name="1001138000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
Parliament has already set out the procedure for making court rules in
the Civil Procedure Acts and appointed a committee of experts, the
civil procedure rule committee of England and Wales, to make the court
rules and lay the legislation before Parliament. A sub-group of the
committee contains eminent specialists in that area of law, including
members of the judiciary, senior practitioners and academics, and they
are well placed to draft appropriate rules. The court rules will have
to work in Scotland and Northern Ireland as well. They must therefore
be drafted in the normal way by the Court of Session in Scotland and
the Rules Committee of the Supreme Court in Northern
Ireland.</div><a name="1001138000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the bodies are considering generic rules for collective proceedings.
The Financial Services Bill should not be used to predetermine the
content of generic rules. That would inevitably lead to two sets of
rules, one applying to financial services and another to all other
proceedings, creating inefficiency and inconsistency, which I do not
think we should support. Although I appreciate the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s hard work and his desire to do the work of the civil
procedure rule committee, they are the best people to decide and
determine those rules.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000385"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> That is exactly the problem. The Government have
introduced a process on a sectoral basis; the Ministry of Justice said
that it would not introduce a generic process. The Minister justified
the process that we are legislating for with a sectoral response, but
the sector does not know the rules by which it will operate. The sector
requires clarity.</div>
<a name="1001138000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that the
Ministry of Justice has rejected a generic application and that this is
the first sector where the rules will be applied, it is reasonable for
people to expect that there will be rules reflecting the concerns of
the sector being used as a guinea pig for the new
process.</div><a name="1001138000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000386"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Again, let me explain what we are trying to
achieve. I take issue with what the hon. Gentleman said. Previously, he
argued in favour of removing some of the Treasury&#146;s powers of
discretion to make regulations. I have been at pains to stress that the
rules that the various bodies are working on, including the civil
procedure rule committee, are generic, but that we are taking a sector
approach to implementation. That is why we needed powers to tailor
rules and ensure that they have regard to specific circumstances: when
we discussed previous clauses, I made it plain that the Treasury needed
those powers.</div>
<a name="1001138000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many cases,
when we are talking about legislation in this House, we are talking
about the balance between what is contained in primary legislation and
what appears in secondary legislation. A lot of legislation is about
providing an overall legislative framework as a structure into which
contents are put. A lot of the detail that sometimes needs to be
changed and updated in the light of circumstances is rightly there in
secondary legislation, because it is a lot easier and more appropriate
to
alter.</div><a name="1001138000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is essentially the situation. We have a high-powered committee that is
looking at and drafting appropriate rules in this area. The civil
procedure rules committee is required by Parliament to consult on the
draft rules, which is the third point that I want to make. Having rules
in the Bill would mean that the consultation that is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column406" />Column number: 406</div>already envisaged and is contained in the Civil Procedure Act 1997
cannot take place. Having said that, I fully recognise that this is a
new procedure, and that there is a need to consult on the rules and to
get them right. There is a particular requirement to ensure that the
rules are not only right generically, but that they are appropriately
tailored to the circumstances of the financial services sector.
Inevitably, the rules will need to be updated in the light of
experience under the procedure set out in the Civil Procedure Act and
in accordance with the various procedures in Scotland and Northern
Ireland. That is why it is right that the rules should not be in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="1001138000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
includes a backstop power to enable the Treasury to set out
supplementary criteria that can be tailored to the financial services.
At the risk of labouring the point, it is important that the Committee
recognises that. The Government intend to consult fully on the
regulations, including discussions with experts on civil procedure, so
that such issues receive the fullest possible debate. I realise that
there is a natural desire to want to know the detail of everything
immediately, but that is not how most legislation works. We have the
right balance between what is in the Bill and what is coming down the
track in terms of further work at a more detailed level, explaining how
things will operate on a more technical
basis.</div>
<a name="1001138000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000387"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> We can debate on the proper process for
consultation, but in most situations one would expect there to have
been wider consultation about a radical measure such as this with the
sector directly concerned, than has been the case to date. Returning to
the generic rules, when the Minister spoke earlier, he did not refer to
the fact that the rules were generic for collective proceedings
matters. The challenge is that the Ministry of Justice has rejected a
generic collective proceedings law, and it will be applied on a sector
basis. From what the Minister said, my assumption was that the rules to
be developed would be specific to the financial services sector, which
would then be tweaked by the reserve powers. That was the impression
that the Minister gave me earlier because he did not use the phrase
&#147;generic rules&#148; but rather talked about rules relating to
the proceedings. He spoke about generic rules during the
discussion on the amendments. Is he saying that the Treasury&#146;s
reserve powers will take the generic rules and tailor them specifically
for the financial services sector? Will those rules under the auspices
of the Ministry of Justice be generic rules that can be applied in any
circumstances where the Government choose to use collective
proceedings?</div>
<a name="1001138000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000388"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> That is exactly what I am saying. I am sorry that
the hon. Gentleman did not appreciate what I said earlier and I
apologise to the Committee if I was not sufficiently clear. The work
that is being done by the civil procedure rules committee centres on
rules that will be generic, and it will consult on them. I kept making
the point that the Treasury has a backstop power to set out
supplementary criteria. That is explicitly because these are generic
rules that will apply to other sectors where collective proceedings
orders might be introduced. We want to make sure that the rules that
relate to the financial services sector are tailored and specific,
which is why we need the powers.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column407" />Column number: 407</div><a name="1001138000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why
amendments 68 and 69 should be resisted. They would distort the
development of more comprehensive rules, and the rules need to be
developed in more detail by those appointed and best placed to do so. I
emphasise that the rules will be subject to the fullest possible
consultation and debate before they are finalised. There will be ample
opportunity for the industry and others to make their views known. It
would also be inappropriate for them to be set in primary legislation,
because that would mean that they could not be updated quickly in the
light of changing experience and circumstances. I therefore
fundamentally believe that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment is
misplaced. However, if this debate has helped clarify matters for the
Committee and for those who follow these proceedings, it has been
helpful.</div><a name="1001138000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000389"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I may be having trouble understanding, but I
believe there is a wider problem regarding the lack of transparency in
relation to the process and how we are going to progress from the Bill
to a workable set of rules. I assume that, where the Bill contains
rules that stem from a requirement to introduce collective proceedings
orders for the financial services sector, they will be specific to the
sector and not generic. The Minister has referred to backstop powers,
which are clearly more important than I previously understood them to
be, given that the rules will be generic rather than specific to the
financial services sector. We should also bear in mind that the
Government actually rejected the process of generic collective
proceedings rules. That adds to our confusion that the committee that
the Minister referred to is developing generic rules when only one
sector is actually implementing the process. It would be useful to know
how widespread the Government expect the use of those powers to
be.</div><a name="1001138000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the consultation process that the Minister outlined and the time scale,
we have not discussed the timetable for the implementation of the
provisions. Will the consultation process on the court rules include
representatives from the financial services sector as well as the
people that the Ministry of Justice generally consults on such things?
Does the Minister expect the consultation on the Treasury regulations
to happen in parallel with that on the court rules or will it happen
subsequent to the introduction of court rules? When does he think the
industry will be in a position to see both the draft rules and draft
regulation?</div><a name="1001138000311"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="1001138000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000390"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Let me have another go and respond to the
specific points made by the hon. Gentleman. I hope that he now realises
why the Government want to resist his amendments and accepts that they
are not appropriate in such
circumstances.</div><a name="1001138000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no intellectual difficulty with saying that, as a Government, we
have decided not to move forward with collective proceedings
generically, across all sectors, but saying that in sectors where we
think there is a case for proceeding there should be some generic
rules, to ensure consistency. That seems sensible, as does saying at
the same time that there might be some sector-specific circumstances to
which courts will need to have regard, so there is a requirement to
build on to the generic rules established. That is what we are
proposing.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 408</div><a name="1001138000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
assure the hon. Gentleman and others that there will be full
consultation on the matter. We want to consult as widely as possible,
including financial stakeholders. Clearly the Treasury consultation
will be informed by the consultation on court rules, so although there
can be some parallel processing it is right to consult on the court
rules first. We would seek to gain the views of the financial services
industry on those rules and take them into account when designing the
Treasury rules as well. I expect the Treasury rules to follow on from
the consultation on the court
rules.</div><a name="1001138000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention is to consult on the court rules later this year, with a view
to seeing implementation in 2011&#151;that is my understanding of the
time scale at the moment&#151;but I stress that there will be ample
opportunity for interested parties to contribute to the consultation
exercise. We want to make sure that we get this right and recognise
that it is a new departure and, therefore, it is right that we spend a
significant amount of time talking to stakeholders and other interested
parties to make sure that their views are properly taken into account
when it comes to developing the new
provisions.</div><a name="1001138000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000391"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation,
and of the process in particular, which will reassure people that the
proper time will be given to consider the proposals. Given that the
court rules are generic to the process, rather than specific to the
financial services sector, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="1001138000244"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000392"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I want a quick run around the block with the
Minister on counter-claims&#151;the concept is slightly strange, but
I can understand how it might happen&#151;and, more specifically, on
the costs of counter-claims. I am referring here to paragraphs (i), (j)
and (f) of subsection
(2).</div><a name="1001138000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue involves the opt-out procedure. If someone fails to opt out, they
are party to the action and are a claimant. If the defendant
successfully counter-claims, there will be a costs order in the usual
manner against the claimants. We now have someone who never went near
the action but who did not read the blurb and did not opt out, so they
are part of the claim; there is a successful counter-claim against them
and, lo and behold, someone comes knocking on their door asking for
costs. Could the Minister elucidate that a little because, were that to
be the case, it would not go down well with our constituents? In spite
of the considerable detail in clause 24, that is not covered as far as
I can tell.</div>
<a name="1001138000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The obverse of
that is that under 24(2)(f) there can be a representative counter-claim
on an opt-out basis. There is a representative counter-claim on an
opt-out basis against a bunch of claimants. The counter-claim fails, so
the claimants who have successfully resisted that counter-claim in the
normal course of events, seek their costs against those who made the
counter-claim. Those who made the counter-claim included those people
who failed to opt-out because it is not now a counter-claim, and
therefore are part of that unsuccessful counter-claim. Because of
counter-claims, they could end up with a costs bill for a case they
never went near. Will the Minister at some point address the issues
raised by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column409" />Column number: 409</div>those examples? Perhaps not today, because these are complex issues and
that is the difficulty with putting complex issues in the Bill. I am
concerned about people who did not opt-out potentially ending up with a
cost bill against them, especially in a counter-claim
situation.</div><a name="1001138000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000393"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> If I understand my hon. Friend correctly, I would
be likely to have similar concerns. My understanding is that the normal
rules on costs will apply, as they do in proceedings. He cited clause
24(2)(i). As he will be aware, that is one of an illustrative list of
issues that will be considered when determining the rules&#151;the
point that I was making to the hon. Member for Fareham. Again, as I
said earlier, there will be a full consultation on the rules, so there
will be ample opportunity to take account of the views of my hon.
Friend and of others concerned about these particular issues. In
passing clause 24 today, we are not committing to anything other than
providing an illustrative list, which will be considered as part of
regulations that will be drawn up, debated and discussed in the normal
way. I hope that provides him with assurances that his views can be
taken into
consideration.</div><a name="1001138000250"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1001138000394"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tom Watson</b> (West Bromwich, East) (Lab): Does my hon.
Friend agree that my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West is an utter genius and may have spotted a flaw in the Bill?
In that unlikely scenario, would the Minister commit to get his
officials to look at it and perhaps come back on Report to make sure
that his fears can be

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001138000395"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am happy to acknowledge the contribution that
my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West makes to the
Committee and to the House in general. He is widely recognised as an
expert on many matters. His views are always of great interest.
Ministers and officials always take what he says with the utmost
seriousness. On this particular point, the comments I have made that
these matters will be considered in the future as part of the process
of determining the rules, should provide him with assurances that his
expert views will be taken into consideration by some very eminent
people, whom we have put in charge of drawing up the rules. I hope that
provides sufficient assurances.</div>

may by order amend subsection (2)(b) so that, in Scotland, the

propose the amendment at the request of the Scottish Government. The
amendment will give the Treasury a power to enable collective
proceedings to take place in Scotland before the sheriff court. At
present, the clause provides for collective proceedings to be heard in
the Court of Session only. The reason is that the Scottish Government
are currently considering recommendations about class actions generally
in a report by the Scottish civil courts. Decisions about the
applicability of class actions in Scotland have not yet been taken and
there is a question of whether they should be combined to the Court of
Session only. The power will enable class actions to be extended to the
sheriff court if the Scottish Government find it appropriate to do so
in
future.</div><a name="1001138000256"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment
