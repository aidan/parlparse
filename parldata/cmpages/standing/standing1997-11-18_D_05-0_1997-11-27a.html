<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 24, in page 5, line 27, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) The appointment of all the members of the Committee shall be subject to confirmation by the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton):</B> I was saying this morning that the staffing of the Monetary Policy Committee is crucial. The members of that committee will determine the monetary policy of the country. The choice of members of the committee is critical, especially if hon. Members accept, as I do, that the translation into monetary policy of the inflation target, set by democratically elected Ministers, is not simply a technical matter. It requires subjective economic viewpoints. The members chosen to represent such viewpoints on the Monetary Policy Committee will determine the monetary policy of the country.
<P>
Tim Congdon's booklet, produced by the Centre for Policy Studies, states on page 39 that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Governor of the Bank of England would become a major public figure, as important in some ways as the Chancellor of the Exchequer.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The same applies to members of the Monetary Policy Committee; they will become--indeed there is evidence that they are already becoming--personalities, political figures in their own right. Their thoughts and views will determine the public policy of the country, and that is a critical matter.
<P>
Will the Paymaster General tell the Committee how the Chancellor will pick members of the Monetary Policy Committee? Will he try to establish a balance of economic views between broad monetarists, narrow monetarists, Keynesians, or those who believe in returning Britain to the gold standard? Will the Chancellor actively seek that balance, or will he choose members who are eminent in their particular fields, but whose opinions will be a random matter, so that economic policy will be a lottery? These days the lottery seems to be part of the Government's economic policy. I hope that the Paymaster General will address these points in his concluding remarks.
<P>
The Paymaster General has said that the Government want to have a transparent and open policy; therefore, hon. Members should know the criteria for selecting members of the Monetary Policy Committee. If we cannot scrutinise the criteria for assessing the economic views of potential members of the Committee, or if the Paymaster General will not tell us what they are, it is important that we should scrutinise the individuals.
<P>
For those reasons, I support the amendment's proposal that nominations for the committee should be scrutinised by the Treasury Select Committee. That is not just my opinion, nor that of Conservative Members, nor even that of Liberal Democrat Members: it is shared by eminent and rising stars on the Labour Benches. The hon. Member for Bolton, West (Ms Kelly), for example, said on Second Reading:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is for those reasons that I argue that although I support the Bill and support the granting of independence to the Bank, the hand of Parliament should be strengthened so that a Select Committee can properly carry out its responsibilities and hold the Bank to account.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): Is not the hon. Member for Bolton, West a distinguished former employee of the Bank?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Indeed; my hon. Friend is right to point that out. In view of the hon. Lady's expertise, I am surprised that she is not a member of the Standing Committee. Given the remarks that I have quoted from Hansard, however, I can see why the Government would not want her on the Committee. She continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In particular, I suggest, as the Treasury Select Committee has suggested in its recent report, that members of the Monetary Policy Committee have the opportunity to come before the Select Committee in confirmatory hearings after their nomination to the Monetary Policy Committee by the Chancellor.''--[Official Report, 11 November 1997; Vol. 300, c. 772.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley (Bury St. Edmunds):</B> My hon. Friend has missed out another rising star--the hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke), who also, as a member of the Treasury Committee, made similar points on Second Reading and elsewhere. Are not both stars' views in direct conflict with the views of the Minister present today?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. A third--perhaps risen--star is the hon. Member for Durham, North (Mr. Radice), who is Chairman of the Treasury Committee. He said on Second Reading:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We have also said in our report on accountability that there should be confirmatory hearings. We believe that such hearings would be good for the independence of the Monetary Policy Committee and strengthen the relationship between the Bank and Parliament.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So at least three Labour Members believe in a measure. The Paymaster General should therefore take notice of the opinions of his right hon. and hon. Friends.
<P>
The Treasury Committee concluded, in paragraph 47:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In our view the independence of the appointment process would be enhanced by the Treasury Committee being given power under the new Bank of England Act to confirm the nominations of the Governor, Deputy Governors and all other members of the Monetary Policy Committee . . . We therefore recommend that the Bank of England Act should make provision for the confirmation of nominations to the post of Governor, deputy Governor or nominated member of the MPC unless the Treasury Committee, within 30 calender days of the nomination being made, makes a report to the House of Commons stating its reasons for considering that the candidate does not meet the criteria of competence and personal independence and recommending that the appointment be not confirmed.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There it is in black and white.
<P>
The Treasury Committee is to be Parliament's only way of holding the new Bank accountable. A Memorandum dated 13 September, prepared by the Treasury, stated that the Bank will be accountable to the House of Commons--through regular reports and evidence to the Treasury Committee. Is it not ironic that the Government believe that the Treasury Committee is the only tool by which the Bank will become accountable, although that Committee believes that it can make the Bank of England accountable only if it has power to review nominations to the MPC? In effect, the Government are in a catch-22 position.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith </B>(Redditch): Does the hon. Gentleman think that other Select Committees might like to hold senior officials to account in a similar way? If so, how does he propose that that should come about?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Lady has raised an important point. The evolution of Select Committees has been a gradual process. When the next steps agencies was introduced, it was clear that Select Committees would play a part.
<P>
Making the Bank of England independent is the greatest change--the biggest next steps agency of them all. In terms of its control over people's everyday lives, the Bank will have enormous independence and a lack of accountability. This is, so far as I am aware, the biggest example in history of power being taken from the House and given to an outside body. If changes to the Select Committee process are needed, this seems the ideal place to begin. I do not think that we should have the Bill because the Bank of England should not be given independence. Given that it has been given independence, we have to provide for the gradual evolution of the Select Committee process, otherwise the Bank of England will be non-accountable in the future. I should like to hear what the Paymaster General has to say about accountability, and how he intends to solve that catch-22 problem.
<P>
What are the criteria for determining the economic views of those whom the Government will appoint to the Monetary Policy Committee?
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General </B>(Mr. Geoffrey Robinson): I shall reply directly to the questions of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb). The amendments are related to those that we discussed this morning. You were not with us then, Mr. McWilliam, and I shall not try your patience by explaining previous amendments.
<P>
On the question of accountability and the Select Committee, I gave an undertaking to consider seriously the point that the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) made.
<P>
The Opposition appear to want to legislate for confirmatory hearing rights. That is inappropriate at present. The issue should be discussed by the whole House. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) suggested in one or two remarks that there was something wrong in Members of Parliament behaving independently and not always reflecting their party's views. But that is the purpose of a Select Committee. The hon. Gentleman's points do not constitute an argument against the Government's position. It is natural for members of a Select Committee to try to gain more power for their Committee. That is a healthy sign of our evolving parliamentary system. However, the subject of the amendment is a matter for the whole House, not only the Committee. If the Opposition press the amendment, we shall resist it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was seeking help. He wants to ensure that the good balance that currently exists in the Monetary Policy Committee is maintained. He is anxious to exclude serendipity and random choice from our selection process. I assure him that such elements will play no part in it.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked me to list a set of criteria for prospective members of the Monetary Policy Committee. We cannot do better than the qualities for which current members have been chosen. However, the two most important qualifications are outstanding intelligence, for which there is no substitute, and a demonstrable economic knowledge. Those are the essential criteria, but all sorts of other matters must be considered. However, it would be inappropriate to delay our proceedings with them.
<P>
I would like to pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, West whom the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton also mentioned. She is a distinguished economist, who worked for the Bank of England. She might be a candidate, not in the near future, but in the longer term, for which all our policies are geared. I also pay tribute to my distinguished hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North. There is no greater protagonist of the Select Committee system. My hon. Friend's views are well known.
<P>
It is not appropriate for the Committee to decide how we should proceed. The House is reviewing the Select Committees. As my hon. Friend the Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith) said earlier, the House's decision will be translated to each organisation for which it might be thought appropriate to have a confirmatory arrangement made for the respective Select Committee. Until that decision is taken--and in light of the arguments made here--I urge my hon. Friends to vote against the amendment.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Dr. Davey.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): My title is Mr. Davey, Mr. McWilliam. However, I was accused of giving tutorials earlier in our proceedings, so perhaps Committee members wanted to attribute that title to me.
<P>
I apologise to the Committee for my enforced absence earlier. I have consulted my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) and he has informed me about the debates that were held in my absence. I now wish to make some brief remarks.
<P>
I was pleased by the Paymaster General's statement that the Government are open minded on this issue, that they hope to bring proposals to the House about the viability of ratification and confirmatory hearings for all types of public appointments and that they regard such hearings as an evolution of the Select Committee system. That development would be most welcome and we look forward to such measures being debated in the House.
<P>
I stress that the Government do not have to wait until those measures come before the House. They could accept the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham and I, and by Conservative Members. The amendments would increase the Bank's accountability and reinforce the appearance of independence, which is so important.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): We shall press our amendment to a vote, if only because the Paymaster General so conspicuously failed to deal with the points that we made. It cannot be reasserted too strongly that the success of contracting out interest rate changes to the Bank of England depends on credibility. However, the Paymaster General did not acknowledge that point, even though it is surely true.
<P>
Credibility depends on the independence of the Monetary Policy Committee's members not just being a fact, but being seen to be a fact. Therefore, they should be free from the taint that they are creatures of the Executive. The Bill will put awesome powers of patronage in the hands of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In recent weeks, we have seen that the Government are vulnerable to outside pressures. The formula one fiasco is a case in point. To remove the suspicion that the appointees will be on the Monetary Policy Committee because of favours rendered in the past or expected in the future, it is important that their independence is transparent. We recommended that we follow the practice of other independent central banks--I described what happens in other parts of the world--which routinely subject appointments and nominations to a ratification process after hearings. That is the case with the more independent central banks in Germany and the United States. However, the Paymaster General failed to deal with that argument.
<P>
We shall doubtless return to this issue later in the Bill, but, in the light of the Paymaster General's response, we shall press our amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Because our amendment is similar to that tabled by the hon. Member for Daventry and the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Schedule 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Monetary Policy CommitteeTerms of office of appointed members</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 21, line 32, leave out `3' and insert `6'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we shall take amendment No. 25, in page 21, line 32, leave out `3' and insert `5'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The amendment would increase the period of office during which members of the Monetary Policy Committee could serve. It is one of a number of measures tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham and I to attempt to beef up the Bank's independence. That must affect the way in which it is perceived as well as how it operates. It is crucial that appointees are seen to be their own agents, not agents of the Government. If they were to be seen as agents of the Government, it would seriously undermine the independence and credibility of the Bank.
<P>
There must be no suggestion of pressure being put upon appointees to vote in favour of the Government's view. The term of office should last longer than the life of a Parliament, ensuring that reappointment will not be for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to decide.
<P>
I have no wish to impugn the professionalism of current members of the Monetary Policy Committee or indeed of its future members. I am sure that they will approach their jobs with a great deal of professionalism and would be horrified at the suggestion that they would be anything other than independent in their conduct of affairs. However, I stress that the appearance of independence is crucial, ensuring that the outside world will believe in their complete independence. If the period of office is only for three years, there may be question marks about that.
<P>
Appearances are crucial. The raison d'etre of an independent bank is to affect people's inflationary expectations. There must be credibility in the Bank's capacity to take decisions in a depoliticised manner in the interests of the long-term health of the economy. Anything undermining that sense of independence will undermine the whole point of the Bill.
<P>
As mentioned in debates on the Select Committee's ratification hearings, experience elsewhere suggests that other countries have opted for longer time periods in setting up arrangements for independent banks--as much as 14 years in the United States, although I stand to be corrected on that, and eight years with the Bundesbank. Elsewhere, then, a term of office longer than the electoral cycle has been adopted.
<P>
We can examine the degree of independence by drawing parallels with other types of institutions. For example, members of the supreme court in the USA have life tenure. Although they are political appointees--appointed by the President, subject to ratification hearings in Congress--their independence has always been viewed as essential to establish the legitimacy of supreme court decisions.
<P>
One example is the former chief justice, Earl Warren. When he was appointed by President Eisenhower it was thought that as he came from Republican stock he would do the President's bidding. President Eisenhower expected his new chief justice to put forward his types of social policy but is on record as being very disappointed by the reality. Chief Justice Warren was a very liberal chief justice of the US supreme court. It was because he had independence and life tenure and was not going to be reappointed by the same politician that he was able to take a different view. That underpinned and strengthened the decisions of the court under his leadership.
<P>
Terms of office and the period of those terms are very important and it is vital that they do not stay within the period of an election but span that period. If the Government accept the amendment, it would, like all the amendments we have tabled, strengthen the policies that they are trying to pursue. It is yet another example of the Liberal Democrats trying to be very constructive in our work on this Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> May I say at the outset that I am broadly sympathetic to the arguments deployed by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey). Before those Labour Members who take a delight in the minutiae of our amendments decide to make their contribution, I confirm, first, that these are probing amendments, although we may wish to press them to a division if we do not get a satisfactory response; secondly, that there is no magic in the figures of six in the case of the hon. Gentleman or five in ours, although I shall return to that in a moment; and, thirdly, that we understand that there is no precise science in how to determine the length of policy terms for these matters.
<P>
I am conscious also of our earlier debate when the Economic Secretary responded in a similar fashion to a similar amendment about the appointment of members of the court of the Bank. She said that there was a concern to harmonise the Nolan standards and not to have a prolonged turnover. I am glossing on the substance of her remarks, but she argued that there should not be some kind of facility for placemen; people should not be put in indefinately. I am sensitive to some of those concerns, but I am bound to say that the hon. Gentleman's argument is stronger.
<P>
It is important that the MPC is not only independent--we do not seek to impugn its professionalism or independence--but is seen to be independent. No one should feel that they can plausibly argue that it is being set up with a lot of party hacks to do the Chancellor's bidding. We all know that Ministers in successive Governments--though in this case I am tempted to say excessive--appoint special advisers. Indeed, I was one myself a few years ago, as was my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds. We had a specific remit which was to represent the Chancellor's, or, in my case, another Minister's, views politically. I hope that that was discharged with a degree of dispassion although I am not sure that it always has been.
<P>
That, however, is a different type of appointment. This is meant to be freestanding, just as in a different context civil servants' sole role is to give free, independent and fearless advice to Ministers, irrespective of their politics. We want to ensure that that happens.

<P>

<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> We have heard many arguments from Opposition Members about the importance of the high calibre of members of the MPC. Is the hon. Gentleman worried that lengthening the period of time that they are expected to serve, although it is possible for them to serve more than one three-year term, might dissuade some of the highest calibre candidates from committing themselves for such a long time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Lady will have heard me say that I do not regard the subject as an exact science. I thought that she was about to make a different point--so perhaps I can make it for her.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It might be suggested that committee members who were good at the time of their appointment might, after six years, if they had not kept up their economic reading, have passed their sell-by date. One could imagine an economist, prominent in the early 1930s, before the publication of the general theory, who for some reason--perhaps being too busy on the Monetary Policy Committee--did not get round to reading it. He might then have been regarded as somewhat out of date. Even one or two members of the governing party have, perish the thought, not quite fully assimilated the messages of new Labour and are occasionally given to putting forward obsolete doctrine, However, I am sure that you, Mr. McWilliam, do not want me to pursue my response to the hon. Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith) further.
<P>
Clearly, there is a balance to be found. Hon. Members from both sides of the Committee are interested in ensuring as much operational independence as possible in the framework that the Government have set. I do not think that the independence of the people concerned is a matter of dispute; they will give free and fair advice. I understand the Nolan-type arguments for a short period of office. However, because of our failure to persuade the Government, or the Committee, of the merits of our two other arguments, I consider it even more important to set a slightly extended period of appointment.
<P>
The Paymaster General generously undertook today to reflect on the possibility of open competition. I am sure that he will honour that. However, we have just failed to persuade him about the filter of the Treasury Committee. The amendment provides for another type of filter, which would ensure that whoever was appointed by a Chancellor would continue in office after the end of that Parliament. The difference between six and five comes down to our wanting our extremely modest changes to result in the lowest possible period allowing for a bit of what might be called negative injury time at either end of a Parliament. In practice the intention and effect are just the same as under the alternative suggestion. Both are designed to ensure that the Chancellor cannot simply rig the course for the period of a Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony D. Wright </B>(Great Yarmouth): What the hon. Gentleman has outlined would be fine if we had fixed-term Parliaments. However, under the amendment surely at some time the periods specified would expire when there was a general election in the offing. Previous Governemts have certainly pursued what has been expedient for them at the time and that could happen in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, although I am not quite sure that I have got his point. If he is worried that appointments will be softened in some way because the Government are approaching an election, that would be an argument for some kind of independent endorsement. If the hon. Gentleman's argument is that Governments might be tempted to rush appointments through immediately before an election, perhaps on the assumption that they would no longer be in government afterwards, some very tight rules that we examined this morning in a different context relate to that. I would not see that as a serious danger.
<P>
To return to the substance of the point, we are all bent on the objective of trying to give the greatest independence and credibility to the Monetary Policy Committee. There are different ways to do that, but the Opposition fear that if we were to proceed without further safeguards, it would be possible for a Chancellor to make short-term appointments--with the threat of removal during the Government's term of office--and the members would be more tempted to bend to his opinion in a given matter. If a Chancellor had to make single appointment, that might not matter. In a moment, I shall discuss briefly the staggering of appointments which is mentioned after that part of the subsection to which the amendment refers. If appointments were for a three-year period and a Chancellor wanted to clear out people whom he regarded as representative of the ancien regime, he could effectively change the constitution of the Monetary Policy Committee. We should bear in mind that the governorships are within his approval and will no doubt come up for reappointment. In a short time, he could have a total clear out of the committee and completely change its character and nature. We are anxious that there should be a safeguard against that because of the business of getting the best possible people, who might be prepared to accept appointment for a shorter period of the hon. Lady's concerns needed to be reflected in their appointment. On the other hand, we want new people on the committee and a reasonable exchange of views, but not some dramatic or destabilising discontinuity in the system. For that reason, I have great sympathy with the points made by Liberal Democrat Members and I am inclined to support the amendment.
<P>
I would like the Paymaster General to comment on one further matter to which I have just adverted. He spoke about the initial arrangements for some appointments to be staggered. In my former capacity as a Minister, I was familiar with that practice and I am not against it, which is why I did not table an amendment to that effect. However, it would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman could remind the Committee of the situation for present appointments. Will he also say what the future pattern will be, with the objective, as I said earlier, of securing reasonable continuity rather than a series of sudden changes in the arrangements?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): In the context of fast-moving monetary conditions, not least in Europe and the global marketplace, does the hon. Gentleman think that extending the length of tenure for an individual member might risk inbuilt obsolescence, making it a Jurassic committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I thought that I had acknowledged that theoretical possibility. We all know that it is a matter of striking a balance. The emphasis on the Opposition Benches is on the continuity, independence and credibility of the Committee. On the other hand, I can understand Ministers having lots of work to do and wanting to speed up the process--not necessarily in a malign sense--and good luck to them. But they need to convince the committee that there will be genuine independence, that they have that objective and that they are prepared to secure the arrangements necessary to achieve that aim.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Like my hon. Friends, I endorse the comments made by the Paymaster General on full-time members of the Monetary Policy Committee. That is a welcome and sensible change and the Government should be applauded for making it. However, I seek the hon. Gentleman's enlightenment of a specific matter: the Bank of England Act 1946 specifically states that the tenure for the Governor and the then single deputy Governor should be for a period of five years. The Bill will create a second deputy Governor who will also be appointed for five years. In 1946, it was thought that five years was the appropriate tenure--
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Under a Labour Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Under a Labour Government. That view has been endorsed this year by the statement that the second deputy Governor should have a five-year term and we are entitled to ask why.
<P>
The history of the matter--I should like to know the views of the Paymaster General--shows that five-year security of tenure was thought to be necessary to protect the Governor and the deputy Governor from political pressure and for the avoidance of their being seen as tied to one Administration. That logic must hold true today. It is illogical for two deputy Governors and a Governor to sit on the MPC for five years when other members will sit for fewer. That inconsistency troubles Conservative Members. The Paymaster General must address the argument that a five-year tenure was optimal for the prevention of the perception that political pressure was being applied.
<P>
My argument was endorsed by the Roll committee in 1993. Its evidence in the Treasury Select Committee report states that if Bank officials were to be independent, their tenure should be longer than the typical life of a Government. Conservative Members hope for a change of Government in the not too distant future. It would be unfortunate if members of the MPC were tied to a particular Government. Security of tenure should stretch across Governments. The Paymaster General should answer that point head on.
<P>
I endorse the comments of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, who rightly pointed out that in almost all other developed countries with independent central banks the tenures for equivalents of the MPC are extensive. In the USA, members of the Federal Reserve board of governors have 14-year tenures, members of the German Central Bank Council have eight-year terms and members of the French Monetary Policy Council have nine-year tenures. Those developed central banks see a need for extensive tenures, so it is rather odd that this country has gone to the other extreme with a three-year tenure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> In that case, why are not the Opposition suggesting 14 years, given that the hon. Gentleman's logic is that what is done abroad is necessarily right and should be done here? Why do not we simply import a tenure of 14 years?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to have missed the point. There is no optimal standard term--different countries have different tenures. We chose five years for a simple reason: it is on all fours with the term for the deputy Governors and the Governor, who are also members of the MPC. There is consistency and logic in our proposal.
<P>
I endorse the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry on schedule 3, paragraph 1. We have not tabled amendments to that, but I would welcome the Paymaster General's comment on his understanding of the word ``initially'' where the schedule says that initially there will be staggered appointments. What periods shorter than three years do the Government envisage using? What will be the exact configuration of the staggering of those appointments?
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Finally, I can find in the Bill no specific provision for reappointments. If a member of the MPC were spectacularly successful--it currently has many distinguished members--what would be the Government's position on reappointment? I presume that if there is no provision in the Bill, the Chancellor will have the option to reappoint members of the MPC who have done a particularly good job and whom he and the Prime Minister consider worthy of reappointment. I ask that question in the spirit of honest inquiry and I look forward to hearing the Minister's replies. I support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> The first point that emerges from the contributions of Opposition Members is an obsession with the electoral cycle. I can well understand the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton being so obsessed. We know of the machinations of the previous Government during their 18 years in office. The hon. Gentleman must realise that the policies that we are putting in place and the economic arrangements that we are making are all geared towards long-termism. If we were concerned about the electoral cycle, why, within 48 hours of taking office, would we have dreamed of granting the Governor operational independence? That would not have made sense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The Paymaster General misunderstands the intention behind my amendment. I accept that the Government's policy will be consistent and designed to bear down on inflation, but the importance of the amendment is that it would ensure that a future Government, perhaps of a different persuasion or with a different Chancellor, would not follow the policy that is so sensibly followed by this Chancellor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Whatever the hon. Gentleman might think in his higher flights of fancy, I do not think that there will be a change of Government in the near future or beyond, so I do not confront that prospect with any sense of immediacy. There is nothing to stop any Government doing whatever they want, although Parliament is sovereign. We put forward these measures because we believe them to be correct.
<P>
The credibility of the new arrangement is dependent not on whether the appointment is for three years or five years, but on how well it performs. The visible independence of those who have already been appointed has been most reassuring to the City, industry and the country. It shows that we mean what we say and that this is not a charade.
<P>
This is not an exact science and I would not say that other periods were not considered. We are right initially to choose a shorter rather than a longer period. No one would consider a period of less than three years--that is at the lower end of the range of acceptable appointment periods. At the beginning, in particular if one got it wrong, it would work itself out much more quickly because one was not tied into seven or 14 years, which would be inconceivable.
<P>
As one of my colleagues said in answer to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, of course there could be a re-appointment, and I am sure that one would hope to see that happening. My Right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary said in his evidence to the Select Committee that he had considered three, six, nine or maybe 12 years. There is no suggestion that it is a case of ``three years and you're out''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> There is no disqualification then, but I wanted to know whether there would be an active policy to re-appoint on more than one occasion. Do Ministers envisage re-appointing a member of the Monetary Policy Committee for three, four or five consecutive terms?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Just to come back constitutionally, it is not a case of my being out after three years, because I am not standing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am grateful for that, Mr. McWilliam. I was merely using a figure of speech, not addressing the Chair. I am sure that you will be here for many more than three years, subject to the good wishes of your electorate.
<P>
We are not looking at the matter in those terms and it is not sensible to talk about four, five or 15 years. While we intend that the post should be as full time as possible--as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, the individuals concerned can be full time--they are not all full time at the moment and, as Opposition Members will know, appointments are being made on a temporary, ad hoc basis until the legislation goes through. Perhaps then I will consider how we will phase it. It is a valid point--it would be unfortunate if all the appointments ended in a single year--but I would ask members of the Committee to wait for us to introduce proposals. Obviously, those proposals will affect the intentions of the individuals involved in the appointments. The exact timing and arrangements would be a matter for negotiation with them. Naturally, however, one wants to avoid a cliff-edge situation, and I am sure that we can draw up arrangements to achieve that.
<P>
Equally, it is fair to point out that the original appointments of the Governor and deputy Governors were for five years. We cannot, however, extend that and say that that conferred on them security of tenure. It was a contractual arrangement, which is in itself legal, but it was not linked with security of tenure. It was merely a suitable period.
<P>
There is a difference between members of the Monetary Policy Committee, some of whom may be part time--although we are naturally encouraging the maximum possible participation--and those who are charged with a whole job besides that. In the Governor's case, the job is the overall running of the Bank, and of the two deputy Governors, one is in charge of monetary policy and the other is effectively in charge of the Bank's organisation. As hon. Members will know, we were successful in recruiting the banker David Clementi. His appointment--as non-political as one can get--was widely welcomed in the City. It was one of the changes that we are pushing through, which will help to make the Bank a much more modern institution than it has been.
<P>
Although I cannot say that three years is absolutely right and five years is not, for the reasons that I have given it would not be appropriate for the Committee to divide on the matter. We intend to settle the phasing when the appointments are settled, after the legislation is enacted. If, however, Opposition Members feel so inclined, we will resist any change to the number of years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I am slightly disappointed by the Paymaster General's reply. He may have confidence in the future of his Government, but not everyone shares that. There may well be a new Government in the foreseeable future--I have in mind a Liberal Democrat Government, of course--but while a Liberal Democrat Government would certainly pursue a policy as anti-inflation as the current Government's, should the next Government not be Liberal Democrat or Labour we want to ensure that, at least in statute, the new Bank has as much independence as possible.
<P>
The Paymaster General was teasing the Committee at one stage. He said that other periods had been considered, without saying exactly what they were. He did not present the internal arguments that the Government had when they debated those periods or say why they decided to choose three years. He presented no strong arguments to back that choice and I therefore want to divide the Committee on the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I advise my hon. Friends to support the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton in the light of the Paymaster General's response. There is no precise science, but I noted in particular the Minister's suggestion that the term selected was at the lower end, if not the lowest end, of the acceptability range for appointments. There are relatively few things that I would want to take on for less than three years, except possibly membership of this Standing Committee, but we shall leave that aside for now.
<P>
I want to turn the Minister's words back to him. He made some play of the fact that this was the initial stage of the Committee and that he did not want to commit himself. Surprisingly, he added almost as an afterthought, that it might later be possible to appoint people for longer. I am sure that the Minister is aware of this, but, within the terms of the Bill, he could not appoint someone definitely for more than three years. I think that he meant that there could be reappointments, which Conservative Members would welcome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The important point is to establish credibility from the start. There is a case for a term of longer than five years even if only for the initial period. Once credibility has been established, the term will not matter so much because independence will have become part of the culture. One could then have a shorter period without feeling--and without having such a debate every time--that an attempt was being made to subvert the committee's independence. I therefore invite my hon. Friends to join the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton in supporting the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 26, in page 21, line 43, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, except that in any case where the inflation performance of the economy falls outside the specified targets under section 12 for a given period, the Chancellor of the Exchequer may make such modifications as he thinks fit to the remuneration of members of the Committee.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have to admit at the outset that the amendment is less attractive than some that we have tabled. Nevertheless, it requires--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. Gentleman is entitled to be heard in silence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Nevertheless, the amendment merits consideration. We are faced with a fait accompli at this point in the Bill. Unless we can reverse the measures before us on Report, the powerful Monetary Policy Committee will be composed of political appointees who will report to a court of directors that will also be full of appointees chosen by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. We therefore have the spectacle of one quango reporting to another. That disturbs not only Opposition Members, but the Treasury Select Committee. We continue to refer to its report because it was all-party. The Committee has a Labour Chairman and a Labour party majority, so we are dismayed that the Government continue to reject its argument and to dismiss its attitude.
<P>
Opposition Members must therefore advance the arguments in the report. Although the report was unanimous and signed by all the Labour Members who sat on the Committee, none of the arguments that it contained is represented in this Standing Committee. I am saddened that the spirit of inquiry and independence that new Members should retain at least for a year or two seems to have deserted all the new Labour Members appointed to this Committee. Clearly, any new Members with any independence of thought about these matters have been kept out of this Committee.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is therefore up to Opposition Members to advance another argument and take a different tack in relation to the accountability of the Monetary Policy Committee. Amendment No. 26 would sharpen the incentives of that Committee and its members, and would discourage too cosy a relationship between the Chancellor and the people whom he has appointed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve McCabe </B>(Birmingham, Hall Green): At the risk of displaying a glimmer of independent thought--
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Go for it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> I wish to ask the hon. Gentleman a simple question. We spent the earlier part of the afternoon debating independence and whether the appointments would be political. The amendment advocates performance-related pay, which most people would concede might be a reasonably good idea, but why would it give that power to the Chancellor? Surely that is the exact opposite of what Opposition Members have argued all afternoon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Gentleman has spotted the apparent paradox--there is one buried in the middle of all good amendments. I promise to return to that question at the end of my brief remarks.
<P>
First, I wish to describe why a measure of performance pay may be appropriate for members of that committee. There is a precedent for it. The history of public service in this country--especially of tax collecting--shows that it was often part of the terms of appointment that public servants were granted a measure of performance pay.
<P>
That was true of former Paymaster Generals--I know that because I used to hold that office. Paymaster Generals often left the job rather better off than they began it because a measure of performance pay was granted to them--they were allowed to keep a small part of the money that they raised and distributed, or they lived off the interest of any money that they retained temporarily.
<P>
Unfortunately, all that was stopped in the early part of the 19th century. In any case, I doubt that it would have survived Lord Nolan's committee. But the concept of performance pay and of its opposite, the penalisation of public servants who do not meet their targets in full, is of some antiquity, and it has been adopted in New Zealand.
<P>
The Bill does not set up an independent Bank of England. As has been observed many times, it sets up a contractual arrangement between the Treasury and the Bank, very much along the lines of the arrangement obtaining in New Zealand. There, the governor of the national bank is vulnerable to salary cuts, which are made if he does not meet his inflation target.
<P>
The amendment envisages a similar arrangement applying to members of the Monetary Policy Committee, which brings me to the point made by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green. The amendment would give the Chancellor of the Exchequer power to vary remuneration. The Opposition have suggested that because it is not appropriate to lay down a complex and variable formula in primary legislation. If the amendment were agreed, the Chancellor would publish a pay or penalty formula. Everybody would clearly understand that their remuneration would vary according to whether the inflation targets were met.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As the co-author of the amendment, does my right hon. Friend agree that if the Chancellor was in the driving seat for altering remuneration, he would be accountable to the House for his decisions?
<P>
<B>Mr Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I agree. I correct my hon. Friend on only one point--he is the amendment's sole author. By some oversight, it is me who is speaking to it.
<P>
Will the Paymaster General at least consider the concept of applying performance-related pay?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I support the amendment. I do so especially because throughout consideration of the Bill, I have been anxious about what will happen if the newly independent Bank of England fails to achieve the inflation target. No real penalty is inflicted on anybody at the Bank for failure. No incentive exists to achieve the target. A penalty has been set out in a number of letters from the Chancellor to the Bank and to others. The penalty is that the Governor of the Bank of England should write an open letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, stating his reasons for failing to achieve 1 per cent. deviation from the 2.5 per cent. target. If inflation is outside the parameters three months later, a subsequent letter will be written. So what? The letter would be written, published and debated, but the people responsible for not delivering the inflation target would carry on in their jobs. The Bill has no provisions to get rid of people in the Bank who have failed.
<P>
It is the Government's belief, but not mine, that translating an inflationary target into monetary policy is purely technical. If the Government fail to achieve their inflationary target, it would be due to a lack of technical ability, according to their own arguments. Why does the Bill have no provision for getting rid of people who are not technically up to their jobs, if that has been proved by their failure to achieve the inflation target?
<H4><center>[Mr. Jim Murphy in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I welcome you, Mr. Murphy, to the Chair. Will my hon. Friend develop his arguments along the lines that I shall set out? There are very few sanctions. Lord Kingsdown suggested to the Treasury Select Committee that an adequate sanction was a grilling from that Committee. That sanction is not worthy of the name. The amendment would put teeth into ensuring adequate performance, and into ensuring that the people involved deliver on their obligations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend is right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will my hon. Friend bear in mind that such sanctions could sharpen exchanges about the definition of economic policy and price stability between the Chancellor and the Monetary Policy Committee? Clearly, if those involved have to do a technical job and their salary is on the line, will it not be important for them to have a clear set of instructions to follow?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am sure that if the amendment is accepted, they will be very vigilant in ensuring that they receive explicit guidelines on the Government's economic policy, because their wealth and their ability to carry on will depend on it.
<P>
I searched through schedule 3--particularly the part headed ``Removal of appointed members''--for any way in which members of the Monetary Policy Committee could be got rid of if they were not delivering the inflation target. Paragraph 9(1)(c) might cover that. It says that the Bank may, with the consent of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, remove a member appointed under the relevant sections if it is satisfied
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that he is unable or unfit to discharge his functions as a member.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Paymaster General confirm whether that phrase means that if the Bank of England fails to achieve its target within one month or the three months following that, the provision will be used by the Chancellor to terminate the contracts of members of the Monetary Policy Committee who are failing to deliver the purely technical matter of translating an inflationary target into monetary policy?
<P>
My right hon. Friend referred to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Not only does the governor's salary depend on delivering the inflation target, but he can lose his job if he does not do so. That must be the right way of going about it. The way in which the Bank's independence is structured in the Bill the governor is not responsible. He has somehow diverted responsibility to a committee which makes its decisions on the basis of a majority vote.
<H4><center>[Mr. John McWilliam in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> I understand that the setting of interest rates is not an exact science. On that basis, would it be reasonable for someone to lose his job for doing his best but not working to an exact science? I think that those were the words used by the hon. Gentleman earlier this week.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is my view. I do not believe that it is an exact science, and that is why the composition of a Monetary Policy Committee is so important and why we should have precise criteria for the opinions of its members. It is not an exact science, and their opinions matter, but the Government have rejected that suggestion.
<P>
It is also a reason why Conservative Members oppose the Bill. Because the setting of interest rates is subjective, and a matter of political debate between economists, decisions should be left to democratic, directly elected politicians. The Government do not take that view. They believe, apparently, that it is an exact science. When I questioned the Governor of the Bank of England in the back-bench Conservative finance committee, he said that it was a science. The Government deliver the inflation target but the Bank of England will translate that, through purely technical delivery, into monetary policy.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain how he seems to support not only a regime in which, in terms of independence, the committee is clearly accountable to the Chancellor for matters of pay and sacking but a system whereby the committee would be appointed for a five or six-year tenure? The arguments of Conservative Members, between themselves and between clauses, are contradictory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> They are not contradictory. The five or six-year term is meant to give rise to the independence of the people involved in the Monetary Policy Committee. People would be sacked if they had not delivered the inflation target, which is a purely objective matter. We can see the target, we can see that it has not been delivered so there should be some sanction when it comes to getting rid of people who are not delivering--if, that is, we believe that translating an inflation target into monetary policy is an exact science. Conservative Members do not believe that. We believe that the committee should be independent if we are to have an independent Bank of England. Therefore, the period should be five or six years.
<P>
The governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, who is solely responsible for monetary policy, can be sacked if he does not deliver the inflation target. Here, the Governor has absented himself from sole responsibility--the Government have set up a Monetary Policy Committee that makes decisions by a majority vote. Therefore, no one is responsible. It is odd that the Government have decided to structure the Bank of England in that way. This country is not a federal state like the United States or Germany which have that type of committee. Unitary states, such as New Zealand, have a single person responsible for getting monetary policy right.
<P>
Given the proposed structure, there must be sanctions or incentives on members of the committee. Otherwise they might pass responsibility on to their colleagues. The will say, ``I tried my best and applied all today's best scientific methods, but we failed. Never mind. Eh?'' There must be an incentive on the members of the committee to deliver the low-inflation target. The amendment is the best way of repairing this flawed Bill.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In view of the comments made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, I shall briefly endorse the amendment. It does not make an unreasonable request.
<P>
As my right hon. and hon. Friends have said, the amendment was tabled in the context of the Government's decision to present the Monetary Policy Committee as both independent and essentially technical in that it will operate within a remit that is politically determined. Either the committee will fulfil its remit, or it will fail to do so. It will worry all hon. Members if it does not fulfil the remit that is laid down politically, and, in particular, it should concern the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>
Of course, the committee should be set a reasonable task. This is where, by a very small degree, I may dissent from the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton on targeting. The way that the Government have set their inflation targets gives rise to a fairly wide margin of error. The target is 2.5 per cent. plus or minus 1 per cent., which gives a 2 per cent. range. That is different from, and it has the potential to go higher than, those set by the previous Chancellor, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). The Monetary Policy Committee will operate within the fairly wide remit that the Chancellor has set. If it cannot get it right to within 2 per cent., that will be a matter for concern. It suggests the need for potential sanctions.
<P>
Another point relates to the Government's inflation target. Some of us fear that the tendency for the headline and underlying figures to edge up may have been aggravated by the change in the target and by the Government's actions that have increased the retail prices index. As I said earlier, that increase is having an effect on wage claims. The Government are in danger of restarting an inflationary cycle.
<P>
If there is the potential for sanctions at the margin on members of the Monetary Policy Committee, the incentive for them to land within the centre of the target range will be enhanced. They will be penalised only if they go outside it. That is a reasonable approach to making the committee more responsive to the Chancellor's stated wishes. We understand that meeting the target is not a precise science and that there will not be an exact 0.1 per cent. correspondence at any one time. However, there should be a common commitment to the inflation target.
<P>
That target should be enforced. Perhaps it should not be enforced by the sanctions that occasionally come from the Government Whip's office, but by a modest reminder that, if the committee delivers outside the target range, it will not merely receive an open letter from the Chancellor and tea and sympathy on the understanding that it does better in future. We have had such apologies even from the Prime Minister recently. There must be a real underlying pressure on the members of the committee that will be reflected in their dialogue with the Chancellor to see that matters are properly conducted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> In the scenario where inflation was edging towards the outer limits, perhaps operating at 3.25 per cent., do you think that under the regime you are proposing it could instigate the risk of draconian interest rates that would have a severe detrimental impact? Would it not be more prudently operated in the system that is currently proposed which is about letters and exchange?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not proposing anything.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That was an extraordinarily interesting intervention which I had anticipated. It implies that the official targets which the Chancellor is setting are not really his at all; that it is really quite all right if inflation goes outside the limit. If this is a purely technical matter, it is a grave technical error on the part of the MPC if it is not meeting the target.
<P>
What I think the hon. Gentleman was trying to say was that if there is an economic problem, an exogenous shock, some developing tendency or even a change of political heart about inflation--I am not arguing the merits of that--something ought to be done about it. If that is the case, that should not be transmitted through some softening of the position of the Monetary Policy Committee, because there are many technicians carrying out the Chancellor's wishes, it should be by the Chancellor changing his remit letter so that they can meet it. If the Chancellor changes it, it may be to validate an inflation that he has caused because of his failures of fiscal policy, or it may be because he has had a change of opinion. It should be his responsibility to do it and it should not be confused with the proper technical responsibility of the MPC to carry out its monetary policy responsibilities.
<P>
In a sense the hon. Gentleman is making my point for me by drawing attention to the sensitivity of the margins up or down of these inflation targets. The MPC should hit its targets within the franchises that it has been given and if it cannot, either it should be changed or, if it is because the Chancellor has given a set of instructions that are inappropriate, it is the Chancellor's responsibility to bring forward fresh instructions on which he is accountable. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> The amendment was well described by one of my most distinguished predecessors, the right hon. Member for Wells, as less attractive than the many that have been proffered. I noted that in the course of the amusing interchange between him and his hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, it rapidly became something of an orphan. I doubt whether the orphan will find many votes in the Committee this evening. I hope not, so that we can press ahead with more important matters.
<P>
Underlying it however, were one or two points to which I should refer. As far as Paymasters go, the right hon. Gentleman will be aware that this one will leave office considerably poorer being unpaid for the job that he went into. It is none the less enjoyable.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton seems to have some sort of visceral hatred for the Bill. Can we have it on the record that in office--I am sure tht he has a distinguished career in Government ahead of him in the far distant future--he will repeal this Act? Is he saying that? He hates the Bill and the schedule, and believes that we should go on manipulating interest rates as the previous Chancellor so disgracefully did. That is not our intention. We intend to see that the Bank behaves independently. That is why we have taken all the steps that we have since coming to office, particularly in the appointments that we have made.
<P>
There seem to be three sensible reasons why no one would want to do what these amendments suggest. As far as I am aware there are no arrangements by which the salary of the governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand can be reduced. If the Chancellor were to do that, it would be political interference of the worst sort. The paradox was well highlighted by the right hon. Member for Wells, although not exactly resolved by him because of course no resolution is possible. Another reason that it was not adopted in New Zealand, which will interest my hon. Friends, was that, if all went well--this is perhaps what the right hon. Member for Wells fears--the Governor might be being handsomely rewarded while unemployment was rising. Clearly that would not be sensible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Paymaster General is falling into the same trap as his hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies). If some undesirable economic consequence is triggered by a performance within the standards, surely it is for the Chancellor, even within the terms of the Government proposals, to alter the remit of the Monetary Policy Committee rather than complain when it does its job and is remunerated for doing so. This may give rise to concern about whether there is a serious intention to penalise the MPC if it sets an inflation rate below the target.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman misunderstands the position. We have set the target, and the Governor and the MPC will undoubtedly hit it: the evidence so far is that they are determined to do so. If it goes too far beyond 1 per cent., a mechanism is in place to impose an effective constraint on them.
<P>
Another interesting feature of the debate was the hatred of the MPC expressed by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. Why should the immense power to move interest rates reside in one person? It is a considerable power: it is not the entire direction of policy, of course, but it is the other side of fiscal policy, and is immensely important. The early decisions that we took when we came to reforming the Bank included not merely setting up super-SIB or hiving off the funding arrangements; we also decided that to vest such responsibility in one person was not the correct approach. There was the confrontational arrangement of the Ken and Eddie show. Having one person acting alone--although he would take a great deal of advice--was, in our opinion, not the most sensible way to have monetary policy decided, which was why we expanded into a committee. There is widespread acceptance of the good reasons for, and common sense of, doing so. It is not only the quality of the people, high though it is, that commends these changes so widely throughout industry and the City; it is that the arrangements in themselves, including super-SIB and the MPC, are eminently sensible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I do not hate anything--it is not in my nature to hate. I was merely pointing out the flawed elements of the Bill and the damage that it will cause to the country. But we have to put up with that.
<P>
As for single responsibility, a single person can take advice from a range of experts. One of my objections to the Bill is that it is one more example of the Government absolving themselves of responsibility. Even within the Bank of England, a structure in which no responsibility is located anywhere is being created so that when things go wrong it will be not the Governor's fault but the fault of the MPC, or not the Chancellor's fault but the fault of the Bank of England, or not the Government's fault but someone else's. I may or may not have voted for it, but that is the reason for my objection to schedule 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman makes his objections in that tone. There is utter transparency in the arrangement, and we shall come to voting arrangements--the recording of votes, and minutes--in a while. There may be differences about that, but the aim is to achieve more disclosure, more transparency and more accountability. We cannot devise a more transparent system unless we go back to one person making the decisions alone.
<P>
Another rather macabre pre-occupation of the hon. Gentleman's is with sacking arrangements. He drew the Committee's attention to paragraph 9(1)(c), which is a standard provision on which standard commercial contracts are based. That is the way in which business arranges its affairs. The Governor has duties to and is responsible for the Bank, the deputy Governors, the directors and staff. The Government also have duties to and responsibility for those whom they appoint. The schedule outlines a normal arrangement.
<P>
The Opposition harp on about sacking. They overlook people's desire to succeed, which, in my business experience, is as important as material rewards. People's professional reputation matters more to them than a 10 per cent. pay cut in a bad year. Their standing vis-a-vis their peers, colleagues, Parliament and the public is important. That applies to the public sector as well as to the private sector. Commitment, and the qualities and abilities of members of the Monetary Policy Committee will win through. Instead of speculating on the possibility that we might not get it exactly right to the last 1 or 2 per cent., the Committee should welcome the Monetary Policy Committee and its composition, and wish it well in its difficult but feasible task.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Despite the Paymaster General's charm and knowledge of business, I am unconvinced by his argument. If the Monetary Policy Committee does a good, professional job--we have no reason to believe that it will not--it should be able to hit a target that achieves 1 per cent. either side.
<P>
Members of the MPC will be unable to do that only if they are not up to the job or if the Chancellor has made their job impossible. If the latter is the case, the Chancellor should come clean and admit it. If the amendment was accepted, the Chancellor would be responsible for determining the remuneration of members of the Monetary Policy Committee.
<P>
However, if the MPC is not up to the job, some sanction other than a letter and friendly chat should exist. Professional people are not weakened by the threat of sanctions; they are strengthened by their professional ability.
<P>
I have no reservations about the professional competence of members of the Monetary Policy Committee, and I would not expect the amendment to be invoked. However, circumstances may arise in which such a provision is needed. Therefore, I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
Question put, That the amendment be made:--

<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Third schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Paragraph 13 perturbs me. I hope that the Paymaster General can explain its purpose. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A representative of the Treasury may attend, and speak at, any meeting of the Committee.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Could that interfere with the independence of the Monetary Policy Committee? Should it remain in the Bill? Does the Paymaster General believe that it will not interfere with the MPC's independence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> No. It is a good point, but I really do not think that it does. If anything, it should allay the hon. Gentleman's fears that somehow or other the actions of the Monetary Policy Committee will be violently at odds with Treasury fiscal policy. This part of the Bill promotes a full exchange of information and good working arrangements. I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman the reassurance that he thinks is lacking.

Question put and agreed to.
