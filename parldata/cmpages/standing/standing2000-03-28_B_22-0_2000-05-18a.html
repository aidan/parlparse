<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 490, in page 73, line 3, leave out `or damages' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, damages or disturbs'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are discussing the following amendments: No. 491, in page 73, line 5, after `interest', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or the habitats or species upon which the notified interest depends'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 467, in page 73, line 5, leave out from `interest' to end of line 7.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> We are discussing how we ensure that damage done by persons other than owners or occupiers of land—we are at one on the matter—can be prevented or penalised. We have discussed the fact that the offence of reckless disturbance is included in the Bill. The question is whether disturbance, unaccompanied by adjectival description, is the appropriate way of handling the offences that may remain.
<P>
I was explaining that my primary concern with applying disturbance to the general offence is that people enjoying recreation in the countryside who are causing no damage may none the less be accused of disturbing the features for which an SSSI is notified. Given that the general offence attracts a fine of up to £20,000, we must be careful and question the reasonableness and proportionality of applying the general offence in such circumstances.
<P>
The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames), who has obviously had snipe for lunch and is still enjoying the delicious taste, told the Committee that dogs are far more of a threat to livestock and some elements of SSSIs—a view that we all share. Again, I take the opportunity to say that the Government have noted the serious concerns expressed by landowners and others, including the conservation agencies, and that we will come forward with the result of our deliberations. I entirely understand the importance of assuring everyone that dogs should not be able—it would obviously be unintentional—to do any serious damage. That must not be allowed to happen, and I am entirely on the side of those who are concerned to ensure that it does not happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): I commend to the Minister an earlier amendment about keeping dogs on leashes. If the right hon. Gentleman is with me on that, such a provision could be qualified and perhaps apply only for the nesting season. That might help
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I understand that point. Our prime concern is the nesting season. The Committee has already discussed whether April to June is too short. We shall consider all those issues carefully and we shall certainly make further proposals.
<P>
Amendment No. 491 seeks to protect the species or habitat on which the notified interest depends. In principle, I appreciate that a genuine issue has been raised—for example, in seeking to protect a food resource upon which the notified interest depends for survival. However, I believe that the argument that I have just given illustrates that the offence would need to be more specific, identifying specific circumstances when the activity may have a significant effect and when action might be appropriate.
<P>
Amendment No. 467 would remove the requirement for a person undertaking an activity on a SSSI to know that it was a SSSI. At this point, I want to deal with the point made just before lunch by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd); in making the case for the amendment, my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Mr. Lepper), curiously, it seemed to me, threw in some words about when it might be reasonable to assume that a person knew a site was a SSSI. However, the thrust of the amendment is that even a person who was unaware would be liable.
<P>
We need to be mindful of the fact that many activities might ordinarily be lawful and not damaging, but for the fact that they happen on notified land. The amendment would effectively criminalise those activities although the person concerned would not be aware of having committed an offence. That view is based on the wording of the amendment, not on what my hon. Friend said in moving it. I also suspect that, even if the requirement were removed, the court might still consider a defence of reasonable excuse to be provided by the third party's being unaware that the land was a SSSI. In many cases, users are likely to temper their activities once they know why a site is special. The offence is modelled on a similar offence that applies to ancient monuments and I am not convinced that it would be fair to depart from that approach.
<P>
I will, without any commitment, re-examine the effectiveness and proportionality of offences in relation to damage by third patties, but I am not convinced that the amendment meets the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for agreeing to re-examine the matter. I did not entirely follow the part of his argument in which he claimed that my amendment would introduce the offence of disturbance without qualifying it with the words ``intentionally or recklessly''. Clearly it would be qualified by those terms, because of where it would be inserted in the text. The amended clause would refer to a person who intentionally or recklessly destroys, damages or disturbs any of the flora, fauna and features at the site. Perhaps the Minister was given erroneous advice on that.
<P>
I regret bringing helicopters into the matter. Perhaps they were not the best example that could have been used. The argument might have been confused by the asides about dandruff and down draft—I understand that in the RAF they apply Brylcreem to avoid dandruff problems, but I do not think that happens in the Fleet Air Arm. As the right hon. Gentleman acknowledged, the argument that I was trying to pursue is a serious one, about how to frame legislation on eventualities that we all want to avoid—the wrecking of nature conservation interest on SSSIs, either deliberately or by people who, having been told about the problem, still do not care. We might want to consider the matter again on Report if the Government do not table a better-worded amendment, but in the meantime I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lepper </B>(Brighton, Pavilion): I beg to move amendment No. 465, in page 73, line 23, leave out paragraph 2 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`2.—(1) Section 29 of the 1981 Act (special protection for certain areas of special scientific interest) shall be amended as follows.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> Paragraph 2 of the schedule repeals section 29 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, under which nature conservation orders can be made. English Nature and the Countryside Council for Wales may ask the Secretary of State to make the orders in respect of third party activities on an SSSI that are damaging that site or when an owner or occupier refuses to enter into a management agreement. A nature conservation order can prohibit any activities occurring on an SSSI with immediate effect, thus preventing any further damage. Anyone who ignores such an order may be prosecuted and, if convicted, may be subject to a fine and ordered to restore the damage caused.
<P>
According to English Nature's annual report, 19 nature conservation orders, protecting 1,645 hectares, were in place in 1998-99. Earlier this year, two further orders were made to stop motorcyclists damaging two heathland SSSIs. As I understand it, clause 2 ensures that it will not be possible to make new nature conservation orders, so it is unclear what will happen to areas that are currently protected by such orders. The fate of special nature conservation orders made under regulation 22 of the Conservation (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1994 is also unclear in the Bill.
<P>
An important feature of conservation orders is that they apply to an activity in general. In other words, an activity will be an offence if can be shown to breach the order rather than if it can shown to be damaging in a particular instance. Another advantage of the orders is that they can apply beyond the boundaries of an SSSI. Damage to an SSSI is often caused by activities that occur outside it. English Nature and the Countryside Council for Wales can try to reach an agreement about management of activities adjacent to SSSIs under section 15 of the Countryside Act 1968, but without nature conservation orders nothing can be done if such an agreement cannot be reached.
<P>
The amendments do not merely propose retention of nature conservation orders as a last line of defence against damaging activities. They also build on the current arrangements and expand the scope with which orders can be made to include the protection of species listed in the following schedules to the Wildlife and Countryside Act: schedule 1, which deals with birds; schedule 5, which deals with animals; and schedule 8, which deals with plants. The 1981 Act ensures that those plants and animals receive the highest level of protection. The listed species often occur outside SSSIs, but although they are protected, the habitats on which they depend are not.
<P>
For example, adjacent to the Thames basin heaths SSSI are significant areas of conifer plantations that in themselves do not currently qualify for SSSI status. However, areas of the plantations are of national—and, in some cases, international—importance for schedule 1 bird species such as the woodlark. The amendment would allow English Nature and the Countryside Council for Wales to apply for an order to prevent forestry activities that would damage the non-SSSI habitat of that bird. It would also extend the scope of the orders, giving power to include the protection of priority species and habitats listed in the UK biodiversity action plan, which was the Government's response to the convention on biological diversity.
<P>
Action plans have been developed for all the priority habitats and species listed. The ability to make an order to prevent damage or destruction of priority habitats and species when all efforts to negotiate a solution have failed would contribute significantly to the implementation of the plans. The amendments propose that section 30 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act—the compensation provisions—should be retained in order to allow aggrieved third parties and non-SSSI landowners to claim compensation where it is appropriate to do so. The procedure for making nature conservation orders laid out in schedule 11 should also be retained.
<P>
I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will accept the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I shall speak to new clause 7, which, if I may say so without incurring the displeasure of the Chair, is grouped, somewhat curiously, with the amendments. The clause relates to the issue of management agreements, which we debated briefly in relation to SSSIs under Government amendment No. 672. I wish to deal with those parts of new clause 7 that were not covered by the Government amendment. Principally, that is the application of management agreements to species protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act and also to priority habitats and species under biodiversity action plans. I understand that we shall debate biodiversity action plans at a later stage, so I shall not detain the Committee on that matter. However, I should be grateful if the Minister would say whether he believes that it is appropriate for conservation bodies to enter into management agreements for species protection and whether the necessary powers are in place to enable them to do that. If not, does he think that it would be advisable to include an appropriate provision in the Bill, analogous with the procedures that have already been proposed for SSSls?
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> We support the intention behind the amendments, which is to increase the formal protection for threatened species in the wider countryside beyond designated sites. Having indicated my support for the amendment's general purpose, the issue is whether it provides the most effective way of achieving that purpose. I shall argue that it does not, but I hope that I can carry the hon. Gentleman with me—as I remember another Government spokesman said about Sir Cyril Smith.
<P>
The species listed in schedules 1, 5 and 8 of the 1981 Act and the priority species currently identified under the biodiversity action plan are those that are most at risk of population decline and disappearance and are priorities for action under the convention on biological diversity. However, we consider that although action in the wider countryside is necessary to conserve those species, the best route is through the current biodiversity action planning process, which prescribes, case by case, the specific action needed for each species.
<P>
The Government do not consider that the Nature Conservancy Council's powers, as improved by the Bill's main provisions, are inadequate to enable it to play its part in achieving the targets established in the plans. Those powers, together with the powers of other agencies involved in delivering the action plans—such as the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, through the expanded agri-environment programme, and the Forestry Commission, through its woodland grant scheme—and the further delivery mechanisms developed by way of local biodiversity action plans, represent a significant armoury.
<P>
Many of the difficulties that affect the conservation of priority species outside designated sites relate to the fact that they are wide ranging or thinly dispersed. The amendments would not directly address the needs of those species, as they could be applied only to clearly defined areas, which, where appropriate, should be candidates for consideration as SSSIs.
<P>
The SSSI protection measures in the Bill are specifically designed to relate to designated sites and are complemented by survey, notification and consultation procedures. The Government would be unhappy about extending the provisions proposed in the amendments to the wider countryside. That would give other land similar status to that of SSSIs, which are of national importance, without the complementary provisions that properly safeguard the rights of owners and occupiers
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion mentioned section 29 orders. Such orders will be unnecessary because permanent protection will be provided by the SSSI regime, as strengthened by the Bill. Accordingly, they will fall. I assure my hon. Friend that those issues will be covered by transitionals, which will be introduced as soon as possible.
<P>
More specifically, amendments Nos. 465 and 466 propose reinstatement of the nature conservation order provision in the 1981 Act. That is no longer necessary for SSSIs because the Bill will allow conservation agencies to refuse consent for damaging activities—the first time that they have had that power. That negates the need to extend the period of negotiation that was previously required. Third parties will now be caught by the general offence provision in paragraph 28M(5) of the schedule. The Government also believe that it would be unfair to owners and occupiers potentially to subject land that contains priority species to such a provision without the support of a statutory procedure to alert them to the detail of the location and conservation needs of the species. Such a procedure would need to be similar to the procedure for SSSIs. That would represent an onerous duty on conservation agencies and would dilute the distinction between SSSIs and other land. In addition—although I am sure that this was not my hon. Friend's intention—the effect of the amendment would be to impose an almost total freeze on the land. English Nature would not be able to grant consent for operations, even if it was satisfied that no damage would be caused.
<P>
New clause 7 would allow management agreements to be negotiated on land outside SSSIs. As the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) said, we shall debate this more fully at a later stage. The new clause would go further than the Government's amendment No. 672, which will allow conservation agencies to make such agreements for any land where operations will affect SSSIs. The agencies already have powers under section 134 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to make grants for anything that is conducive to nature conservation, and they have been using those powers in support of biodiversity action plan priorities. Beyond that, the Government expect that the expanded agri-environment programmes, as announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food—whom we heard during the lunch break speaking about the rural development regulation proposals and modulation—will be targeted increasingly towards biodiversity action plan priorities and will provide the necessary funding for conservation land management, even on SSSIs. Agri-environment schemes are far better suited to wider countryside conservation issues than conservation agency management agreements.
<P>
I recognise that important issues underlie the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend about how we can most effectively protect threatened species outside internationally or nationally designated sites. Similar issues will be raised later in Committee when we discuss whether there should be statutory backing for biodiversity action plans and other questions relating to locally defined wildlife sites. At this stage, I cannot give any commitments, but I can assure the Committee that, as I shall make clear when we discuss new clauses 18 and 20, we are giving serious thought to those questions. On the basis of those assurances, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> I welcome those reassurances from my right hon. Friend and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
</UL></FONT>The amendment relates to the powers in the 1981 Act, as amended by the Bill, which give the Courts the option to order restoration of an SSSI if someone has been convicted of an offence of damaging the special feature of the site. The Bill as drafted requires restoration if the offence is committed by owners, occupiers or third parties, but it does not fully include public bodies. The amendment caters for that. I hasten to assure the Committee that it will be rare for sites to be damaged by public bodies, but if there is a conviction on prosecution, they should be subject to the courts' power to make a restoration order.

<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): I beg to move amendment No.618, in page 34, line 38, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) notify the local planning authority in whose area the land is situated;
<P>
(e) notify the Environment Agency;
<P>
(f) notify every owner and occupier of any of that land; and
<P>
(g) notify any other appropriate body'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This welcome clause deals with the protection of Ramsar sites, which we support. The amendment is simple. Its purpose is to extend the list of organisations and individuals who should be notified when a Ramsar site is designated. I am slightly surprised that the clause requires the Government to notify the Nature Conservancy Council and the Countryside Commission for Wales. I assume that those agencies would have been consulted on the decision to make the application. Be that as it may, we welcome the fact that if those agencies are ignorant of what has been done, the Government are obliged to tell them.
<P>
The same argument should apply to the organisations and individuals listed in amendment No. 618. They are the local planning authority, the Environment Agency—as we heard this morning, it has a significant role—everyone with an ownership or occupational interest in such sites, which are likely to be on the foreshore, and any other appropriate body. We must remember that the planning process under the Ramsar convention is effective. The planning authority and landowners have a right to be notified if they do not already know. Other bodies, such as statutory undertakings or, even more likely, internal drainage boards might have an interest and should be properly notified. Such notification should be done out of courtesy; it is not a consultation exercise. It seems sensible and straightforward to add to the two agencies mentioned in the clause those listed in the amendment.

<B>Mr. Nicholas Soames </B>(Mid-Sussex): I rise to support my hon. Friend. Here again, writ large and manifest, we see that the poor landowner is the last person to be involved. The person who owns the land—the person who has stewardship of it and who is responsible for its upkeep and maintenance—is not considered in the Bill. We come back to what I have said before. I do not wish to weary the Committee with tedious repetition, but I shall have plenty of opportunity to say it again later in the Bill. It is only common sense—indeed, it would be courteous and a protection for him—that the landowner should be included in the provision. I do not see what it would cost the Government to accept the amendment.
<P>
The Minister and the Under-Secretary have both been more than generous and courteous. [HON. MEMBERS: ``hear, hear.''] They have been; I can say that without solecism. They have been extremely kind in saying that they will go away and think about matters. I want them to go away and think about this, but I want them to come back and say, ``Yes, we think that it is a sensible idea. We see no reason why the landowner should not be consulted. We will include that provision in the Bill because we feel that the landowners have the same rights, pari passu, as anyone else in the transaction.'' Indeed, they have more rights, because they have the property rights of the ownership of the land, and all the responsibilities that go with it. I urge the Minister and the Under-Secretary to support the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> We understand the rationale behind the amendment. It is quite reasonable that all those who own or occupy land covered by a designated Ramsar site should be notified, as should statutory bodies that may need to be aware of the designation. That is why, as a matter of policy, the nature conservation agencies notify every land owner and occupier—and relevant bodies, including local planning authorities and the Environment Agency—of a Ramsar designation. All such sites are already SSSIs, and those with an interest will have been notified of the fact.
<P>
The point is covered, but because we are sympathetic to the intention behind the amendment I am happy to take it away and think about it. If it is any comfort to the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames), I should say that we have a lot of thinking ahead of us, but I am quite happy to add this to the list. On that basis, I should be grateful if the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) would ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his remarks and I hope that he will reconsider the amendment. If I understood him aright, he said that the conservation agency will notify the parties that it lists. However, the clause requires the Government to notify the agency. It seems wholly absurd to rely on the agency to tell all the other people, when it appears not to be involved until it has been told by the Government. Either the Government should do it all, or the agency—which, I assume, would be involved in the whole process—should continue in the way that the Minister has described. However, if it is necessary to require the agency to be told by the Secretary of State, the same notification should be required by law to go to the parties listed in the amendment—
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Does not my hon. Friend agree that notification might initially come from a European agency? The Government would then notify their own domestic agency in turn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I shall not pursue that point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am grateful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Not that I would cross swords with my hon. Friend. I was simply conscious of your beady eyes on me, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
It is odd that the Bill requires notification of the agencies and not of the parties to which the amendment refers. I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his assurance that he will consider what appears to be an inconsistency. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I beg to move amendment No 668, in page 34, line 38, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) The Secretary of State may by regulations made by statutory instrument make such provision as he considers appropriate—
<P>
(a) for the purpose of implementing articles 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the Ramsar Convention or any other article he deems appropriate or any amendments of those articles, and
<P>
(b) for the purpose of dealing with matters arising out of or related to the implementation of those articles or of any such amendment.
<P>
(1B) The Secretary of State shall, at periods not longer than 5 years, review any regulations made under subsection (1A) and make a statement regarding the need for amendment of existing regulations and the need for further regulations.
<P>
(1C) A statutory instrument containing regulations under subsection (1A) shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said, we welcome the inclusion of Ramsar sites in the Bill. I am glad that the Under-Secretary told us that he would reconsider the previous amendment, which attempted to improve a clause that is not especially well drafted. Amendment No. 668 does the same thing. It is a permissive amendment that would allow the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales to make regulations about Ramsar sites on a range of issues—designation, monitoring, conservation and cross-border management—and which would give some teeth to the clause.
<P>
Most Ramsar sites are designated as special protection areas under the birds directive or as special areas of conservation under the habitats directive. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) will support those European directives, not least because they were, I think, signed by a Conservative Government. That means that the sites are under a high degree of protection in relation to the special interest that gives them their extra designations. However, the special interest that leads to designation as Ramsar sites may be different. The regulations that may be necessary to establish how that special interest should be judged in the planning system and how it should be balanced against other special interests must be decided.
<P>
For example, the north Norfolk coast is important because of a range of wetlands, both coastal and freshwater. It is home to globally important populations of nesting terns and bitterns. Those species and the habitats on which they depend are currently protected by SPA and SAC designations, but a wide range of other habitats and species, such as plants and vertebrates associated with the wet flushes along the springline, are part of the notified SSSI and the Ramsar site. The marshes are threatened by permanent tidal inundation as sea levels rise, and the shingle bank that is protecting them cannot be sustained for much longer.
<P>
The Environment Agency plans to build a new sea defence, but half the freshwater wetlands will be lost when they become brackish. As the site is an SPA and SAC designation, the agency wants to recreate that interest close by. However, no such requirement exists for the Ramsar interests, which, despite being of international importance, are wholly dependent on SSSI provisions for protection. The amendment would recognise the international obligations of the Ramsar convention and elevate Ramsar sites so that they have equal status with SPAs and SACs. That would increase the level of protection available for some of our most important and vulnerable areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I support my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green). There is little point in extending protection provisions if people can wander across areas when they exercise their right of access. For example, six of this country's birds are on the red list and six are on the amber list of Europe's most threatened birds. Rights of access could create serious problems for the protection rights that are assigned to those rare birds.
<P>
The amendment allows us to debate the Government's implementation of the Ramsar convention but, if accepted, it could tighten regulations. Although the Ramsar convention is important for our international obligations, there is concern that individual farmers and landowners will carry the can for the Government's intent The poor landowner, who often owns only a small amount of land, will again have to pick up expensive obligations. However, I am sure that that is not the Government's intention and that they have not acted out of malice.
<P>
I hope that the Government will respond to their international commitments in a proportionate manner, although I shall not weary the Committee by listing the commitments on which the Government are outside their obligations. In applying the EU habitats and wild birds directives, competent authorities are required to ensure that no permission or consent that they grant will damage a European site. But unless the sites have been designated in the Ramsar convention, they have not been designated to the satisfaction of the EU. We have signed up to those obligations and I feel strongly that we should abide by them. The European requirements are plain. It is unacceptable for the Government to say, ``Well, a lot of other European countries haven't implemented them.'' A lot of other European countries behave badly and reprehensibly, but we do not.
<P>
The competent authorities must be required to ensure that no permission or consent that they grant will result in damage to a European site. The problem is that the applicant, who might be a farmer seeking a minor consent—a small abstraction licence—would be required to undergo the same onerous applications procedure as a public water company or some other rich, horrid public institution. Will the Minister give those landowners an assurance?
<P>
I find myself constantly speaking for the landowner interest. I do not own any of the relevant land, but further obligations, under conventions, are constantly thrust on landowners. They are obliged by ownership of important sites to honour those obligations, but at the same time are obliged to extend often unwelcome access. I ask Ministers to investigate what could be done to arrive at a more equitable result.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The Government intend to supplement clause 64 with a policy statement highlighting our commitment to protecting and managing listed Ramsar sites on a par with sites that form part of the European Union's Natura 2000 network. That statement will cover a range of issues associated with the way in which we notify, protect and manage Ramsar sites, but the Committee will appreciate that most of the sites are already protected by European legislation under the EU birds and habitats directives. The statement will include consideration of any issues that might arise on the handful of Ramsar sites, of which there are currently only 11 in England, or features that are not so designated. However, all Ramsar sites are SSSIs and will therefore benefit under the Bill.
<P>
We are not yet convinced that additional regulations are necessary or justified for so few sites, but I am prepared to give the matter further thought, and therefore I ask that amendment No. 668 be withdrawn. We are nothing if not a listening Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I am grateful for the open and generous way in which the Under-Secretary has so often responded to us with an offer to consider Opposition amendments further. At what stage does he think it likely that he will be able to report back to us, so that, on hearing the welcome news that he will incorporate all our suggestions in the Bill, we shall be able to congratulate him and extend our best wishes to him for being such an open, relaxed, charming and thoughtful Under-Secretary?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> My goodness; how am I to respond to that? We hope to be in a position to deal with many of the points that have been raised on Report. That might not be possible in all cases, because, as hon. Members will know, we have undertaken to consider quite a few amendments—there seem to be more with every page—tabled by Opposition Members, as well as some from Labour Members. We shall be able to deal with the rest when the Bill is in Committee in the Lords. I hope that that plan meets with the satisfaction of the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I cannot necessarily speak for my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex but he looks reasonably satisfied. I am grateful for the Minister's assurance that he will take seriously the important issue that we have raised and I hope that we shall be able to debate it again on Report. If not, clearly there will be a wish to discuss it at length in another place—and I am sure that that will be done knowledgeably. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I want to ask the Minister's opinion on the letter that I believe all hon. Members have received from the Institute of Arable Crops Research at Long Ashton on the subject of invasive alien aquatic plant species. The problem is whether we have sufficient capacity to control it. That is obviously of particular relevance for Ramsar sites, where we will find the most vulnerable wetland, but it could happen anywhere in the country. If we have an invasion of floating pennywort, we shall have difficulties. Something needs to be done about it, and I seek the guidance of the Minister to discover whether he has the matter in hand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am not able to offer the hon. Gentleman any guidance, as I have not seen the letter to which he refers. I have recently discovered Japanese knotweed in my neighbour's garden, which is rapidly moving in my direction, so I have some sympathy with him. If he will forgive me, I shall respond to that question later.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`on or'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> with this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments:

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> We have had similar discussions about damage to SSSIs that does not take place on the territory itself The amendments seek to strengthen protection offered to SSSIs against offences that can be committed outside their boundaries. The most obvious example is that of fouling a nearby water course, although it might not be adjacent to it; that was the subject of an earlier amendment, which was moved in another context.
<P>
The amendments seek to improve clause 66 by strengthening it. The Minister might want to achieve that by other means, but it is obviously important that the SSSIs should be protected against offences, whether or not they take place within their boundaries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall respond to the hon. Gentleman's fairly technical amendment, but I shall first use the opportunity to say again, particularly for the benefit of the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex, that the agencies have limited powers of entry to the land. In our experience, they use those powers extremely rarely, and we intend that to continue. We believe that they should nevertheless have additional powers to accompany their new duties and responsibilities, even though, in all but exceptional cases, they need to be kept in reserve.
<P>
Those powers may be essential in a small proportion of difficult cases, but I repeat that the agencies will, in all cases, respect the rights of individual owners and occupiers. If they do not, I can tell the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex that I should want to know about it. The agencies will continue to ask permission to enter land. Their power to do so will be used only if permission is repeatedly refused, and it will be subject to having given notice—unless they have reason to believe an offence is being committed.
<P>
I turn to the technical milieu of the amendment. We have sought to define clearly the separate circumstances in which the agencies will be able to exercise the additional powers of entry conferred under the clause. Through precise definitions, we have aimed to provide reassurance should it be necessary. The difference in terminology is easily explained. Indeed, having listened to the hon. Gentleman, I think that the Bill is drafted to achieve exactly what he wants, covering not only offences committed on the land but in respect of the land.
<P>
Offences under section 28M may be committed on the land or in relation to land. For example, a section 28E authority might commit an offence if it fails to give notice of operations on, or affecting, an SSSI. That is the reason behind our terminology.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised a rather different issue. Our intention is that the Bill will cover not only offences committed by a third party in respect of land but offences such as the fouling of a water course, which was the hon. Gentleman's example. I hope that, on that basis, the hon. Gentleman will be reassured and will withdraw.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for that reassurance and am glad to hear it. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 622, in page 36, leave out line 29 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) take such samples of the land as relate to the designation or potential designation and integrity of the site as a site of special scientific interest and take such samples of anything from or on the land which may adversely affect the site and its designation and integrity'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 622 is plainly obvious and reasonable, but then all our amendments are reasonable—[Interruption.] At least they appear reasonable to us, if I might use the jargon. The Minister is the arbiter on whether they are.
<P>
Subsection (6), of clause 66 will insert actions into the 1981 Act. It specifies the actions that someone entering land under powers of entry may take in the process of entering. The powers are a significant step forward from our previous position. I do not resile from the need to include them. However, the final power, which simply says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>take samples of the land and of anything on it<P>
</UL></FONT>,
<P>
seems too wide in its potential exploitation.
<P>
Our amendment would restrict what samples could be taken of the land or anything on it. Samples would have to relate to designation or potential designation and to the integrity of the site and not to a factor irrelevant to the site's SSSI status.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will appreciate the logic of the proposal. We do not suggest that inspectors will go on to SSSIs to take samples of this, that or the other. However, as we have tried to explain on countless occasions today and in previous sittings, we must cater for the odd situation. It would be regrettable if someone somewhere exploited the opportunity made available by the current phrasing. I hope that the Minister will support the logic and reasonableness of the proposal to constrain the scope of the measure to samples relating to the designation or potential designation of SSSIs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I hope that I can persuade the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire of the reasonableness of the drafting. Our intention is that samples will be taken for the statutory purpose for which entry powers are granted. I said on the previous amendment that new powers of entry to back up the agencies' new responsibilities would be used only exceptionally and with considerable respect for land and property.
<P>
I hear the hon. Gentleman's point that samples should not be taken indiscriminately and that they should be taken only if they relate to the protection of the SSSI. Many landowners accept that such activity is appropriate and support what is often important monitoring and research that contribrutes to the sum of our knowledge. When that is not the case and action is repeatedly denied, I do not think that we should unnecessarily constrain the agencies' use of their new powers.
<P>
All the purposes for which the agencies can enter land are related to their statutory functions. Those purposes are to determine whether a site should be notified, to assess its condition, to formulate management schemes, to determine whether to make payments and, where necessary, to see that consents are complied with and offences are not being committed. Their exercise of powers to take equipment with them and to take samples will be similarly related to those functions. For example, when checking whether an offence has been committed, it might be necessary to take samples that are not adversely affecting the site. The proposed amendment would not allow for that. In seeking to define the provision too closely, we may narrow its use unreasonably, and I cannot support that approach. The provision will not apply indiscriminately, which I believe is the hon. Gentleman's concern. It provides for samples to be taken purely for the purposes of carrying out the statutory functions listed in the Bill. On the basis of those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I obviously accept the Minister's word for that, and I do not necessarily want to press our phraseology. However, the Minister just mentioned words to the effect of ``in relation to the inspector's functions'', and I would have thought that some such phrase would be adequate. I hope that the Minister is right to imply that, by reason of provisions in this and other clauses, any samples will have to relate to the SSSI's designation or potential designation. I would have preferred to make that explicit in the Bill, but I am happy to accept the Minister's word on the matter and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 642, in page 36, line 29, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and on leaving any land upon which he has so entered, shall leave it as effectively secured against unauthorised entry as he found it.
<P>
( ) It shall be the duty of the relevant authority to compensate any person who has sustained damage by reason of—
<P>
(a) the exercise by a person authorised by the relevant authority of any powers conferred on him by virtue of this section; or
<P>
(b) the failure of a person so authorised to perform the duty imposed on him by subsection (3a) above,
<P>
except where the damage is attributable to the fault of the person who sustained it; and any dispute as to a person's entitlement to compensation in pursuance of this subsection or as to the amount of the compensation shall be determined by arbitration.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This straightforward amendment attempts to safeguard the interests of owners when any officer of English Nature or the Countryside Council for Wales enters their land. Wide powers are entrusted to such officers by clause 66, so clear safeguards are necessary. The text of the amendment is based closely on section 7 of the Natural Heritage (Scotland) Act 1991, which sets out the parallel powers of entry to SSSIs in Scotland.
<P>
It is obviously important that land entered should be left effectively secured to prevent unauthorised entry and to prevent livestock from escaping on to roads. Where damage is caused by a person exercising the powers of entry—and accidental damage is always possible—it is only right to provide for compensation to be payable. I hope that the Minister will address that issue, as well as another issue that is unclear in the clause. What liability, if any, will occupiers owe to any officer who exercises his powers of entry? We are all aware that SSSIs can be dangerous places, such as quarries and bogs, and it would be unfair if owners were held responsible under the Occupiers' Liability Acts or any other legislation for accidents that befall officers who are exercising their powers of entry. I am not clear what the position is and would be grateful if the Minister would clarify that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I support the amendment. I am sure that apparatchiks from these organisations who invade other people's land—it was a mistake to call them officers; the word ``apparatchiks'' is much more sensible—[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a mumbling of conversation and I am finding it difficult to hear the hon. Gentleman's contribution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I regard that statement as breaking significant new ground, and I shall speak up accordingly. I hope that the hon. Member for Peterborough can hear me. I regret the interference of constant back-chat from the Government Benches.
<P>
I was talking about the apparatchiks from various organisations who will trample all over the land, leave gates open and generally behave in an ignorant and unsatisfactory manner. I was trying to make a serious point. Will the Minister consider including in the instructions that it is within his power to give to the organisations a code of conduct for people inspecting land? I entirely accept his belief that people who inspect land for good reasons will make appropriate arrangements. However, there is much ill will towards many of the organisations because of their high-handed behaviour. I wanted, therefore, to make absolutely sure that if he can do so, the Minister will instigate a code of conduct making it compulsory for them to undergo checks and to respect the countryside code. All of us who have any knowledge of life in the uplands know of the terrible difficulties that are caused by the constant problem of people leaving gates open, pulling walls down, letting livestock on to the road and so on. It is important that people who work for organisations of the state behave very well when they inspect other people's ground.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall give up trying to defend the honourable members of English Nature and the other agencies against the hon. Gentleman's sustained attack, although I think that his remarks are largely tongue in cheek. If we are being serious, I shall repeat my opinions. I believe that the organisations behave extremely responsibly and that they well understand the rights and responsibilities of landowners. I repeat—I hope for the last time—that if the hon. Gentleman has evidence of instances in which those rules and principles have not been adhered to, I shall ensure that thorough investigations are made. If further rules and principles are necessary, I shall give the matter due consideration. I do not believe that they are necessary, but I intend officers of the agencies and ordinary members of the public to show proper respect for the legitimate rights of landowners and of others who live and work on the land.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford has done his homework again on this amendment. He was right to say that there is a precedent in respect of Scottish Natural Heritage. I repeat that the powers of entry will be used responsibly. There may be exceptions, but we will deal with them, as we have to in all human activities. There are always people who transgress, for whatever reason, and who must be dealt with accordingly. It is hardly conceivable that exercise of the powers by the conservation agencies would result in damage, and I would astonished if it did. Nevertheless, I am aware that it is standard practice in the exercise of powers of entry by other public bodies for such a provision to be attached and for reassurance to be given should the inconceivable happen and damage be sustained. I was aware that powers that are already available to Scottish Natural Heritage are covered by such a caveat. I am, therefore, prepared to consider the detail of the amendment and to table an appropriate Government amendment on Report. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Ashford will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked me another question about the liability of conservation agency officers when entering access land for conservation purposes. A general duty exists to take reasonable care. If such persons were injured, the Bill would apply to them. They would have no special claims, but occupiers' liability under previous legislation is not, I believe, relevant. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall think about that. I am not entirely sure what the effect would be. I am grateful that the Minister has taken the main issue, about compensation, seriously. We look forward to seeing the wording that he will devise. It would clearly be fairer if the same provisions as in Scotland applied in England and Wales. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> This is an exceptionally wide clause. We have heard some reasonable words from the Minister, but I should like further clarification. The new subsection (3A) that clause 66(6) would insert into section 51 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act would allow officials of the relevant bodies not only to enter land but to do so by vehicle or boat, to take a constable with them if reasonably required, to take equipment and materials needed for the purpose and to take samples. It is a draconian clause.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex was on to something. There should be a code of conduct for officials before they act under the clause. It is an ancient, long-established principle that a landowner or occupier is entitled to privacy. The clause, used without great discretion, could become oppressive. Will the Minister assure the Committee that he will issue a code of conduct before any officials act under the provision? The threat of its use would allow officials to adopt an overbearing position. It should be used only in exceptional circumstances. The Minister has said that notice will be given. I hope that the timetable for that will be reasonable and that, if necessary, there will be follow-up before the clause is employed.
<P>
A code of conduct would cost the Government little and would give landowners and occupiers confidence. It might prevent such incidents as I described when in my constituency a council official entered land. The official indeed had powers under one of the planning Acts, but, as the chief executive told me, could easily have given, and should have been expected to give, proper notice. It is unacceptable that anyone should enter private land except in exceptional cases when an SSSI is being damaged.
<P>
Under subsection (1)(j) of the amended section 51, one purpose of the powers of entry would be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to determine any question in relation to the acquisition of the land by agreement or compulsorily.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Once the power to enter land without notice, to see whether it can be acquired compulsorily, is obtained, we are quite a long way down the route to excessive state powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I want to examine the power for an officer to take a constable with him if he reasonably believes that he is likely to be obstructed. Who is to evaluate the reasonableness of the belief? Is an objective test available or might an officer at any time take the view that trouble was possible and that it would be better to take the police along? It strikes me as odd, and at variance with what has been said in Committee. For example, an amendment was tabled, quite reasonably, that would have made it an offence, when entering land and misbehaving, to refuse to give one's name to a person entitled to request it. That would have created an offence similar to refusing to give one's name and address to a water bailiff, who is entitled to request such information from a person who is fishing, intending to fish, or engaging in other activities on the river bank. That amendment was dismissed out of hand, yet the clause contains this draconian measure based on reasonable belief and the hope that officials will always behave reasonably. I am unhappy with it, and I believe that the constabulary will also be unhappy with it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I hope that I can give the assurance that the hon. Member for Cotswold seeks. I have made it clear that these powers will be used only in exceptional cases. I said that compulsory purchase orders have been used only once since English Nature came into existence. Moreover, there will be a general duty on officials entering land and using these powers to take reasonable care. Having said that, the general instruction to English Nature to take care will be covered by a code of guidance, which is currently being discussed with the main interested bodies, including those representing landowning interests.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there should be a code of conduct, which should be agreed with representatives of landowners—for example, the Country Landowners Association—and adhered to. The Government intend to seek such an agreement, which will be the basis on which these powers will be used.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for taking on board very courteously the suggestions that we have made. Will he undertake to incorporate in the code of conduct a provision to make it the norm for a notice to be given, except in an emergency?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I have already said that when entry to land is sought, other than to investigate whether an offence is being committed, notice will be given. I also said that in cases of silence or a refusal, entry would be sought only if it were persistently refused, even though the officer might be seeking a right of entry to carry out the statutory functions set out in the Bill.
<P>
I hope that that meets fully the hon. Gentleman's requirements. The Government share the view that these powers should be used when necessary, but that that will be used extremely rarely. When they are used, there should be a clear procedure that must be followed, with one exception relating to the investigation of the commission of offences. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will find that satisfactory.

Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`killing, taking and disturbance etc. of wild birds and other animals and uprooting or destruction of wild plants etc.)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> The amendments were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton), who is unable to be in Committee today because she is unwell.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> We are already taking steps through the Bill to introduce ``reckless'' where appropriate. The current provisions in the Bill arise from the proposals developed by the Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime—sometimes known by the acronym PAW—which were designed to address a specific enforcement problem, primarily involving the disturbance of the nests of rare birds. Extending ``reckless'' to all offences was not considered or proposed by the Partnership for Action against Wildlife Crime.
<P>
The introduction of a general test of reckless disturbance will require demonstration of the fact that a person took an unacceptable risk or failed to notice an obvious risk. The defence that disturbance was the incidental result of other lawful activities would remain and prosecutions might be difficult with little conservation benefit.
<P>
I sympathise with the purpose of the amendment, but it does not provide the best way to achieve its objective. A more appropriate solution might be positive conservation measures, such as those being undertaken through the biodiversity action plan process, which we shall discuss later.
<P>
With that explanation, I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw his amendment. I do not object to its purpose, but I believe that it can be achieved in another way and there will be an opportunity to return to the matter later.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> I thank the Minister for his assurances and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 510, in page 76, line 20, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. In section 3 of that Act (areas of special protection) in subsection (1)(c) for ``the offender shall be liable to a special penalty'' there is substituted ``the offence shall be treated as falling within section 7(3A)''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 511 and 519.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The amendments will tidy up our proposals to make all offences subject to a fine of up to £5,000 and/or six months' imprisonment. That is a significant tightening of the level of penalties, but is fully justified.
<P>
The Wildlife and Countryside Act identifies some offences as being worthy of attracting a special penalty in the form of a fine up to £5,000. People found guilty of committing those offences are further penalised by being banned from keeping schedule 4 birds for five years. For other offences, the period of the ban is only three years.
<P>
The amendments put those former special penalty offences together in a new subsection and link them directly with the longer ban period. That should send a clear message to prosecutors and the courts that the Government take those offences seriously and want offenders to be properly punished.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> We strongly support the increased penalties. It is a nightmare to try to link the amendments with the amendments to the original Act that are in the Bill, but I have eventually reached the same point as the Minister. He slightly undersold his amendments, because they ensure that in addition to those penalties, forfeiture of any birds, eggs and so on is covered. When I asked about the purpose of the amendments, I was told that the Bill as drafted would inadvertently remove from the courts their confiscatory powers under the 1981 Act and that the purpose of the amendments is to rectify that. Perhaps the Minister will let me know in due course whether that is so. In the meantime, we support the increased penalties for the crimes for which there is no justification.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made:No. 511, in page 76, line 22, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—(1) In section 7 of that Act (registration etc. of certain captive birds), in subsection (3)(a), for ``for which a special penalty is provided'' there is substituted ``which falls within subsection (3A)''.
<P>
(2) After subsection (3) of that section there is inserted—
<P>
``(3A) The offences falling within this subsection are—
<P>
(a) any offence under section 1(1) or (2) in respect of—
<P>
(i) a bird included in Schedule 1 or any part of, or anything derived from, such a bird,
<P>
(ii) the nest of such a bird, or

(b) any offence under section 1(5) or 5;
<P>
(c) any offence under section 6 in respect of—
<P>
(i) a bird included in Schedule 1 or any part of, or anything derived from, such a bird, or
<P>
(ii) an egg of such a bird or any part of such an egg;
<P>
(d) any offence under section 8.''.'—[Mr. Meacher.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 426, in page 76, line 22, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. In section 9(4) of that Act, after paragraph (b) there is inserted—
<P>
``(c) intentionally or recklessly disturbs any marine mammal included in Schedule 5 in any place other than a structure or place used for shelter or protection.''.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am pleased to be able to speak to the amendment, which concerns a subject in which I have a personal interest.
<P>
The amendment would extend the ``reckless'' provision to apply to protected marine species in any location, thus giving protection—which would not be limited to a place used for shelter or protection—to cetaceans: whales, dolphins and porpoises. That is necessary because there is growing evidence of intentional or reckless disturbance or harassment of marine mammals, especially the bottle-nosed dolphin, and especially by fast personal motorised leisure craft such as wetbikes, which have increased in number in recent years. Members of the Committee may have received representations from their constituents about that.
<P>
Dolphins are especially vulnerable to harassment, because not only do they need to come to the surface to breathe every few minutes, but they are often mistakenly thought to seek out and enjoy human attention. There is growing evidence of the serious effect of harassment on dolphin numbers and physical health. We should take the earliest opportunity to legislate to protect them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am sorry to intervene on the hon. Lady, because I am sure that we all support what she is trying to achieve. However, I am curious to know how the amendment would be policed and enforced—for example, in coastal waters, where many such offences take place.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> The hon. Gentleman always makes interesting and relevant points. The purpose of the amendment was to draw the attention of the Government and Government officials to the issue so that consultation with relevant bodies could take place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> My hon. Friend's commitment to environmental issues, especially marine issues, is well understood and widely appreciated. I am glad that on this occasion I can support the amendment, instead of having to say that, although I like it, there are better ways of achieving its objectives
<P>
The Bill will make it an offence recklessly to disturb any of the animals listed in schedule 5 to the Wildlife and Countryside Act. However, that is limited to disturbance while the animal is occupying a structure or place. My hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough, who has an eye to these matters, has pointed out that some marine species, especially cetaceans and basking sharks, do not normally have a place of shelter. We accept that, and therefore propose to table a suitable amendment on Report.
<P>
I take the point that the hon. Member for Cotswold made, which was perfectly fair and not easily answered. We support the creation of the offence, and agree that the law should be enforced, or certainly enforceable. All that I can say is that we will consider the issues and consult on how the measure is best undertaken.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> I am absolutely delighted by the indulgence shown by the Minister and by the support of the whole Committee. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 427, in page 76, line 22, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. In section 13(1) of that Act, after paragraph (b) there is inserted—
<P>
``(c) damages or destroys any place in which any wild plant included in Schedule 8 is growing''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would help to protect those places where schedule 8 plants grow. It is necessary because existing law does not protect the places where plants grow—only the plants themselves. However, plants are now more vulnerable to destruction of habitat than collection.
<P>
The United Kingdom biodiversity action plan lists 168 plant species that are threatened with extinction or severe decline. Many more are disappearing from large areas of the countryside. Many of the sites where such threatened plants grow are outside protected areas. In fact, some especially vulnerable plants are not found in great quantities in SSSIs, and are, therefore, threatened by crop spraying, development, casual destruction or simple neglect.
<P>
I stress the urgency of the problem. At least 107 species of plant have become extinct in the past century, and we have lost 98 per cent. of our wildflower meadows. Cambridgeshire, a county about which I know a little—as, indeed, does the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire—has lost 120 of its 897 species of native flora, a staggering 13 per cent. In Huntingdonshire, a shocking 47 per cent of scarce species have been lost since 1970.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Sympathetic though we are, I am afraid that the run of luck for my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough has come to an end. We believe that the amendment could have unfortunate results that she might not intend.
<P>
The amendment could criminalise any activity that, deliberately or otherwise, affected any place where a protected plant was growing. That might include mowing the lawn or road verge, forestry or farming. The amendment uses undefined terms such as ``place'' and ``damage'' that would make the law virtually impossible to apply. ``Damage'' to a ``place'' would become an offence, even if it had no effect whatsoever on the protected species.
<P>
The current provisions in schedule 13 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which protect wild plants from picking, uprooting and destruction are the most appropriate way in which to achieve the aims of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> A 50 per cent success rate is pretty good; I could not expect two successes in a row. I accept the Minister's sympathy and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 361, in page 76, line 22, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. For section 14(2) of that Act (introduction of new species) there is substituted—
<P>
``(2) Subject to the provisions of this Part, if any person plants, releases or otherwise causes to grow in the wild any plant which—
<P>
(i) is of a kind which is not normally resident in England and Wales in a wild state; or
<P>
(ii) is included in Part 11 of Schedule 9
<P>
he shall he guilty of an offence.
<P>
(2A) A person shall not be guilty of an offence under subsection (2) if he shows that his action was not undertaken recklessly or the action was for the purpose of agriculture, horticulture, forestry or for other specified purposes (for example medicine, veterinary medicine, brewing and food processing).
<P>
(2B) Subject to the provisions of this Part, if any person—
<P>
(a) sells, offers or exposes for sale, or has in his possession or transports for the purpose of sale, any living wild plant included Part II of Schedule 9, or any part of such a wild plant; or
<P>
(b) publishes or causes to be published any advertisement likely to be understood as conveying that he buys or sells or intends to sell, any of those things
<P>
he shall be guilty of an offence.''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I must say that I enjoyed the hon. Lady's ability to spin—rather than call it ``one in a row'', she spoke of a ``50 per cent. success rate''. That was brilliant.
<P>
Amendment No. 361 is also about protecting plants, albeit in a more specialised sense. It would improve control of the release of invasive plant species that damage the environment and the enforcement of the law against the illegal release of such species. Schedule 11 proposes the introduction of custodial sentences for the illegal release of invasive species. However, as the Minister will be aware, although the 1981 Act allowed for prosecution for the illegal release of the plants listed in part II of schedule 9, there have been no successful prosecutions in the intervening two decades. That is because that part of the Act does not work. Although the release into the wild of non-native types of animal is strictly controlled, the control of non-native plants is limited to the very small number listed in part II of schedule 9 of that Act. No plant has been added to part II since 1992, despite the existence of many plants that cause significant problems. One example is the Australian swamp stonecrop, or New Zealand pigmyweed. The Minister referred to the Japanese knotweed, which is affecting his part of the world. [Interruption.] One of my hon. Friends refers from a sedentary position to triffids, but I doubt whether they would be covered by the amendment.
<P>
Clearly, the problems are widespread and serious. More than 1,000 sites, many of which are SSSIs, are occupied by the New Zealand pigmyweed. The effects of introducing such non-native, invasive species, many of which are aquatic, include the displacement of native plants, the blockage of drainage channels, extensive flooding and the drowning of cattle that stray on to water courses. The organisation Plantlife has collated a blacklist of the 10 most damaging aquatic species, all of which are now widely sold to garden pond enthusiasts. I shall spare the Committee the entire contents of the list, but it includes the floating pennywort, about which the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome complained, and the water chestnut. There is a place for the water chestnut—closely adjacent to king prawn and special fried rice, rather than clogging up necessary watercourses.
<P>
Listing such plants in schedule 9 to the 1981 Act has hitherto failed to control their spread. The amendment would improve control of new introductions, while safeguarding legitimate interests. Although plants that are known to be invasive, or which are likely to prove invasive in this country's environment, can be listed in part II of schedule 9 to the 1981 Act, further control of the sale of plants that are so listed is likely to be the only effective restraining mechanism.
<P>
I trust that Ministers will look favourably on the amendment, and in an attempt to speed it on its way I should point out that it would help to implement recommendations 5 and 6 of advice submitted by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. There is considerable support for the purpose of the amendment, and I hope that Ministers will consider it seriously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> This is an important subject and I agree entirely with the purport of the amendment. Although I cannot grow rhododendrons properly in my garden, there are entire valleys in my constituency that have been taken over by that plant. There are many other examples that we could cite, and the hon. Gentleman has referred to some of them. If the amendment were accepted, the Bill would be strengthened.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> This is indeed the right point at which to mention the floating pennywort, or hydrocotyle ranunculoides, to give it its proper name.
<P>
Under the amendment, a new section 14(2A) would exempt those who sought to introduce a new species
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for the purpose of agriculture, horticulture, forestry or other specified purposes.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Would that exemption include gardening, which is the main way in which alien species are introduced? No one wants to prevent the introduction of new species for gardening purposes, but a brake must be put on the introduction of species that are likely to prove invasive and unlikely to be contained within a garden environment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The problem is that people buy such species for gardening purposes in good faith, but they then grow out of control. That is one of the main causes of the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Not to mention Leylandii.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed, the Under-Secretary is lucky that I did not mention it; otherwise we would be here even longer. It is not wicked gardeners who cause the problem; people do these things in good faith, but accidents happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct. I am not suggesting that gardeners are wicked, although, in the context of my garden, I suspect that whoever introduced the ground elder to this country was particularly wicked.
<P>
I question whether this area of human activity can be controlled. I wonder whether controls can be imposed on the introduction or importing of non-domestic species of garden plant, or whether those actions would be exempted under proposed subsection (2A) because they were clearly not undertaken recklessly and because the action could be said to have been undertaken for the purposes of agriculture or horticulture. That is the only difficulty that I have with the amendment. I agree that we need to take action. I hope that the Under-Secretary can suggest a way of dealing with the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I readily acknowledge that the amendment addresses an important issue—perhaps one of the most important that we face in nature conservation. There is no doubt that the effect of introduced species on native fauna and flora can be detrimental and even devastating. It is already illegal to introduce into the wild those plants identified as being a problem. The amendment, however, would lead to differences between the treatment of plants and animals that it would be difficult to justify.
<P>
The Joint Nature Conservation Committee—the hon. Member for Ashford rightly pointed out that it has recommended action in that respect—has given us a preliminary report on the issues associated with introduced species. I acknowledge that the amendment is based on that report, but we concluded that the exemptions listed, which are clearly understandable, render the amendment ineffective. Most releases arise from exempt activities, but we believe that they are not deliberate. We acknowledge the problem, and we therefore intend to carry out a full review of non-native species in the new year. In the meantime, if there is an urgent need to add species to schedule 9 to the Wildlife and Countryside Act to prohibit their release, they can be added in secondary legislation. I therefore ask that the amendment be withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I think that Sir Humphrey has re-„entered our consideration of the Bill. The Minister agrees that the amendment was based on the report of a Government Committee that was set up specifically to consider the problem. He defines that report as preliminary. He said that the Government disagree with it and that they will ask for another report, but it will presumably be produced by the same people, as they are expert in the subject. I assume that that second report will reach much the same conclusion.
<P>
I am not sure why the Under-Secretary should believe that the amendment would introduce different provisions for plants and animals. Slight differences may occur, but the thrust of the problem is that the control mechanisms for the introduction of non-native animal species are strict, but that the provisions for the introduction of non-native plant species are much looser. We seek to equalise the treatment of animals and plants. It is a serious and urgent matter. It is not satisfactory to say that the Government will ask for yet another review.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Our main point was that the exemptions listed render the amendment ineffective.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Is that because of the exempt activities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am not sure that I agree with the Under-Secretary, because of what was said by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. He wanted to include gardening, which would have made the Under-Secretary's argument stronger. The problem is that such species, which have been bought for gardening purposes, are sometimes inadvertently released. The amendment would provide significant additional protection, even with the exemptions for agriculture, horticulture, forestry, medicine, veterinary medicine and food processing. The loophole in the regulations means that legitimate gardening can accidentally cause serious problems.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendment No. 513.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The amendments are technical. They clarify the limited circumstances in which my Department's wildlife inspectors can enter people's homes and what they can and cannot do while they are there.
<P>
The amendments limit the powers of inspectors who enter dwellings to carrying out specific tasks that they have been authorised to do. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Cotswold was interested in this issue, but he seems to be distracted by an article in, perhaps, The Spectator.
<P>
<B>Miss Anne Mclntosh </B>(Vale of York): It was the NFU magazine.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. References to the reading habits of individual hon. Members are making it difficult to follow the arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am sorry about that, Mr. Stevenson, but we do now command the attention of the hon. Member for Cotswold.
<P>
An inspector cannot, while he is in someone's home, search for signs of other offences. That would be beyond his remit. The amendments also make it clear that, for certain offences, inspectors have no powers to enter dwellings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> There is a sinister ring to the schedule. The idea of inspectors from the Under-Secretary's Department going into people's houses and the dismal reassurance that they will not be looking for other offences—a matter of great relief to many of us—is rough stuff. We resisted similar provisions in previous debates. Clause 66 gave inspectors the right to be accompanied by a constable. It will not be long before they want to be accompanied by the first battalion of the Parachute Regiment. The schedule is a further example of legislation that our forefathers would have thought unthinkable. The idea that an inspector from a Department could enter one's house and root around under one's pillowcase for birds' eggs is intolerable.
<P>
Parts of the Bill are thoroughly worthwhile. The Minister said that he hoped that some of my criticisms were tongue in cheek. One or two of them were, but most of them were not. The legislation is un-English. I wish to place on record my concern about the potential action of the apparatchiks.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`wild'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The amendments are succinct. We know that the schedule deals with wildlife, but not including the word ``wild'' when describing birds or animals might be construed as widening inspectors' powers. Bearing in mind the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex, that would be regrettable. Under the current drafting, a wildlife inspector could enter my hon. Friend's home looking for his pet moggy. He would alienate himself from my right hon. Friend even more if he entered purely to look for a domestic animal. That would not be advisable. The serious point is that the amendment would ensure clarity. The word stands as its own evidence and should be included.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am advised that the amendments would substantially weaken the value of the inspections. The inspectors check that the controls on the sale and registration of wildlife are complied with. The controls often apply to birds and animals that have been bred in captivity.
<P>
I cannot understand why the hon. Gentleman would want to excuse keepers from helping an inspector to examine such specimens. A scrupulous keeper would have nothing to hide and would want to help an inspector, in the interests of the well-being of the specimens, to ensure that the inspection went as smoothly as possible. In cases in which there are genuine reasons why a bird or animal cannot or should not be examined, an inspector will use his professional judgment to decide whether the inspection should be arranged for another day or discontinued.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Will the Under-Secretary reflect on what he has said? He has spoken of birds bred in captivity. What about budgerigars? They are wild birds in some parts of the world but they are also bred in captivity and kept in people's houses. I am sure that he is not suggesting that a wildlife inspector should inspect the way in which someone keeps his budgies. However, that is the effect of the clause as drafted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> No, it is not. We are not suggesting that; nor, I think, is the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire. The inspector will use his professional judgment, which will probably lead him to conclude that tracking down budgerigars would not be the best use of his time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> In a moment, but I hope that we are not going to have a long diversion about budgerigars.
<P>
I remind the Committee that inspectors will be entitled to enter a dwelling only in relation to offences under the Bill; they will have to have good reason to believe that such offences have been committed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for giving way. I fail to understand why he will not accept the amendment. One of the premises that he is using to resist it is wrong, because birds that are bred in captivity become ``wild'' when released. It is wrong, therefore, to use the excuse that an inspector might not be able to find a specimen, for example, because the bird in question had been bred and then released into the wild.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The Government do not want unnecessarily to limit the powers of the inspectors to carry out their duties under the Bill. The difference between our approach and that of the hon. Gentleman is that we are content to rely on the inspectors' professional judgment. We shall shortly place in the Library a copy of the draft code of practice for inspections, which will explain in detail their precise scope, the procedures for setting them up and guidelines on how they will be conducted. There is nothing in the measure for the hon. Gentleman to get too excited about, and I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am quite astonished by the Under-Secretary's response to the amendments. I thought that they would provide a clear, sensible means of clarification.
<P>
The Bill places an obligation on a person with any bird or animal in their possession to assist the inspector. That obligation is on the owner, so in theory anyone with a bird or animal in their house will be obliged to assist the inspector. That is far too wide a measure. I agree that we do not want unduly to restrict the inspectors' powers. However, we do not want to make them any wider than is necessary, which is what the provision does at present.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I do not want to prolong the debate about budgerigars, but the Committee should know that I am known in my constituency as the budgerigar's friend. I am a great champion of the budgerigar. [Laughter.]

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am intrigued.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I am not suggesting that there should be a code of conduct for the keeping of budgerigars. However, if the Under-Secretary proposes a code of conduct for the duties of inspectors, why should the Government resist the proposal of a code of conduct for inspecting and entering other people's land?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend makes a key point. The codes of practice will be very important. I recognise my hon. Friend's reputation as the budgerigar's friend, and I am grateful that he managed not to tell us what they taste like. However, there is still some time left and we may get that information before the Committee adjourns.

<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I do not know what assistance the hon. Gentleman can give me, but I have 50 fancy pigeons in a loft in the grounds of my house. Perhaps I shall be raided.

<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I should like to speak briefly to amendments Nos. 625 and 626, which would make part of the enforcement provisions more practical by inserting the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`by a suitably qualified veterinary surgeon'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
with reference to the taking of blood samples. There is no point in taking blood samples for evidential or ancestry identification purposes unless they are taken by suitably qualified vets. DNA sampling is very expensive and it would be a waste of time and money if that were done by anyone else. The purpose of the two amendments is to make the schedule more effective in its application.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I have not had much luck with my eloquence recently in keeping the Opposition happy and I hope that I am more successful this time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We live in hope.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Indeed we do.
<P>
For the avoidance of doubt, I shall speak in support of Government amendments Nos. 514, 515, 516, 517 and 518. For reasons that I shall come to, I must ask the Opposition not to press amendments Nos. 603, 604, 605, 625 and 626.
<P>
 With regard to amendment No. 603, I share the desire of my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough to ensure that the police have clear and unambiguous powers to take samples from wildlife specimens. However, the Bill already achieves that. My understanding is that if a person authorises something to be done, he is permitting it, but if he requires it to be done, he is demanding it. Amendment No. 603 would therefore weaken the existing position, as would amendment No. 604. I am sure that that was not the intention.
<P>
Amendment No. 625 gives me an opportunity to explain why the Bill is drafted as it is. Subsections (1) and (2) of new section 19ZB cover birds, other animals and plants, whether alive or dead. Subsection (5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No sample from a live bird or other animal shall be taken pursuant to such a requirement except by a veterinary surgeon.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no need for a requirement that a veterinary surgeon should take a sample from a dead specimen or a plant. The same applies to amendment No. 626.
<P>
Government amendment No. 514 is technical and it clarifies the provisions for police officers to take samples from specimens other than those which are the subject of a suspected offence. It will be difficult, if not impossible, for police officers to be able to confirm the ancestry or identity of a single specimen. That can be corroborated only by collecting samples from its parents or offspring and having them analysed. The amendment allows a police officer to require any person to make a specimen available for sampling, if he believes that that will help to establish that identity or ancestry.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 515, 516 and 517 are technical and they clarify the provisions for wildlife inspectors to require the taking of samples. The provisions are almost identical to those for the police, except that they will be used to ascertain whether certain offences have been committed.
<P>
With regard to amendment No. 605, the Bill already achieves what my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough is asking for.
<P>
Government amendment No. 518 is technical and consequential on the other Government amendments. It confirms that it will be an offence to fail to make a specimen available for sampling, whether it be for a police officer or a wildlife inspector.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`a constable acting in the exercise of the power conferred by subsection (1), or'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This simple tidying exercise would be for the benefit of the courts. The Bill contains an anomaly, in that there is a higher penalty for obstructing a wildlife inspector in pursuit of his duty than for obstructing a police officer who is performing exactly the same function, but whose obstruction would, I understand, be governed by the Police Act 1996. That is an odd differential. It does not seem appropriate. The only result would be that courts would be in doubt about the appropriate penalties to be applied, particularly if a wildlife inspector was acting in conjunction with the police officer. It is a sensible tidying amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The penalties for obstructing police officers are prescribed in the Police Act. I do not believe that a case can be made for making Wildlife and Countryside Act offences an exception to that provision. Other options are open to police officers. They can seize items that could be evidence of an offence. They can apply for a search warrant if they are not already operating under one. In serious cases, if a public order offence is being committed, an arrest can be made for a breach of the peace.
<P>
A wildlife inspector does not have those options. He has no power of search or seizure. If he is prevented from carrying out an inspection, he is limited to visiting again on another day, this time accompanied by a police officer, or to arranging for a new inspection to be set up, the arrangement having been agreed with the person concerned. Given the lesser options available to wildlife inspectors, it is right that the fine for obstructing them should be higher. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am not sure whether that is entirely logical. It seems to me that the obstruction of two such officers engaged in precisely the same activity and faced with precisely the same instruction should occasion the same penalty. I am at a loss to understand why the advice was framed in that way. I shall not pursue the matter, because it is of little consequence, but there is an unnecessary potential for confusion which would not be the case if the penalties were the same. It is hardly unique for a police officer in a particular capacity to have slightly differing power and sanction against those who obstruct him than in the general circumstances covered by the Police Act.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will consider the matter again—it is a worthy point—although he has such a list of things to look at that I would not be surprised if he does not get around to it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I shall not detain the Committee. Schedule 11 is even wider than clause 66, about which we have already complained. Paragraph 164 of the explanatory notes refers to the fact that a non-statutory code of practice will be drawn up. Will the Under-Secretary confirm that the items in the code of practice that we discussed under clause 66 will be covered in this code of practice? Will he confirm also that landowners, occupiers and the other interests referred to by the Minister of State on clause 66 will also be consulted before that code is drawn up?

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> This is another one-word amendment. It applies to the money resolution clause, which is a little wide, and aims to constrain the expenditure of this profligate Government by inserting the word ``directly'' in relation to the attribution of money for purposes specified in the Bill. The clause is currently rather loose, and I should have thought that the Treasury would be concerned about that.
<P>
We appreciate the costs that will arise from the Bill. A number of hon. Members have spoken about resources at various stages during our deliberations, but I suspect that overall expenditure will be far in excess of the £5.2 million given to English Nature and the £200,000 given to the Countryside Council for Wales in the current year—sums that are mentioned in the explanatory notes. It has also been suggested that English Nature will employ 25 more staff, which is obviously a considerable increase in its activity.
<P>
The Bill has many different aspects and will incur a lot of expenditure. I believe that the money clause should be slightly constrained with the words ``directly attributable''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> It might be helpful if I say a little more about financial provision, which was for obvious reasons, an issue of considerable interest even before we reached the question of direct and indirect expenditure. The clause has been drafted in standard format to provide parliamentary authority for public expenditure that may be incurred as a result of the Bill; it is not concerned with how much will be spent. I do not have to tell hon. Members that that is a matter for separate scrutiny and will be decided when Parliament votes annually on the supply estimates. The clause, which is perfectly normal, is required for procedural reasons, in order to avoid italicising—because they have not already been voted for—all the provisions under which expenditure may be incurred.
<P>
We believe that the new access provisions will entail one-off costs of about £8 million and on-going costs of about £2 million to £3 million a year. The rights of way provisions will cost central and local government some £20 million to £30 million annually. That would include proposed funding for the countryside bodies to enable them to promote research into rights of way.
<P>
The SSSI provisions will entail some additional administrative costs for the conservation agencies and will add to the pressures to increase resources for SSSI management. The grant in aid for English Nature was increased by £6 million for 1999–2000 and by £5 million for 2000–01 partly to meet those costs and pressures. Inevitably, the expenses of public bodies that are directly attributable to the Bill will be combined with other expenses during the accounting process. Expenses that are specifically Bill-related will not necessarily be separately identifiable from other expenses—for example, expenses incurred while encouraging access or protecting wildlife. That is not to obfuscate; it is an inevitable result of the cross-cutting nature of expenditure.
<P>
The Government will make provision to cover costs that seem reasonable to us to achieve the Bill's objectives, but the precise form of that—whether through grants to the statutory agencies, the revenue support grant mechanism to local authorities, or some other route—has to be worked out in the context of the overall expenditure review that is in progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has been interesting and open in giving us the public-sector figures, which strike me as being slightly higher than previous figures. Has his Department estimated the private-sector costs? Clearly, they are not covered by the same part of the Government accounts, but officials who worked out public-sector expenses must have estimated private-sector expenses. The Committee would find that information helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall try to help the hon. Gentleman. The costs to private businesses will vary substantially. Even the worst affected business—large moor owners with commercial shoots—would incur costs of no more than £4,000 a year. Provisions for closures and other restrictions could increase those costs Against that, however, landowners will benefit from reduced liability and the provision of wardens, as well as increased tourism and greater opportunities for farms to diversify. Indeed, some voluntary-sector interests could also benefit, such as outdoor recreation The cost side is relatively modest and is offset by considerable benefits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I do not want to put the right hon. Gentleman on the spot, but he gave a specific figure for English Nature. What is the figure for the Countryside Council for Wales? With regard to the variation of the SSA, it is important that the Committee should be told how local government will finance the additional work. I live in an area where it will be necessary to carry out a huge amount of work and I do not want my ratepayers to bear a disproportionate burden. I am sure the Minister appreciates the problem. He can write to me if that is easier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> It certainly would be, as I do not have the information to hand. However, the means by which the expenditure is incurred will not be decided in Committee, but in a wider setting. Of course I understand the hon. Gentleman's legitimate point. It is a matter for the National Assembly for Wales and not only for the Secretary of State. I shall undertake to ensure that further information is made available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> It may be partly a matter for the National Assembly for Wales in terms of formulae, but the addition to the block is also a matter for this Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> That is true, and I am sorry if I gave any other impression. Clearly, the totality of that sum will be determined in the current spending review.
<P>
I have been reminded that, in relation to the effect of closures and restrictions on private businesses, I inadvertently said that that might be expected to increase costs. The truth is the opposite it can be expected to reduce costs substantially. I apologise for that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The clause deals with public expenditure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am grateful to you for that intervention, Mr. Stevenson, not least because I have said as much as it is wise to say at this stage about the impact on private businesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I want to return to the issue of local authorities, and to clarify what the Minister said. He has slightly revised his figures, which I shall examine carefully. I think that he said that he had not ruled out—without ruling in—hypothecation as a method of distributing money to local authorities for this purpose. It may also be done through the revenue support grant mechanism, in which case it will have to inform the standard spending assessment review. Will he assure me that, if that mechanism is to be used, it will be fed into the process? Otherwise, a new hypothecated process will come into play, which will provide money where it is needed—in the rural authorities, not the urban ones.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I did not mention hypothecation; I suppose one could, therefore, say that I did not rule it out, but it is not one of the mechanisms to which I gave significant consideration. I agree that, logically, if the more usual route were taken, we would have to follow the decision-making process which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<P>
The amendment relates to indirect costs. I should stress that the costs that would have to be covered are bound to include indirect as well as direct costs. The salaries of support staff and the costs of office accommodation, travel and training will have to be covered, as well as the direct costs of, for example, handling applications made under the Bill. Indeed, contrary to the impression that the hon. Gentleman seemed to have, the Treasury would be extremely keen to ensure that all relevant costs were taken into account and included Therefore, if the word ``directly'' were added, indirect expenses would not, by implication, be authorised. That would not be right.
<P>
I assume that the amendment is probing. I feel fairly probed, and I certainly hope that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire is satisfied.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I have just one question to ask the Minister. Throughout our consideration of the Bill, there has been a dichotomy between the name by which we know the Nature Conservancy Council for England—English Nature—and its statute title. Will the Government consider putting in statute the term ``English Nature'', to stop the confusion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Once again, I commend the hon. Gentleman on his diligence in pursuing matters of interesting detail. The matter is one that we are considering, and I am aware of the point that he makes. We shall bring the new title into line with the title English Nature, as long as that does not create excessive and ureasonable problems and we do not have to make too many changes to previous legislation. If we had to make 10 or 20 changes, it would be all right, but 100 or 200 changes would be another matter.
