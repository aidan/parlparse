<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Committee. I am sure that our proceedings will be conducted with the usual good humour and courtesy, and that we shall make satisfactory progress.
<P>
I have a couple of announcements to make before we commence. The forthcoming recess affects the tabling of amendments. The cut-off for amendments that can be discussed on Tuesday 6 June is 4.30 pm on Friday 2 June. Amendments tabled before then will be unstarred. By implication, therefore, those tabled afterwards will be starred and not called.
<P>
Turning to this morning's business, I am mildly concerned that some hon. Members did not receive notice of their membership of the Committee until late last night. Indeed, because of last-minute changes, one or two hon. Members may not be aware that they have been appointed. For that reason, the usual channels have agreed that this morning we shall deal only with the sittings motion. I anticipate a brief debate on the order of consideration, if that is necessary, at the start of business proper on Tuesday when we return from the recess. I hope that that assists Committee members.
<P>
Finally, for the comfort of those hon. Members who have not presumed on my generosity, it will be in order to remove jackets. It will, of course, be up to Mr. Illsley to decide whether to exercise the same extraordinary generosity when he is in the Chair.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during proceedings on the Care Standards Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet, with effect from Tuesday 6th June, on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I had the pleasure of serving under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, when we discussed the Health Bill in Standing Committee in the previous Session. No doubt we both have fond memories of that Bill. I am sure that Members on both sides of the Committee look forward to debating this Bill under the careful and watchful eye of yourself and Mr. Illsley.
<P>
The Bill is important. It offers the prospect of better protection for patients and other members of the public. It will establish significant new institutions that will lead to the training and education of the social care work force into the new century. I am sure that the Bill's consideration will be well informed and conducted, certainly on the Labour Benches, with the usual courtesies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond (Runnymede and Weybridge):</B> I welcome the Minister's remarks. The Opposition also look forward to a constructive and courteous debate on this important Bill. I, too, had the pleasure of serving under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, in the Committee that discussed the Health Bill&#151;now the Health Act 1999&#151;and we look forward to receiving the Chair's guidance on this Bill.
<P>
I welcome to the Committee the many hon. Members who spoke on Second Reading. You made the point, Mr. Gale, that one or two of our colleagues are unable to be here because of the indecent haste with which the Committee was empanelled. In view of that fact, we are grateful for your guidance about the limitations that have been placed on our deliberations this morning. The speed with which Committee members were nominated perhaps reflects the logjam encountered by the Government's legislative programme.
<P>
None the less, we look forward to some constructive debates over the next four or five weeks. The principles behind the Bill enjoy a consensus among hon. Members of all parties. The Government are building on a long-term trend in legislation, which started in 1990, and which seeks to tighten and strengthen the regulation of social care. However, several concerns remain, which are relevant to the issue of the time that the Committee needs to consider the Bill.
<P>
Many of those concerns were identified in the other place. I am glad to say that, at that stage, the Government were able to make some concessions, but our noble Friends were unable to persuade the Government of the wisdom of their views on many other parts of the Bill, and imposed their views against the Government's wishes. I anticipate that the Government will seek to reverse some, if not all, of those changes. I am pleased that some further Government amendments have been tabled, which suggests that they have considered the points raised in the other place.
<P>
Our job is to consider the Bill as it now stands, drawing on the reasoned debates in the other place. Our journey through the Bill might be slightly fitful&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Julian Brazier </B>(Canterbury): Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend would allow me to finish. There are few areas in which the meaning of the Bill and its implications are clear and concise. Where the full purpose and import has yet to be made clear by secondary legislation, we shall want to pause and seek clarification and reassurances from the Minister.
<P>
I want to identify three principal causes of the need for greater scrutiny. The first is the Bill's architecture, which is too dependent on regulation and, worse still, too dependent on standards that are to be used by Ministers without any opportunity for parliaments scrutiny. So, we shall need to probe the Minister in some detail about the Government's intentions. In many areas, no draft regulations are yet available and there is little indication of their scope. It is unclear why the Government have been unable to produce either draft regulations or, at least, some outline document to indicate the scope and impact of those regulations.
<P>
The Bill started its passage some six months ago in the other place, and I would have expected that, by now, the Government might have been able to let the Committee have sight of something to flesh out the framework. In many cases, I am minded to give the Government the benefit of the doubt and to believe that many of our fears will disappear when we see that the regulations are reasonable and sensible. However, since our job is to scrutinise legislation, we can look only at the Bill. To the extent that it provides open-ended scope for Ministers to lay regulations and set standards that will not be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, it is the Committee's duty to assume the worst. If the Government do not constrain themselves, either by publishing regulations or by making clear statements, we must explore the Bill's impact in the worst cases. I hope that Ministers can clarify the scope and extent of the Government's intended use of the regulation-making powers, so that the debate will resolve itself satisfactorily.
<P>
Another issue needs to be raised. I mentioned it last year during our debates on the Health Bill, but it remains a concern. Although Ministers can make commitments on the use of the Secretary of State's regulation-making powers in respect of England, no one in the Committee can make binding statements on those that will be vested in the National Assembly for Wales. I realise that we can do nothing about that, but it is a serious gap in Parliament's ability to scrutinise legislation. In practice, although the Minister may be able to reassure us on matters relating to England, he will be unable to do so on those relating to Wales.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales </B>(Mr. David Hanson): I serve on the Committee not as the hon. Member for Delyn but as the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. One purpose of my being here, as on the other four Committees on which I serve, is to bring to the attention of the House the concerns of the National Assembly for Wales. Unlike the hon. Gentleman, we work in partnership with our colleagues in the National Assembly and we shall have severe discussions about how such matters affect Wales. I shall bring those concerns to the attention of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I do not know where the hon. Gentleman gets the impression that we do not work in conjunction with our colleagues in the National Assembly for Wales. We do, and some of the issues that we shall be raising during our consideration of the Bill will have been raised first by our colleagues in the Assembly. Although the hon. Gentleman's contribution may be interesting and valuable, he is not a member of the Welsh Executive and he cannot bind that Executive. The Minister's comments will doubtless be helpful, but it remains a constitutional fact that, although he can explicitly say that the Government do not intend to use their regulation-making powers in a certain way or that they will constrain their actions, no one is able to make a similar statement to the Committee in respect of the National Assembly for Wales. It remains to be seen whether that will prove to be a problem.
<P>
We shall want to probe the Government a little further on the financial implications of the higher quality agenda. The Bill is almost silent on the subject. We all support higher quality in the delivery of all forms of social care, but we must recognise that higher quality means higher cost. We need to know whether those costs will be met by central Government, and how, so that local authorities can continue purchasing the same volumes of care at the higher quality&#151;and thus, by implication, at a higher price. If local authorities are not fully reimbursed for the cost of the quality-improvement programmes, the result will be higher quality care but less of it, because local authorities will not have the wherewithal to meet the cost and maintain the volume of care.
<P>
The reason why I will probe the Government particularly on the matter is that, if they acknowledge that they will have to foot the bill for the higher quality that they are imposing on the sector, they had no reason to wait this far into the Parliament before introducing the legislation, which may not become effective for another two and a half years. If the Government really want to achieve higher quality in delivery of social care and are prepared to pay for it, they could do so through contracting and the power of their role as the principal financer of social care purchasing. The hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) told us on Second Reading of an interesting example in her constituency of a system of differentiated payments to ensure that higher quality care is recognised in higher payments.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have a lingering suspicion that, because the Government did not choose in advance of introducing the Bill to procure higher quality simply by paying for it and using the mechanisms of the marketplace&#151;I am not suggesting that that is an alternative to the need for legislation&#151;thereby speeding up the process, they will somehow seek to avoid the full cost of implications of the quality programme that they are imposing. That would have serious consequences for care users, care providers and local authorities. We will table amendments to ensure that the Bill's good intentions on quality translate into the production of a stable supply of services by ensuring appropriate systems for recognising quality and meeting its higher costs&#151;using carrots as well as sticks to deliver the higher quality regime that we all seek.
<P>
We will also raise for consideration the areas where the Government insist on ignoring deliberations in the other place. We now have a reformed House of Lords. The present Prime Minister has filled it with more peers than any previous Prime Minister. The House of Lords has been shaped to be compliant to the Government's bidding. We were told two years ago, even 18 months ago, that reform was needed because the body was anachronistic and out of tune with the thinking of modern Britain. The Government have done their dirty work in the other place.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the reformed House of Lords is any more democratic than the previous House of Lords?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> That is precisely my point. The reformed House of Lords is the image of the interim body that the Government chose. We might reasonably expect that the Government would listen to the body that they created in its preferred form. I find is shocking that, having dramatically changed the nature of the House of Lords so that it suits them, the Government still choose to ride roughshod over it. I may be surprised; the Government may have a late change of heart and accept some of the careful deliberations in the other place and do not seek to reverse all the changes imposed against the Government's will.
<P>
On issues of principle raised and debated in the House of Lords in a serious and well considered way, we will seek to engage the Government in a constructive debate. We will not stand on the ramparts defending the Lords' amendments, but we shall consider the principles that the Lords sought to introduce and the Government's specific objections to them. We shall also explore other ways in which we might obtain a compromise that addresses the points made by the House of Lords but which acknowledges the concerns expressed about them by the Government.
<P>
The Bill's passage will occur at a variable pace, but I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that the Opposition are approaching it in a constructive spirit. There is no political division of principle about the Bill's objectives, but there are practical concerns about the excessive use of regulation and the absence of acknowledgement that quality must be paid for and of any explanation of how such payment will be made. The intentions behind the Bill are good and in keeping with a tradition of legislation that seeks continuously to improve and tighten the quality of regulation of social care. It also takes some significant steps forward. For example, it acknowledges the need for uniform regulations, registration and inspection procedures for residential care homes. We welcome the Government's modern thinking on that issue and several others, as we shall point out during the Committee's deliberations.
<P>
We will seek to improve the Bill by building on its best features and by taking the Government's logic and their arguments&#151;as we shall, for example, on residential care homes&#151;and drawing them out to their full consequences. We shall table amendments that will, I hope, lead to a better and perhaps more far-reaching Bill that is built none the less on the same principles, arguments and processes of logic that the Government have already applied in taking some significant steps forward in important areas.
<P>
I look forward to an enjoyable, constructive and&#151;I hope&#151;not too acrimonious few weeks, and to working with hon. Members from all parties. I look forward also to probing the Bill's weaknesses and to trying to strengthen it so that its principal purposes&#151;on which I think all hon. Members are agreed&#151;are effectively enacted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): It is a privilege to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, and on the Standing Committee that is considering this extremely important Bill. I entirely support the sittings motion and will be pleased to be present at the times and dates that it sets out. I should, however, like to request a change of Room. Labour Members are extremely interested in the Bill and are quite numerous, but there is not much room for us. If the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) is to persist in making extremely humorous remarks, we will need a lot more room for laughter and general good humour.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Perhaps I can set the minds of the hon. Gentleman and of other Committee members at rest. We are in this Room as a temporary measure while another Committee finishes its proceedings in another Room, which it will then vacate. I hope that we will find ourselves in slightly more comfortable surroundings for our next sitting on 6 June.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I am most grateful for your remarks, Mr. Gale, which set a constructive tone for the future. In that spirit, it is important to note that discussion will necessarily refer to other Bills that are passing through the House and the other place. We should bear in mind that much of our debate will be affected by the profound and important extension that the Government introduced only this week in the other place of the statutory duties of local authorities to young people leaving care up to the age of 21. That change is extremely important and welcome, and it will affect our consideration of various important aspects of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> While the hon. Gentleman is speaking about other Bills, I should like on my own behalf and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) to acknowledge the enormous debt that we owe for the drafting of some of our new clauses, which the hon. Gentleman may have recognised. We will duly give him credit for that initiative.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I am most grateful for that.
<P>
The Bill is important. It will introduce profound changes that do not build on a great legacy of the previous Government. Instead, it radically amends the mistakes of the past.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): I, too, have served on two Standing Committees under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. I realise that our business was discharged at a pace that was satisfactory for Government Whips and, I believe, all members. Some of the issues on the provision of national health service health care that we explored last year in the Health Bill Committee flow into this Bill. The Committee on the Greater London Authority Bill seemed to take a lifetime to conclude.We await with interest to see how its recent outcome will develop.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said that there is a consensus on the Bill, which is only right. However, it is a strange consensus that tables and votes on a reasoned amendment on Second Reading which, if successful, would have put the Bill in the bin and forced the Government to introduce new legislation. However, he is right to say that many of its underlying principles are supported on both sides of the House.
<P>
The Bill provides an essential framework in which to set standards for the quality of care that vulnerable people receive and to ensure that those standards are policed and enforced in a way that gives confidence to the wider public. Our amendments will explore how the bodies that the Bill establishes will deal with service users and service providers. We will also want to know how its worthy intentions will be rolled out and put into practice. I hope that the Minister will clarify the details on the timing of implementation. The devil is not so much in the detail as in the definitions of care settings, which need additional explanation to that given in the other place, and personal care.
<P>
Reference has been made to the use of regulatory powers and the extent to which the Bill gives the Secretary of State and appropriate Ministers considerable powers to prescribe and lay regulations. The legislative framework must be sufficiently flexible to reflect changes in the way in which that care is provided and to accommodate expectations and aspirations. However, we need to know that mechanisms will be put in place to reassure providers, and that the views of carers and cared for people will be taken into account at an early stage in the development of new standards.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Having listened to the hon. Gentleman's remarks on regulations, I wonder whether he thinks that it would have been helpful for some form of draft regulation document to be before the Committee. Does he see a good reason why such a document should not be before us?
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Gentleman will know from exchanges on Second Reading that I would have preferred&#151;as I hope all hon. Members would&#151;regulations to be available. Some of the work has not even started. We have not yet clarified the definition on which standards will be built. It would therefore be difficult to have all the regulations now. We need a parliamentary mechanism for more than the laying of regulations so that we can do justice to the hard work of officials and others drawing up the standards. We will return to that important issue of consultation and its meaningfulness.
<P>
It is important not automatically to equate quality with the amount of cash, as the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge appeared to do. Much of the research that I have read implies that standards of care vary in residential settings and elsewhere even when the same sums are spent. I was intrigued and interested by the hon. Gentleman's pursuit of that line. If he returns to that argument, I will ask about public expenditure levels under the previous Government and the logic of his case bearing in mind past public services.
<P>
I am looking forward to getting into the details of the Bill. We are ready to begin work on it today and have tabled a substantial number of amendments to provide opportunities to explore several important questions. We want to engage the Government constructively and to build on what, in our view, was a constructive process of refinement and improvement in the Lords. We hope that the Committee will take that approach.
<P>
Several hon. Members rose&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we proceed, I had better clarify something for the benefit of the Committee. Reference has been made to new clauses relating to the possible creation of a children's rights commissioner. To avoid misunderstanding, I should say that I have yet to decide whether those new clauses fall within the scope of the legislation. The issue is being studied carefully and I am taking advice. Early suggestions are that the new clauses do not so fall, but a final decision is yet to be taken.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): I wish to make a small contribution to the debate because what I want to say cannot easily be said at other stages of our proceedings. I should say at the outset that I look forward to working under your guidance, Mr. Gale. I have served under your chairmanship on several occasions. I still have a lot to learn in this place and will welcome the gentle reproofs when they come.
<P>
I should like to use this early opportunity to register one point on the Committee's set up and the preparations for today's debate. During my experience as a Whip, it was extremely unusual for a Standing Committee to be convened less than 24 hours after the Committee of Selection meeting. On behalf of Whips, I hope that that will not become regular practice.
<P>
I should explain for the benefit of the Committee the practical problems entailed in such late convening. I am not the only member of the Committee with an office in 7 Millbank, where the post is not distributed by 9 o'clock on Thursday mornings. I sought notification of where the Committee would sit on my way to the House, but was not able to gain access to that information. I checked on the Letter Board yesterday evening for notification of the Committee, but there was none. That was because the Committee of Selection met only yesterday evening and had to reconvene at a late hour because one member of this Committee was still scrutinising another Bill. I put those illustrations on the record for the benefit of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint </B>(Don Valley): Is the hon. Lady suggesting that Conservative Members of Parliament were not here until the final vote last night, and therefore could not be told?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> The hon. Lady misunderstands the point. If the Committee of Selection meets on a Wednesday evening, it is quite possible, at such short notice and because of previous engagements, that hon. Members will be unaware that the Committee is meeting at 9 am the following day.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we go too far down that road, it is appropriate for me to make certain points plain.
<P>
The procedures adopted were entirely in order. It is quite proper for the Committee of Selection to meet as it normally does, and it is proper for representations to be made. It may be necessary for the Committee of Selection to meet again&#151;I understand that that is what happened last night&#151;in order to change a name and make a fresh appointment. Under those circumstances, the Clerks and the officials of the House are placed in a difficult position, because until the final composition of a Committee is known, notices cannot be issued. However, what has been done was done correctly.
<P>
I have made it abundantly plain that we are curtailing this morning's debate to take account of that fact. As a general rule, it is Madam Speaker's view&#151;I share that view&#151;that as a courtesy to all Members, notices of change should be given as early as possible. It goes without saying, in the same vein, that papers should be made available to members of the Committee, on both sides, as early as possible. I hope that with those few words of advice, if not of admonition, we might now continue debating the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale, for that clarification.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge spoke about the architecture of the Bill, but I wish to make further points that relate to the number of sittings. The Bill was described on Second Reading as an ``empty box'', with much being left to subsequent regulation. I see it more as a cavernous building, the danger being that the attention of those who walk into it will be drawn to the ceiling when many important points need to be explored that are to be found in rooms off the main part of the building.
<P>
The best illustration of that is part III, entitled ``Local Authority Services''. It includes several clauses on adoption and fostering. We must have sufficient sittings to do justice to that subject. The Government have made a number of pronouncements, but given only limited legislative expression to that intention. Given the maturity of the parliamentary cycle, this may be one of the last occasions on which legislative progress can be made in those areas. I feel strongly that our sittings motion should give us sufficient time for that.
<P>
The regulation of social care in part IV is another major subject. The many Members of Parliament who, in a previous life, were qualified and practising social workers should have time to contribute their expertise to the debate and to do justice to a subject that is never far from the headlines. Shortcomings in social care have drawn the public's attention, and public confidence in social care has been diminished. The Bill, if properly debated, will afford some opportunity to restore that confidence&#151;but only if we have enough sittings.
<P>
Clause 68 is likely to require more than one sitting, because of the significance of changing patterns of child care. The hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint), in her capacity as chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on child care will, I am sure, agree that the Bill affords us an opportunity to debate the wider issue. It is essential that we have sufficient sittings to debate the changing pattern of child care, its under-provision and our changing demand for it&#151;especially as the Government are committed to encouraging women into work for the first time, notwithstanding their responsibilities as parents.
<P>
The latter part of the Bill includes important provisions on the protection of vulnerable adults and the regulation of boarding schools and colleges.
<P>
The moving contributions of Lord Rix should be a warning not to race through those provisions. I fear that, because of its tail-end position, that part may suffer from the Government's desire to expedite the legislation speedily before the summer recess. I should like to record my concern for sufficient sittings to consider parts VI and VII in order that they are scrutinised properly.
<P>
The Government are wedded to the idea that a framework Bill will provide sufficient flexibility and a better legislative tool. My concern is entirely that of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. Given the Bill's lack of clarity and, perhaps, over-flexibility, the Government may lead us to make mistakes if we fail adequately to debate the full implications. I would hate to realise in a few years' time that I had been part of the legislative process that produced an Act that works poorly in practice, knowing that I had missed an opportunity to do something about in Committee. That is why I have specifically raised such concerns. We must have sufficient time to debate these important matters.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): I am particularly pleased to be serving on the Committee. I was disappointed to be unable to take part on Second Reading because of a prior engagement. The issue is one in which I have already taken an interest on behalf of my constituents, who have been writing to me in signficant numbers about a piece of legislation that, sadly, never receives the full airing in the national media that we would like. Fortunately, care home associations have been effective in informing their members that moves are afoot which are important to the livelihood of the sector.
<P>
Bearing in mind your admonition, Mr. Gale, I must none the less say that although I am still a relatively new Member, having entered the House only at the last election, I am surprised at the short notice that we were given of this morning's business. It is a discourtesy of the Government, perhaps reflecting their inability to cope with their Parliamentary timetable. They have forced us to be present this morning even though some of us heard that we must be so only by word of mouth and did not receive adequate notification.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that, this Session, 28 Bills are going through Parliament, compared with an average over the past 18 years of 17?
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. Friend, as always, is up to date with what is going on in Parliament. That is the reason why we have been dragooned here today. The Bill is important, and it would have been better if we had had more time to prepare for our first sitting.
<P>
The Government knows that, although the official Opposition support many of the measures, we have huge concerns about some of the Government's proposals and, worse still, about some of their omissions from the Bill. The regulatory framework which will come afterwards, is causing&#151;I do not exaggerate&#151;alarm in the private sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend has said the Bill is causing alarm in the private sector. She might also note that the possible impact of standards as yet unpublished in detail is causing alarm in the public sector.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. Friend makes a relevant point. I have been contacted so far only by private care homes. The previous Conservative Government's legislation resulted in a considerable number of private care homes, which on the whole provide much better value for money than those in the public sector in weekly boarding rates. Given that private care homes have been anathema to the Labour Party&#151;and certainly Labour councils&#151;over the years, there is suspicion on these Benches of an element of revenge-taking in the Bill, which we should guard against. We want to be wary and to examine the detail of the regulatory framework that the Bill will set up.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I visited a nursing home owned by a constituent of mine. It was a lovely home, in which any of us would be more than happy for our parents to be residents. It had a pleasant atmosphere and was beautifully clean and magnificently run. I was taken into one of its small rooms, which had an en-suite toilet. It was explained to me that that would have to be taken out of the room to meet the size qualifications proposed in the initial framework document. That, of course, was of great concern to my constituent and would also affect the value of her property and business. The number of rooms in a care home dictates its financial structure and viability. If one room cannot be used because it is a few inches too small, financial viability becomes problematic.
<P>
I am anxious that sufficient time should be allowed&#151;especially on the care home provisions, in which I take a particular interest&#151;for line-by-line scrutiny of the proposed regulatory structure and framework. We shall do our best to persuade Ministers that it would be ridiculous nonsense to force my constituent to remove a toilet, which I am sure is appreciated by the occupant of the room, especially in the middle of the night. It would be better to retain it, whether or not it makes the room slightly smaller than Ministers would want in their Utopia.
<P>
Very important considerations arise from the Bill. Those that I have mentioned are matters on which I have been consistently contracted over the past few months.

<P>

<B>Mr. Steve McCabe </B>(Birmingham, Hall Green): I am interested in the point that the hon. Lady is pursuing and wonder where she would like to take it. Which would she prefer: the specifying of room size in the Bill, so that her fears could be relieved, or the present arrangement of a draft standards consultation document, which leaves the question open and takes account of the concerns of care home owners?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not sure where the hon. Lady would like to take it, but I should like to take it straight back towards the sittings motion. Hon. Members will probably find that there will be ample opportunity to consider all the matters that have been raised.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> The hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe) makes an important point, which will be pursued later in our deliberations, but the Opposition are keen to ensure that measures that will have a significant impact on the care home sector and fundamentally alter an operation's viability remain within the ambit of parliamentary approval. We do not want those measures to be handed to a body over which parliamentarians will have no control. Constituents ring up Members of Parliament and say that something should be investigated because it is unacceptable. As part of our democratic function we should be able to do something and not simply reply, ``I am terribly sorry, but a new body has been created with the power to take decisions that could severely damage your operation.'' It is vital that we ensure democratic accountability for decisions that could undermine the financial viability of the care home sector. For that reason, among others, we want the sittings motion to allow us time to impress on Ministers that making the relevant decisions at a one-step remove from Parliament could lead to severe repercussions.
<P>
The hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood, who is not here at present, also received representations from her constituents and I suspect that there will be cross-party agreement that such issues are too important to be left to a regulatory framework that is outside our control. That is my principal concern about the Bill, although I am interested in other provisions in the Bill, not least those that deal with adoption, and the Government's rhetoric about what sort of parents should be allowed to adopt. This week, we heard about the birth of the Prime Minister's fourth child. Under the law of this country, Mr. and Mrs. Blair would not be allowed to adopt a child, yet I cannot believe that they will not make first-class parents and give little Leo the best start in life that anyone could possibly wish for a child. Therefore, when we consider the provisions on adoption, we should appreciate the fact that older parents&#151;certainly privileged older parents such as the Prime Minister and his wife&#151;would make admirable adoptive parents. The politically correct nonsense that has, sadly, invaded our adoption laws should be swept aside. On many occasions, the Prime Minister has said that himself, and it would be nice if the Committee could give effect to those views in the Bill so that more children could have parents to give them a good start in life.
<P>
Another important issue is the funding of the nursing home sector and care sector in general. I receive complaints about the amount that is paid out by social services for care home places, which had been kept at a low level for many years and is beginning to cause problems. I hope that we can reflect those problems in some shape or form, so that we can do our best to sort out that ever-growing sector in our society. The profile of our population is getting older. We are able to do more for people who have disabilities, so their life expectancy is increasing. As a result of the changing pattern of life expectancy, most of us&#151;either ourselves, our families or friends&#151;will have need of the care sector at some point in our lives, so we must make it financially sound and viable. We should not be trying to do things that we cannot afford, so we must be realistic in our aims to improve standards in the care sector. However, that realistic approach should not get in the way of making step-change improvements, which will benefit all of us, our families and our futures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jonathan Shaw </B>(Chatham and Aylesford): It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. As a fellow Member of Parliament for a Kent constituency, I have shared a couple of sessions with you&#151;[Interruption]. Not drinking sessions, but perhaps if we have a break one evening that would be a good idea.
<P>
The Bill is important. As someone who has worked in the social work profession for many years, I know that we have been waiting a long time for such a Bill. The way in which social care has changed over the years means that the checks and balances have not kept up with the service providers and the expansion in the private, independent, sector. That sector has an important contribution to make. An increasing number of services are provided by the private, independent, sector, so it is right that we should root out those who have no wish to provide quality care for our most vulnerable citizens. We must provide a playing field where those who provide good-quality services will flourish.
<P>
In one of my jobs, I was a fostering officer. One of the important objectives of the Bill is to bring in the independent fostering section. When I worked for a local authority, we had no relationship with the independent fostering agencies. Consequently, there was a feeling of suspicion between us, and grievances arose when it was felt that some of our foster carers had been poached. The services need to work together. Local authority and independent agencies will be subject to the same inspection and regulation, which bodes well and will bring together the two organisations. The establishment of a general council to replace the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work is also welcome. There is a shortage of social workers, but I believe that the Bill will do much to promote the profession in the eyes of the public and, I hope, will attract people to the work.
<P>
We need to discuss the issue of qualifications. There are 1 million people employed in social care, yet 80 per cent. of them have no qualifications. I look forward to hearing my hon. Friend the Minister say how he envisages improving, incrementally, that situation.
<P>
Opposition Members have asked the Government to listen, and the Government have listened. They have accepted amendments, suggested in the other place, to include provisions on domiciliary care. For people who are at their most vulnerable, who need one-on-one care in their homes, it is vital that the agencies that provide that care should be registered.
<P>
I also look forward to discussing private foster carers. In the other place, my noble Friend Baroness David tabled amendments relating to private foster carers. The Government thought that there was no need for private foster carers to be registered because they were mainly involved in family arrangements. However, time and again, the Utting report refers to the fact that no one knows how many private foster carers exist, and they do not all look after relatives; many look after the children of parents who are very mobile. Sir William Utting stressed that it is essential for those carers to register because such children are vulnerable and can be subject to abuse. It cannot be right that we do not know how many people are carrying out that sort of work, and we should provide as many safeguards as possible for such children. I look forward to debating that issue.
<P>
The Government's approach to the Bill is flexible, as they showed by accepting amendments relating to domiciliary care. The Government want to get the Bill as right as possible&#151;an approach that we have also seen in the other place in relation to other Bills.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) referred to the decision to raise the age for children leaving care to 21. That is a welcome move, and I wholeheartedly endorse my hon. Friend's comments on that. The Bill is very welcome. It will help a great number of vulnerable citizens, and we all have some self interest in the Bill. As the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) said, we are all vulnerable and either we or our relatives will need care at some point in the future, so it is important to get the Bill right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Julian Brazier </B>(Canterbury): I accept your admonition for removing my jacket too early, Mr. Gale. I shall&#151;
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Await instruction?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> Indeed. I thank my hon. Friend, whose thoughts I shall echo in my brief remarks.
<P>
The Bill deals with the care of the most vulnerable people in our community. The three categories of people to whom it principally relates are those about whom I am especially concerned. For my sins, I am vice-chairman of Voice, which has existed since the middle of the previous Parliament to look after the interests of adults with learning difficulties. I am also co-chairman of the new all-party group in adoption. My constituency, like yours, Mr. Gale, has a concentration of care homes for the elderly, which is a feature of much of the seaside in southern England. The measures worry me from all those angles.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall table amendments, principally on adoption, during the next week or so. They deal with the need for a national register and the requirement to act against local authorities that are not doing enough to facilitate the adoption of children in care, on which there is a healthy consensus on both sides of the House. However, it would not be right to discuss those amendments in a debate on the sittings motion.
<P>
I apologise in advance because I wil be away for a week with the Select Committee on Defence. Hon. Members know that the clashes between different Committees are creating problems. The Committee will be delighted to hear that my hon. Friend the Member for Southend (Mr. Amess), who was not able to attend the Committee at such short notice, will be happy to speak to amendments when I am away. They will be thoroughly discussed whether I am here or not.
<P>
I echo the comments that my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) made on Second Reading and, critically, in this debate on the sittings motion. The business of scrutiny is difficult and arduous and, precisely because this is a framework Bill, it might take longer than the number of clauses would suggest. This is an important and complicated issue. The Bill, which covers so much ground, sets out a long list of ways in which Ministers will be empowered to introduce regulations without setting yardsticks for them to follow. That is an abuse of Parliament.
<P>
My closing image is of the care home in my constituency that announced a few weeks ago that it was closing. Its owners read ``Fit for the Future?'' and decided that the future of care homes was not for them. The residents of that good and popular home are very happy there. If the future lies in regulating room sizes, then the future for caring for the elderly&#151;

<P>

<B>Mr. Shaw</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> The hon. Gentleman may make his point, but I am about to finish. If that is going to be the future, then it is not for those owners.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint:</B> I am pleased to contribute to the debate. I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Gale. I have not served under your chairmanship before, but some years ago, in another life, I was pleased to attend a meeting in Strasbourg where you were giving evidence to the European Parliament's animal welfare committee. My better half was supporting you as head of Government affairs at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. I know your concern for animal welfare will extend to the animals on the Committee and that you will attend to the health and safety of people in the Room.
<P>
It is interesting that so many Opposition Members referred to the notification of Committee membership. I noted their comments and will seek their support when the Modernisation Committee reports on its proposals to reform Parliament. I expect them to help us to make Parliament a more effective place in which to work, both in terms of sensible hours and structures.
<P>
During our deliberations, we will often have to recognise the changing ways in which adults, parents and children want care to work. Many of the policies that have been discussed do not relate merely to the term of a single Parliament. The Bill tries to address generational issues, in respect of which we must have a window on how circumstances might look in 10, 15, 20 or even 30 years' time, to try to ensure that we get the provisions right and that we do not have to keep regulating time and again. I am not one of those Back Benchers who like constantly to refer to past Governments, but I remind hon. Members that the previous Government had 18 years to address generational politics. The current Opposition often speak about what Labour Members should have done in three years, but it is a great shame that the previous Government did not deal with these issues during their time in office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I shall resist the temptation to rise to the hon. Lady's final comment, as I want to make a constructive intervention. As she has spoken about the long-term nature of the issues that the Committee will discuss, does she agree that it is especially important for us to seek a broad consensus on the changes? They are likely to form the basis of legislation that will apply for a long period, across Governments of different persuasions.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint:</B> Wherever consensus is possible, it is to be welcomed, but it cannot always be reached and we will sometimes have to agree to differ. I hope that the publication of the White Paper and the consultation that has occurred&#151;throughout the past three years, it has been clear that the Government would attend to the matters dealt with in the Bill&#151;has allowed full and frank discussion. The Committee will continue that discussion.
<P>
I should like to obtain clarification on some child care issues that I raised on Second Reading. Child care is having to change to meet new demands, which have arisen because of changes in the number of families in which both partners are working. There have also been significant changes in the workplace, in terms of shift work and hours in general. The settings in which parents choose to have their children cared for are becoming different, just they are in relation to vulnerable adults.
<P>
Those issues must be acknowledged, but regulation cannot disguise the fact that parents who are seeking child care must be vigilant and ask questions. They cannot rely on a piece of paper to tell them that a provider is the right person. We must bear that in mind at all times, as many questions will arise. For example, should parents at least be able to initiate a criminal records check in respect of a person whom they are engaging to care for their children? We might consider how to ensure that parents have that safeguard when they are employing a carer. I am not a social worker and I do not know whether I am in a minority on the Labour Benches in holdng that view.
<P>
One of the reasons why I became interested in the Bill results from a visit paid by a constituent of mine, who came to see me more than a year ago to express concerns about day care for vulnerable adults. Both on Second Reading and this morning, many hon. Members have referred to constituent interests that have alerted them to the issues covered by the Bill. That illustrates the strong connection that Members of Parliament have with their constituencies and shows why the constituency link is so important. Of course, agencies throughout the social care world have written to hon. Members, sent us briefings and lobbied us about various aspects of the Bill. That process is important, as such organisations provide expert advice. Eventually, however, the legislation that we agree in Parliament must be implemented on the ground, which is when our constituents come into it. Sometimes, provisions break down at that stage, and we will not be able to cover every eventuality. However, it is at the constituency level that Members of Parliament can bring fresh blood to the debate by representing our constituents. I am a connection with the constituent to whom I referred, who first expressed her concerns to me more than a year ago.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> I shall be brief. I too, am pleased to be able to serve under your chairmanship Mr. Gale. I cannot claim to have sat under your chairmanship previously, but I do remember one pleasant expeience when I was happy to receive your guidance during a visit to Cyprus.
<P>
I welcome the Bill. I take a different view from some of the earlier comments. The Bill is not ``an empty box''. It is a framework in which some clear boundaries must be established so that we can cope with the massive changes in the care sector. I welcome many of the changes and the fact that there is greater variety in the pattern of care these days. A clear regulatory framework to protect vulnerable people is necesary precisely because of that tremendous rate of change and that greater variety. The Bill will provide that.
<P>
A lot of discussion will be required on boundaries and definitions because that is what will make the regulations meaningful. Rigidly fixing everything in the Bill is the wrong approach because that is the kind of restrictive practice that will make it hard to accommodate change and ensure the flexibility we want in the care sector. I look forward to debating particular areas. The question of inspection and regulators will be important. We must be sure that we have the right people with the right skills and it will be vital that they apply their skills fairly across the board. The General Social Care Council provides an opportunity to regulate the sort of people working in the care sector so that we have the right people with the right skills and we are able to keep track of them.
<P>
I acknowledge the concerns raised by hon. Members about care homes. I have received representations from private care home owners in my constituency and the Birmingham area. However, good care home owners should welcome much of what is in the draft document ``Fit for the Future?''. We should welcome the points about the dignity and rights of individuals and the standards of care.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that private care home owners do not know which of the draft standards they should welcome because the Government have not said which ones they will include? Does he not think that those standards, which will have such an impact on the sector, should be subject to some form of Parliamentary scrutiny when they are published?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCable:</B> I simply make the point that ``Fit for the Future?'' is a consultation paper. The vital first step to ensure that the changes are right is to consult those who will be required to make them. Producing a set of standards and simply telling people they will be required to adhere to them prior to consultation would have been the wrong route to take.
<P>
In response to the comments of the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), I was saddened to hear that a care home owner closed down her home after looking at the draft consultation document. That leaves me with two questions. First, what grasp did they have of the document? If they had such dificulty understanding a set of draft proposals in a consultation document, how did they grapple with all the other issues with which they have to be familiar in order to care for vulnerable people in a changing world?
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> The hon. Gentleman simply fails to understand that most small business people have had it up to here with the Government's regulatory process. Any further step is a step too far. The closure of a nursing home in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury has been mirrored by one in my own constituency for the same reason. If the hon. Gentleman fails to understand that, he fails to understand why we are here to consider the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> The hon. Lady and I might have to differ on the matter. There is a world of difference between a small business that sells plastic boxes competing in a market in which it must be sensitive to regulation, and the care of elderly vulnerable people. We will be in immense difficulty if we do not want to regulate the sector.
<P>
It is sad that anyone should read a draft consultation document and consider it a reason for selling their care home.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> My hon. Friend is making a good point. He might like to remind the hon. Member for Bromsgrove, who has made a case against having regulations at all, that the regulatory framework has been endorsed by the care home sector and by the organisations that represent care homes. They have welcomed it because it will establish a level playing field between the private sector and the public sector for the first time.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister. The point that he made was true. We will stop the divide between the private independent sector and the local authority sector for the first time. That is vital because we want standards to be uniform across the board.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes his point reasonably. I know from previous debates that he thinks about issues moderately. The care home owner's decision might not be voluntary, as was the case in the example that my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury outlined. The uncertainty created by the publication of drafts without the Government making it clear what the standards will be has dried up the supply of capital available to many people in the sector. People might have been forced out of business because of uncertainty surrounding the industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> My understanding is that there has been difficulty with banks. Larger concerns have expressed particular problems. We should distinguish between the different types of private care homes. I point out to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that the hon. Member for Canterbury said that the owner in his example voluntarily chose to close the home after reading the document. Personally, I find that decision and reaction astonishing. I wonder what that says about the care of the elderly people in that establishment. A set of procedures would have to be followed were a local authority to choose overnight to close a home.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> Let me be clear. I am relying on what a newspaper article said about that case. By coincidence, another care home owner, who must remain anonymous for obvious reasons, came to see me at my constituency surgery that same week. The story that that owner told me will be relevant to our deliberations on several clauses. He said that he was under pressure from his bank and was at an age when he had to decide whether to continue for a few more years or to retire. The position has been made clear to him: his property would be unsaleable as a care home, were he to seek to sell at that time, because so much uncertainty then existed in the market. Further, it would be difficult to modify into anything else. I am guessing at what lay behind the decision outlined in the newspaper but that was how the case was reported.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> I am grateful for that clarification and will not pursue the point. The story is obviously different from the one that we heard initially. We should perhaps be relieved that people are not running around the country closing homes in the way that we have been told.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster </B>(Hastings and Rye): It might help my hon. Friend to know that about 20 care home owners from my constituency have consulted me. One of the homes has been closed because of its lack of standards but that is the only one. I suggest that home owners would be less concerned if hon. Members gave them the true facts.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) and the hon. Member for Meriden recently met care home owners at a conference in Birmingham, which I also attended. My experience was that the home owners wanted to do a good job and were concerned about their businesses. They wanted to be reassured and to work with good standards. We should chase that goal.
<P>
I acknowledge that there are problems for private care home owners. I want good homes to be maintained in business. Several factors put pressure on them&#151;there are problems with banks and there is overcapacity. We should acknowledge that some local authorities have undoubtedly adopted a hostile approach.
<P>
Possibly the easiest way of maintaining the sector and of reassuring people is to demonstrate in Committee that reasonable and good standards will be provided, which owners of quality homes can aspire to achieve, They will then be reassured that they can remain in business. The Committee must face that challenge in the coming weeks.
<P>
