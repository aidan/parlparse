<P>
<B> Mr. Andrew George </B>(St. Ives): I beg to move amendment No. 80, in page 3, line 44, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`including consumer-focused research to ascertain consumer attitudes to matters connected with food.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 8 concerns the acquisition and review of information. The amendment seeks to ensure that the agency can consider consumer attitudes as well as scientific research. We should recognise that consumer attitudes are not always based on rational considerations or scientific evidence. Consumer attitudes are a material factor. The Bill should allow the agency to consider the consumer viewpoint and not only cold scientific facts.
<P>
On his reply to me on an earlier amendment, the Minister said that references in the Bill should not be repeated unnecessarily, and I accepted that and other factors when withdrawing the amendment. However, consumer attitudes may not necessarily reflect scientific understanding. Consumers may worry about food technology. The amendment would allow the agency to make positive and constructive judgments on such matters as modified foods. We have seen recently how the public perception of risk can be different from the scientific interpretation: the public weigh the perceived risks against the supposed benefits.
<P>
The agency's decisions should be based not only on science but on the broader issues, and consumers' ethical and environmental concerns and perceptions should be taken into account. They are not a priority, but the agency should include them in its overall assessment.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> I must resist the amendment. At the risk of being repetitious, and although the intentions of the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. George) are the same as ours, its wording would increase the definitional problems to which I referred this morning. Consumer research is covered already under subsection (1) and the amendment would narrow its scope, not broaden it. The agency will conduct such research, having taken over research programmes from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. It might be better for me to stick to the narrow effects of the amendment at present, because I shall give a breakdown of the agency's work in the clause stand part debate.
<P>
The joint food safety and standards group is the embryo of the agency. It will have responsibility for planning surveys in connection with the general public and stakeholders later in the year. It will create a benchmark for future research into the effectiveness of the Food Standards Agency and its crucial communication policies. The group will ensure that the agency's audience--the general public--receive the information that they want in the most appropriate form. Such work will not await the start of the agency. The joint food safety and standards group will commission a couple of projects later this year, so research will already be under way on vesting day. As I said, I shall give details of the work that will be undertaken in the clause stand part debate. I recommend the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment, because its entire thrust is covered under subsection (1).
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> The Minister has reassured my hon. Friend the Member for  Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) and me that the amendment is already covered by subsection (1) under the fairly general statement that refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``other interests of consumers in relation to food''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It has been helpful to have the Minister clarify that research undertaken by the agency will include consumer-focused research and consumer attitudes to food and, on that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Before we agree the clause, I should be grateful if the Minister will give the Committee some further information. The agency will be representing the Government in international forums, such as the World Trade Organisation and the European Union. How will it carry out that role? How will it keep up to date with the latest research undertaken by various bodies?
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): In some ways, the clause is extraordinary. It is a motherhood and, no doubt, nutritionally correct apple-pie clause. When setting up an all-powerful agency, the Government consider that it is necessary to draft a clause saying that the agency can undertake research and acquire information, and that it will be allowed to monitor developments in science and technology. Well, of course it should. No doubt the Government have checked out the position with lawyers, who said that it is appropriate to add in such a clause to leave it in no doubt that the agency can do such fundamental things.
<P>
There would be no point in having the agency if it could not undertake research, monitor developments in food science and technology and acquire a knowledge base not already available in MAFF and the Department of Health. A little part of me thinks that the clause may be in the Bill merely for presentational purposes--to show that the Government are creating a wonderful new independent agency. Under clause 6 Ministers may ask the agency questions, under clause 7 the public may ask it questions, and under clause 8 the agency may ask itself questions. I do not oppose the clause, I merely consider it extraordinary and possibly redundant in that it enables an agency that must undertake research to do what it has been created to do.
<P>
My short intervention has another purpose. I should like to press the Minister on the research programmes that the agency might undertake in future, to which he alluded. He said that if we had a clause stand part debate he might be able to refer to them, and that if he were asked he might be able to mention them. I am asking him in the clause stand part debate, and I look forward to hearing about the research programmes that the Government envisage the new agency undertaking, including those relating to consumers' attitudes to food.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I take the point that the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) makes. He might think that the clause does not need to be included in the Bill, but it contains one of the agency's guiding principles that we set out in Chapter 2 of the White Paper ``A Force for Change'' in January 1998 because we wanted to make it abundantly clear that the agency's functions would have parameters, constraints and limits, and that it would not be a tiger set loose on the food industry but would work within certain rules.
<P>
We pledged to include those nine guiding principles in the Bill, and the clause fulfils one of those promises. It sets out the guiding principle that the agency should use the best scientific evidence to inform its decisions, thereby specifying in the Bill the rationale for policy making and decision making, which we thought important. Other clauses set out other guiding principles, such as to ensure that risk is assessed and that action is proportionate to risk.
<P>
The agency must keep itself informed of recent scientific research that others have carried out both at home and internationally. Within the group, we already keep up to date with WTO and Codex Alimentarius, and Britain services and plays a key role in some international committees. Strategic blue skies research will be the function of the research councils and others. We are careful to try to avoid overlap, although I would not say that it does not happen.
<P>
The present portfolio falls into five general areas--chemical food safety; microbiological food safety; radiological food safety; food quality and authenticity; and nutrition. To give a broad idea of the breakdown, chemical food safety constitutes about 37 per cent.; microbiological food safety constitutes 20 per cent.; radiological food safety constitutes 5 per cent.; food quality and authenticity constitutes 8 per cent.; and nutrition, including food choice and acceptability, constitutes 30 per cent. Those five general areas comprise 28 individual programmes, and 400 projects are currently under way. Some last a year; some last two years. The average is about three years. Very few go beyond four years.
<P>
Some projects were set in train one or two years ago, and are still in the system. Others are now subject to bidding. All joint food standards and safety group research is tendered for; none is placed in house. Some projects are currently subject to tendering for the 2000{**nrl**}01 programme, and assessments and decisions will be made later this year.
<P>
Responsibility for the projects will leave MAFF and be rolled over to the agency. The approximate figure given in the White Paper is £25 million. There have been a few adjustments to our research budget, which we discussed at Question Time last week, but it will probably be just under £25 million--a significant sum.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The agency will have a duty to keep itself abreast of developments and properly informed, so that it can carry out its functions, and to base its policy and advice on sound science, not on a hunch. The clause represents a sensible way to ensure that that is done and to include guiding principle number four--no, the order has changed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> May I give the Minister some breathing space? The clause might seem insignificant but it is important because, on the vesting day of the Bill, the Minister's function in negotiating the British Government's position in the European Union and other international forums will become redundant. What will happen if the agency's advice conflicts with the Government's view, yet the agency is busily negotiating on the Government's behalf in the international forums?

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> That is a perfectly legitimate question.
<P>
I was perhaps a little confused, but the clause deals with guiding principle number two:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Agency's assessments of food standards and safety will be unbiased and based on the best available scientific advice, provided by experts invited in their own right to give independent advice.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Because of the parliamentary draftsman's expertise, we can fulfil that guiding principle under no less than three different clauses--one of which is clause 8.
<P>
On the hon. Gentleman's perfectly legitimate question, the agency will be independent of the day-to-day management of Ministers. It will be a non-ministerial department, but its staff will be civil servants--it is a Crown organisation. It will produce policy advice, draft legislation and represent the British Government in international negotiations, including the European Union and the World Trade Organisation.
<P>
The joint food safety and standards group currently advises Ministers on the position that our negotiators should take, for example, in Brussels. Sometimes the group does so hourly as discussions take place. I have not been kept hanging on the phone, but I have been within an hour--that close--of negotiations before being advised what line to take in discussions in order to build a coalition for a certain way forward. However, if the Government do not accept the agency's advice, it will negotiate according to the Government's instructions. That is exactly what happens now.
<P>
In other words--to put it crudely--our civil servants and advisers can advise Ministers to take a particular line in negotiations--perhaps voting for or against a proposal, or abstaining, so as not to upset this or that camp while trying to build a coalition. However, because of other issues and constraints, Ministers may say that we must send the right signal and be positive, either by voting yes or no. Ministers' instructions are then followed. Exactly the same will happen with the agency; it will be free to negotiate on <P>
behalf of the British Government within the decisions taken by Ministers, because Ministers are ultimately accountable. That sounds like a contradiction or a paradox, but it is not, given what happens now.
<P>
Removing the joint food safety and standards group to the agency and placing it under different day-to-day control will not alter the policy lines given to Ministers in international negotiations. The expertise for the nuances of negotiation will, as now, be that of the agency staff; it is certainly not that of Ministers, who take a strategic view of all factors. The agency will negotiate to the Government's instructions.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>General functions in relation to animal feedingstuffs</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): I beg to move amendment No. 24, in page 4, line 10, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, but has the additional duty of ensuring that all animal feedingstuffs are accurately labelled with a complete list of ingredients, whether they are genetically modified and the country of origin of each ingredient'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I first became involved in agricultural politics almost 30 years ago, and the issue of what is contained in animal feed has been around all that time. There has always been a significant lobby of farmers who want clear labelling as to what their animal feedstuffs contain. The trade resisted that for years, which is why such labelling still does not exist. That is why we tabled this amendment to the clause, which extends the agency's functions to animal feed.
<P>
It is important that producers of livestock, whether of meat or livestock products, should know what they feed their animals. Most people would think it rather odd that they should not now have that right. That is why we want the agency to be given labelling obligations for animal feed.
<P>
We can move from the farmers themselves to the ultimate consumers of livestock products, who have a right to know what has been fed to animals. The issue of genetically modified ingredients in food is topical. Some supermarkets, such as Marks and Spencer, are declaring themselves GM free, but they can make such declarations with validity only if they can ensure that all the ingredients of animal feedstuffs are GM free. No farmer is in a position to know that himself as he buys soya or maize either as part of a compound feed or by the lorryload. We want to see the clause amended to state that the agency is obliged to ensure
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that all animal feedingstuffs are accurately labelled with a complete list of ingredients, whether they are genetically modified and the country of origin''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The country of origin is of huge significance these days, partly because of the obvious competitive pressures, but also because consumers are increasingly aware that there are variations in different countries' legislation concerning animal feed treatment and contents. For example, we know that many countries in Europe, such as Belgium, still use meat and bone meal, and that some countries use antibiotic growth promoters now banned in Europe. Those are key issues that must be made transparent by labelling animal feed.
<P>
It is perhaps odd that the Opposition should raise an issue that goes back to our experiences of BSE. There is no doubt that there was a vast range of novel animal feed ingredients during the 1970s and 1980s, when I was still involved in practical agriculture. I can remember a dozen and one different ingredients from African countries and elsewhere in the third world, including ground-up peanuts and rape stalks. There was also the recycling of individual species to produce meat and bone meal. If many farmers had known what went into their animal feed, they might not have chosen to use it. However, we do not know for certain; we are using hindsight, which is an attribute that we all have, but which perhaps we use too often. Many farmers have said that they would not have used some of those feeding stuffs had they known what they contained. That again illustrates the necessity of ensuring that the animal feed that is provided is properly labelled with all the detail that we propose in the amendment, to reassure the farmer, his customer, which may be a supermarket, and ultimately the consumer.
<P>
I remind the Committee of the vast range of possible ingredients. We need only look at a page from Farmers Weekly to see the huge list of items that can be included, such as brewers grains, citrus pulp, distillers dried grains, fishmeal, maize gluten, molasses, palm kernels, rapeseed, soya bean, supergrains, sugar beet pulp, wheatfeed, and many others. They can all be used in animal feed. That is why the manufacture of compound feeds should be open, clear and transparent, so that the farmer, his customer--the supermarket--and the consumer can be entirely clear about what they are buying and what went into it. They will then know whether GM feed, meat and bone meal, or anything else has been used in the production process.
<P>
The amendment has been tabled in a genuine attempt to ensure that the agency can do its job properly. The Minister may tell us that the matter is already covered by clause 8. I do not think that it is; it should be properly included. The agency should have the power to enforce the labelling of animal feeding stuffs, and the measure should be as inclusive as described in our amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I support the amendment. Many of the BSE problems were caused because farmers were unable to understand and find out what ingredients their animal feeding stuffs contained. Having been associated with these matters, I know that it was impossible to find out from the manufacturers what the products contained because there was a culture of secrecy. I hope that the Minister will not be seduced by the animal feed manufacturers when they say that it is difficult to label precisely the contents of animal feeds because they change daily. If the animal feed manufacturers can change the ingredients, they should be able to change the labelling. If, as expected by supermarkets, the Government and everyone else, we are to have ever higher standards of meat production, it is completely reasonable that the farmer who produces the meat should require the manufacturers of feed stuffs to declare fully what their feed contains. Otherwise, how can they pass on their duty of care to the consumer?
<P>
I hope that the Minister will take a fairly tough line against a strong vested interest that I have known for years of the animal feed manufacturers' resistance to labelling properly the contents of their feed stuffs. We look to the Minister for reassurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I have attempted to learn a little history, which I hope will be useful. The White Paper, ``A Force for Change'', contains a section on animal feeding stuffs under the section headed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Agency's Role in Food Safety''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
from paragraph 4.14 onwards. I had no knowledge of the history of the matter until I arrived at MAFF. <P>
Indeed, I had no knowledge of it until late 1997, when the White Paper was going through its early drafts.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I saw the reference to the Lamming report. I had never heard of Professor Eric Lamming before; it seemed a good idea to do what was proposed in the White Paper and implement its recommendations. To quote a couple of sentences from the White Paper that will explain the background, paragraph 4.17 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In 1992''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
note that date--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an expert group on animal feeding stuffs chaired by Professor Eric Lamming recommended that an independent advisory committee on animal feeding stuffs should be created to consider those issues relating to animal feed not falling within the remit of other expert advisory committees.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We become very polite in the next sentence, which reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This recommendation has not been implemented''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to say that the Government intend to implement it.
<P>
When I did a little work on the subject I discovered that when the Lamming report was published, the previous Government accepted that recommendation. Indeed, the document that accepted it was placed in the Vote Office in 1992. We arrived in 1997 and found that nothing had happened. It is polite to say that the report had not been implemented; it had been accepted but nothing had been done about it. There had been no announcement on that. The proposal simply lay there for all those years, while the BSE crisis raged about us. Nobody at ministerial level ever said, ``Hang on, we've accepted this, get on and do it''. The ministerial team had taken a decision to accept it but do nothing about it--probably under pressure from the feed manufacturers of whom I have just been told to be wary. I have had no discussions with feed manufacturers about that and none of them has ever complained about our proposals.
<P>
We put the clause into the Bill because one or two people were surprised, not by the White Paper but to find that animal feeding stuffs were a matter for the Food Standards Agency. Animal feeding stuffs are a vital part of the food chain, so that is the appropriate place for them to be dealt with. I hope that by the end of the week--certainly, with a bit of luck, by the end of next week--we will announce the membership of the Advisory Committee on Animal Feeding stuffs. We announced the chair of the group before the Easter recess and the invitations went out to the 13 members a few days ago. I checked this morning and we have heard back from 10 of them. That committee will deal with issues that, we discovered, were not being covered because they fell between the various committees. The use of genetically modified ingredients in feeding stuffs, feed additives, composition and labelling of feeding stuffs and contaminants in feeding stuffs. In 1992 the previous Government received recommendations that they do something about those issues, but did nothing. I accept the point of the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) that things should be done. We will do them and are doing them--it is just a pity that they were not done earlier.
<P>
On GM food in animal feeding stuffs, one has only to look at the article on page 24 of today's Daily Mail--not my regular reading--entitled
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Meat may be tainted by Frankenstein food''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The article gives a report of an answer from the Minister for the Environment about GM crop trials agreed under the previous Government, which agreed that some of the crop could go into animal feed. Nobody can tell us whether it ever did. We have always made it clear that none of the crop from the current farm scale trials is going into the food chain. The previous Government obviously thought it appropriate for some of it to go into animal feeding stuffs--without any labelling, of course, or any mention of the possibility of GM animal feed entering the food chain. While agreeing with the thrust of what the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said, it is a bit late because we are now dealing with clause 9; clause 6 also covers the issue.
<P>
Responsibility for labelling is a Europe-wide issue. There is no doubt about that, although there have been changes during the past few years. The labelling rules are currently enforced not by MAFF but by local authority trading standards officers. I do not want to nit-pick, but the amendment seems to give the role of enforcement to the agency. We want it to stay with the people who are expert at enforcing the rules--local authority trading standards officers. That enforcement system is a strength, not a weakness, and we do not want to be seen to undermine it.
<P>
The EC labelling rules for animal feed are extensive, and member states are not free to go it alone. We are pressing the Commission to produce the animal feeds rules for GM feed, and we will try to take the voluntary route if it fails to do so. The draft is there in the system, but the Commission dismissed itself, reappointed itself and then said that because it was temporary, it could not make any big decisions. That is the problem in relation to additives and flavourings in foods for human consumption and animal feeds. We are pressing the Commission and the European Parliament on those matters, and they will be pressed by MAFF--as long as this Government have responsibility for it--and by the agency. If the European Union fails to take action, we will take voluntary action.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman said, Britain imports a huge amount of animal feed. We have to import millions of tonnes of it every year, not because of quantity, but simply because we cannot grow feeds with the chemical and nutrient quality necessary for our intensive farming system. It is as plain as a pikestaff that whatever is imported from north America will be mixed as it is not segregated. If it is mixed, it is GM--it is as simple as that. That is our view, as we have made clear in outlining our position on segregation.
<P>
The issue must be dealt with. I freely admit that it is a gap in the chain, as Britain is importing animal feedstuffs in the way that I have described. I have forgotten the exact figure, but I believe that some 3 to 4 million tonnes of feeds are imported each year. Any such imports from north America must be assumed to be GM. Until segregation can be achieved, soya and maize products should be labelled as GM--those are the two products in question; others would not be allowed in.
<P>
The Government have refused to agree to the importation of some GM feed products. I speak especially of Monsanto cotton, which was on our desk earlier this year. It was refused both in Britain and in the European Union, and we have been very careful about it.
<P>
We want feed to be labelled. I agree that ingredients should be labelled, and not in the old way whereby only the chemical composition of feedstuffs was displayed. Farmers can rightly say, ``We did not know what was in the feed.'' I also accept that probably not many farmers asked what feed contained in the early days when a problem was not known to exist. No one can say with certainty that feed caused BSE, but it is generally assumed that it did, and all the information and evidence points in that direction.
<P>
The fact remains that BSE cases have arisen on only 35,000 farms. There are more than 100,000 cattle farms in Britain, and more than 80 per cent. of beef herds have never had a case of BSE. Two thirds of dairy herds have never had a case. The vast majority of farmers were affected by the disease, probably because of the use of particular feeds by the minority. I am not making accusations against that minority; I am simply trying to set out the facts and figures. One can see why farmers encountered a difficulty. Even in the early years of the BSE crisis, when the previous Government were under considerable pressure to decide the content of feedstuffs, feed manufacturers were not exactly forthcoming, although I should make it clear that that is not a point of criticism.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I have had a chance to read the Bill a little more carefully than I had when I made my speech. The clause is far reaching, as it must be read in conjunction with clause 30 and schedule 3. The Bill gives the agency powers that the Government had under the Food Safety Act 1990. The agency will have enforcement powers, but it will have to consult the Minister to determine what they are. He will then introduce them in secondary legislation. Will he give us a little idea of his thinking about the generality of the powers that the agency will be given over animal feeding stuffs? Will he take a much tougher line than has previously been taken with the animal feed industry and require it to disclose all the ingredients in its feedstuffs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The short answer is yes. I do not seek to hide in any way the powers that the Food Standards Agency is being given. MAFF's powers under the Food Safety Act, the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 and the animal feed legislation will pass to the agency. MAFF will still have a role as a sponsor of the agricultural industry, so there will have to be a degree of co-operation.
<P>
The enforcement of labelling requirements will still be carried out by local authority trading standards. We should not forget, however, that the agency is given the role elsewhere in the Bill of setting performance standards and monitoring local authority enforcement of food standards. That applies to animal feedstuffs as well as to the human food chain. The agency therefore sets the standards of enforcement and monitors local authorities' performance.
<P>
<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): I have been following the Minister's comments carefully because he has created more questions than answers. I am clear in my own mind about the relationship between the agency and environmental health departments. The agency can withdraw the environmental health functions of inadequate local authorities. Is the Minister now suggesting that trading standards should have the same relationship to the agency as regards their role in the labelling of animal feedstuffs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I hope that I have not created more questions than answers. I am genuinely trying to be as open and helpful as I can. We have jumped a little in the Bill.
<P>
I have just received some advice, which I will put on the record. Clause 30 allows Ministers to revoke provisions on animal feed and to bring them into line with those in the Food Safety Act; it does not transfer powers from Ministers to the agency. There is a slight difference. Powers could, however, be transferred by secondary legislation, but we do not intend to do that. I hope that that helps the hon. Member for Cotswold.
<P>
On the point raised by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand), we made it clear on Second Reading that the Food Standards Agency had the power to set and monitor enforcement standards. It may remove powers from a local authority in the case of an abject failure and hand them to another local authority, or do the job itself. That is the ultimate sanction in ensuring that we raise standards and achieve a high degree of consistency in enforcement. That is one of the three new functions in the Bill. Most of the agency's work already takes place, but that role is completely new and the power does not exist.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Does that apply to trading standards as well as to environmental health? In discussions in the Special Select Committee, we always talked about environmental health in that regard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I tend to use the general phrase ``local authority enforcement'', and there are obviously different levels of local authority. I simply gave the global answer.
<P>
I apologise for having failed to answer the point about additives that are incorporated into feed. There is currently the issue of antibiotic growth promoters, which have been banned and cannot be placed on the market. In the EU, any feed stuffs that contain illegal or banned additives--this is indirectly a labelling point--are not allowed. The central thrust of the contribution by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire was on genetic modification and accurate labelling of the contents of feed. I am at one with him on that matter. As the Bill is drafted, it is our intention that that objective will be pursued by the agency as it is currently pursued by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

Once the European elections were out of the way, the European Parliament was in place. We are seeking ways of pressuring that Parliament to put pressure on the Commission, even though the commissioners will be going soon. We do not see any excuse for delay in dealing with genetically modified organisms in animal feed stuffs. We need a Europe-wide labelling regime to make any system effective because we import so much animal feed stuff. If most of it was home grown, that would not be an issue; because we import so much, we need a labelling regime with which people are satisfied for trading purposes. I have gone a bit wide of the mark in making those remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> An important general point arises throughout the Bill concerning the huge power that the agency will have under clause 9 as subsumed into clause 30 and schedule 3, about which I am increasingly concerned the more we discuss the Bill. I shall quote briefly to the Committee from the provision made under schedule 3(4):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Agency may, after consulting the Secretary of State''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it need only consult--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``give directions to food authorities under section 40''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That covers almost any directions that the agency might want to give to a food authority in relation to food safety or any of its other functions.
<P>
How is the agency accountable to Parliament? The agency could become totally out of control--it is not really accountable to Ministers--and give directions all over the place to local authorities, trading standards and environmental health bodies. What is the actual line of accountability to Parliament, which is the supreme elected authority in this country?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Where there is a need for primary or secondary legislative change, Ministers will decide whether to accept the proposal for change from the agency. What will be different is that the agency will have put its advice into the public domain. If Ministers--the Secretary of State for Health and the Ministers of the devolved administrations--chose not to go down the suggested route, that would be their responsibility. I make no apologies for that.
<P>
If one wishes to use the term quangos, and to use it in a non-derogatory sense, one could say that the agency will probably be the most powerful quango in the country. We have never hidden that fact. What makes it powerful is its independence, and its ability to publish advice to Ministers and the information that it holds. The agency will have the three functions that are not currently held by the Government, one of which is monitoring and setting standards of the enforcement authorities. If there is a failure, the agency will have the power to remove that responsibility from a particular authority and transfer it to someone else or to contract it out. That will be an ultimate sanction, and I am sure that it will not be used lightly.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Cotswold will not get too concerned; he will probably get even more concerned as we progress through the Bill if that is a relevant issue. We have never made a secret of the position. While the agency can propose, advise and draft legislation, it will be up to the House and the Scottish Parliament, and to the Northern Ireland and Welsh Assemblies for secondary legislation, to decide whether to accept the agency's drafts. It will be up to Ministers to decide whether to propose legislation to the House. Ministers will have to decide and say yes or no to proposals publicly, and they will therefore be accountable for those decisions. I have no problem with saying that the agency will be fully democratically accountable. The provision will not be loose.
<P>
I know that some smile when I refer to guiding principles, but each of those principles is enshrined in different parts of the Bill in order to put parameters around the actions of the agency. The agency will not be completely free to do what it wants under any circumstances--it will not have that much power. I hope that the hon. Member for Cotswold has referred to the guiding principles set out on page 5 of the White Paper. If he does so, he will see that there will be a lot of restraints on how the agency may act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I thank the Minister for his response; he should be wary of too much criticism of reports given to the previous Government but never acted upon. When the day comes--hopefully not long now--that this Government are history, I suspect that there will be many similar reports not acted upon to be looked back on; the Jenkins report on proportional representation may be one of them. [HON. MEMBERS: ``Hear, hear.''] I am delighted to hear support from Labour Members, so the Minister should be a little wary about delving into that particular subject. He is right that the Lamming report recommended a series of changes. However, by 1992, meat and bone meal had been banned anyway. They were the key issues in respect of BSE and, as a result, the pressure was off because there were many other understandable priorities to deal with.
<P>
The Minister said that he was at one with me on the objective of having animal feeding stuffs labelled properly with their ingredients. I welcome that. I hope that he can confirm therefore that clauses 6, 7 or 8 embrace properly the labelling of animal feedstuffs. We do not have to go back over history and ask why it was not been done in the past, but at least we agree that it should be done now.
<P>
The Minister referred to the need for European labelling, which we understand and accept. As for genetic modification, however, the lack of segregation in the United States of America, particularly of soya and maize, has created serious problems. The hon. Gentleman may be a little behind the times because my information is that there is a strong recognition in America that there may be a market benefit in such segregation. The state of Iowa is looking at becoming a wholly GM-free state to capitalise on the market for GM-free animal feedstuffs. I hope that that happens; it will certainly make the labelling of products more simple.
<P>
Over the past 25 years, the animal feedstuffs industry has changed dramatically. As recently as the 1970s, almost every market town and village had its animal feed compounder. There were mills all over the place. The industry is now much smaller and rationalised, however; there are only two national feed compounders. There are still many regional ones, but not as many there used to be. In some ways, their power is much greater now as is the importance of labelling.
<P>
I accept that the Committee wants to move on but, before I withdraw the amendment, will the Minister confirm that I am interpreting his comments correctly and that the labelling of animal feedstuffs is included in the Bill?

<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes, we are satisfied that the labelling of animal feedstuffs is covered by the combination of clauses 6, 7 and 9.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> In that case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to carry out observations</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am certainly not against clause 10. I want to use this opportunity, however, to ask the Minister to explain the purpose of the observations covered by the clause. Clause 11 concerns the powers of entry for those observations but, despite having read the helpful notes on clauses, I am unclear about the purpose of such powers. They do not seem to be related directly to enforcement nor to whether an individual food producer is following the legislation or overseeing whether the environmental health officers have done their job when inspecting the premises. Will the Minister briefly explain the purpose of the powers of observation compared with the powers of monitoring enforcement under a later clause to enable us to have a constructive debate on clause 11?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I do not like the smell of the clause, and it should be suitably labelled at this stage so that when we suffer in future years as a result of this nosey parker clause, we shall have been warned about what we are being asked to consume.
<P>
If the agency is to carry out research, give advice and prepare information for the public, I understand that it must have a reasonable knowledge of what goes on on the ground. The Minister rejected my earlier amendments that proposed that we appoint to the board people with primary practical experience of food production, processing, transport and storage. He rejected quotas for such people--although ethnic quotas on the board have been provided for--but some people on the board may nevertheless have such background knowledge.
<P>
I also understand that it would be desirable for the agency to observe food processing in practice. It would be desirable for members of the agency preparing advice to observe how animals are bred, to look around a pig or chicken farm and to follow the animals through the livestock market or contracts made with processors; to look around an abattoir to observe how animals are slaughtered, and to go to a processing unit to observe how the meat is processed; and to have access to the flour mill to observe how flour is ground, how it is made into pastry and how pastry is combined with meat and made into a pie.
<P>
To do that, the Minister's staff and the agency need to observe what goes on, and that, I suspect, is the purpose of the clause. However, it is very much a big brother clause. It is bad enough now with all the officials who can invade someone's private space, company, business or home kitchen. As the clause will apply to everyone in the food preparation industry, we must assume that the tiniest producers of food, not just the big multiples, may, under clause 11, have yet another official turning up on their doorstep. I am trying not to stray, Mr. Gale, but clauses 10 and 11 are closely linked. Indeed, in some ways it is odd that they are not the other way round. Clause 11 provides the power of entry to carry out observations. Clause 10 provides that such officials shall be allowed to carry out observations, so I suppose that they must have powers of entry. I shall make the same criticism of clause 11.
<P>
It seems a first in legislation that Government officials will have a power of entry, under clause 11, not to inspect, take samples, prosecute, check the diesel, as Customs and Excise officers may on a farm or other premises, check animal health and welfare or any one of the dozens of other things checked by police officers, Customs and Excise officers, trading standards officers, court officials, environmental health officers, veterinary officers, Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals officials and all the others who may turn up on someone's doorstep and say, ``Here is my pass; I am an authorised official. I have come to inspect this, and if you are not doing it properly you may be prosecuted.'' The clause will create a new breed of official--the person who comes to observe and collect information.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I appreciate that it is difficult, but the right hon. Gentleman is beginning to stray into clause 11. As it is, we shall have some difficulty in separating clauses 10, 11 and 14, which in many respects are similar, but please try.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I shall try harder, Mr. Gale.
<P>
Having gained entry, such an official will explain that he has come not to inspect but merely to observe, as it is his duty to do so to build up his knowledge base to advise Ministers and the appropriate authorities. I would not dream of voting against the clause, because it will generate lots of votes against the Government by creating a new class of official--an inspector with a right to gain access to property to carry out observations to obtain information. Big companies will be used to that, unlike the thousands of smaller food producers and cafeterias or restaurants that such officials will be able to enter to observe food premises, businesses and commercial operations and agricultural premises. Nothing is excluded, whether animal feedstuffs or human foodstuffs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Frank Roy </B>(Motherwell and Wishaw): Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that perhaps the food scare over E. coli O157 in Scotland would not have happened if someone had been allowed to observe the relevant butcher's shop?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are moving into clause 11. It is difficult, because clause 10 deals specifically with the power to carry out observations, but clause 11 deals with powers of entry for persons carrying out observations--precisely what the hon. Gentleman referred to. Can we now try to come back to clause 10?
<P>
<H5>5.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I hoped that I was reasonably close to clause 10, Mr. Gale, but I would not dream of responding to the point and saying that what was wrong in that case was not the lack of observation, but that someone should have enforced the law.
<P>
I have no difficulties about people enforcing the law. In food safety cases it should be enforced against a lot of smaller outlets, which environmental health officers are too often afraid to go into, especially restaurants in cities. However, the power to carry out observations is a little big brotherish. We know that the agency will have strong powers of enforcement; the Minister said a few minutes ago that it will be one of the most powerful agencies in the country.
<P>
The purpose of clauses 10 and 11 is not enforcement or prosecution, but to increase the agency's knowledge base so that it knows what it is talking about when it advises Ministers. Surely it is best to increase its knowledge voluntarily. If the agency builds up any respect at all, Northern Foods and United Dairies and all other operators, large and small, will say, ``Come and see how it's done.'' The member companies of the Food and Drink Federation accounted for an £80 billion turnover even in my day, years ago. When the agency wants information, it does not need a big brother clause to say, ``I am coming to observe what you do.'' Those companies will be so desperate to show the agency how good, clean, switched-on and innovative they are that they will invite people from the agency to see their operations.
<P>
There may be another purpose in clause 10 that I have not spotted. However, I think that its purpose is to improve the agency's knowledge base to allow it to give Ministers better advice, to see potential problems in future that it may target or research and to carry out the other functions of clauses 6, 7 and 8. Surely the voluntary approach is better. Everyone in the food industry might have an inspector turning up to say, ``I am here to observe what you do,'' in addition to all the other inspectors who will come to clobber those who get things wrong. That will sour relations slightly, because people will be offended that big brother is coming to observe them.
<P>
Such observation is unnecessary. The vast majority of people in the food industry are not crooks who have to cover their tracks. They do not operate on the basis of, ``My God, we mustn't show the inspectors what's happening!'' They are proud to show off what they think is at the frontiers of modern technology and industry.
<P>
The Minister will have visited food businesses and will know that they love showing off their latest gizmos and products. If he has visited companies making food for any of the big supermarkets--Marks and Spencer, Tesco, Sainsburys--he will know that they love boasting about their wonderful new ranges, and how pure they are because they have to satisfy supermarket quality control testing, which is infinitely more ruthless than environmental health officers, Ministers or any Government inspectors.
<P>
The industry will show off what they want to do. Will the Minister consider whether the clause and clause 11 are necessary? If they are merely to collect information to increase the knowledge base, he should consider the voluntary approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I wholly agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border. The agency will have huge powers under clauses 10, 11 and 14.
<P>
Clause 10 refers to clauses 8 and 9 and will widen the already wide powers contained in the Food Safety Act 1990. It is incumbent on the Minister to explain why it is necessary to increase the already huge powers in the 1990 Act and allow agency officials to make observations on virtually anything that they like in relation to the growing, production and marketing of food.
<P>
In free countries such as ours one would normally expect a voluntary approach to take precedence, as my right hon. Friend says. Why is it necessary for the agency to have such huge powers? If anything goes wrong, the power to make observations already exists under the 1990 Act. I have a horrendous George Orwell vision of food safety police wandering around all the time, not only making a general nuisance of themselves, but making British business completely uncompetitive compared with the rest of the world.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I have different worries about food safety police wandering around enforcing the rules. However, we are not dealing with food safety police; we are dealing with food safety observers, who will wander around making observations, on which they may or may not take action.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My right hon. Friend is being far too generous. Does he not agree that those who make observations will pass on the information to the enforcement part of the agency? I do not believe for a nanosecond that a Chinese wall will exist between the two.
<P>
<B>Mr. Roy:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman concede that it will be right to pass on the information if someone thinks that doing so will improve the service?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. If any food producer were doing something that put at risk public safety, that information should be passed on. However, we live in a free country where people are innocent until proven guilty. I hope that I am wrong, but I perceive that the agency will take on huge numbers of staff, who will visit and observe premises where, by and large, people produce food perfectly safely. I am a business man--I declared an interest at the beginning of the Committee's proceedings--and I know that every time an official visits a business it costs that business money because someone has to answer the questions that the official asks. I do not like the tone of clause 10, let alone that of clauses 11 and 14, about which I shall have even more to say.
<P>
People should make observations only if there is a suspicion that something is going wrong in some part of the food chain. The presumption should always be that people are innocent until proven guilty. The Minister has already admitted that the agency will be the most powerful quango in the country. Anyone who believes in a free country and democracy must have cause to worry about the clause. We shall return time and again to the powers contained in clauses 10, 11 and 14, because they will become increasingly unacceptable.
<P>
To return to the theme that I was on before I was interrupted by my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border, the more impositions are made on business, the more it becomes uncompetitive. It would be fine if every other food safety agency in the world had the same provisions and the same requirements were made of every other country's food producers, processors and retailers. My chief worry--this has happened under this Government and, indeed, under the previous Conservative Government--is that increasing impositions will be made on British food producers, making them less and less competitive compared with their European counterparts. If British producers and processors go out of business, we shall simply end up importing more and more food that has been produced in less safe and less environmentally and animal welfare-friendly regimes, over which the agency will have little or no control. Where is the sense in that?
<P>
I have increasing worries about the agency. Each clause that we debate makes the Bill seem more and more draconian. The Minister says that the agency will be the most powerful quango in the country--it sure will--and we shall rue the day that we put this Bill through Parliament. The Minister should tell us about the powers of observation and, when we reach clauses 11 and 14, the powers of entry that he envisages the agency having. The food police, or food observers--as they might be called--will become increasingly intrusive. I cannot see why we need such a huge number of observers if there is no suspicion that something is going wrong. The hon. Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Mr. Roy) raised a good point about the acid test. Does the Minister think that the Food Standards Agency would have prevented the recent food scares, had it existed at the time?
<P>
The Minister will answer that question in his own way, but I doubt whether the agency would have prevented the BSE scare or, indeed, the red meat, listeria in cheese, E. coli, salmonella in eggs, or any of the other scares that we have had. If the Minister can guarantee that such food scares will not happen in future, there is justification for the agency's huge powers. However, if there is a suspicion, which I expect is the case, that there will still be food scares, what is the point in giving the agency so many powers?
<P>
With great fear and trepidation, I shall now listen to the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I do not criticise the hon. Member for Cotswold--
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Feel free.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No. The hon. Gentleman raised an important point that allows me to respond to him and the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean). People are surprised when they first see the powers in the Bill because they do not know the scale of the existing food surveillance or policing operation of the food chain that is carried out on their behalf by the joint food safety and standards group, MAFF and the Department of Health. I agree entirely that the voluntary approach is by far the best. However, there is not always maximum co-operation. We prefer a voluntary approach and the majority of firms co-operate. We do not want to be an Orwellian big brother, but it is not always possible to get voluntary co-operation.
<P>
None of the samples taken during observation and surveillance can be used for enforcement purposes; there is a completely different procedure for taking samples for enforcement purposes. Last year, in our food safety surveillance programme, we took 186,000 samples. That is a massive operation, involving 186,000 samples being put through the laboratories, which check for all sorts of things. Most testing is done voluntarily at the retail level.
<P>
Clause 10--I have to keep a straight face here--replaces section 25 of the Food Safety Act 1990 to a minor extent. The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border put that Act through the House. He did not offer that information when he was speaking. I have not checked up on what he said at the time; that would not be adult politics and I do not wish to dwell on the matter.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As has been said, the Bill abolishes section 25 of the Food Safety Act and the clause replaces it. The clause enables Ministers to make an order to provide for surveillance to take samples of any food or materials. The difference with that provision in the Food Safety Act is that we do not need to enact secondary legislation to do so. The whole purpose of the clause is to keep a general, monitoring oversight of the food chain. It is true that one area is not currently covered in a systematic--I almost said centralised, but that is the wrong word--way, and that is on-farm surveillance.
<P>
As I have said, the Bill sets up new functions in three areas, which is why we need the new money--education and information, the setting of local authority standards for monitoring enforcement, and on-farm surveillance. It will not be a case of Food Standards Agency police jumping over the farm gate every day or even every month, but they will have the ability to do so. In other words, our objective is essentially to ensure that there are no no-go areas of the food chain for the FSA.
<P>
Wherever the FSA perceives problems, based on its research and its policy advice and information, perhaps from abroad and certainly from the industry, because the measures will not work without the cooperation and expertise of the industry, to a greater or lesser extent it will target different parts of the food chain at different times. The clause gives us the power of observation, or, more accurately, surveillance as it would normally be termed, at any point in the food chain in order to obtain information, although not for the purpose of enforcement. If something is discovered, it can be drawn to the attention of the enforcement authorities, but samples taken for surveillance purposes cannot be used for enforcement. That is absolutely right and as it should be. The procedure for enforcement is totally different.
<P>
However, we want to retain the good will of the industry towards taking samples. As I said, 180,000 is a small number but they are subject to a huge number of checks, as was demonstrated in the information on pears that we published last week, for example. The sample size was 48 pears and we checked for 100 pesticides. Of course, we found a naughty pesticide that is not allowed on pears in this country. The number of tests in the samples is huge. For example, some 40,000 tests are done for veterinary medicines on residues on meats. That work goes on now and is not new.
<P>
The clause replaces section 25 of the Food Safety Act for the reasons that I have given, and I hope that, as hon. Members have not tabled amendments--I suspect that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health will deal with the amendments to clause 11--they will give it their good will. This is not big brother; it is not intended to be onerous on the industry and we want to enforce the measures voluntarily, which I accept is the best way. However, there are times when we do not get voluntary cooperation and that is why we need the powers to conduct surveillance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I knew that I did not recognise the clause; as a great civil libertarian, I could never have put through a clause--in all the legislation that I have put through--worded in exactly the way that the clause is worded. I have had the opportunity to check section 25 of the Food Safety Act 1990 and I think that the Minister would agree that the clause gives much wider powers. That section requires a Minister to come back to Parliament to make an order in specific cases, relating to a specific foodstuff or a specific class of food producer and its scope is much narrower. I would not dream of asking how often that order has been used in the past nine years. [Interruption.]
<P>
I am sorry, Mr. Gale, I was picking up other signals, I picked up exactly the one I expected--the order has not been used. So it is a slight exaggeration for the Minister to say that he has only copied the big brother measures of the 1990 Act. Section 25 of that Act was not by any means big brother; it was a provision for Ministers to come back to Parliament, but neither under this nor the previous Administration have they done so, presumably because ample information is received.
<P>
Unless the Minister tells me not to do so, I am tempted to table a couple of parliamentary questions. He boasted that 180,000 samples were taken in the past year, which may be a slight increase on the number of samples that were taken the year before and perhaps a marginal increase on those in the year before that. However, it is not a case of MAFF moving from 10 samples in 1990 to 180,000 in the brave new world in which we now live.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> What the right hon. Gentleman is saying is news to me. In the past two years, I have gone out of my way at every opportunity to make clear what work was going on in MAFF before May 1997. No one knew about it, because by and large no one talked about it at ministerial level. I am not making a personal criticism; all the issues were concerned with BSE, E. coli and listeria. No one highlighted food surveillance and the policing of the food chain that was undertaken by MAFF before 1997. I have gone out of my way to pay tribute to the work of those inside the Ministry and the right hon. Gentleman knows that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I do know that, and I welcome the Minister's conversion after the general election to the good work of MAFF. I am simply making the point that the wonderful number of samples taken by MAFF when monitoring the food chain did not happen suddenly on 2 May. A huge amount of monitoring was undertaken before then. If some of the Minister's colleagues had not been rubbishing previous Ministers and inadvertently sucking in MAFF and civil servants, they may have heard the protestations about the huge amount of good work that the Ministry has undertaken in the past.
<P>
The Minister has omitted to admit a little point. The power under clause 10 is considerably greater than that under section 25 of the Food Safety Act 1990. It is a wider, and 180,000 samples were taken not because the Minister used the law, not because he used the power of the previous Government under section 25 of the 1990 Act to order people to hand over them over, but because the industry co-operated voluntarily.
<P>
I take the Minister's point. Some nuggets in the industry may not co-operate as well as they should and, in those circumstances, such powers are needed. It is a pity in that case that he did not replicate the powers under section 25 of the 1990 Act whereby he could target an order on the section of the industry that was not co-operating instead of giving everyone involved a general power.
<P>
At present, MAFF can collect the tremendous amount of 180,000 food samples. I am discounting snacking, but if we assume that most people have a little breakfast, whether it be a cup of coffee and a biscuit, and a little bit of lunch and dinner, 150 million meals are eaten each day. For the Government to boast that MAFF has taken 180,000 samples a year seems small beer in comparison with that. However, there is a huge amount of checking to be done.
<P>
I hope that the Government will continue to take that voluntary route, not clause 10, to acquire information, and that the observers will continue their present contacts with the food industry and collect samples in that way. Let us assume that, on the day the Food Standards Agency is vested, the observers realise that they do not need to use the voluntary route to gain information, but can just flash their warrant cards. They could say, ``Yesterday, I looked at your food processing industry because you invited me to do so. However, today I have huge new powers under section 10 of the Act and here is my warrant card. You will have to let me in or you will have to pay a £5,000 fine.'' I hope that that approach will not be taken. It is not necessary and it would destroy relationships.
<P>
As a modus operandi to influence the independent body, I hope that the Minister will advise officials that they should continue to collect food samples and information under the present system. They should flash the warrant card and say that they have powers under section 11 only when dealing with those tiny nuggets of the industry which will not co-operate with anybody.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am trying to reassure the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border. I did not wish to be inaccurate about section 25 of the 1990 Act. These powers go beyond that. The difference is that the powers in clause 10 will enable the Food Standards Agency to take samples and carry out surveillance at an earlier part in the food chain than the previous legislation allowed. We need the agency to cover the entire food chain, which was not the case before.
<P>
To reassure those who read the report of the Committee's proceedings, clause 10 is not intended to target individual companies. The purpose of the surveillance is to take representative samples of the part of the food chain that contains the product under investigation. The surveillance is not targeted against companies; it is intended to be general and representative, as is the information produced.
<P>
The clause allows observations to be carried out earlier in the food chain--on farms, for example, looking out for pathogens. That power did not exist before, and that is the reason for the extension of these powers. Reference has been made to powers that have never been used--there is no need to draft parliamentary questions, which cost too much to answer--and I do not think that they will be.
<P>
Clause 10 expands the powers of section 25 of the Food Safety Act 1990, but only for the reasons that I have given. There is no ulterior motive behind this provision.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am tempted to say that this is not only the clause 10 stand part debate but the stand part debate on clauses 11 and 14. I am sure that right hon. and hon. Members will resist the temptation to repeat in later discussions arguments that they have already deployed.

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 26 in page 5, line 1, after `The', insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Chairman or Deputy Chairman of the'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 27, in page 5, line 1, after `individual', insert `with relevant qualifications'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am conscious that we may be interrupted in a moment by a Division in the House. The amendments in this group, and many in the subsequent groups, have been tabled specifically to address the sort of concerns that my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border and my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold have expressed in their remarks on clause 10.
<P>
I am quite relieved that when the Food Safety Act 1990 passed through the House, I was occupying a position which, until, about a minute ago, was occupied by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden). I therefore enjoyed the Trappism that goes with being a Parliamentary Private Secretary, so the Minister cannot quote back to me anything that I may have said on that piece of legislation. However, I well remember its passage through the House.
<P>
My right hon. Friend referred several times to the observer flashing his warrant card. One of our concerns is that the provisions place no requirement on him to do that. I shall be coming back to that point when we debate a later group of amendments.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 refer to the authorisation of those carrying out observations, and their qualifications. Amendment No. 26 requires that the chairman and the deputy chairman of the agency should make the authorisation, while amendment No. 27 requires that the person carrying out the observation should be appropriately qualified. My right hon. Friend referred to the Food and Drink Federation. I should make it clear that the federation has written in support of the amendments, particularly amendment No. 27.
<P>
I think that the Minister accepted in his reply to the debate on clause 10 that any observation--that is, anybody attending business premises for the purpose of observation--carries with it an imposition on the business. It creates a burden for the business. The Minister--who has already apologised for being about to walk out on me--seemed to accept that point. Our objective here, and throughout the Bill, is to try to minimise such an imposition. If the voluntary approach is successful, so much the better. Although we accept that it may be right for specific people to be authorised to enter premises at a reasonable hour, a point to which the Minister referred, we must ensure that their rights are properly constrained.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am sorry that the Minister of State has had to leave the Room, because I am about to quote him. On Second Reading, he clearly stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the agency will be a non-ministerial department, giving it the same legal status as Customs and Excise.''--[Official Report, 21 June 1999; Vol. 333, c.831.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That statement has tempted me to investigate the precise powers of Customs and Excise in respect of entry into premises. Subsection (3)(a) of the clause contains the word ``enter'', as opposed to ``visit'', which would suggest to me a more benign approach. The word ``enter'' carries with it the possibility of forced entry or at least legally required entry.
<P>
The fact is that the Customs and Excise system is littered with checks and balances to protect both sides of a dispute. The clause contains no provision dealing with such checks and balances or with protection. It appears to give to the agency's staff powers dramatically in excess of those provided to Customs and Excise officers, which seems a perverse balance. As I said, the Government have stressed that the agency is analogous to Customs and Excise, yet they have not followed the best practice of that organisation, which has been in business for hundreds of years. It would have been helpful if the Government had followed its procedures a little more clearly.
<P>
The Opposition want a named senior member of the agency to authorise entry into premises, as set out in subsection (3). Customs and Excise has to seek permission from its regional director or above to authorise such entry. As the Government have no plans to establish the Food Standards Agency along the same regional lines, the amendment would set the authorisation at the level of the chairman or deputy chairman. The exceptional circumstances of granting such authority should be recognised by requiring a senior level of clearance.
<P>
The clause refers to the agency's ability to send any individual to enter premises under any circumstances and at any reasonable hour, a provision to which we shall return later. The Opposition think that that definition is very wide, and we hope that the Government will tighten it up. Amendment No. 27, therefore, seeks to ensure that the individual authorised to enter the premises will have relevant qualifications.
<P>
The explanatory notes, to which hon. Members have already referred, suggest that the term ``any individual'' could include contractors such as university research teams. Such contractors may not have experience of carrying out observations involved, and it is important that they should at least be accompanied by someone who has. Such a requirement would ensure proper observation according to the needs of the agency and in terms of minimising the impact on the business being observed.
<P>
If the investigators know that they have the authorisation of the highest levels of their organisation and that the chairman and deputy chairman are involved, their confidence and ability to do the job properly are bound to improve. A requirement for such authorisation would also work conversely, as the chairman and deputy chairman would be better informed about what is done in their names. If there is a concern that carries through the sill, it is that it contains the potential for individuals of the agency to take the law into their own hands. It does not contain enough checks and balances on the actions of individuals intended to ensure that they do not go about their duties in an aggressive or draconian fashion.
<P>
We are all familiar with the odd environmental health officer who seems to believe that he has any piece of legislation that he wishes to cite behind him, and who goes into small businesses and sometimes goes so far as to close them down. There is little opportunity for such a business to appeal, and we shall return to that later. There is concern that individuals will have an opportunity under the clause--this point was made on an earlier clause--to be extremely difficult and to have a major deleterious effect on a business, even though his only purpose for visiting it is to observe or to carry out surveillance, which is the phrase that the Minister used. We want several constraints to be put upon such activities.
<P>
Under amendments Nos. 26 and 27, individuals should carry senior level authority and be properly qualified. It presently appears that anybody whom the agency decides is suitable could go into a business, regardless of his understanding of food processing and manufacture, farming or minimising his impact on a business. At the end of the day, businesses are trying to produce things as cost-effectively as possible. Every inspector, however benign his purpose, is an additional problem, an additional person to worry about and an additional issue for the proprietor or management to address.
<P>
The Minister of State dealt with clause 10, but I hope that the Minister for Public Health, who will deal with the amendments, understands what we are trying to achieve. The purpose of clause 11 may be observation and surveillance, rather than enforcement. If so, it should be carried out in a much more benign way than the clause currently allows. We want more constraints to be put on such activity. That is the purpose of the two amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I support the general thrust of my hon. Friend's amendments, although, in some ways, they do not go far enough. Let me explain.
<P>
The powers in clause 11 remind me of powers that I and my right hon. Friend the then Home Secretary--it was a Home Office matter--put in a Bill to allow the police and security agencies to observe those who might be engaged in serious criminal activity, to tap their phones and to intercept their mail. The arguments at the time concerned the rank of the person who should authorise that intrusive surveillance. The Opposition were not willing to settle for a senior figure such as a chief constable authorising such activities, and there had to be a judge as well, to make sure that intrusions into people's privacy were properly vetted by someone who was regarded as independent.
<P>
I may be straying out of order, but the analogy is apt. A chief constable on his own is not trusted to authorise intrusive surveillance and the watching of people whom we suspect are engaged in drug dealing, paedophilia or terrorism; we must get someone even greater.
<P>
<H5>6.8 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>6.23 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I was contrasting the draconian powers that observers have under clause 11 with the powers that chief officers of police have when they suspect that someone may be perpetrating an offence. I shall give an example. Perhaps I should have declared this interest earlier, Mr. Gale, but I am England's champion producer of chutney. That is not in terms of the quantity produced--I make only about 600 jars a year. It is a special political chutney for giving away to friends and acquaintances. Nevertheless, I am its foremost producer and its quality is second to none.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Public Health (Ms Tessa Jowell):</B> May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he has ever won a prize for his chutney? I am the proud owner of a first prize from the Women's Institute.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> As the hon. Lady will appreciate, the quality of the ingredients is absolutely essential, and I have won first prize for my onions, beetroot and carrots at the local village show. That is essential background information. So that I did not dominate the prizegiving, I made other entries in the name of my dog, and he won first prize. [Laughter.]
<P>
Jars of the product, which is appropriately named Old Mac's chutney, were recently sold for charitable purposes at a local function, raising £150 for the local village hall. If the local police thought for a moment that I was money-laundering the proceeds or involved in some illegal activity, in order to observe me and carry out covert surveillance under the terms of the legislation that I took through the House a few years ago, they would have to apply to the chief constable for a warrant to tap my telephone or observe me, and the chief constable would be subject to the scrutiny of a High Court judge.
<P>
However, if the agency decided to take food samples to discover whether I had Alar on my apples, Botrytis, on my plums or onion worm in my onions, it would not have to undergo such procedures, because clause 10 will give it power to conduct food surveillance operations, and clause 11 will give it power of entry--with no questions asked or other scrutiny.
<P>
Seriously, I accept that enforcement officers must have powers of entry tantamount to those of Customs and Excise. I do not accept that officers who are present for observation purposes should have such draconian powers of entry. Even if I accepted that certain people employed by the state needed for perfectly valid reasons to take samples--in order to collect sufficient information about how food is produced, maintained and stored, to carry out research, and so on, but not for enforcement purposes--and even if I accepted that they should have the right to enter premises to observe, I would still say that they should be officers of the state. What sticks in my craw about the clause, and the reason why I support the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, although they do not go far enough, is that the clause gives authority to any individual, whether an employee of the state or otherwise.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Is the right hon. Gentleman suggesting that such enforcement and observation functions should never be carried out by the private sector, but always by an officer of the state? If so, I of course agree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> It is perfectly legitimate for private individuals to carry out observation, if that is by invitation or in a voluntary system. It is not right for private individuals, contracted employees or some bearded wonder from Essex or any other university--I know that I will get in trouble for that remark, and I apologise--to have powers of entry. A person who is not an officer of the agency, whether a private enterprise contractor, a researcher from Essex university or a don of food safety science from Oxford or Cambridge should not have the draconian powers of entry that the clause provides. Someone who obstructs such a person can be liable for a £5,000 fine--I think that that is level 5 on the standard scale.
<P>
The Government cannot have it both ways. If they say that it is legitimate for officers of the agency to observe--the Minister gave me certain assurances in respect of clause 10--I will reluctantly buy that. However, in that case the Government will give someone a warrant card that implies, ``If you obstruct me in using this warrant card, you can be done for £5,000 for barring me. If you do not co-operate, you can be done. If you do not show me your records, you can be done. If you do not tell me what is going on, you can be done''. That person will not be a police officer, a Customs and Excise officer or an officer of the State Veterinary Service, but someone contracted from a university, college or some other operation whom the agency has asked to collect the information. That is a step too far. If the Government intend to go down the route of giving individuals a power of entry to observe, not merely to enforce, they should give them the same powers, duties and responsibilities as civil servant--the same ethos of integrity, honesty and incorruptibility--and bind them by the Official Secrets Act 1911. I would trust officers of the State Veterinary Service, the Food Standards Agency, MAFF or the Department of Health--that is, civil servants--to collect the information, and not to exceed their powers. I know that they would not reveal the information. If I was forced to open my door to someone authorised by the agency and discovered that that person was a university researcher or even a local GP, I would not trust them or co-operate with their collection of information. I know that they would not feel bound by the same ethos of integrity as civil servants exercising that same role. If the Government insist that individuals,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``whether a member of its staff or otherwise.''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it is frightening that such a person might not be a member of staff--are to have those powers, they must be authorised by the chairman or deputy chairman, as my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire suggested.
<P>
The chairman or deputy chairman's having to take the rap and authorise individuals is the only way to have control. They will make dashed sure that those individuals are not Herberts who have wandered in off the street and got a contract to go round doing surveillance. They will not be staff of a big private enterprise firm unless that firm is absolutely legitimate, nor will they be random researchers from whatever university.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government cannot subcontract their liability to the public for the protection of civil liberties. They can contract out the collection or processing of information, but they cannot give to unnamed individuals the draconian rights of entry provided by the clause.
<P>
When the Government go down the route of private prison escorts, there is not just one little clause such as this in the relevant Bill. There are 20 or 30 clauses circumscribing the powers, rights and duties of individuals thereby employed, and the inspection regime. If the Government are to build in powers for individuals who are not civil servants to enter food premises and to observe, they must build in protections such as my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire suggested. I would prefer the Government to go further by deleting the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``whether a member of its staff or otherwise''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and by changing the reference in the clause from ``any individual'' to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an officer of the agency''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> I am grateful for the Committee's tolerance of the fact that my hon. Friend the Minister of State and I are working something of a shift system today.
<P>
I have listened carefully to the speeches of the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire and the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border. I shall try to set out the reasons for including such powers. As my hon. Friend the Minister of State has already noted, the powers are intended to deal with a relatively small proportion of possible cases in which there is no co-operation from industry. In the overwhelming majority of cases, there will be co-operation because everyone will recognise that that is in their interest. Normally, powers are not necessary to get a reliable snapshot of a food safety or standards issue, or of other problems.
<P>
For a variety of reasons, it is not always possible to obtain co-operation. It may be that businesses are naturally suspicious or worried about the impact of investigation on them. There may be a more sinister reason, and the powers in the clause are intended to address problems arising from such cases. Such businesses are at the less reputable end of the business and they may wish to conceal a problem.
<P>
The powers are also intended to allow the agency to conduct observations on farms, a role not covered by the Food Safety Act 1990. Many past problems have had their source on farms, possibly because of ignorance on the part of farmers. Surveys of mammalian meat and bone-meal, for example, might have saved some of the enormous problems that ensued from the lack of adequate surveillance.
<P>
It is important also to note the general requirement of administrative law for the agency to act both reasonably and proportionately. Indeed, those principles are clearly set out in the Bill as a test against which the agency's actions must be judged.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Minister just said that, if these powers had been in existence before, the inspection of farms for meat and bonemeal might have prevented some of the BSE crisis. Does she have any information showing that at any time, someone sought to look at what was happening on a farm but was refused co-operation by the farmer? Unless she can provide that evidence, her statement just now was far too cavalier in suggesting that the problem could have been sorted out more easily.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> I certainly did not intend to be cavalier, but we know that the failure to apply proper surveillance to animal feed appears to have given rise--certainly in part--to the BSE epidemic. The problem is, I am advised, that the general powers do not exist to carry out these observations on farms.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> In her latest statement, the right hon. Lady is skirting more carefully round the BSE issue than in her earlier statement.
<P>
While the enforcement of animal feed controls may be a moot point for the Philips inquiry to discuss--I shall not step into that issue just now, as it is likely to be discussed at the inquiry--enforcement is quite a different matter from observation. Nothing in any of the BSE evidence that I have seen--I have seen too much of it--suggests that observations of the type prescribed by clauses 10 and 11 would have made the slightest difference. Enforcement, however, may be another matter.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his caution. We must be careful not to cover ground that will be covered by the Philips inquiry. Perhaps the Minister would bear that in mind in her continuing remarks.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> I certainly accept your guidance on that, Mr. Gale. Clearly, we must establish a distinction between enforcement and observations.
<P>
I entirely accept Opposition Members' concerns about the risk of abuse of the power, but it will be essential that where the power is applied, it is done in the spirit in which it is intended--to deal with the small number of cases in which co-operation is not forthcoming.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I would welcome some clarification of whether clause 11's phrasing allows for covert observation. I was slightly alarmed by the similarities mentioned by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border. Am I right to assume that the observed organisation would always be informed of such observations?
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> The hon. Gentleman has raised an extremely important point. My understanding is that they would not be covert observations, but that when an observation was taking place, those who were being observed would be aware that that exercise was being carried out.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that reassurance, but do we need to take further advice about whether the Bill gives that assurance? Taking copies of computerised information is not a great step from taking logs of telephone calls. It will reassure those who believe in civil liberties to know that the operation will always be declared and never covert.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that it will not be covert. Indeed, the forward programme for surveillance will normally be published in advance, so the industry will be aware of any planned action.
<P>
Amendment No. 26 would require the chairman or the deputy chairman personally to sign authorisations to allow officers to exercise powers of entry to carry out observations. The agency will be a body corporate, and giving specific powers to the chairman and deputy chairman would go against that. As civil servants, the agency's staff will be accountable and must act consistently with the agency's guiding principles. Adherence to the agency's guiding principles will apply to everyone who acts in its name. To function effectively, it must be able to delegate powers to sub-committees, individual members and, in some cases, senior staff.
<P>
Amendment No. 27 would limit the agency's authority to enter premises and take samples as part of its surveillance activities to those ``with relevant qualifications''. I accept the principle behind the amendment. We would certainly expect observations to be conducted by people who are suitably qualified. The agency will be expected to follow general protocols governing the award of research projects and contracts, but it would be unnecessarily prescriptive to place in primary legislation what is suggested in the amendment. It could lead to disputes about what qualifications were relevant in particular cases, which could prevent the agency from doing its job properly. Stipulating it in the Bill could also give rise to vexatious challenges being made to the use of the entry power. That could pass final determination to the courts, which are not well placed to determine such matters.
<P>
I accept the cautionary note sounded by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border and the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire. However, the agency's modus operandi requires it to act in a way that is proportionate and that takes due account of risk. That principle would apply also to carrying out observations.
<P>
I finish with a word of reassurance for the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border, who fears that his chutney-making may be interfered with. The clause does not apply to domestic premises.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I have no fear for my chutney or the inspectors. I still have a shotgun licence, so I can continue my chutney-making until the very end.
<P>
We should worry for our liberties when a Minister says that of course the clause is phrased in very broad general terms, but that it is intended to be used only in principle and targeted against the tiny minority of law breakers or, in this case, recalcitrant producers.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> With great respect, that was not what I said. I made it clear that the agency needed the powers to allow observations in order to deal with, admittedly, a small number of intransigent producers at any point in the food chain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> That is a slight revision of what I said the Minister said, but it still does not change the point. In order to deal with a tiny number of recalcitrant producers who do not allow officers to collect food surveillance samples, there is a general power, including a draconian power of entry. If we were dealing with a freedom Bill or a criminal justice Bill in the Chamber, dozens of colleagues on all sides would crucify a Minister who said, ``Well of course we are giving the police huge powers of entry, but they will be used against a few people only, so we don't need all the other safety nets built in.'' There are no safety nets in this Bill, but there are huge powers of entry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Todd </B>(South Derbyshire): There is a safety net, otherwise I should have had a lot of sympathy with what the right hon. Gentleman is saying. Clause 23(2), which I do not wish to debate now, covers the exercise of powers on all aspects of the Bill. It enshrines the principle of proportionality and analysis of risk, which I should have thought would reassure the right hon. Gentleman. That applies to this clause, as much as to any other part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> With respect, clause 23 does not act as a safety net. Of course proportionality is important, but clause 23 is not designed to control the taking of samples when officers decide to use enforcement powers, but is about the general functions of the agency in concluding whether a foodstuff should be banned or is unsafe. The principle is built in because, understandably, the Government do not want every foodstuff in the country outlawed--there is always a little risk, no matter how small. Risk is built into the concept of proportionality, so that the Government do not have to ban every foodstuff.
<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> I refer the right hon. Gentleman to the first line of clause 23(2) which states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Agency, in considering whether or not to exercise any power''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Surely that covers the concern that the right hon. Gentleman is addressing. It is not restricted to one aspect, but ``any power'', including the one that we are discussing now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Of course it covers any power, but it is still not a safety net in dealing with the powers of entry, which any person may be given by the agency in order to observe, take samples, or check computer and business records. If there is to be a limitation on that power, it should be built into clause 11 or other clauses dealing with the powers of entry, right of appeal and a warranting system, or it should be targeted at the recalcitrant minority. The provision should be a repetition of section 25 of the Food Safety Act 1990, saying that in certain circumstances, the Minister can be empowered to target sections of the food industry or individuals who, after say three warnings, have refused to co-operate. Clause 23 does not limit the powers in clause 11.
<P>
I worry when Ministers say, ``Trust us. We need the general power to deal with the minority. Of course it will be used sympathetically in the spirit of the Act.'' That may be remembered in Committee for a few minutes tonight, but it may not be remembered in two years' time when someone from a university is given a contract to collect food data, samples and other production information, or to check records starts to exercise his or her authority under the general powers of entry. That is quite severe.
<P>
I would advise my friends in the police force to get a contract to carry out food surveillance with MAFF or the FSA if they want to check businesses for money-laundering activities. It is very difficult for the police to get a warrant to check computer operations relating to mainline crime such as drug running, terrorism or armed robbery.
<P>
However, should the police get a contract with MAFF or the FSA, they would not have to go through all that palaver to get access to find out whether someone was engaged in such activity. They would be able to get into a food business, check its accounts and book and take all its records, without the hassle of having to obtain warrants and records, which are needed to keep the High Court judges happy.
<P>
That may not apply to every business. However, it would at least be convenient for the police, should they wish to inspect anyone in the food business who may be engaged in criminal activity.
<P>
I shall not labour my point, as there are more important matters relating to the clause that we ought to debate. However, I am anxious about the Minister's response, which is equivalent to saying, ``Trust us. The clause is very wide, giving incredible powers to anyone the agency may authorise. Don't worry though: it will be targeted only at the recalcitrant minority.''
<P>
However, there may be people on the street with a warrant card and power of entry who do not share that view. Their perception of the troublesome minority may, in fact, pertain to the innocent majority, who are willing to co-operate but suddenly find their books and paperwork being examined by an observer who is not a civil servant who has signed the Official Secrets Act and who cannot therefore be trusted.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My right hon. Friend has made a number of extremely valid points about the inadequacy of the Minister's response.
<P>
Speaking about amendment No. 27, the Minister assured us that there was no question of people not being properly qualified. However, she went on to say that it was not acceptable to put that in the Bill. That is an odd contradiction.
<P>
The Minister missed a crucial point in relation to the issue of authorisation raised by amendment No. 26. As my right hon. Friend said, once such powers are included in the Bill, there is absolutely no constraint on their use. It is all very well saying that everything will be done mainly on a co-operative basis, and that provision needs to be made for the small minority, which--I think she said--was intransigent or recalcitrant, but who will ensure that that happens? Who will ensure that such powers are not used to conduct every single observation. We wish to instil a degree of authorisation from a high level of the agency. Should the Minister feel that the chairman and deputy chairman are the wrong people to make such authorisation, she could suggest alternatives, such as the chief executive.
<P>
The Minister said that the amendment is inappropriate because the FSA is a body corporate. However, earlier I mentioned Customs and Excise requiring the authority of very senior officials. My right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border referred to the authority required by the police. The Minister is proposing a power for the FSA far in excess of that possessed by the police and Customs and Excise, two of this country's most important law-enforcement agencies. She is proposing that a certain level of the agency need not possess any authorisation at all. That is not appropriate.
<P>
The Minister misses the point that the powers are excessive. For example, clause 11(3)(a) provides power to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``enter any premises at a reasonable hour''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Customs and Excise must be accompanied by the police, should they wish to enter premises against the owner's wishes. The Bill makes no suggestion that the police should accompany FSA inspectors. Clause 11 goes far beyond what is reasonably acceptable for observation and surveillance.
<P>
I am sorry that the Minister has failed to answer the questions; indeed, many of her points worry me even more than the Bill. I therefore have no intention of withdrawing the amendment.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we move on, I have deliberately allowed a fairly wide debate on this first group of amendments as it seemed appropriate. I cannot, of course, bind Mr. Hood who will be chairing the Committee on Thursday, but he will no doubt read the debate and he may well consider that a stand part debate has already been held.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.--[Mr. Betts.]
<P>
Adjourned accordingly at four minutes to Seven o'clock till Thursday 8 July at Nine o'clock.
