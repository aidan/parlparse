always a pleasure to see you. As you know, the Government are committed
to improving the higher education funding system to make it more
sustainable and more affordable for the taxpayer. Do you think that the
clause in the Bill, taken together with the wider range of changes,
would achieve
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000009">&#160;</a>

Ebdon:</strong>
                           </em> It is clear that there is a substantial
improvement in the arrangements for part-time students, which is
something that the universities very much welcome.
In this particular Bill, important powers are given to the Secretary of
State over the setting of interest rates on the repayments for
students. There must be some concern that the Secretary of State now
has considerable powers for the setting of interest rates that
previously would have been subject to parliamentary scrutiny. According
to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills model, students
will borrow, on average, £7,500 a year to pay for their
education. In addition to that, they will take out a maintenance loan,
which, the Secretary of State says, will become subject to interest at
the rate of RPI plus 3% during the time a student is studying. That
means that a student taking a £7,500 fee loan and an average
maintenance loan would have debts of some £40,474 at the end of
their period of study. Obviously, if the fees were set at
£9,000, the figure would be higher. That is substantially
influenced of course by the rate of interest on that loan. Parliament
might want to consider whether it wants to retain the right to
scrutinise the rate of interest as it makes such a significant
difference to the overall student debt. One must be concerned that the
student debt might well put off students from poorer homes. The debt
that I am talking about will accrue to all students whether or not they
come from a disadvantaged
home.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000010">&#160;</a>

Smith:</strong>
                           </em> Universities UK very much echoes Les’s
concerns. We are worried about the interest rate while a student is
studying. We are concerned that there must be some parliamentary
scrutiny over the amount charged during the repayment of the loan. I
would like to make it clear that our No.1 concern is the long-term
sustainability of the model. There is a myth that the Government have
cut funding to higher education. They have by the accounting rules, but
if you actually look at the data, £3 billion is taken out of
HEFCE by 2013-14, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 124<a class="bkMark" name="Column124">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and an additional £6.6 billion of payments are paid out in
student loans. Therefore, the resource accounting and budgeting charge
on those student loans—31% is the estimate—becomes of
critical importance, as do the repayment rates.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000011">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The current
estimate is that only 30% of students will repay the full amount and
70% will not. UUK is concerned to ensure that we do
not return to the situation that the sector was in during 2008-09,
where overrun costs on student loans came straight off the funding to
universities. Getting this right is incredibly important. The link
between the cost of student loans and the RAB charge, and the increase
in student grants from £1.6 billion to £2.2 billion a
year, involves a lot of additional funding. If those calculations and
the assessments of what people earn are wrong, that will throw the
calculations into question down the line. UUK’s major concern is
about the financial sustainability of the whole
package.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000012">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will pick up on that point. Before I do, on
Les’s point, would it be fair to say that you argue that the
part-time provisions you described are a critical means of broadening
access because part-time learners are typically drawn from a different
cohort? Steve, is sustainability to some degree about repayment rates
and the degree of repayment? In making the system as progressive as we
have, in line with Lord Browne’s criticism of the existing
model, do you argue that we have risked
sustainability?<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000013">&#160;</a>

                           </em> It is interesting. First, it is incredibly
important to welcome what was done for part-time students. That was a
major progressive move. Secondly, as Les has said, things such as the
threshold from 15 to 21 and the repayment rate at 9% mean that someone
who graduates in 2015 will pay a lower percentage of their total
income. I graduated in 1976—I had to look this up because I did
not know what the tax rate was. It is interesting. The base tax rate in
1976 was 35p in the pound. I paid 27p in the pound of my total first
year income. Even with these changes, that goes to 18% for someone on
the same relative salary today. There are issues there.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000014">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I stressed
that point because I want to ensure that the analysis is done
correctly. As president of UUK, I have had to deal with cuts before the
current round under this Government. That was not because the
Government decided to cut spending, but because of cost overruns.
Remember how the BIS budget works. The amount left for HEFCE is the
resultant, after the demand side of student support has been accounted
for.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000015">&#160;</a>

entirely that the proposals aim to make the sector more sustainable. We
have to work together to ensure that we do not damage the UK’s
brand. The shock among our competitors is that although they are having
fun with the “cuts” to UK higher education, Government
estimates say that there will be 10% more funding at the end of the
period. I understand that but I am concerned that we get the numbers
right and ensure that unforeseen consequences of assumptions about
interest rates do not lead to a repeat of the problem that led to the
university sector having £400 million cuts in the past two
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000016">&#160;</a>

is identical whether you set a fee at £6,000, £7,000,
£8,000 or £9,000. The only difference is how long one
repays for. To the student, therefore, the repayment rate is not the
issue. And, of course, the 30-year drop dead date on the debt is of
importance.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000022">&#160;</a>

past, through Government the funding for university subjects came from
an arm’s length body. The abolition of the TDA means that there
will be direct departmental funding. That raises concerns due to the
temptation to make some kind of a political interference with

know from their White Paper that the Government aims to switch a good
deal more teacher training from universities to schools. Yet the
evidence from Ofsted, which inspects all initial teacher training, is
that the quality of the provision in universities is superior to that
in schools. There is a marked difference in quality ratings—I
know that Professor Smith has the figures in front of him. Universities
make a very significant contribution to teacher training in showing
that teaching is underpinned by good skills—much of the initial
training takes place in schools whether it is based in universities or
schools—but, equally, in ensuring that it is a knowledge-based
profession. Teacher training needs to be sustained as something that
involves knowledge as well as skills. As the Ofsted reports show,
universities have an excellent track record in training teachers for
our
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000026">&#160;</a>

the key piece of evidence is that Ofsted’s 2009–10 report
rates 47% of the HEI-led training as outstanding. School-centred is at
23%. So HEI provision is stronger. We would worry that any follow up to
the TDA which did not have a stakeholder board might end up choosing on

honourable Member knows, we are among the top 10 largest providers of
initial teacher training in this country, and the largest provider of
PE teachers. Our allocation of places—our so-called
quota—has been cut by 50% this year. The larger providers have
been cut more than the smaller providers. That pattern will reduce the
numbers of centres of excellence in this country, either for physical
education or for other subject areas, if it is repeated. It damages our
ability to remain as a centre of excellence and it damages our ability
to engage in a number of other things, such as our work through the
school sports partnerships and the amount of volunteering our students
do in schools, which enhances the work that goes on in schools.

or do not make on access for children who otherwise would never get a

implications for other universities that may implement such penalties

university such as mine. Some 70% of the students at the university of
Bedfordshire qualify for a full grant—they have residual family
incomes of less than £25,000. Some 1,000 students join us every
year with a residual family income of zero, i.e. they come from
benefits. Some 43% are 24 years old or older when they join us. Much of
the debate seems to assume that students come straight from school into
university, but that is not true. Any measure that requires a
university to give a fixed amount of money to students from those
particular income groups is particularly damaging and costly to those
universities that have an excellent track record in recruiting students
from access backgrounds. That is a concern. If there is not such a
requirement, that risks the other problem, of students going to other
excellent universities which do not have such good track records in
access—I could point just up the road to Cambridge—but
which have a lot more money available to spend on their access
students. That is a problem for

Smith, the income tax you were paying in 1976. Of course, you would
have been paying VAT at 8% and been able to claim the dole in the
vacations, so it was slightly different in those days. Professor Ebdon
said that an average student would owe £40,474 at the end under
this system. On top of that, the interest over the course of their
repayment would have to be calculated as well. Professor Smith, in
taking your decision to charge £9,000 at Exeter, have you
calculated the total amount a student would have to pay back for
attending Exeter, if they paid their loans back in full, on the
assumption of a moderate rate of interest of 2.5% a

be able to put into fee waivers and bursaries, which is substantial.
Then we looked at the issue of what you have to earn to pay back the
total fee. Our estimate is that you have to earn some £50,000 a
year to pay back the total fee. It links back to my first set of
answers. My concern is that the assessment of the cost is based on an
assumption of the resource accounting and budgeting charge remaining
the same. As someone who has had to deal with the consequences of that
being underestimated, that is an incredibly important point. Why would
a RAB charge be the same at £3,290 as it is at £9,000? To
answer your question directly, our data show us that only about 30% of
Exeter students will pay back anything like the total amount of the

there are two ways of paying up front. One, the student comes with his
or her cheque and is outside the student loan system, which relates to
the point about widening participation, and also to who can pay that.
The other issue, which is the concern for universities, is that they
might offer off-quota places on a needs-blind basis, meaning that they
would have to take out the loans from the banks to advance
the money to the student. The rate of interest the bank would charge

you need to look at what happens at 16. At 16, some 52% of students do
not get five GCSEs at A to C, including maths and English. If you take
A-level points, your probability of going to university is within
roughly 1 percentage point for every A-level combination. The key issue
in the UK is that there are 360,000 kids every year who do not get five
GCSEs at  A to C. While you are absolutely right that we have
to look at those who apply to university, the core issue is those who
are filtered out at

Smith:</strong>
                           </em> First, we do not assume that every devolved
Administration will follow the England model. We think that the current
situation leads to some complex movements of students, for example from
Wales to England and England to Wales, and especially in the Scotland
and Northern Ireland situations. In Scotland it is particularly acute.
The complication is, if English universities set a fee level that
brings in additional resources to them, what does that do to the
long-term health of the other Administrations’ universities
ability to compete? There is an issue, three or four years down the
line, when fees have been established in England, as to what that does
to the income streams for those universities. That is the biggest
problem. The other complication is EU law, whereby an EU student can go
to Scotland and pay the same as a Scottish student. An English student,
however, has to pay up front. There are some complicated issues around
student movement, but the bigger issue is the strength of those
university
systems.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000060">&#160;</a>

are supported by the Northern Ireland Assembly to the tune of
£6,000, or something approaching that, for students at colleges
in Northern Ireland, there will be pressure on the Northern Ireland
Assembly to say that it will only be to that same rate that they would
support student fees anywhere. What impact will that have on student
mobility, if that
happens?<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000061">&#160;</a>

Northern Ireland to the grant to the two institutions. It is the
trade-off between 70% cuts in England, but increased fees. It is the
net figure. If an Administration limits the amount they are prepared to
pay in fees elsewhere, that raises an issue for student mobility,

                           </em> There has been significant progress over the
past four or five years on the learner voice agenda and the seriousness
that is attached to it in institutions. College managers are seeing it
as integral to their quality improvement processes, and there is a wide
recognition across the sector that it is the views of those in the
classroom and in the workshops that make the most difference in
improving the provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000069">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If you go
into City College Norwich, for example, the principal there holds
student views in high regard and invests highly in an effective student
union, because he believes that students should be empowered to lead
the student voice and make those views heard on college committees and
so forth. There are wide-ranging examples, from Norwich down to
Cornwall college, which has a particularly difficult set-up because it
is multi-site. Cornwall is the best at doing a multi-site, while City
College Norwich is the best at its particular type of FE college.
Obviously, there are other providers that have their own best practice
as well. The clause that removes the duty for governing bodies to
consult with learners and employers

                           </em> We have significant concerns about elements
of the Bill, particularly the extension of stop and search powers in
FE. What is of particular concern is the ability of teachers to search
pupils and students for a range of items that have been weirdly
categorised together. Your iPod will be in the same category as a
weapon, which strikes me as odd. It strikes me as odd as well that
teachers are being given extraordinary powers to be able to stop and
search students, more so than police. There are actually more
safeguards for both the searcher and the searchee if a person is being
searched by a police officer than by a teacher. That is dangerous. That
is difficult. Under the Bill, teacher anonymity powers include only
schoolteachers. In a post-16 environment, that would include school
sixth forms. I can’t imagine a scenario in the real world where
such powers would be utilised in further education institutions. They
would just create too much risk, not just for teacher safety, but
because the teacher anonymity powers do not extend to FE. Teachers
would be put at too high a risk, and they would not engage in
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000076">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
view is that, if you suspect that someone in the classroom or in the
college is carrying a weapon or something dangerous, you call in the
professionals. There are many colleges out there that have on-site
campus security. They have that because they recognise that there is a
risk, so they take those precautions like good college management
should. It is not right to put teachers in that position, which is why
I have significant concerns about that particular element of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000077">&#160;</a>

not necessarily mean impartial. We need to be much more explicit about
that. I also think that, for far too long, we have used the issue of

of course, work with the Government to make that happen. There also
needs to be an emphasis on a national service providing careers advice
and guidance for young people, rather than something that differs
regionally. With the rise in the participation age in 2013 and 2015,
parents also need much more access to independent information, advice
and guidance, because the options open to young people from the age of
16 will be far more vast than they ever have been. As I have found with
my members, informal advice and guidance has equal, if not more, impact

schools. For example, according to my members, even primary and
secondary schools advise that you have to go to university and get a
degree in order to make a success of your life and earn lots of money.
We now know that that is not true. Factual evidence shows that
university graduate lifetime earnings are £105,000, which is the
same for someone with a level 3 apprenticeship. Therefore, we need to
stop deluding young people into a specific given route which may have
existed 10, 20 or 30 years ago but no longer
does.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000089">&#160;</a>

usually do not regret going to university and doing their
course—university has a raft of benefits in terms of personal
development, alongside the actual qualification—I do hear a lot
from students wishing that, for example, they had been told about level
3 apprenticeships and how much it could have enabled them to earn, or
been made aware of opportunities to work and study part time when they
were making their choices at 14, 16  and

of students who clearly are disappointed that, having studied for a
degree, they are not able to realise its potential through employment.
We have to understand that in order for the UK to prosper in the
future, we need to ensure that there are no fracture lines between
education and employers. One of the things that we are trying to create
is diverse opportunities for a range of students who can benefit from
different sorts of education. If we are really a knowledge economy, we
have a real problem in front of us. What I am hearing all the way
through the debates and discussions is that we are looking for fracture
lines all the time, looking at ways in which we can differentiate or
move one group in a particular direction as opposed to another. We have
to start joining some of this up.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000095">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Fundamentally,
that means going back and saying, “What routes might be of
benefit to a range of students with different needs?” I would
include apprenticeships, universities and further and higher education
working better together to create those opportunities, but doing that
in partnership with employers. There is little point in going forward
if, at the end of an academic or vocational programme, there are no
jobs. We have to get to grips with how we join things us, how we get
employers engaged early and how we give the right career
advice.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When students
at 16 begin to think through how they stream their education, many of
them are not given good advice. Some of them find it difficult to
engage with the advice because of their maturity or their support. If
students come from families where a tradition in universities or any
sort of education is not the norm, their advice networks can be quite
limited. We have a fair bit of work to do.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000097">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Other
pressures influence students’ choices. Some of them are as
simple as the media—what happens to be on telly at the time. Why
did we see a huge explosion in forensic science when we all know that
there are not many forensic science jobs out there? It was because of
TV at the time. We must understand that the pressures on young people
and the way in which they make choices and engage with education are
very complex. In considering how we prepare those young people, we must
think very hard about how we prepare our teachers, counsellors and
career guidance people so that young people are
given appropriate advice and
support.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000098">&#160;</a>

not have to put in your GCSE grades now, but in a more competitive

about something. If someone did not have that A to C grade in English

be offered to them as they were going through university, so that they
could leave university with that qualification. I say that because I am
very keen to reduce the gap between education and employability and we
want to get rid of any barriers that stop people being able to get a
job. I was the first generation in my family to go to university and
effectively we are saying to these children, “Work hard at
school, work hard at university and then try to get a job at the end of

for the world of lifelong learning and the world of employment. It
picks up numeracy, communication, literacy, how students present
themselves and how to communicate effectively. We are now seeing the

with that and we will see whether or not that has an impact on our

choosing my GCSE options, I chose not to do some GCSEs and instead
chose to do a GNVQ in ICT, because I saw that as something that was
much more beneficial. I have learned how to build websites. That is a
skill that I think you will need in the 21st century, over a language
for example.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000113">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That
qualification does not even exist any more and I only did my GCSEs
about eight years ago. So this constant restructuring gives an
instability to employers. Employers do not know what is going on. Some
employers out there will want to engineer their own vocational
qualifications and some want to see a level of consistency. Students
want to see a level of consistency, because they want their
qualifications to mean something and not to be abolished a few years
later. So what we urgently need

have equivalents. We have mapped vocational programmes against the
so-called tradition A-levels and GCSEs that
students can access with vocational qualifications. We will be
accepting BTECs. We will be accepting diplomas. We will be accepting a
vast range of vocation-orientated programmes, as well as access
programmes into the university. Those students do as well as any other
students, provided they are supported appropriately. Many of them are
coming in slightly ahead in terms of their understanding of a
particular vocational area. To take teaching and nursing as two
examples, students coming in with BTEC have often been in environments
in which they have learnt skills that then immediately transfer and
translate into elements of the curriculum within the university. They
will be ahead of those students who perhaps have followed a more
traditional route that is academically orientated. Overall, the balance
is that they do as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000118">&#160;</a>

the changes that have come about as a result of that. Increasingly, we

undertake sandwich degrees, adding another year. Over time, that has

students who may be on placements when an issue might arise. My
personal view is that anonymity is important, but we need to be assured
that we can investigate fully and ensure that all parties are protected
during the process. Clearly, the outcome of that process needs to be

has to be seen as separate from the stop and search powers, which are
totally the wrong way to deal with the problems that the Government are
trying to deal with. For example, the issue of cyber-bullying cannot be
tackled by confiscating someone’s iPhone. That is a 19th-century
solution to a 21st-century problem. It needs a total
rethink.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000126">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Teacher
anonymity is a particular concern. There are increasing cohorts of 14
to 16-year-olds studying in FE colleges. There will be FE teachers
teaching young people, who could be subject to the same kind of
malicious accusations as someone who would teach in a school. Those
people are exempt from the protections in the Bill
currently—that should change. Also, the announcement this
morning that the Department for Education will allow FE teachers to
teach in schools is positive and should be welcomed, but, again, the
law needs to protect them, in terms of anonymity, against accusations
in the same way that it protects school
teachers.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000127">&#160;</a>

There are some incredibly good employers. We need
to recognise that the challenges facing big and small employers are
different, and that the offer to apprentices differs too. As the

competition for apprentices in big employers such as Rolls-Royce and
BT. Those kinds of employers will face massive competition, much in the

small employers to have a look-in as well. It will be difficult,
because large employers can pay more. The minimum wage for apprentices

businesses than big businesses. That is an issue in itself that should

mean that the next time I fill in my UCAS form, which I may or may not
do, I will have to look at institutions and courses based on prices.
That in itself is a problematic process to go through because, at that
level, you are not getting all the information that you need to make an
informed decision, and that information is not as freely available now
as it should be. For example, some universities are not setting their
fees until the end of March. The general perception around continuing
in education from a post-16 perspective  will change
significantly. Young people, particularly disadvantaged young people,
will be looking at education as expensive. The abolition of the
education maintenance allowance will make going to college or sixth
form more expensive and, in some instances, will mean that a person may
not take that route. That is just one of many factors that you will
have to analyse when deciding whether the traditional higher education
route of going to university is for you. You will need to look at fees,
the interest repayments and the additional loans that you might have to
take out to support yourself. A combination of factors will change
people’s entire views and attitudes around participating in post
16-education, particularly young people. Fee price is just one
element.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000139">&#160;</a>

that consider themselves to be the most prestigious will charge the
most. That will endanger someone’s ability to make an informed
decision based on other factors. When I call my grandparents every

to keep breaking their heart and say no. They want me to go to the
places that will be charging £9,000 a year because they are
deemed to be the most prestigious. That in itself raises a number of
problems, and it is incredibly difficult for young people to look at a
vast array of cost prices for courses and not make those assumptions
around

had no impact at all on widening participation. The honest answer is we
have not got a clue what will happen this time. Anybody who suggests
that they have got a clue is perhaps deluding themselves. We are moving
into a situation in which the cultural and behavioural changes that
will be required are huge. There are multiple dimensions as to how
people make these decisions, depending on their backgrounds, their
cultures, their experiences and their parents’ and
friends’ experiences, so we really do not know what will
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000142">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
are moving into a situation in which markets and consumerism will be
present. When we have conducted surveys with sixth formers and the
schools and colleges with which we work in partnership and on our open
days, there is a view in a high proportion of those with whom we were
exploring this agenda that the quality will be determined by the fee
that is charged. If you charge £9,000, regardless of whether or
not you are seen in a high division of the league tables, that equates
to high quality. If you charge a low fee that is low quality. The
parents and the students quite rightly are saying, “I
don’t want to go if the quality is poor. What will you ensure
that you deliver for me?” It is very, very complex.

universities communicate that to prospective students through their

Government, obviously we introduced the £3,000 level. There was
a great debate around whether we should charge £1,000,
£2,000 or £3,000. In the end, virtually everybody went
for £3,000. We found that the demand for places meant that it
did not make a lot of difference and enrolments were still pretty high.
My local university is the university of Central Lancashire and,
despite the objections of the vice-chancellor and the student union at
the time, it now admits that £3,000 was not a problem. This
Government’s proposals have led to the tripling of the fees
despite the fact that they say they want to widen participation. Can I
ask both of you—Professor West has already touched on
this—how conducive will the abolition of the EMA and the
tripling of the fees be to widening

that Aim Higher has been lost because both of those schemes do a huge
amount towards widening participation. It is now for the universities
seriously to address how, in the absence of that, they are going to
engage with young people to ensure that they understand the benefits of
universities and that they can see routes through if they are students
who will potentially be put off by the fact there is a fee. Admittedly,
they will not need to find that fee up front, but they will ultimately
pay it
back.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000147">&#160;</a>

is a huge communication issue for us to engage with. The politicians,

For me, that would be a complete disaster, regardless of what

talk about WP, EMA and progression on to university. That is one of the
reasons why I found the Government’s decision to abolish EMA
distressing. If you look at the statistics, there is an
under-representation of people from black and minority ethnic
backgrounds going to university. Some 77% of the entire population of
16, 17 and 18-year-old Pakistanis, for example, are on EMA, and 88% of
16, 17 and 18-year old Bangladeshis in this country are on it. The
Government’s decision to abolish EMA was based on a report where
the survey respondents were 91% white. There is yet to be an equality
impact assessment on the abolition of EMA, despite various calls for
there to be one. That would give you the reason why. So I think that
there will be a direct correlation and that the attitudes around
participation in education, as I mentioned before, for all young
people, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, will change
culturally as a result of post-16 education becoming more
expensive.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000152">&#160;</a>

our plans were rubbished by the then Opposition. We were told that
people did not want Mickey Mouse courses any more and that people
should not be going to university who were doing courses that were not
needed by the economy, and 101 other reasons why more than 50% of young
people should not be entitled to an education that many of us around

encourage as many people as possible, particularly from
under-represented groups, to go to university. That is why I say that I
do not think that it is about information, advice and guidance. I think
that there are probably chronic issues in the admissions system. The
excuse that they will give, for example, is that people from certain
backgrounds do not achieve well at school and

study until the age of 16, which would militate in some ways against
young apprenticeships at 14 and the rest of it. Do you think that that
combined with the emphasis on the English baccalaureate could lead to
the closing off of options that might be more suitable for some people,

being closed. The thing about the English baccalaureate is that it is a
league table exercise, to start off with, so students’ interests
are not necessarily at the forefront. Also, the subject choices within
that are, in my opinion, questionable. Why religious studies, IT

reviewing, given where we are in a 21st-century economy and how skills

enable someone to do a vocational course while getting A to C in
English and maths, but it must also recognise that the reason why they
do not have an A to C in English and maths might be disengagement from
particular teaching methods and teaching styles, and it should look at
different ways that people can gain those qualifications.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000171">&#160;</a>

about mobility. If fees are set at a different level in devolved
territories, if those universities end up saying in a few years’
time, “We are losing out because we are not getting the same
money in fees as our counterparts in England,” if there is
natural pressure for fees to rise and if, as we heard in answer to
earlier questions, universities will tend to price for prestige to the

in price terms. We have to remember that what triggered all of this was
a recognition that universities were chronically underfunded. That led
to the Browne report. Lord Browne proposed a whole raft of measures
that would have introduced a market, but we do not quite have full
Browne. We have some of Browne, and we will see what happens. I think
that one issue is that we already know that our Scottish universities
are receiving less income than those in England, in terms of their unit
of resource, and they are finding it very difficult at the moment. If
everybody agreed that universities  were chronically
underfunded to begin with and we want to be a world-class country
delivering high-quality education, there is going to be a natural
tendency to drift towards a point that ensures that more funding comes
in to
universities.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000174">&#160;</a>

has been a chronic problem since the late 1970s. Even in 2005, when we
were in an economic boom, it could be argued that youth unemployment
was still far too high. The more fundamental issue is long-term
Government policy decision making to prevent situations such as we are

                           </em> Good afternoon, everyone. It is nice to see
you. We had four tests as we worked our way through the various stages
of the reform of higher education. The first was equality of access,
the second was parity of treatment, the third was flexible study and
the fourth was to ensure that we improved the quality and innovation of
our teaching. Clauses 70 and 71 of the Bill largely clean up the detail
of normalising between full-time and part-time study, and we are fully
in support of that. I would like to thank everyone in the room and
everyone outside the room for making sure that the four in 10
undergraduates who study part time at last get to participate on a
level playing field. So it is a resounding yes,

out in furious agreement but, yes, the principle is good. I also think
that it is fine if it focuses more attention on different ways of
participating in higher education, on there being not just a single
full-time route at 18, and on the fact that higher education can be
undertaken at any time that life or careers require it, or people want
to do it. I do think that, as always with these things, there is some
devil in the detail, and I am particularly concerned that people in
employment currently and in the future get every encouragement to
participate, and that whatever structure is there does not create
either bureaucratic or other barriers to their participating and
improving their qualifications while still
working.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000195">&#160;</a>

that I am very committed to the whole idea of a more modular approach

and why, in terms of cohort? Perhaps you might say more about what we
could do to match the rhythms and patterns of study to the rhythms and

university—I am sure this is not lost on anyone across the four
nations—is the widening participation university of the United
Kingdom. Some 41% of our students have one or no A levels at the point
at which they embark on their programmes. We have more than 12,000
students with disabilities and 9,000 students who come from the 25%
most-disadvantaged communities in our society, and we constantly top
the league tables for students’ satisfaction with quality. This
is part of a journey of widening
participation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000197">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">You
asked what more could be done, John. We have taken a very big step. All
the conversation in the last session was about young people. You would
not hear it as much, but I hear it all the time because the average age
of our students is 32. That is a big, courageous step. The national
scholarship programme of £150 million started off with bright,
young people from poor backgrounds. I am delighted to see that the
language is now more inclusive to bring in people from all stations in
our
society.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000198">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Most
of you will be aware that, in addition, the Higher Education Funding
Council for England currently invests £372 million extra for
widened participation. I was thrilled to see in the BIS guidance letter
to HEFCE for this year that the No. 1 priority was the protection of
that £372 million so we did not give £150 million and
take away £372 million. That was for one year so, in asking the
question what should we do in the future, and all of us having an eye
to social mobility, it is absolutely critical that that be protected
through the discussion in the White Paper and subsequent legislation.
That is something else that we absolutely need to do.

always be the case that people will miss out and not go to university
at the age of 18, people who are perfectly capable of doing so. There
has to be a system that allows those people a lifelong opportunity for
widening participation. We try to make that as easy as possible, for
example, by offering one-year certificates that are a preparation for
higher education, and that are much less threatening than starting a
degree programme. Those certificates take you into the second year of
the degree programme, so you do not miss
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000200">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At
the moment, the regulations for the loans suggest that those people
would begin repaying their loan immediately after they had done the
certificate. We need something that recognises those who immediately
progress not to the first year of a degree but to a second year of
degree, whereas if they went straight into the first year of degree,
they might actually drop out. This is a way of getting them in, and
taking them at the same pace. It is about lifelong
participation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000201">&#160;</a>

people in employment and people who may at 16 choose an apprenticeship
route. That should not, in their minds or in the mind of anyone else,
exclude higher education requiring high-level skills. We have to make
sure that there are good opportunities for apprenticeships. I think
everyone would support that. We want apprenticeships to be available at
higher level as well, so that they are available at post A-level,

also have to find progression routes for people doing vocational
qualifications at 16, of which the Wolf report has made some mention.
That route has been neglected in terms of progression to HE. In
widening participation that way, we must make sure that the right
progression opportunities are available so that validating institutions
can actually create the right sort of curriculum that will appeal to
people who choose a work-based route. At the moment, that can create
difficulties.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000203">&#160;</a>

practice. I do not understand how risky your business model would be in
terms of part-time students. Can you shed any light on the eligibility
for fee loans for part-time students, and when they start paying it
back if they are in employment? There does not seem to be much meat on

loans to people studying at one quarter of full-time, rather than one
third as the minimum, because that will bring in a whole cadre of
students. We are still very worried about the repayment conditions as
announced in the regulations so far. If you are on a three-year
full-time course, you will repay in the April after you have graduated.
If you are on a four-year full-time course, you will repay in the April
after you have graduated. If you are on a four-year part-time course,
you will pay in the April before you graduate,

			Column number: 149<a class="bkMark" name="Column149">&#160;</a>
                           </div>because the current regulation is three-and-a-half years for repayment
for four-year part-time students. That is an inequity in the level of
the playing field, but it will also make it very hard to explain to our
students. Rather than saying, “You are starting a four-year
degree, and you will repay after you graduate”, we will have to
say—if this regulation is maintained—“You are
starting a four-year degree, and you will have to repay in the April
before you graduate.” That will make life very
difficult.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000205">&#160;</a>

for the business model that you mentioned, on average—at least
for our students—it takes four years for a part-time student
from the first moment they think about studying until they actually
come to us. They tend to take the decision very late. August and
September are peak months for applications. In our business model, I am
expecting a considerable dip in applications for a couple of years
while part-time students come to terms with loans. We will recover
after that, as they realise that it is actually a much better deal than
studying
full-time.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000206">&#160;</a>

perspective. Our concern is about people in employment, and
particularly employers who want to support their employees, which we
all strive to do. One assumes that that will be possible, but will it
incur any early repayment penalty? Will there be a disincentive for
employers to pay the fee if they think that their employees can call
down a loan? There may be employers who are not as committed to
supporting employees as they ought to be.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000208">&#160;</a>

                           <em/>There are
also issues about mature students and employment. Mature students may
be in their 30s and 40s and going back to education to improve the
skills that they need to keep their job, get promoted or start their
own business. They will look at the repayment period and think it is a
very long time. They will have all sorts of other things happening in
their lives such as mortgages, families or other loans that they have
to sustain, and they will see any study loan in that context.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000209">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The devil is
in the detail. There is a lot that we do not know about this system.
Any bureaucratic system of repayments must be flexible enough to allow
employers to pay to support employees, both old and young, and to
support apprenticeships in the workplace. It must also be flexible
enough to allow those individuals with the means to repay to do so when
it suits them. They are planning for the rest of their life, and study
cannot be separated from that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000210">&#160;</a>

                           </em> We would be worried about the dip that I have
already touched on. If we are not careful, one of the unintended
consequences of this may affect those in our society who just want to
get started and need some support in their first year for their hopes
and aspirations so that they can succeed in higher education. If the
funding levels for widening participation drop, we will see a dip in
the number of those people. Of all the dips we may see, I would be
saddest about that one. It is fair to say that we do not know. The only
certainty is that if there is a wholesale drop in funding for widening

valid observation, and I am delighted to see how everybody has rallied
around that finding in the Browne report and supported it. That is
terrific; it is the point that everyone seems to agree on at last. As I
have said before, it is about 40% of all undergraduates. Your first
question was about the practicality. Browne also talked about it being
free at the point of entry—that is absolutely critical. David
has talked to you a little about at what point people should start
repaying, and there has been some great work on that. On the lowering,
Browne recommended 33% intensity and dropping that to 25%. That one
change allows the OU alone to bring in an extra 19,000 students. This
is a journey of cleaning up and normalisation. The White Paper has to
put a lot of the meat on the bones, as does the legislation that will
follow.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000213">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There are a
couple of points to illustrate what still needs to be decided. One of
the things recommended by Lord Browne and his team was that we should
meter numbers into the system through UCAS tariff points—A-level
tariff points. He also mentioned in the report that there should be a
separate system that operates for those such as the Open university.
Let us put that in context. I have 265,000 students and 41% have one
A-level or fewer. That is why I am sure David Willetts stated that that
is an unworkable way of metering numbers into the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000214">&#160;</a>

that point because it is important and there are a wider number of
things that need to be cleaned up. The 1962 Act likes to define
full-time education through an in-attendance rule. That might have been
appropriate for the 1960s, but in a web 2.0 world, defining full-time
education by being in attendance is somewhat laughable. We have to have
the courage to clean up those types of things. Otherwise, we will
inadvertently perpetuate the two systems.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000216">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Absolutely. In the next few years we will
start to see people having a choice of whether to study full time or to
work and study part time. Many mature students now go through UCAS and
study full time, probably because they do not know about the
availability of part time. It is an amazing change that UCAS is
proposing to flag part-time courses from 2012–13 and have a
single entry system from 2014–15. We are absolutely clear that
all parties are committed to doing this, and we to delivering it, but
the only caveat is that the detail needs to be got right. The devil is
in the detail. There is no deliberate attempt at whatever; it is an
issue of not understanding. I was told in the last few days by a senior
civil servant that, because my students

four years—it must mean that they were only working 25% of the
time. Those students are working full time and studying in the
evenings, making a huge commitment. For those of us brought up on the
18-year-old going to university, it is very hard to understand how that
is working. We can make it really work, and deliver with it, if we now
just get the last few details
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000218">&#160;</a>

inevitably be short-term turbulence. For part-time students in the FE
sector, there will be a significant increase in the
price of courses and we will have to explain that. It will be
difficult. I cannot predict what our enrolments will be in 2012
compared with 2011—having said that, I predict that they will
possibly go down for all sorts of reasons. We are faced with price
increases to individuals or employers, which we will have to stand by
and justify in terms of the quality of what we offer. But the
artificial divisions between full and part time need to be broken down.
I do not think that there is any comprehensive or widely understood
definition of what full-time study means these days. Most students on
full-time courses have part-time jobs. Those jobs can extend into the
rest of the time they have, and that is no bad thing in many respects,
because it prepares them for work. So if we could get away from some of
the artificiality of the system, which has held us in good stead up to
now, and let it open up access to higher education to people who choose
different routes at different stages in their lives, it will be a job
well done. But we need to think about different definitions, and I do
not think that full and part time are very helpful as we go into this
new

part-time study, as well as vocational and so on. I think it is only
about 4% of people who start an apprenticeship go on to HE at the
moment. This Government is, in my view rightly, building on the
previous Government’s efforts on apprenticeships and will take
them forward. How do we ensure that apprenticeships can lead on to

better job of knitting together secondary, further and higher education
with more connected pathways. It is not just about the advice and
guidance, but also structural reform in the way that we validate
institutions, the normalisation of the Quality Assurance Agency with
what it takes for a higher education college to collaborate with a
further education college. It is about ensuring that credit is more
transferrable within the system and that we have vocational lattices

mistaken. It will only monitor full-time progression. So if a young
person takes an apprenticeship at 16, they 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 152<a class="bkMark" name="Column152">&#160;</a>
                           </div>undertake a very challenging and in some ways much more demanding route
than A-levels, because they have to work and combine study with all
sorts of other things. At 18 it is probably unrealistic to expect them
to give all that up and embark on a full-time course. It suspect that
that is the 4%. But we find, as an institution, that many people have
gone through that work-based route and, when they finish their
apprenticeship, want to work, and their employers want the same. They
will therefore come back into the system in their mid-20 to mid-30s,
when maybe their outlook is different. Take the construction industry.
They work on site and with the tools until their mid-20 and early 30s,
and then perhaps have the opportunity of a job in a professional
capacity, for which they will need retraining and thus come back into
the system. I guess that we do not do a good enough job of tracking
those who come in, but we do know that on HNC construction courses, for
example, the average age of students is well into the 20s and 30s; they
are not 18-year-old full-timers. We need to ensure that there is the
value attached to that. People should be able to choose to do higher
level apprenticeships—apprenticeships with a higher-level of
study attached to them—at 18 rather than full-time study at
university.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000223">&#160;</a>

touched on the point about being able to do more of that. Part-time
provision is not fully part of the UCAS admissions system. We can
participate in some promotion elements of it, but if you go to UCAS to
enrol for a university course currently, part-time provision is not in
there. I was on a Government task force on e-learning in the United
Kingdom. One of our big findings was that if you look for flexible
distance education or e-learning in the UCAS system, it is virtually
impossible to find those options. Part of what we
can do is to put in student support and structure our programmes to
help under-25-year-olds be successful. There has to be a lot of reform
in the rest of the sector that has been built for full-time-provision
fully to embrace part-time provision as it

before the existing fees regime, partly because of the difficulties in
finding the right sort of placements for students for a year. There
were still some, but as HE developed and grew, the number of placements
probably did not grow to the same degree. One’s mind moves more
towards how we educate people already in employment so that they do not
have to make that break in the sandwich provision but can actually not
rule themselves out from higher education by choosing a work-based
route. That was starting to emerge as a real option. I am not
particularly surprised by the decline of the sandwich course. For some
people and for some industries, it is the right thing, but there are
other options that might be more flexible and more appropriate that
allow people to earn alongside learning in a much more organised and
structured way that employers support and that leads to a job at the
end of it, or even has a job all the way through, which is the ideal

and well, in another way. This notion of the sandwich programme as you
described it is about to go through a renaissance. Some of you may have
seen KPMG’s announcement with the university of Durham about
allowing people to start straight away and begin their audit careers as
well as doing their accountancy qualifications in parallel. Our ability
to bring in to FE and HE in more meaningful ways what the CBI estimates
as the £18.5 billion a year that is spent on plc training, while
at the same time allowing people to get the goodness of studying and
practising at the same time, will create some great outcomes. Going
back to your question about painting a picture for the future, I think
that is a great picture of the

with full-time students. The current statement on students repaying
once they are three years into their course of study is something that
we support. I also support David’s comments that we need to
avoid anything that looks like part-time students being treated
unfairly compared with full-time cohorts in terms of the expectations.
If that means that we need to move more to a four or four and a half
year delay, based on the discussions or David’s comments, to
ensure that there is that parity of treatment, that is critical. That
is because we need to avoid, at all costs, any further impression that
there is a distinction between part time and full
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000238">&#160;</a>

you repay in the April after your third year, and I would suggest that
for part-time students, one should move to the April after the fourth
year. There are two very good reasons for that. First, that places it
in line with four-year full-time students, who repay after they have
graduated. Secondly, it would remove the unfortunate strapline that, as
currently constructed, all full-time students will reach their
repayment point, whether they repay or not, after they have graduated,
while all part-time students will reach it before they have
graduated.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000239">&#160;</a>

again, based on his FE experience. On the provisions in the Bill on
powers for members of staff in FE institutions to search students, do
you see any issues with how those powers are provided? Would you have
any apprehension that colleges or staff could face controversy or
litigation either for the exercise of such powers, or, as often happens
in my part of the world, Northern Ireland—where litigation is
increasingly based on people being accused of dereliction—for
not having exercised powers, in a way that led to a risk to
someone?<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000246">&#160;</a>

Widdowson:</strong>
                           </em> It is important that college staff have
the same powers as those available to staff in schools. That seems to
be entirely sensible. There is a further complication in virtually
every FE college—maybe not in sixth-form colleges—in that
we have adult students on the premises as well. It might be slightly
different to deal with a young person under the age of 18 and then to
deal with an adult. Given that we are trying to widen participation not
just in HE but in all sorts of other provision as well, we get all
sorts of adults through colleges, as you will be
aware.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000247">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Therefore,
I think, that power needs to be handled sensitively. Certainly, in my
own institution, it would be done—and is done at the moment,
where we have powers to intervene with students—only by trained
staff, and in most cases by specialist security staff. It is not
something that I would expect every classroom lecturer to engage in as
a day-to-day activity; that would be most unusual, and to be
discouraged. But to have the same power would be very useful and very
valuable.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000248">&#160;</a>

schools, the Bill makes reference to school rules, but there is no
equivalent reference that I can see to college rules specifically in
relation to the powers given here. The powers are basically given to
staff. There is also a provision that in exercising those powers,
people would have to have regard to the guidance issued by the
Secretary of State. How often do you think the Secretary of State might
issue guidance on such matters? Every time that there is controversy
over a particular case or issue, will there not be demands for the

serious issues within some inner-city colleges, where you have to make
sure that the environment is safe and controlled and that it is a place
where we would want to send our kids, in the same way that we expect
other people to send theirs. I would expect and hope that the Secretary
of State would consult widely on this, listen to the voice of

“I’ve got my job and I’m going to study part-time
because I’ve got the debt carried over from my undergraduate
degree.” I think we might see a shift between studying full-time
and studying part-time at that level. The fees will presumably be
affected only in a different way, because there is no direct effect in

                           </em> With regard specifically to professional
qualifications, there is already a lot of self-funded provision there,
not least because if it gives some form of licence to practice, in the
way that you just said, the student can see some incentive. Equally, to
go back to my point about employers, often employers will pay for their
staff to be qualified, because it helps them carry out their business
more effectively. In accountancy practices and legal practices, it is
to the benefit of the employer to have people qualified to a certain
level. Then they can undertake more independent
activity.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000257">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
think that there is an issue about access to the professions, however
one defines the professions: not simply surgeons and lawyers at the top
end, but all the other professional bodies that give access to people
from low-participation groups. There may be an issue there that crosses
the different funding streams for FE and HE. Many of those courses
start at level 2 or level 3 and then have a progression pathway into
level 4 and beyond. There are some issues at that lower end—the
access end—where we probably need to look again at what sort of
support is available and what sort of support for fees is available for
people who want to go down a professional route as opposed to a
traditional academic route. I would not want that to be neglected in
this debate. There is a challenge in relation to full and part-time
definitions and a real question about how we can break down some of
those barriers and give support to the people who need
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000258">&#160;</a>

fees policy more widely. It seems that the policy Professor Smith laid
out earlier has shortcomings, but not the ones that have been
communicated to the public. In terms of access, lower-earning people
should not be put off; they should be celebrating this new system. The
question, rather, is

                           </em> It is impossible to know right now what the
implications will be, but here are just a few thoughts for you, so that
I can answer the question. Firstly, because part-time is set outside
the current system, we have always charged fees and we have always been
market facing. So we have always had to be in tune with the notion of
value for money for our students and returning value for what they
invested with us along the way. The same methodologies we have always
used to price in the market historically are exactly the same ones we
will use to figure out where to go in this new world. As I have
mentioned, it was absolutely vital that it was free at the point of
entry and that payment did not begin for part-time students right away
or until they were earning above £21,000. Those things have been
taken care of. Without being repetitive—because I know the Chair
would like me not to be—looking forward, should we see a
retrenchment away from the current investment in widening participation
funds, we absolutely will see a drop in participation from those
communities that need a starting point to enter higher education,
irrespective of how we structure the loan
programme.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000260">&#160;</a>

Latchman:</strong>
                           </em> I entirely agree with that. The full-time
sector will have to learn some of the lessons that we learned in the
part-time sector a long time ago. I was interested to note, when
talking to the chief executive of UCAS, that she thinks some
institutions will introduce a tiered fee structure with different fees
for different things. We have that already, with a default tier in the
middle, higher fees for certain popular professional-type
courses—such as law—which are strongly supported by
bursaries, and a lower tier for widening participation-type courses. We
will continue that in the new system with higher fees. The full-time
sector will probably have to learn that lesson, but there will not be
many institutions that just put a blanket fee out. If they do, they
might well have to change to a tiered structure in a few years’
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000261">&#160;</a>

will see huge numbers of Birkbeck adverts. We spend an enormous amount
on that sort of marketing because we do not have the captive audience
of 18-year-olds who come through UCAS. We have had to learn lessons
about that, including the type of courses I mentioned
earlier—low-cost access one-year certificates that, if you pass,
you go into the second year of a degree course. Courses like that could
be offered in partnership with FE colleges, for example, which is
something we are exploring with a few colleges in London at the moment.
They will have to be more creative in those terms, rather than relying
on a captive cadre that just looks at UCAS and says, “Okay. That
seems fine. I’ll go

participation initiatives have been valuable, but they take time. They
do not just take effect at the point of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 158<a class="bkMark" name="Column158">&#160;</a>
                           </div>entry. In my experience, you have to support students certainly through
their first months—maybe their first year—on a programme
if they have come from a low-participation background. Those
initiatives are useful and we have to make sure that the money is
targeted and directed well. But it does have an impact. Things such as
Aim Higher—I speak at the chairman of the Aim Higher partnership
in Durham—have worked and we have seen a significant increase
from low-participation communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000264">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The second
thing is just the need to communicate this. We are probably dealing
with a lot of debt-averse families and individuals. The sums look very
big and the repayment periods look very long. There has to be a clear
explanation of what this means and what the deal is for them.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000265">&#160;</a>

thing would be about keeping the bureaucratic burden of all this on the
student as simple as possible. It is early days yet and we do not have
much detail, but it looks quite complicated from the student’s
point of view. There are quite a lot of gateways to get through that
were not there before and which need to be explored and simplified as
quickly as
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000266">&#160;</a>

it is a recognition of reality, to be honest. If we take the headlines
from the Wolf report in the media today, I do not think that is a vote
against vocational education, it is a vote for meaningful and realistic
vocational education. Colleges have had a lot of experience in
delivering that. Until recent times in my own college, we had 500 young
people coming in a week under what was known as the increased
flexibility programme. They were doing NVQs at level 1. They were
learning real skills and you could see the competence that they got in
a context that they enjoyed, which led to them succeeding better at
school and progressing to study, employment or apprenticeship at 16.
Those programmes have a real impact. It would be wrong to have any form
of dilution or any form of soft-edged vocationality, which does not do
anybody any good, particularly the

of the starting points is with information, advice and guidance in
schools, and there are what I would describe as various pathways
through the schooling system that would lead young people into an
apprenticeship, or, as in my case, to a wider career in the
construction industry at a professional level. Funding also has a part
to play, not only at the 16 to 18-year-old level, but in how that is
orchestrated over higher-level apprenticeships and those pathways into
higher education that were discussed earlier.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000287">&#160;</a>

                           </em> If I may briefly add something to that, what
you see from the data is variation in the take-up of apprenticeships by
sectors. Clearly, Mark’s is a leading sector in terms of the
take-up of apprenticeships, but there are others where more can be
done. When you look at apprenticeships by numbers of employers, you see
pockets of small businesses that do an awful lot, and the number of
apprenticeships that such employers take on relative to the size of
their work forces is very strong. Larger employers take on more
apprenticeships, but they make up a lower percentage of their work
forces, so there are opportunities to extend the number of
apprenticeships there.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000288">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
also progression opportunities, so if more can be done to extend
apprenticeships at level 3 and level 4, it would be very positive. We
need to look at the apprenticeship frameworks, because a small number
of them provide a vast majority of apprenticeship numbers. The
commission’s own work around future skills demand highlights the
importance of STEM subjects, so science, technology, engineering and
mathematics all have areas where we see prospects for apprenticeships
in the future.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000289">&#160;</a>

information, advice and guidance. You will know that there will be an
all-age careers service from the autumn, and part of its purpose is to
rebalance advice that is given so that it is more equal in respect of
vocational options. Should sector skills councils, however, be given
greater clarity about their role in primary legislation? Would an
amendment to the Bill that defined the legal personality and the
function of sector skills councils be welcomed?<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000290">&#160;</a>

information, advice and guidance on two levels. First, the raw
information needs consistency and it needs to be bang up to date right
across the country in its delivery. Employers in various
sectors—not only my own—can participate in ensuring that
that is the case. Secondly, employers can play a very hands-on role in
engaging with schools. On construction skills, there was an example at
our Cambridgeshire training group with employers where we had schools
and schoolchildren, and it all worked perfectly. There was real-buy in

apprenticeships in past years—certainly in
construction —but the dominant factor that we have to
deal with at the coal face in my organisation at the moment is the
economy and the output. Construction has gone through a tough time and
the forecasts for an industry that employs more than 2.5 million people
and that accounts for 8% of GDP are lacklustre at best for the future.
The challenge is to get that basic contract of employment for a young
person that will secure them the apprenticeship. The challenge will lie
in how public funding in particular can assist that, especially in
specialist areas. That will be over a journey for that individual. The
road ahead will be rocky, but it is the economy that will drive
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000295">&#160;</a>

myself to the degree required to participate in some of the potentially
growing markets of the future. That can be surmounted, but it will take

spent a lot of time and effort helping to develop procurement
guidelines for clients—in this case, public sector clients of
all sorts—particularly to deal with OJEU requirements in
particular. We have specified, on a light-touch basis, skills and,
particularly, apprenticeships. That work has progressed over the past
18 months, and I believe that it is having an impact at this moment in
time on maintaining a flow of apprentices, certainly in some areas. I
would welcome a deeper embedding of that, but the caution that would be
needed, if I take construction as an example, is that, at the end of
the day, construction companies are there to build things, so there is
a limit to what can be put in their contracts and what they can be
expected to deliver alongside

tend to be at 19-plus if employers are seeking a slightly older intake.
You do not necessarily want a 16-year-old at the top of a 20-storey
scaffolding rig for various reasons. On 16 to 18, in my own sector, we
would continue to do as we do now—engaging with schools and with
career pathways through something like the construction and the built

the growth in apprenticeships builds on the policy of the previous
Government. I echo that it is reflected in all four nations, so there
is a genuine UK consensus to do more and to continue to do
more.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000301">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To
answer your question about procurement, the commission’s view
would be that sectors, and strong sector leaders and business leaders,
should be identifying what is the best mechanism in their sector that
would really drive the demand for them. I think that that highlights
the importance of a sectoral approach. When we have looked at
international evidence on what we call collective measures, there is no
single magic bullet so that you can say, “Well, if we did
procurement everywhere, that would solve the problem.” You look
at it in each sector and say, “What is your biggest skills
challenge? How do apprenticeships play a role? How can we cause an
action?” In construction’s case, that is through the
levy. In another industry, it might be through a collective measure
action, but the important thing is the bottom-up business leadership
that says that this is the right thing for us to do so that business is
driving that change of
behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000302">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
relation to 16 to 18-year-olds, the take-up will, again, vary by
sector. The most important thing is provision of work experience
opportunities. When you look at things such as the commission’s
employer perception survey, you see that although only a small number
of employers take on 16 to 18-year-olds, when they do they are broadly
satisfied with them, and as they get older they become more satisfied
with them. So the logic of that is that the greater the quality of the
work experience that you can offer, the greater the chance that you
could increase the number of 16 to 18
take-ups.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000303">&#160;</a>

champion apprenticeships, and I think we are getting very close to a
tipping point at which higher education becomes an increasingly
expensive option about which young people will think very seriously
before they embark on it. At the same time, with groups such as the
Apprenticeship Ambassadors Network, there are some very strong
household-name employers, and the UK Commission for Employment and
Skills has some very strong case studies and examples of the value of
the apprenticeship route. There is strong economic evidence about the
wage returns for individuals pursuing the apprenticeship route. We just
need to keep pushing out those messages.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000305">&#160;</a>

is a quite a lot of burden on small businesses with limited overheads

a bit about some of the practical problems that small and medium-sized
businesses might encounter in keeping apprentices? What can be done to
smooth that further? Could skills based on entrepreneurship and setting
up businesses be incorporated into apprenticeship

governors at Leicester college, which has an apprenticeship training
agency. That is one of the really good examples of how you support
small businesses. The apprentice is employed within the agency housed
by the college or the provider, which takes away many of the employment
regulations—it does not take away the responsibilities, but it
eases the burden—and supports the individual in an
apprenticeship. Another example is group training associations in which
an apprentice is shared among a number of employers. So there are
burdens but, equally, you are seeing a number of innovative responses
coming through from sectors, employers themselves and providers to
address them
positively.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000311">&#160;</a>

programme-led apprentices as they existed in other sectors. We were
quite wedded to ensuring that we had employer engagement from the off.
Indeed, at the moment we are looking to work with schools on what we

been operating. The statistics from that programme show a high
proportion of those students moving on either into a full
apprenticeship or elsewhere into the industry. At the moment, a lot of
time and effort has been invested by employers in our construction and
built environment diploma. Even my own chairman and his construction
company, the Wates Group, have put a lot of time and money into
web-based activities or resource going into schools to assist with
pulling that throughput through. We have had some good models working
down in Wales. So I do not think that it is a case of any one model
working. There are two or three models, certainly in my own sector,

agreement on the importance of apprenticeships in the 21st century for
a modern industry, do you think that there is a role for the industry
training boards, such as the construction industry training board, many
of which were abolished in the past? Do you think that there is a role
for more of them in the future in providing more of the traditional
longer-term apprenticeships, whereby firms made commitments to

qualifications with, in our specific case, an employer-funded grant
scheme through our levy. That is done through the targeted delivery on
the ground, where others simply cannot go. It might be targeting
training, or whatever. It works and works well. It enables a speed of
response and the industry is certainly very engaged. I am scrutinised
from various directions. The one that catches my attention every day is
the industry’s own scrutiny of us. It is  a model that,
certainly for our sector, has worked. It is a blend of different

entitlement, which was a requirement on the chief executive of the
Skills Funding Agency to secure a sufficient number of apprenticeship
places for young people in the area within reason. Do you think that
there is any danger that taking that away—you always have to

                           </em> The stark reality we deal with is the need
for work, physical output for any organisation, which allows it to take
the risk—and it would be seen as a risk—of employing X
number of apprenticeships. That dominates all other factors on this. I
am placing reliance on the fact that, because of the ongoing priority
for apprentices and the funding that is being allocated in behind them,
there will be sufficient support from the public sector to bolster the
commercial sector’s approach to this. From within the Skills
Funding Agency, therefore, I do not necessarily believe on the
financial funding side of it that that will make a significant
difference. If I speak again of my own sector, we are pushing as hard
as anyone to get those apprenticeships in and that will not
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000331">&#160;</a>

that. However, can I also ask you for a response on this matter? John
Widdowson, the principal of New College Durham, said that he felt the
number of 16 to 18-year-old apprenticeships were likely to decline in
the next couple of years. There are obviously economic reasons for
that. Is that something that you and the UKCES in your scanning of the
likely skills needs have picked up and think might
happen?<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000332">&#160;</a>

Bill’s amendment is a pragmatic response. It seemed a
responsibility that would be very difficult to fulfil, because
ultimately an apprentice is employed by a business. I do not see that
that would in any way change the emphasis that the Skills Funding
Agency is putting upon it. The demand for individuals clearly outstrips
the number of places currently available, so that is
positive.<a class="bkMark" name="11030394000333">&#160;</a>

likely to have come from what can be described as the low-hanging fruit
of people already in employment, perhaps at an older age, being
re-assigned from what they might have done at Train to Gain in the past

1,000 employers and 100 different consortia out there are supporting
the diploma, and that there is a lot of activity for the September
intake. First and foremost, to maintain that would be appropriate in
our particular circumstances. The prime academic learning route within

We find that it is useful, probably because, unlike France or Germany,
we do not have an artisan pull through on the technical master
craftsman side as a country. Some degree of push and encouragement is
needed that takes us into vocational qualifications. Beyond that, we
must get the right balance and the right sort of vocational training
locally. It is not necessarily to make the job ready or directly lead
