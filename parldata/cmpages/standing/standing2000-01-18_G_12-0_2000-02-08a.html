<H4><center>Schedule 8 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Limits on campaign expenditure </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Eighth schedule to the Bill. 
<P>
<H5>10.30 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Walter </B>(North Dorset): Thank you, Mrs. Michie. I hope that we can make a little more progress during today's proceedings, in a spirit of co-operation on both sides of the Committee. 
<P>
I seek guidance from the Parliamentary Secretary in respect of one aspect of schedule 8. Although the limits on campaign expenditure appear to be eminently reasonable, I am concerned about the fact that appropriate sums are designated for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in respect of expenditure in the period running up to a general election. It would be possible, in a general election, for a regional party to field candidates elsewhere in the United Kingdom, thus, without necessarily incurring the candidate expenditure, enlarging the expenditure on its national campaign--which would essentially be a regional campaign, if that is not a contradiction. 
<P>
My concern relates specifically to general elections. Clearly, a regional or national party--a party of Scotland or Wales--would not be able to field candidates in elections to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, although such parties would be able to field candidates in elections to the European Parliament. I am worried that one of the national parties could enlarge what is essentially its local campaign expenditure in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland by fielding paper candidates in England--having paid the necessary deposits--in order to enhance the amount of money that it could spend on a general election campaign in the part of the United Kingdom that it most sought to influence. 
<P>
Other than that, I have no specific questions about the schedule. 
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office (Mr. Paddy Tipping):</B> I am delighted to hear that the Committee is to make good progress: I thought that we had already done so under your chairmanship, Mrs. Michie. I seem to be constantly writing letters to Opposition Members, accepting amendments and praising them for identifying aspects of the Bill. To give hon. Members a little trailer on our future discussions, I can say that we might be able to accommodate them further. We might even be home in time for tea. 
<P>
The hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) has made a fair point, and identified a real issue. If a party in Dorset and the south-west wanted to concentrate its efforts there, it would be proscribed by the expenditure limit for England, which is £810,000. If its members thought imaginatively, and decided to put up paper candidates--as they were described in respect of Wales and Scotland--it would have extra resources to spend. The hon. Gentleman has identified a problem which has no easy solution. I simply draw his attention to the schedule. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Schedule 8 agreed to. 
<H4><center>Clause 73 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Returns as to campaign expenditure </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I beg to move amendment No. 97, in page 47, line 39, after 'be', insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'as far as is reasonably practicable'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 87, in clause 75, page 48, line 38, leave out subsection (4). No. 99, in clause 75, page 48, line 39, after 'fairs', insert 'without reasonable excuse'. No. 98, in clause 75, page 48, line 41, after 'comply', insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'as far as is reasonably practicable'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
No. 100, in clause 75, page 48, line 43, after 'fairs' insert 'without reasonable excuse'. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am mindful of the Minister's comments. Indeed, I hope that we shall be able to move at a faster pace today, precisely because we have touched on some of the issues that I now want to raise on previous occasions, when he gave some helpful indications about the Government's approach. I apologise to the Committee for going over old ground, albeit on new clauses, but I shall do so briefly to identify the problems on which I tabled these probing amendments in order to stimulate discussion. 
<P>
I have no problem with the generality of the clause, but, as usual, it places a number of mandatory requirements on party officers or the party treasurer when making returns. Subsection (4) includes the following requirement 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A return under this section must be accompanied by-- (a) all invoices and receipts ... and (b) in the case of any campaign expenditure treated as incurred ... any declaration falling to be made".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
If that requirement is not met, a person commits one of the many criminal offences that the Bill creates. There are several ways of addressing that problem. The first is by limiting the provision to so far as is reasonably practicable. What happens if all one's invoices and receipts go up in an arson attack on the association offices? The Minister will be aware that, unfortunately, the political offices of various parties are occasionally attacked at election time: it is an appalling occurrence. In that case, where does the Bill exempt the unfortunate treasurer who is trying to get hold of invoices? I accept that duplicates of invoices can sometimes be secured, but occasionally they cannot. Where, therefore, is what I would expect to be the normal exemption to the clause to enable a person not to face criminal culpability, or did the Government intend to create an absolute offence? I do not believe that they did, so I seek reassurance on that point. 
<P>
Properly grouped with amendment No. 97 are the amendments that I have proposed to clause 75, which deals with returns and with the penalties that are incurred if a return is not made to the Electoral Commission. Clause 75(4) identifies a series of offences that may be committed by the treasurer. He commits an offence if he fails to comply with the requirements of clause 75(l) and (2), clause 73(3), which we have just looked at, or clause 75(3). 
<P>
As I have said to the Parliamentary Secretary on previous occasions, these are fairly draconian measures. I have therefore tabled a number of alternative amendments. Amendment No. 87 would delete clause 75(4) entirely, thereby decriminalising a person who failed to make such a return. We have already discussed that in previous debates. I should not be surprised to learn that the Parliamentary Secretary does not think that that is a good idea, because a sanction needs to be maintained. In that case, I have suggested that the words "without reasonable excuse" or 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as far as is reasonably practicable"
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
should be added. In that way, a treasurer facing a criminal sanction could persuade a court that he should be exonerated because he had done all that he reasonably could to comply with the provisions. 
<P>
It is a simple but important point. The Bill places a great burden of compliance on individuals. I have a theory, with which the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) concurs, that small organisations may find it onerous, and that we should do nothing to deter honest, public-spirited individuals from taking on the task of running political parties. Any campaign treasurer reading the Bill will envisage a sword of Damocles hanging over his head every day, waiting to impale him as he sits at his desk. In those circumstances, I fear that no one would be prepared to do that job. 
<P>
I would be satisfied if provisions were to be introduced--either here or in some other way by the Parliamentary Secretary--to ensure that a person who makes a mistake could escape criminal sanction by showing either that there had been a mistake, or that he had done his best. I look forward to the Parliamentary Secretary telling us how he thinks that that could best be achieved. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) said that this was a simple but important point, and I agree with him. I am grateful to him for pointing out that these are probing amendments, and for outlining to the Committee that they are either/or choices relating to ground that we have covered before in Committee: the need to provide a defence where  necessary. I have corresponded with the hon. Gentleman outside the Committee, and I accept the point that he made. 
<P>
If the Committee agrees, I am minded to accept amendments Nos. 98, 99 and 100, in principle. I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman's aims, but they could be inserted into the Bill in a slightly more elegant form, and that is my intention. Having said that, amendment No. 97 would become unnecessary, and the hon. Gentleman's backstop, amendment No. 87, which would provide for a criminal sanction, could remain. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, if a campaign office were attacked by an arsonist and its records lost, there would have to be a defence for those affected. I believe that we can accommodate the wishes of the Committee by accepting amendments Nos. 98 to 100. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am delighted and most grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for that. I do not know whether he wishes to proceed by agreeing to the amendments at this stage. I suspect that he does not. I accept that I am no parliamentary draftsman; that task would be beyond me. Officials in the Department will make a far better job of it than I did, poring over the Bill for 10 minutes in the Library. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Clause 73 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
Clauses 74 to 77 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 78 Controlled expenditure by third parties </center></H4>
<P>
10.45 am 
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 101, in page 50, leave out lines 21 to 24. 
<P>
We are now considering third parties--those who do not put up candidates at a general election, but who seek to influence the outcome. If this were a clause stand part debate, we would concur with most of the provisions as the principle in relation to expenditure by third parties seeking to influence the outcome of a general election is correct. However, this is a probing amendment. Paragraph 165 on page 40 of the explanatory notes states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The test is whether the material can reasonably be regarded as intended to benefit a particular party's electoral prospects. The cost of a poster campaign advocating a particular policy without explicitly supporting or attacking a named political party might nevertheless fall to be regarded as 'controlled expenditure' if the policy in question was closely identified with a particular political party or group of candidates."
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The suggestion is that expenditure by a third party, without mentioning candidates or parties, could almost automatically be regarded as third-party expenditure--expenditure by somebody who had registered with the Electoral Commission as a third party. A person who had not done so would be in breach of the proposed legislation. For instance, a parish priest or vicar, in a parish newsletter, might write that he was concerned about the law on a particular subject, and express the hope that his parishioners would bear that in mind in a subsequent election. If the subject were abortion or the homosexual age of consent, there might be only one candidate in the constituency who had taken the same view as the clergymen, or only one candidate who had taken the contrary view. Therefore, the cost of the parish newsletter might be deemed,to have fallen foul of the legislation. The church would not have registered as a third party, and the expenditure would be expenditure of a third party seeking to influence the outcome of an election. 
<P>
A host of organisations might become subject to the Bill. A company might issue a document to its shareholders on, say, the single currency, stating, "Be mindful during the forthcoming election that the company has extensive business interests on the continent of Europe. As you know, your board of directors has, on many occasions, said that it would be in the company's interests if the United Kingdom were to join the single currency." Such a quasi-public document--for it would be a matter of public record--might be deemed third-party electoral expenditure. The National Farmers Union, of which I am a member, might issue documents to supermarket shoppers on beef exports or butter imports. The Electoral Commission might deem them third-party expenditure because they endorsed a particular cause or political party. 
<P>
I am worried about the test and the way in which it will be interpreted. Under the clause as drafted, a recognised third party is one that chooses to be recognised by drawing up the necessary scheme and putting it before the Electoral Commission. However, other third parties could inadvertently come within the scope of the provision without going through the recognition procedure. Some may not realise that, in expressing an opinion, they were committing an offence, and were deemed to be recognised third parties. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will provide guidance on that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> This is an interesting subject and I am grateful to the hon. Member for North Dorset for his comments. 
<P>
I draw his attention to paragraph 10.79 of the Neill report, in which attention is drawn to Unison's strong and well-resourced campaign in support of the minimum wage during the 1997 general election. Of course, unlike the Conservatives, the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats were in favour of the minimum wage and could have benefited from Unison's advertising campaign. That is the problem that the clause will address. As has been said, it is not necessary for the name of a candidate or a party to be included in such advertising for Neill's point about the Unison campaign to be valid. 
<P>
The hon. Member for North Dorset cited a number of specific examples, including a priest. Those of us who have an association with the Catholic faith, and who, from time to time, have had our names mentioned from the pulpit, know the power of the priest. We know that it is an important issue. Denunciation, or adulation, from the pulpit is not within the scope of this part of the Bill, although the parish newsletter might well be. I remind the hon. Gentleman that clause 87(5) will provide for a de minimis limit of £10,000 for England and £5,000 elsewhere. I fear that, whatever the size of the Catholic Church in Nottinghamshire or Hazel Grove, for example, even £10,000 would be over its limit. I believe that I can offer the hon. Gentleman some comfort in that respect. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned, somewhat provocatively, the position of the National Farmers Union, which has now started leafleting outside supermarkets. The campaign material that they are disseminating at present would probably work across all political parties. I find it hard to think of a third party campaign that the NFU could run that would not reflect a difference of views within political parties. However, a third political party will be in a position to take advice from the Electoral Commission before it begins its campaign. I accept that that is a strong point of the Bill. It is important to get it right, and to look for discretion in parts of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for his explanation and for his suggestion that those who might potentially be regarded as third parties could seek advice. 
<P>
I want to pursue the example of the National Farmers Union, which is on record as being in favour of Britain's joining the European single currency as soon as possible, because it sees that as being in the interests of farmers and their subsidy payments. That could be deemed to be a policy seeking to undermine the chances of candidates from the United Kingdom Independence party, or possibly even the Conservative party. The NFU might choose not to be a recognised third party, because it might not want to enter into the electoral fray. However, any literature that it might put out expressing such views might be regarded as electorally sensitive material. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Let me remind the hon. Gentleman that this part of the Bill concerns big poster and newspaper campaigns. Mailshots and direct letters from the NFU and others would not be covered. The measure covers big public awareness and public information campaigns clearly designed to affect voters' behaviour in respect of a political party. It may be the case that if a third party were seeking to become involved in this area, they would want to take advice from the Electoral Commission. 
<P>
A more difficult argument would arise in the case of bodies not wishing to influence an election campaign but which, nevertheless, wished to advertise to get their message across during the campaign period, and wanted to take advice from the Electoral Commission beforehand. I can give the hon. Gentleman some comfort by saying that we are discussing promotion to the general public, which would have to involve a wide campaign, and by reminding him of the de minimis provision: £10,000 in England and £5,000 in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which, when added together, give £25,000. Most of the examples that he gives would not come under that provision. 
<P>
<H5>11 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Commission will monitor the situation and assess the outcomes. We have not yet had the opportunity to discuss the Electoral Commission, but it will review elections and will be in a position to give and receive advice. 
<P>
The commission will watch such cases closely. There are examples in the Neill report--Unison, Tate & Lyle and others, as well as a case in which neither the candidate nor the party has been named, but in which the intention of a poster campaign was to influence behaviour. That is what the Bill provides for--rightly, in my opinion. The commission may want to consider the issue at a later date, in the light of experience, but the amendment would damage the Bill, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am somewhat reassured by what the Minister has said, although I am not entirely happy. Perhaps when we debate the provisions relating to the Electoral Commission on Report, we will be able to examine more closely the powers and duties of the commission and the way in which other bodies relate to it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 103, in page 51, line 13, after first 'the', insert 'estimated'. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 102, in page 51, line 30, after 'value', insert 'or the nature of the property provided'. 
<P>
No. 92, in page 92, line 7, leave out from 'value"' to end of line 9 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'is to be interpreted in accordance with the following provisions: 
<P>
(A) the Electoral Commission shall prepare and publish for consultation as soon as reasonably practicable such definitions as it thinks fit. and those definitions shall have regard to the need for certainty of accounting for the use of 
<P>
(a) goods, 
<P>
(b) services, and 
<P>
(c) property; 
<P>
(B) citing conformity with the Electoral Commission's definitions (as amended by any consultation in accordance with subsection (A)) shall be sufficient evidence of market value for the purpose of this Act; and 
<P>
(C) the operation of subsection (B) is without prejudice to any alternative market valuation that may be submitted to, and agreed by, the Electoral Commission in any particular case.'. 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Amendments Nos. 103 and 102 are probing amendments, and they may have an application wider than that in the clause. We have not yet discussed the subject, although we may have already passed some clauses in which it arises. 
<P>
The clause--quite properly--stipulates that services or goods provided at an under value may be treated as part of the expenditure of the third party, and must therefore be declared. However, there is a question about what is the intended requirement in terms of the valuation of such non-cash benefits. Subsection (2) defines the relevant amount as follows: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(a) where the property, services or facilities is or are provided free of charge, the market value of the property or, as the case may be, the commercial rate for its use or the provision of the services or facilities, or 
<P>
(b) where the property, services or facilities is or are provided at a discount, the difference between-- 
<P>
(i) the market value or, as the case may be, the commercial rate there mentioned, and 
<P>
(ii) the amount of expenses actually incurred by or on behalf of the third party in respect of the property, services or facilities."
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
What will be required of third parties in terms of valuations? I accept that, as we discussed earlier, the requirement could apply equally well to political parties. Will they be required to get a commercial valuation? In the instance identified in amendment No. 103, how would one show the difference between the market value and the commercial rate? What is the market value? Is it a matter of saying, "I think the market value is X?" If so, I suggest that we are talking about an estimated market value. Should a professional carry out the valuation?  That would put a great burden on organisations. 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset mentioned the variety of third parties that might exist. Unison was quoted as part of the campaign, and it is, of course, a large organisation. However, some third parties, such as churches and the like, may be small organisations. The legislation seems a bit daunting for them, unless there is some clarification, especially as the clause includes, as is usual in this Bill, the possibility of criminal sanctions if one 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"knowingly or recklessly makes a false declaration".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Therefore, such matters are important. Ours is a probing amendment, however I would be grateful to know how we are supposed to discover the market value. Is it a question of the third party making a reasonable estimate, which can thereafter be queried by the Electoral Commission if it is so minded? Should one make some other estimate of the value of goods, in order to avoid committing a criminal offence? 
<P>
I dare say that help could be derived from taxation legislation. I have had the misfortune to deal with an inheritance tax matter, and such matters sometimes involve the valuation of chattels. As I understand it, provided that the chattels are identified, one can put any value on them. If it needs to be queried, that can be done. However, a wise person consults a proper valuer. The provision clearly says that one can submit estimates. Provided that one has declared an item and its value, it is up to somebody else to query it. It is not clear whether that is intended by clause 79. If it is not the intention, it should be. That might require clarification. 
<P>
The same applies to amendment No. 102. Line 30 of clause 79 says: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the responsible person shall make a declaration of the value or (as the case may be) the difference mentioned in subsection (2)."
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I suggest that we insert a reference to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the nature of the property".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
If somebody is lent a computer during an election campaign, it may be more sensible for them to declare the computer, rather than trying to put a value on it. However, I accept that that means that there would not be a financial total for the commission. I am the first to accept that that approach would not be ideal; amendment No. 102 is a probing amendment, and I would be grateful if the Minister explained how the legislation would work in practice. 
<P>
We must keep a simple system, or small organisations will be snowed under with bureaucracy and costs as a result of consulting a professional valuer. I hope that that is not the intention. If it is not, we must face the fact that the commission will sometimes receive from perfectly bona fide organisations valuations that may be-- innocently--off the mark. If that happens, will the hand of the prosecutor descend on the shoulders of the unfortunate people involved, or will the legislation make proper allowance for that contingency?

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell (Hazel Grove):</B> Although amendment No. 92 seeks to amend clause 146, it addresses the issue now under discussion, and I appreciate the fact that the Committee has the opportunity to consider the matter now. 
<P>
 The question of how the Bill should provide for market value has been mentioned several times. I spoke about it last on Tuesday 1 February, at column 214, but the Minister chided me for seeing too many trees and not enough wood; perhaps he thought that the point was too detailed. I suggest that it is rather more than a small detail that can be brushed aside in the generality of a Bill such as this. 
<P>
I welcome the third-party provisions, which have been the cause of personal irritation in previous election campaigns and at other times. The change is long overdue but, as with national party campaigning, it must be done fairly. There are various approaches to determining market value. 
<P>
The Government have decided that the Bill should include definitions and that interpretation should be left to the courts. I have already pointed out that some of the definitions are not entirely consistent or mutually compatible. For instance, interspersing the phrase "commercial rate" with "market value" makes the Bill hard to understand; and the definitions in clause 146, which apply to the whole Bill, are not conclusive or sufficiently extensive. The Minister has agreed that some problems will need to be addressed. That is the first approach--to provide some definitions and then to leave it to the courts to make case law to establish the outcome. 
<P>
I return to the question of its being only a matter of detail. We are talking about treasurers, whether of large or small organisations, whether of third parties or of political parties. Treasurers properly take a cautious view of spending money, let alone of spending money if there is any chance of their going to prison if they get it wrong. In its present form, the provision will lead to a tremendous inhibition on spending on political campaigns. The Minister may believe that that is good--except that he resisted attempts to lower total spending. He must believe that expenditure itself is a good thing, and that it should be constrained by uncertainty. Unfortunately, that would probably mean  that cautious treasurers--the good guys--would spend less than those who were prepared to take risks, which seems not to be the Government's intention. 
<P>
Amendment No. 92 proposes an alternative, which would avoid that uncertainty. It states that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Electoral Commission shall prepare and publish for consultation such definitions as it thinks fit, and those definitions shall have regard to the need for certainty of accounting for the use of (a) goods, (b) services and (c) property".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I suggest that different principles apply to each of the above uses. The amendment then states that citing conformity with those definitions will be conclusive evidence that the right valuation has been entered. The commission might produce definitions that left room for argument, but it would put declarations of expenditure beyond challenge if treasurers could say that they had complied with the code. 
<P>
I draw a comparison with building regulations. Whether a building has been soundly built may be a matter for debate or dispute--the matter can even go to court--but the fact that it was built in accordance with the relevant building code is evidence that the builder did his best, and it puts him beyond challenge. If he did not build it in accordance with the regulations, he would be open to challenge. However, the amendment would not require only that new approach;  it admits of continuing with the approach of the Bill by stating that the operation of the Electoral Commission's code 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is without prejudice to any alternative market valuation".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
In other words, the amendment tries to insert--I took advice on where; the answer seems to be clause 146--an alternative method, which may be somewhat rough and ready but which will give certainty and put beyond challenge the expenditure that will be undertaken. 
<P>
11.15 am 
<P>
The Committee has danced around the practical details on valuation, commercial rates and market value. Electronic data have been mentioned on several occasions as a highly marketable item. Access to someone's database, assuming that the Data Protection Act 1998 has been complied with properly, may be valuable during an election or in support of a campaign. An example cited earlier was the database of people who had made large donations to political parties, but there are other areas where electronic data would be particularly valuable--telephone directories, for example. How will those be valued: to the purchaser at the time of purchase, at their value on the commercial market--they may not even be on that market--or in some other way? 
<P>
All those problems can be overcome but if the Electoral Commission states that the way of valuing electronic databases is by the cost of the CDs or by some other factor, everyone knows where they stand and will not experience the difficulties that would otherwise occur. Similarly, on the loan of cars or other vehicles: is the commercial value of someone lending me a car for a campaign--this has not happened, it is merely a hypothetical example--the commercial value of what I would have to pay Avis Rent a Car, for example, to hire a car for three weeks, or is it the minimal cost of the petrol used? Between those two figures is scope for a great deal of discussion. We have mentioned the calculation of the cost and value of sound systems. That difference between cost and value may be one of the issues that are making the definitions so difficult. It may be possible to ascertain cost in some detail, but value may be less clear cut. 
<P>
To come closer to home, or to election time, it is probably commonplace for political parties to hire out equipment to their election agents during campaigns so that the capital cost is defrayed over a number of years. That principle could be brought into the Bill in relation to third parties and to national campaigns--and could lead to disputes. Indeed, it will inevitably lead to disputes because the Bill is designed to create a great deal of transparency and public scrutiny. Political parties and university research departments will be crawling over the first set of returns to find out as much as they can about their opponents and others. The determination of certainty is crucial if the Bill is to be implemented smoothly. 
<P>
I may have tabled the amendment in relation to the wrong clause and this may be the wrong place for the debate, but we need to have it somewhere and we need some of the outcomes that I have suggested. I urge the Minister to look carefully at an Electoral Commission code dealing with expenditure and value as an alternative to, but not a replacement for, the mechanism in the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I shall pick up on the point that the intention of the Bill is to change behaviour. Openness and transparency will lead to changed behaviour in political parties and by their candidates and agents. I picked up the phrase "sorting out the good guys from the bad guys"; I know several electoral agents, and understand that distinction. 
<P>
The first point to acknowledge is that we have had such a discussion before. Indeed, it is a theme that has run through the Committee. I apologise if the hon. Gentleman feels that I am not taking the amendment seriously. It is an important issue, and we must try to get it right, as we have tried to do throughout our proceedings in Committee. 
<P>
Another theme that has run through the Committee and that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield has pursued vigorously is the defence clause, under which a person must act properly and not recklessly, in good faith. We have inserted such clauses throughout the Bill. One of my tasks, scheduled for the end of our consideration of the Bill, is to ensure that all those defence clauses link together. Discussion on the amendments should be viewed against that background. If it can be demonstrated that the person responsible for the return acted in good faith, to the best of his ability, and not recklessly, that constitutes a defence. 
<P>
In addition, the Electoral Commission will introduce a code of practice in order to deal with the responses that were received during the drafting and in response to the draft Bill. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove suggested that the code should include accountancy advice. The Electoral Commission will consider our debate carefully, and that may be relevant. However, we should not over-egg the pudding. We are all familiar with market valuations: we all sell or buy property, and are used to obtaining valuations for houses, for example. We may change our values or our estate agent, but by and large the valuation is roughly the same. 
<P>
The expected valuation has been calculated roughly. An independent valuer would not, as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield suggested, be involved. The person completing the return must make a best estimate, which can easily be done by making a few inquiries. By and large, the valuation will be understood and accepted, even though some variation may be involved. People will know what the valuation is and that it is liable to be checked, and, if they have any wisdom, might make a few phone calls. 
<P>
The Electoral Commission will not crawl over the returns. It will investigate valuations if they seem wildly inaccurate. A good example is the cost of a helicopter, which is expensive but relatively easy to define, and another is the cost of providing a car during a campaign. I am not sure which hire firm was mentioned, but a couple of phone calls to hire firms would give a valuation. I wish to reassure the Committee that it is an imprecise science. That is the nature of valuations. 
<P>
The hon. Members for Beaconsfield and for Hazel Grove recognise in their amendments that this is a difficult area. Amendment No. 102 would insert the phrase 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or the nature of the property provided".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The example was given of a computer--not the best of examples--and of the person completing the return asking the Electoral Commission to make a valuation. It is a recognition of the problem. It is a possible approach, but it is better if the third party takes responsibility. 
<P>
Amendment No. 92, tabled by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, would provide in proposed paragraph (C) that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the operation of subsection (B) is without prejudice to any alternative market valuation that may be submitted to, and agreed by, the Electoral Commission in any particular case."
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That is a clear recognition of the fact that there is no right answer, but that the answer could be the subject of negotiation. 
<P>
I understand those concerns, but we shall draw the attention of the Electoral Commission to the fact that a good code of practice will help resolve the problem. Secondly, the Bill contains defence clauses giving people the defence that they had acted in good faith and to the best of their ability. 
<P>
I return to where I started. Having to make those returns in the public domain will make people reflect more carefully on the matter. We have joked before about a new army of researchers crawling over people's affairs. It would be sad if that happened, but if people believe that they could be challenged, they will act more responsibly, more reliably and more consistently. I have said several times during our debates that, in the light of experience, the commission may want to bring forward new guidance. 
<P>
The commission helped in preparing the Bill by working with parties to ensure new systems that will work. If the provisions of part X turn out to be difficult, complex or even impossible, it would be within the commission's gift to revise its guidance. We are looking for a light touch; we want the commission to interfere only if the bad guys are found operating on the fringes of the law. I am not confident that I have satisfied the Committee on the point, but I invite my hon. Friends to resist the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his full answer to the points that I raised, and, if I dare speak on his behalf, those matters raised by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. The problem with setting up statutory bodies is that they will usually have a measure of discretion about how best to go about the business of implementing what Parliament intended. The Minister is right; it is to be hoped that someone on the Electoral Commission will read the report of our proceedings, in which case there will not be much doubt as to what we or the Government intended. Our intentions would be found to be identical. There is no difficulty about that. I retain a concern about the matter and about whether some slightly more precise definitions could be provided of the requirements upon persons concerned. I do not know enough about the matter to know it as an analogy to other legislation that could be prayed in aid. 
<P>
11.30 am 
<P>
The Minister should not treat the matter as closed. He should go away and think again about the wording and whether a new clause could be introduced to make the scope of what is intended clear. People are clearly intended to make reasonable estimates based on their own judgments and obvious inquiries. An example springs to mind that has happened, and would probably be classed as a third-party donation. If someone lent a car or a battle bus to a Member to travel around in during an election campaign, its value could easily be estimated by ringing up the man who owned it and asking how much it would cost to hire. That would be relatively easy for a layman. 
<P>
When one comes to the loan of office equipment, however, much will depend on the age of the equipment. Some people charge to value those items commercially on a daily basis. Unless the average layman happens to have input into that professional world, he may find that his valuations are greatly at variance with what the commercial valuation would be. He would probably have no idea about such commercial valuations. There is even a risk in many cases that he would overestimate the value of what he gets. 
<P>
I agree with the Minister that it is not possible for Parliament to lay down precise rules, but we must at least ensure that the Bill makes it clear that we do not suggest that a whole commercial valuation system will be brought into play to back up political parties or third-party submissions on such matters. That brings us back to the amendment tabled by hon. Member for Hazel Grove. If we can do that, I will be relatively happy to leave the matter to the discretion of the Electoral Commission thereafter, but at the moment I am not completely satisfied that we have done that. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity afforded by other stages of the Bill to consider the matter further. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> To reassure the hon. Gentleman, I should say that we reflect at regular intervals on what is said in Committee. If it is possible to do better, we will. We all acknowledge the problem, but we are not clear what the solution is. I am not making any commitment other than to reflect on what has been said. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Minister and do not want to take up the Committee's time any further, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Clause 79 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 80 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Expenditure by third parties which is not controlled expenditure </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Some of clause 80 may be superfluous, and I want to probe the Minister about why it was necessary to include certain provisions in it. I am grateful to the Minister for explaining why reference is made separately in the Bill to the Welsh Channel 4, S4C--Sianel Pedwar Cymru. He said that, unlike Channel 4, it is not a licensed service under the Broadcasting Acts. 
<P>
Clause 80(2) lists exemptions from the clause and refers to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the publication of any matter relating to an election, other than an advertisement, in-- (i) a newspaper or periodical, (ii) a broadcast made by the British Broadcasting Corporation or by Sianel Pedwar Cymru, or (iii) a programme included in any service licensed under Part I or III of the Broadcasting Act 1990 or Part I or II of the Broadcasting Act 1996".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The BBC charter and the Broadcasting Acts would preclude such services from carrying advertisements of a political nature anyway so, unless I have missed a point, the clause seems superfluous. We are all accustomed to political advertising in newspapers and periodicals, but not to political advertising, other than party political broadcasts, on licensed or chartered broadcasting services. Either such provisions are unnecessary because they are covered elsewhere in legislation or I may have missed something. I should be grateful to receive the Minister's guidance. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Member for North Dorset acknowledged that we have discussed the matter before and that I wrote to him about it. I draw the Committee's attention to the Library's extremely helpful research paper entitled "The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill--Referendums and Broadcasting", the latter part of which contains some of the complicated and historic arrangements that surround election broadcasts. When we debate part I of the Bill on Report, there will be an opportunity to discuss such issues. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the scope of clause 80(2)(a), which reflects section 75 of the Representation of the People Act 1983. Without that provision, a current affairs programme could be construed as controlled expenditure. It is not dealing with advertisements, because that would be unlawful. The subsection gives television companies the opportunity to report on current affairs as part of their normal programming. It is not a prohibition and it is important that a current affairs broadcast can report the news, as it were. That is the intention of the Act. I was surprised by the specific point that the hon. Gentleman raised and will write to him about it later in the week. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Miller </B>(Ellesmere Port and Neston): I refer to subsection (2)(a)(i) and its relationship with the status of advertisements appearing in other media, such as the internet, especially those that may be replications of newspaper advertisements. The Daily Telegraph, for example, can now be read from cover to cover on the internet. If it chose to reproduce such advertising, where would that fit in the context of the clause? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> My hon. Friend has a great interest in those matters. He has been involved in discussions outside the Committee and knows about the complications posed by the new media such as the internet. I am told that "publish" refers to publication in any form, which must include electronic forms. The move towards new technologies and how they affect the Bill have been discussed before by the hon. Member and other hon. Members. The hon. Gentleman raises the wider issue of how new technology will affect the Bill and other legislation. We do not seem sufficiently to understand that the world is changing and that thinking is changing. We are in a new industrial revolution. That is not a matter for the Committee, but it is a matter for us that we ensure that the legislation reflects the new technology and the importance of the internet. I am keen to ensure that we bring the Bill as close as possible to the frontier of change. There will be further discussions on the matter before the Bill is enacted. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 80 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 81 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Third parties recognised for the purposes of this Part </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 76, in page 52, line 24, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(d) specifies either the whole or the part or parts of the United Kingdom in which expenditure is to be incurred'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 77, in page 130, line 8, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(3A) For the purposes of subparagraphs (2) and (3), and Part VI, a "part of the United Kingdom" may consist of any two or more parliamentary constituencies, or one or more local government areas'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
No. 78, in page 130, line 23, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(e) in relation to any smaller part of England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland the same proportion of the total sum for each that the number of parliamentary constituencies in that smaller part bears to the total number of such constituencies in the relevant part of the United Kingdom'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The amendment would strengthen the Bill in regard to third-party bodies by introducing a provision that where they operate in a part of the United Kingdom smaller than its constituent countries, as set out in schedule 9(3)(2), their expenditure limit should be capped in proportion to the size of the area that they are dealing with. Under schedule 9(3)(2)(a), a third-party body operating in England alone should be allowed to spend a substantial amount of money--an amount, indeed, that almost defies belief: £793,500. However, a third-party body might have a much more limited, perhaps geographically limited, objective. An absurd example that has featured before in our discussion is the Hazel Grove bypass; it affects five constituencies, three of which happen to be represented by members of the Committee: the hon. Members for Cheadle (Mr. Day), for High Peak (Mr. Levitt) and me. It is not likely but it is certainly feasible that a third party body in favour of--or even against--the Hazel Grove bypass might seek to put across that point of view at a general election. Nothing in the Bill would stop that third party body spending £750,000 to get its view across in each of those five constituencies. I might be wrong--I might have missed something--but I wonder whether the Minister is satisfied that the Bill would provide sufficient restraint in that extreme and absurd example. 
<P>
<H5>11.45 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 76, tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), states that, among other things, the third party body has to specify 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"either the whole or the part or parts of the United Kingdom in which expenditure is to be incurred".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I freely concede that it would have helped if I had tabled a relevant amendment to schedule 9 to say what the consequences would be, but I would certainly expect a proportionate scaling down of the total expenditure allowed by the third party body. Even if my precise example is absurd, other examples are quite likely, with regional campaigns or sub-regional campaigns run by bodies dealing with a particular theme, such as the Severn barrage. So far as I am able to determine, nothing in the Bill would prevent the full force of the national expenditure limit on third party bodies from being brought to bear on such a proposal. 
<P>
The Minister will appreciate that I moved the amendment to allow me to explore a point rather than propose a change, but I should be grateful to hear his response. Will he agree to reconsider the provision, or is he satisfied that the Bill would prevent the sort of mischief that I have outlined?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I shall elaborate on what was said by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. He has raised a most interesting point. 
<P>
The Committee might recall that on Second Reading, the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) showed a postcard with his photograph on it, which was issued by the Democracy Movement. Similar postcards circulate in my constituency, not with the hon. Gentleman's photograph but with mine. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> And mine. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> And the hon. Gentleman's; I am sure that his is a much more flattering photograph than the one that circulates in my constituency. The Democracy Movement has allegedly targeted 222 constituencies in the United Kingdom. I am sure that it would be happy to be recognised as a third party seeking to influence a parliamentary election by spending just under £1 million. However, that expenditure was concentrated on certain constituencies. 
<P>
Although I have sympathy with the amendment, the Democracy Movement's campaign is not limited to a particular area, but is concentrated on specific constituencies and it could have a disproportionate effect. If a body such as the Democracy Movement wished to influence the election it could choose a dozen parliamentary seats in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It could spend £1 million in only five marginal seats in a bid to influence the outcome of an election or to ensure that someone sympathetic to its cause who might not otherwise be elected was elected to the House of Commons. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove has made a fascinating point, and I am intrigued to discover how the Parliamentary Secretary will respond. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> It is a fascinating point that raises some interesting, difficult and complex issues. However, whether we can find a practical solution to it at this stage is a moot point. 
<P>
I was minded to agree to amendment No. 76 in principle, but, unfortunately, the speech that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove made in support of it has slightly put me off. The amendment would insert a new subsection that would read: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"specifies either the whole or the part or parts of the United Kingdom in which expenditure is to be incurred".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I thought that that referred to the different national parts of the UK--England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland--which, to some extent, the Bill already reflects. Subsection (1)(b) 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"states the limit or limits in question",
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
which, I accept, is unclear. Although I may have misunderstood what the hon. Gentleman proposes, I intend to introduce an amendment on Report that specifies a breakdown of the national parties. 
<P>
The more interesting and complex debate relates to the Hazel Grove bypass and the Democracy Movement. The hon. Member for North Dorset referred to third parties focusing their spending. Under amendment No. 77, a third party might have to introduce schemes that involve all constituencies and all possible variations. Mathematically, therefore, the number of options would be extremely great. As the Hazel Grove bypass involves just five permutations, such a scheme might be possible. However, in the case of the Democracy Movement--I am delighted to learn that handsome photographs of my colleagues from all parts of the political spectrum are being circulated around the country--222 constituencies are involved. I am not sure of the intention of either the campaign or Mr. Paul Sykes, who is behind it. Clearly, however, in dealing with those 222 constituencies, as we move closer to an election, it might be possible to change spending plans. Many variations are possible. 
<P>
Although I understand hon. Members' desire for the Bill to be more precise and to specify that third parties spell out where they intend to spend their campaign money, and am happy to consider the matter, at this stage I cannot see how we can devise a scheme to reflect all possible variants, which would give the third party and the commission fairly onerous responsibilities. A third party could focus on one or any number of the 651 parliamentary constituencies involved, so an extremely large and complex scheme would emerge. I understand the desire for knowledge of how the third party is to spend its money. Earlier, we discussed the position in North Dorset and the south-west. The Hazel Grove bypass campaign was also mentioned. I cannot see how to resolve the matter which, as has been said, is fascinating and of great interest to academics. 
<P>
The best that I can do for the hon. Member for Hazel Grove is accept the principle of amendment No. 76 on the understanding that it relates to the sub-nations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. I accept points made about the need for more precise and smaller definitions in relation to the Hazel Grove bypass campaign and the democracy campaign. I am not convinced, however, that such a scheme can be designed, although I am prepared to have further discussions with hon. Members. On that basis, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Minister, not least for his willingness to accept an amendment that does not mean what he thought it did. It will be interesting to see how we proceed. 
<P>
Combining my examples with those provided by the hon. Member for North Dorset, one could imagine a Devon and Cornwall democracy campaign and a Lancashire and Cheshire democracy campaign. 
<P>
<B>Ms Candy Atherton </B>(Falmouth and Camborne): I fear that it would not be a Devon and Cornwall campaign, but a Cornwall campaign. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Of course, the campaign might make the mistake of associating the two counties in its name. We cannot necessarily account for the folly of our opponents on such matters. However, the Minister has conceded that one could multiply the expenditure of third party bodies by making a geographical subdivision in England. That might seem unlikely, but it relates to my question about expenditure ballooning in loopholes. Therefore, setting up regional campaigns, rather than a national third party campaign, would completely bypass the provision. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point about regional campaigns. Indeed, the concept is relatively easy to grapple with. However, issue-led campaigns run across regions. There are real problems  in tackling the matter by using existing parliamentary constituencies as building blocks. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I do not deny that there are real problems, which I trust the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials will solve. I am pointing out that the problem might be more substantial than the Parliamentary Secretary believed. A national campaign or single-issue campaign wishing to spend more than the limit provided for in schedule 9 merely has to set itself up as a Yorkshire and Humberside campaign and a Devon and Cornwall campaign to have twice as much expenditure at its disposal. 
<P>
I believe that the Minister fully comprehends the issue and hope that a solution will be found. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
12 noon 
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I do not want to delay the Committe for long, but a question arose when I read the clause. When I read it again, a related question arose by which I am somewhat more disturbed. I am sure that the Minister can answer the first question easily and quickly. When we debated political parties in Northern Ireland, we laid down all sorts of exemptions and bases on which the Secretary of State could exempt Northern Ireland parties from certain provisions. It occurred to me that it may have been in the minds of those drafting the legislation that a third party in Northern Ireland may be exempt from some of the provisions of clause 81. I would not want a third party to be exempt. As we have argued, we are not in favour of special provisions for Northern Ireland. I would be interested to know whether the Minister has that in mind. 
<P>
As I pondered that question and considered the clause--I also examined schedule 10, which is relevant to the control of donations to recognised third parties--I was intrigued that it does not say that a recognised third party has to be a United Kingdom citizen, or that the individual must be on an electoral register. It provides that a company must have a registered name and office and a registration number, which I presume refers to the Companies Act. There is also a fascinating turn of phrase about notifications from unincorporated associations needing to state 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "the name of the association"
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
and 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the address of an office of the association in the United Kingdom"
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
as though the association might have offices outside the UK. 
<P>
Although we have gone to great lengths in the rest of the Bill to ensure that we prevent foreign influence over our electoral process, one could be a recognised third party without necessarily being a UK citizen or an association in the UK. One could be a foreign body. 
<P>
We must consider schedule 10, which contains all sorts of controls on donations, with clause 81 in mind. If one does not become involved in the donation phase, there may be a way under the legislation for foreign individuals or organisations to influence the outcome of elections in the United Kingdom. That relates to companies, individuals and possibly associations that might trade for some purpose. I would be intrigued to know whether the Minister has a simple answer, or whether the matter was considered by those who drafted the legislation. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Member for North Dorset has raised two points but, as he said, they are related. Third parties in Northern Ireland are covered by the Bill, as we intended. We did not intend to use the provisions in clause 63 for the Secretary of State to exempt third parties in Northern Ireland, as the clause clearly refers to political parties. 
<P>
It would be contra to the freedom of speech provisions of the European convention on human rights for foreign nationals living in the UK to incur expenditure as a third party. I am a bit suprised at that, I shall consider the subject, and I promise to send a second letter to the hon. Gentleman about it. 
<P>
The broader issue is that the Bill is designed to prevent foreign funding from entering the political system. We intend that foreign funding should not come through political or third parties. The hon. Gentleman is a fair man. Clause 81 is a lengthy clause and it is designed to stop foreign donations through third parties. I shall check that the Bill is watertight or fireproof--whichever figure of speech is being used today--and comeback to him on it.

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> When the Minister first said that the European convention on human rights would cover my point, I thought that he meant that it would prevent foreign individuals from setting themselves up as third parties. I then realised that the European convention on human rights meant that we could not prevent foreign individuals from being third parties. Such an argument drives a coach and horses through the provision.

In view of his assurances, I am confident that such matters will be covered. As it stands, the clause is seriously deficient in that it criminalises individuals. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Let me reinforce the hon. Gentleman's confidence. We accept, in principle, amendments Nos. 104, 106 and 109. They reflect what the hon. Gentleman said earlier when he referred to improving the Bill. We shall change the wording of the amendments, but they have been helpful. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> As for amendment No. 104, the Minister concedes that the Bill does not include a "reasonable excuse" provision for the restriction on incurring controlled expenditure if a person exceeded it, even quite innocently, as one would normally expect in legislation of this sort. 
<P>
Amendment No. 106 would amend clause 85, which deals with restrictions on making claims in respect of controlled expenditure. We have already spoken about that in relation to political parties. The intention behind the amendment is that if someone inadvertently made such a payment, they should not needlessly be criminalised. Amendment No. 109 would amend clause 91. It skips a long way ahead, but a common theme runs through the amendments. Clause 91 deals with submissions of returns to the commission--another topic that we touched on in relation to political parties. Again, the responsible person commits an offence even if he has a reasonable excuse. Having been given the reassurance that the Minister will redraft my amendments in better form, I shall move away from that topic. 
<P>
The Committee will be reassured to learn that that leaves only amendment No. 105. That amendment, too, covers a topic that we have already discussed. It would amend clause 84, and it is about financial limits. Clause 84(2) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Any payment made in respect of any such expenditure by a person within paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (1) must be supported by an invoice and a receipt unless it is less than £100."
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I canvass the notion that the £100 limit on third party expenditure could be raised. By their nature, third parties may be organisations that would be even less well-trained as to the Bill's requirements, and it may be more likely that they would inadvertently exceed that limit. The Minister may say that the sooner we put third parties on a similar footing to political parties the better. If that is the Government's intention, and if the Minister is happy to justify it, I shall be interested to hear it. 
<P>
The Minister will accept that, by their nature, third parties that are involved in election campaigns at the last minute are organisations of much looser structure than political parties. Therefore, the provision may be more onerous because they will not have had the necessary preparation to deal with the Bill's requirements. It is obviously a probing amendment, but it gives us the opportunity to think about how precisely we should impose duties and obligations on third parties. As we said when debating previous amendments, although third parties may have a major impact on election campaigns, one would not normally expect their import to be quite as great as that of the political parties that are seeking election. Is it right to tie them down as closely as political parties? 
<P>
I have nothing to say about the Government amendment. I know why the Minister has tabled it, and we have already debated the subject extensively. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I shall start with amendment No. 83. It flows naturally from amendment No. 58 moved by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, which the Committee accepted last week. To refresh the Committee's mind, it provides for payment within 42 days rather than 30 days. I am delighted that we have followed the course suggested by the hon. Gentleman. 
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
As I have said, the Government are inclined to accept amendments Nos. 104, 106, and 109 in principle. Those amendments take us back to our old friend the defence clause, which has been pursued vigorously during our debates, but they need to be improved, and I am prepared to do that. The word "knowingly" is used in amendment No. 106, but I remind hon. Members that ignorance of the law is not a defence. However, we shall take the broader issue and get it into shape. 
<P>
Amendment No. 105 is a probing amendment. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield rightly said that, in practice, third parties might not be as well organised as mainstream political parties. Is the right figure £100, or should it be £200? I have no strong feelings about the amendment, which would raise the de minimis provision. I shall explain why the figure of £100 has been used. The provision is based, as is much of the Bill, on the Representation of the People Act 1983, under section 73 of which the de minimis figure is set at £20. The view was that moving from £20 to £100 would allow significant leeway. 
<P>
It is a matter of judgment whether a figure of £100 or £200 is more realistic for a well organised, or even a poorly organised third party. We are involved in the old discussion about what the norm should be and what the relative value of £100 or £200 is in North Dorset or Beaconsfield, compared with Sherwood or Hazel Grove. The sum of £100 is a relatively relaxed figure when compared to £20 in the 1983 Act. I am inclined to stick with £100, but as I have said frequently, there are no magical right answers; it is a matter of judgment and, on balance, the judgment is right. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for answering that query. I do not want to take up the Committee's time on that point. However, the Minister referred to the word "knowingly" in amendment No. 106. Perhaps I should have explained the use of that word further, because I included it deliberately to stimulate discussion. The Minister is right that ignorance of the law is no excuse. Therefore, the word "knowingly" has a different thrust than the phrase "without reasonable excuse". 
<P>
I used the word "knowingly" in amendment No. 106 to clause 85(3) because someone might make a claim without knowing the circumstances in which it contravened the legislation. A person commits an offence if he 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"knowingly or without reasonable excuse"
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
pays any claim that by virtue of subsection (1) is not payable or he makes any payment in respect of a claim after the end of the period allowed under subsection (2). In reality, the words "reasonable excuse" probably cover the "knowingly" point. 
<P>
I included the word "knowingly" not to muddy the waters, but because it would give a cleaner defence. To show that there was a reasonable excuse often requires a great deal of explanation and justification. If someone has unknowingly done something, provided he can show that he was in ignorance of the precise circumstances, he is likely to get off, whereas under the reasonable excuse requirement he would have to show that it was reasonable that he had been ignorant of the precise circumstances. My proposal would therefore provide an easier defence for the person who, prima facie, might have committed the offence. 
<P>
I am mindful of the fact that the Minister will be guided by similar provisions in the Representation of the People Act 1983. I would be pushing my luck if I were to ask him to go beyond that. Perhaps, however, his officials would bear in mind my suggestion when they consider how best to draft these clauses. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> As I think I said to the hon. Gentleman, we are making excellent progress. I intend to ensure that all the defence clauses are drafted in an appropriate and similar way and we will, of course, take his comments into account. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I do not intend to take up any more of the Committee's time on these matters. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Although I did not draft an amendment to subsection (4), it is interesting because it provides that a person commits an offence if

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 107, in page 56, leave out lines 15 to 18. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 108, in page 56, leave out lines 31 to 34. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> By their very nature, these are probing amendments. I was tempted to have a discussion in the stand part debates on the preceding clauses as to the implications of this part of the Bill for small third parties--even those third parties that are not recognised as such. I shall discuss that when we come to the second of our amendments. 
<P>
Amendment No. 107 would delete the provisions whereby if a third party is an individual he is guilty of an offence if he knew or reasonably should have known that the expenditure incurred was in excess of that limit. It is a probing amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Perhaps I can check that I have understood the amendment correctly and that this relates to an individual. The clause states that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the third party is also guilty of an offence".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That may just be a drafting error but there is some tension between the two points. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> The Minister may have alighted on a drafting error. I shall reflect on that for one second. It was our intention to leave in the provision that the third party is guilty of an offence if the third party is an individual. The purpose of the amendment is to investigate and delve a little more deeply into the nature of offences as they relate to individuals. We are not in any way seeking to create gaping exemptions from the provisions, but I have a horror of the Electoral Commission chasing lots of little people all over the country who may or may not have committed an offence. I begin to wonder how big it will have to be to police the Bill. 
<P>
It is obviously fairly easy to identify organisation. It is relatively easy to identify companies. Identifying individuals at every stage in the game when the infringement may be quite minor is a different matter. As we said earlier when referring to Mr. Paul Sykes, the infringement could be quite significant but nevertheless he shelters behind an organisation in the shape of the Democracy Movement. How does the Minister envisage that the Electoral Commission will operate in those circumstances? The infringements might be quite localised. Will the Electoral Commission call on returning officers to act as a conduit for information about offences? Will it rely on aggrieved candidates and political parties in elections to provide information? Will it call on the scarce resources of the police and the Director of Public Prosecutions in what might be quite minor infringements? 
<P>
The amendment raises an intriguing point concerning subsection (4). It raises the question of expenditure incurred by a third party that is not a recognised third party. What will happen if that third party that is not a recognised third party is an individual who had been spending money--I am conscious of the de minimis limits in this--in all innocence, as he did not feel that he should be a recognised third party? Earlier, the Minister said that ignorance of the law was not a defence. However the European convention on human rights has been established, and in this country it is possible for individuals to do certain things at election time without necessarily feeling that that involves an election expense for a particular candidate or an expense for a particular cause. 
<P>
12.30 pm 
<P>
We are opening up a whole new area of law. Individuals--whether recognised or not as third parties--must have all their pre-election expenditure controlled, counted and audited and may find themselves falling foul of the law. We have tabled a series of probing amendments, designed to find out how the Parliamentary Secretary envisages the mechanics of the measure in relation to the Electoral Commission. How will the commission alight on those alleged offences, especially when individuals operating in localised environments fall foul of the measure? I am not clear about how the commission will operate in relation to offences, especially when committed by third parties who are not recognised as such under the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Again, I shall not detain the Committee for long. We have tabled two amendments, but additionally seek a wider definition of third parties. 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset has a good point. Generally speaking, third parties are campaigning organisations. Therefore, it is surprising that individuals should wish to interfere in the political process. Of course, the exception to that is individuals who, during an election campaign get worked up about matters and start putting out leaflets run off from their own photocopying machines, urging people to adopt a certain attitude or support--or refrain from supporting--certain candidates. They are the loose cannons of election campaigns and how much they choose to spend is difficult to unearth. How do they fit into the scheme of things? 
<P>
My hon. Friend said that such people would not be registered as third parties in the first place. What mechanism exists to enable them to register if they wish to intervene in that way? In my constituency there are many people--some of whom have bees in their bonnets--who would find it easy to spend £10,000 without noticing. Our amendments relate to whether a registered third party should be criminalised for failing to comply with the rules. As my hon. Friend said, such individuals are not part of an organisation, so they may be at greater risk of incurring criminal sanctions. However, that does not mean that they should be allowed to escape them altogether. 
<P>
I would be grateful if the Minister would help on a problem that we should perhaps have dealt with earlier. On a purely personal basis, someone with substantial sums of money might want to intervene in an election campaign at the last minute, by starting to distribute literature that does not appear to relate to any specific organisation. What will be the controls in this framework on such a maverick individual? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am pleased at the outset that we have cleared up what the amendment is really about. For the convenience of the Committee, let me say that I think that the hon. Member for North Dorset would like amendment No. 107 to leave out not lines 15 to 18 but lines 16 to 18, and would like amendment No. 108 to leave out not lines 31 to 34 but lines 32 to 34. Those changes would leave the third party in. The comments that he has made and our discussions have been almost exclusively about individuals. 
<P>
I remind the Committee that de minimis principles apply. Subsection (5) refers to figures of £10,000 for England and £5,000 for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. I think that that will satisfy many of the points. Throughout our discussions, hon. Members have stressed that we should not put undue responsibilities and handicaps on smaller parties and smaller third parties. I think that £10,000, and £5,000 in addition for other parts of the country, will deal with the situation of someone who, at an election campaign, becomes enthused by an issue and begins to roll the printing press. I do not think that people use duplicators these days. It would be hard to spend £10,000, even in support of any action group in Hazel Grove. That turns the coin over. The intention of this part of the Bill is to consider not those who were described as little people, but big people such as millionaires. Mr. Paul Sykes, who is involved in the so-called Democracy Movement, has been mentioned on Second Reading and today. It would be conceptually possible for an individual to spend large sums of money during an election campaign on his or her own account. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I am not trying to outsmart the learned brains of the Opposition, but as my hon. Friend the Minister knows, I have considered the subject in relation to other amendments. Section 106 of the RPA seems to cover the point, in the sense that there are already provisions to deal with the rogue who might make false statements about a candidate. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I had better check what section 106 says, but I am sure that he and his German research assistant have worked hard on the matter. A millionaire could spend large sums of money, and I see no reason why there should not be provisions in the Bill to catch such a person. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield asked what the position would be, in relation to the Electoral Commission, of someone who suddenly became enthused during an election campaign. Election campaigns generate excitement for some people, but for others they are rather a chore. They can enthuse people at the last minute, and late runners and riders may emerge. Under clause 81(2)(a), the person involved would have to contact the commission. It would not matter how late that was done, provided that spending was accounted for over a period. The Bill relates to expenditure over a period rather than the usual campaign period to which we have become accustomed. I hope that that satisfies the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary has gone some way to answering the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and I have made. The amendments were intended to be probing. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Clause 87 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Schedule 9 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Limits on controlled expenditure </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Ninth schedule to the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Schedule 9 contains the various formulae for determining how much a third party may spend on an election. It also covers overlaps of elections, under part III, which deals with limits applying in special circumstances, which I shall discuss in a moment. 
<P>
Two general points should be made, both of which relate to overlaps. Part I of the schedule, which deals with interpretation, specifically mentions an example that occurred to me before I had even read the schedule. In determining whether expenditure relates to a particular part of the United Kingdom, the schedule provides "so that, for example"-- interesting phraseology for a piece of legislation-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"expenditure on an advertisement in a newspaper circulating in Wales is to be attributed solely to Wales if the newspaper does not circulate to any significant extent in any other part of the United Kingdom".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Wales has two daily newspapers, one of which, the Daily Post, circulates to a significant extent in both north Wales and Merseyside. If an advertisement were placed in the main section of the Daily Post, might it be determined that the newspaper did not circulate to a significant extent in other parts of the United Kingdom, even though it clearly does? Those who purported to conduct a third-party campaign could claim that it was a national campaign, a United Kingdom campaign or a campaign for England and Wales, even though they wanted to influence the election in Wales. As I said earlier in discussing the possibility of political parties fielding paper candidates, it is conceivable that people who want to influence a campaign in a specific geographical area mentioned in the Bill or, as in the case that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove cited, in even smaller geographical areas, may be able unduly to influence activities in that area by claiming that expenditure relates to a national campaign. 
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
I am still concerned, even with the implications of the schedule, that ostensibly third parties concerned with specific campaigns that may be located regionally could use the schedule to influence unduly activities in specific areas of the United Kingdom. A similar argument can be advanced about overlaps. The schedule deals in detail with the specific sums that can be spent in general election campaigns, European Parliament campaigns and campaigns relating to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly. As for general election campaigns and European Parliament campaigns, the expenditure is divided into such campaigns for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 
<P>
I am concerned about a combination of election campaigns, such as if, for example, the European Parliament campaign overlaps with those for the devolved assemblies. We must bear in mind that they are predictable campaigns, because we know the dates on which they take place. A general election might be pending, too. Let us imagine that an organisation sought to influence the outcome of the European Parliament election campaign, which, although it has significantly lower limits than a general election campaign, might be considered to be equally important and as expensive in relation to national expenditures and so on. That organisation could create its Welsh branch, which could then claim that some of its expenditure went on influencing elections to the Welsh Assembly, while its Scottish branch could claim to be spending money to affect elections to the Scottish Parliament. Despite the fact that a token advertisement may have been placed in a Welsh newspaper relating to the Welsh Assembly, for example, the expenditure could have related to the European Parliament election campaign. 
<P>
I would not describe such action as an abuse of the Bill, because such organisations will use it to the best of their advantage. Obviously, if an organisation can piggyback a series of campaigns when a general election is pending, the figure involved will increase and the organisations will use the schedule in their defence and say that such expenditure is permitted and can be applied to their particular campaign. When such overlaps occur, expenditure can be increased by bringing into play other elections that may not otherwise be relevant to the particular campaign that is being promoted by the recognised third party. 
<P>
Opposition Members are wholly in favour of putting into effect the recommendations of the Neill report. We accept that the schedule brings into play many of the recommendations made by Neill made with regard to third parties, but the mischievous part of me suggests that some organisations may use schedule 9 to tinker a little bit here and there in order to up the amount of money that they can use to further their cause and to get those candidates whom they favour elected at subsequent elections. 
<P>
The Bill goes into a lot of detail about time limits, sums of money, dividing up the country and so on, but I wonder whether we may have missed the wood for the trees. The Bill contains some incredibly detailed provisions but it is possible that they could be open to abuse. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The hon. Member for North Dorset referred to Members on the Opposition Benches, but what he said does not apply to all of them. The schedule is a balanced provision. 
<P>
I remind the Minister, if he needs reminding, that effective working rules for apportioning expenditure in election campaigns are already in place. To make the provisions yet more complex to meet the point raised by the hon. Member for North Dorset would be a mistake. I do not know what the spin doctors would say about it, but spending on one election, in the circumstances described by the hon. Gentleman, would be pretty much the same as spending on others; that is how it is in real life. I hope that the Minister will not be tempted along the line suggested by the hon. Gentleman. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> In a nutshell, the hon. Member for Hazel Grove has opened up a bigger issue. I shall start with the smaller issue of newspapers, primarily in Wales, whose coverage spills into Merseyside. The hon. Member for North Dorset put his finger on an interesting point. He picked up on an exceptional piece of drafting. However, we must bear in mind that people will always argue about definitions. 
<P>
Throughout this morning's debates and during earlier sittings, we have talked about what is reasonable. A judgment will have to be made and, at the end of the day, the Electoral Commission might become involved. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I confess that when I read the schedule I interpreted it to mean that, if a newspaper had primarily a Welsh circulation but sold copies in London, mainly to those interested in Welsh affairs, it would be regarded as being primarily in Wales, but that if part of its regular catchment area, even a small part, extended across the border--perhaps it currently circulated in a few villages on the English side of the border--it could be argued that it did not come within that category. In the example given by my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset, such a newspaper would be bound to be deemed to be both a Welsh and an English newspaper. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am not sure whether that is bound to be the case. The phrase included the word "arguably". A Scottish newspaper or a Welsh newspaper that is read in London by relatively few people--perhaps Members of Parliament--would be outwith the Bill's provisions. It is arguable that a newspaper from Wales whose circulations spreads into the borders, even by a small amount, would not be caught by the phrase 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"no significant effects in any other part...of the United Kingdom".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman will permit me, I do not want to get into a detailed discussion on that point. However, I shall sit down to hear what he has to say. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's sitting down, because the Daily Post, which is based in Liverpool, has a significant circulation in north Wales. I am intrigued as to whether expenditure in the Daily Post would be third-party campaign expenditure in a Welsh campaign or whether it would be English expenditure. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Those are matters of judgment. I am not familiar with newspapers in Wales or in the north-west, but if the Daily Post, which is published in Liverpool, permeates the north Wales coast, and perhaps a little deeper into Wales, it clearly counts against both English and Welsh expenditure. That is clear cut. However, we are talking about a "significant effect". Differing judgments may be made about that, but we mentioned defences and reasonableness earlier today. 
<P>
The hon. Member for North Dorset was spot on in what he said about the schedule and its overlapping nature. I was involved in election campaigns in the spring of last year--not particularly successfully in the European elections, I am sorry to say--but we used the phrase "One campaign, two election days". We campaigned for the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament on 6 May, knowing that the European elections were to be held five weeks later. All my efforts as a mechanic, not a particularly successful one, were made in the knowledge that it was one campaign. What we said about the issues in Wales and Scotland and the local elections clearly had an effect on the European elections five weeks later. 
<P>
As the hon. Member for Hazel Grove recognised, the Bill is designed to acknowledge that. It would be possible for inventive parties who really wanted to fight in the European elections--not the best example, because they are held on fixed dates--to devise a scheme to set up a bigger campaign, drawing money from two headings when it was concentrating on only one issue. 
<P>
The provisions of schedule 9 exactly mirror those in schedule 8, which apply to political parties. Judgments need to be made, but the provisions are broadly right. It is important that people should know the rules. The private sector often says that it does not mind what the rules are, provided that people know that they are firm and established. The same argument applies here. Once people know the rules, they can operate under them. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am glad that the Minister should compare schedule 9 with schedule 8. However, schedule 8 is clear cut, because it relates to the candidates of the party. In schedule 9, there are no candidates. We are talking about someone who is trying to get their political opinion across, in the hope that it might affect the election of certain candidates. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> It is certainly someone trying to put across a political opinion, but the purpose is to affect the outcome of the election. That is what it is all about-- affecting the result for candidates or political parties. That is why it is important that schedule 9 should mirror the previous schedule. 
<P>
I have nothing to add to what was said by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. He obviously understands the
<P>
situation; and, in political terms, he is right. The schedule is well drafted. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
