							<a name="07052339000520"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls):
						</b> Thank you,
Mr. Illsley. I am pleased to welcome you back after our
morning&#146;s activities. We were discussing schedule 9 and I had
explained in extensive detail our approach to the schedule and our
targeted anti-avoidance rule. I was talking about the schedule in the
context of the extensive consultations that have been going on over the
last year on insurance tax
matters.</div>
					<a name="07052339000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
explaining at the end of our last sitting that there is a power in the
schedule to amend legislation for the start date of the TAAR by
regulation, which is a different approach because despite much hard
work, neither the Government nor the industry are yet fully satisfied
that the legislation will work exactly as we intend, as a number of
details remain to be sorted out. The pre-Budget report envisaged that
most of the legislation would operate from 1 November 2007, allowing
several months between finalisation of the rules and the start
date.</div>
					<a name="07052339000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, because
more time is needed for this schedule, commencement is now to be
determined by an appointed day order, which gives flexibility to allow
for several months between finalisation and its coming into effect,
whenever the form of the legislation is finalised. Changes to the
legislation that are needed to finalise it can be made by regulations,
using the power in schedule 9, which means that we do not have to wait
until the next Finance Bill or rush to get the final details right on
Report. The regulations will be introduced using the affirmative
resolution procedure to ensure that there is an opportunity for proper
scrutiny in due
course.</div>
					<a name="07052339000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation, as amended by any regulations, will come into effect from
a day to be appointed, which will depend on further consultations, but
which we would not expect to be before spring next year. However, we
are confident that with further consultation we will be able to get the
final details of the schedule sorted out. I commend the proposal to the
Committee.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): I welcome you to the Chair,
Mr.
Illsley.</div>
					<a name="07052339000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to ask
the Minister about the targeted anti-avoidance regime to which he
referred before the lunch break. As I understand it, the supplementary
avoidance rule contains a motive test and a pre-clearance test. I was
surprised and taken aback when I saw that there was a pre-clearance
test, because I remember the Minister lecturing me quite firmly in
connection with clause 27, saying that there was no need for such a
test. He
said:</div>
					<a name="07052339000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
amendments are unnecessary because the clause contains a main purpose
test, which means that it will apply only when a person has entered
into arrangements that have the main purpose of securing a tax
advantage, which is to say tax avoidance. Such schemes do not happen by
accident. They are the result of contrived circumstances in which
transactions are undertaken or carried out primarily to achieve a
desired tax effect, as opposed to a genuine economic
purpose&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07052339000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
continued:</div>
					<a name="07052339000440"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;That main
purpose may be inferred from the actions of the parties to the
arrangements, but it is best understood by the person making the
arrangements. It is therefore not necessary to set up a clearance
regime when the person best placed to judge whether the rule applies is
the person who makes a clearance
application.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Public Bill Committee
Finance Bill,</i> 17 May 2007; c.
223.]</div>
					<a name="07052339000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">It appears that there is
one rule for clause 27 and one rule for schedule 9. Having re-read the
Minister&#146;s explanation in our debate on Tuesday morning, I am
not clear why a clearance rule is right in schedule 9 but was not
appropriate for clause
27.</div>

							<b class="B">Rob
Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): Bearing it in
mind that the Committee is scrutinising the wording of the proposal,
among other things, I want to raise a rather more prosaic matter, and
my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary may wish to write to me about
what appears to be the most curious piece of drafting in the Bill, on
pages 156 and 157. Paragraph (10)(2) substitutes part of a sentence,
the final words of which are</div>
					<a name="07052339000441"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or as a business
transfer-out,&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07052339000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
continues:</div>
					<a name="07052339000442"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(3) In that
sentence (as amended by sub-paragraph (2))&#151;omit &#147;or as a
business transfer
out&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07052339000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I am reading
that correctly&#151;I might not be&#151;sub-paragraph (2) inserts
some words and sub-paragraph (3)(a) immediately removes some of them.
That seems very curious to me. Perhaps my hon. Friend could write to me
about it later.</div>
					
					<a name="07052339000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000523"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> I am very grateful for my hon. Friend&#146;s
commentary. The claim, &#147;This is the most curious piece of
drafting I have ever seen in a Finance Bill&#148; is, for him, one
hell of a claim. Whether it would stand the test of true scrutiny I do
not know. He has a fine track record of highlighting curious pieces of
drafting. I can only encourage him to participate fully, not only in
the next stage of our consultation but in the affirmative procedure
that we will apply to ensure that that drafting is fully reflected in
the final schedule. If I can shine any light on this particular
curiosity I shall be happy to write to my hon. Friend. I shall ensure
that all members of the Committee are copied and that the letter is
worth framing.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 313</div>
					<a name="07052339000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to the hon. Member
for Fareham for having highlighted the fact that we on this side of the
Committee do not take an over-dogmatic or idealistic approach to these
matters but are happy to proceed case by case on the basis of the
consultation and the evidence that arises in any particular
circumstance. Before Conservative Members get over-excited, it would be
foolish and wrong of me to lecture them, as Conservatives, on the
importance of precedent. That is clearly an important part of
conservatism, whatever&#151;I will not go there. I fear that the
issue of grammar schools might be ruled out of order, Mr.
Illsley.</div>
					<a name="07052339000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearance
procedures for transfer of business are in place under existing
legislation. We are replacing previous clearance procedures with a new
and more streamlined one. Unlike the discussion on the previous clause,
this is not a debate about whether to introduce a new clearance
procedure. Perhaps because of the complexity of the tax regime
legislation, clearance is judged to be desirable in this case from a
Financial Services Authority and court point of view. It was desirable
before and it will be in future. I hope that the hon. Gentleman finds
that to be an accurate, non-ideological and conservative answer to his
question.</div>

Balls:
						</b> I shall try to be brief, but at the same time to
provide a bit of context for the amendments in order to satisfy Members
on both sides of the Committee, who will be interested to know the
detail of the schedule.</div>
					<a name="07052339000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule contains a range
of measures to clarify and simplify miscellaneous
life assurance tax provisions, most of which arise from the life
assurance tax rules consultation process. I shall discuss the first of
them, covered by paragraphs 1 and 2, when I highlight the amendments.
The other important measure in schedule 10, packaged in paragraph 3, is
a reform of the treatment of so-called structural assets held by a life
insurance company in its long-term insurance fund. Structural assets
are held by an insurance company as part of its trading structure, as
opposed to assets that are expected to be turned over in the course of
its trade. A major example, and one included in the Bill, is shares in
subsidiary companies that themselves are insurance companies.</div>
					<a name="07052339000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, where structural
assets are held in a company&#146;s long-term insurance fund,
inappropriate tax rules can arise, because the life
insurance tax rules assume that all assets held in a long-term fund are
held 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div>or sold in the course of the company&#146;s insurance business. For
example, dividends from insurance subsidiaries through structural
assets are subject to corporation tax, whereas dividends from
structural subsidiaries of other types of trading company are
exempt.</div>
					<a name="07052339000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">As taxation of
life insurance companies is based on their regulatory returns, it
follows that write-downs can result in a tax deduction where there is
no economic loss. Following consultation with the life insurance
industry, we have introduced paragraph 3, which will reform the
taxation of structural assets, treating them as capital assets rather
than trading assets. Dividends from structural assets will be exempt
from tax, giving the insurance industry parity with other
traders.</div>
					<a name="07052339000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">A further
measure in paragraph 4 will remove the restriction on use of capital
losses where a life insurance company sells holdings in an authorised
unit trust or an open-ended investment company to the manager of that
trust or company, and that manager is a member of the same group of
companies as the life insurer. The capital gains rules impose
restrictions on the use of capital losses on all disposals between
connected parties, such as members of the same group. The policy reason
is that connected parties have opportunities to manipulate the
circumstances of the disposal that are not available to independent
parties.</div>
					<a name="07052339000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
where a life insurer disposes of holdings in unit trusts or open-ended
investment companies, both Financial Services Authority rules and life
insurance tax rules ensure that the disposal is at market value and
minimise opportunities for manipulation, regardless of who acquires the
assets. For that reason, the life insurance industry has argued that it
is unfair to restrict any losses arising. The Government accept its
argument, and schedule 10 will remove the restrictions.
</div>
					<a name="07052339000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The remainder of the
schedule comprises a general tidying up of life insurance tax rules,
modernising definitions, removing duplication by putting all
definitions in one place and repealing spent or obsolete provisions. I
look forward to the scrutiny of my hon. Friend the Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West and to seeing whether obsolescence and
obscurity have been fully
tackled.</div>
					<a name="07052339000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments will modify the new provisions in response to our
consultation. Paragraph 3 will reform the taxation of structural
assets, treating them as capital assets rather than trading assets.
Dividends from structural assets will now be exempt from tax, giving
the insurance industry parity. The schedule defines structural assets
initially as shares in and loans to subsidiaries of insurance companies
that themselves write insurance business. The measure also includes a
regulatory power to add to or amend the list of structural assets;
however, the life insurance industry will be consulted before that
power is exercised.</div>
					<a name="07052339000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
short time ago, the Association of British Insurers
and other parties sent a number of representations to
Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs about the new measures. At the
time, it was thought that the schedule would be debated last week, so
HMRC was able to deal immediately with only two straightforward points,
which are covered by Government amendments Nos. 91
and 92. But when debate on the schedule was deferred to today, I agreed
that further amendments&#151;Government
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 315</div>amendments Nos. 130 to 133&#151;should be tabled now, rather than on
Report, to give effect to many of the ABI&#146;s requests for
clarification and
relaxation.</div>

						</b> On a point of order, Mr. Illsley. I am
slightly confused as to whether there are two groups of amendments to
schedule 10 or one. There seems to be some interrelationship between
the two. I am not sure whether we are debating one group or two
separate
groups.</div>

amendments Nos. 90, 92 and 94 to 96, and Government amendments Nos. 130

referring to a group of 10 amendments, that he was not moving amendment
No. 130, which will be in the following group, and that he was simply
referring to the fact that they all apply to schedule 10. However,
there will be separate debates on both

						</b> I apologise to the hon. Member for Fareham: I did
not read fully and correctly the punctuation of the schedule before us.
It seemed to me that, to understand these amendments, it was important
to put them in the context of the schedule. With your permission,
Mr. Illsley, I should like to frame all the amendments
together, accepting your right not only to determine that we should
vote on separate groups but to allow a second debate on the second
group, if you prefer. It seems that the amendments are all of a piece,
as they emerged from a detailed set of consultations that I have been
able to update in recent days. There was not a principal distinction
between the two groups, but I am happy to take your guidance,
Mr.
Illsley.</div>

If it has no objection to taking both groups together, I have no

convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 92, 94 to 96, 130 to 133,

Balls:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>This is not about a difference of scope or
subject. Because we have had more time, we have been able to add
further amendments in recent days at the request of the ABI,
particularly Government amendments Nos. 131 to 133. We have tried to
add those amendments to meet the needs of the industry. There is one
case where we have changed the legislation to ensure that a company
cannot generate a loss earlier than it would do so naturally by moving
the asset around the company or its group.</div>
					<a name="07052339000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not
fully to the liking of the industry, but it was necessary to ensure
that we protected the Exchequer. However, I have asked HMRC to monitor
that rule carefully to ensure that it works properly, and not harshly.
I also know that the industry does not like the way in which section
83XA(6) deals with the capital gains treatment of structural assets.
That is not something 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 316</div>that we have been able fully to bottom in the consultation. The
ABI&#146;s preferred solution seemed to skew the results too far
towards an Exchequer loss, and both sides accept that that may be a
theoretical, rather than a substantial, point of difference. However,
it is an area where we are trying to do the right thing, while
protecting the revenue base. I am happy to give an assurance to both
the ABI and Opposition Members that we will keep that under review. The
amendments ensure that the structural assets are given in all cases,
including where the substantial shareholding exemption is relevant, and
where there is a transfer of business. I am happy to commend the
amendments to the schedule to the
Committee.</div>
					
					<a name="07052339000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000532"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I thank the Minister for his explanation of the
amendments, and of paragraph (3) on structural assets, which is a
difficult part of the legislation, as it affects life assurance
companies. Many such companies hold many structural assets in their
funds, which are available for use in certain circumstances to meet the
policy holders&#146; liabilities. There are some quite difficult
interactions with FSA rules and tax rules about the
valuation.</div>
					<a name="07052339000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should
like to raise three areas with the Minister in connection with those
rules. The first is the treatment of gains, which he has already
touched on, but I want to come back to it in a little more depth in a
minute. As I understand it, paragraph (3) excludes the movement in
value on insurance dependants from tax, so ending the double taxation
of insurance subsidiaries. Certainly in the past, although I am not
sure that it is the case now, life funds have held other trading
businesses within their funds. A distinction has been between those
involved in insurance business and those involved in non-insurance
business. I should like to understand why it is only insurance
dependants that have been excluded from
tax.</div>
					<a name="07052339000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second point
concerns interest. Movements in value on loans for insurance
subsidiaries will not be taxed and nor will the interest on those
loans. However, my understanding is that the interest deductions on the
other side of the loan transaction will be relievable against tax
credit. If the interest payable is subject to relief, why is the
interest receivable not going to be taxed? Does the Minister think it
appropriate for debts and loans to be included in our structural
assets? There is a slight risk that an asymmetrical treatment will
arise where life assurance companies engage in tax planning,
recognising the difference in treatment on the interest payable on
loans.</div>
					<a name="07052339000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third point
goes back to the central issue of the treatment of gains, on which
there is most debate between the Treasury and the ABI. Taxation is
charged when a qualifying asset leaves the long-term fund of the life
assurance company. That is determined by taking the difference between
the historic cost of the asset and its admissible value at the relevant
time, which is 1 January 2007 for existing assets, and the time that
the non-profit fund of the life assurer acquired the assets, for assets
acquired after that date.</div>
					<a name="07052339000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ABI believes that such
gains should be taxed as capital gains and therefore should attract
indexation to give them the same tax treatment as other companies.
There should also be an opportunity to compute such gains using either
the higher of the original base costs 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 317</div>or, where relevant, the market value at March 1982. Again, that is the
same treatment that is available to other businesses. It is a
consistency point between assets held by life assurance companies and
assets held by other companies. Will the Economic Secretary give us
some background on the reason why there is a difference in treatment?
Certainly, other businesses go through the process of being able to
have indexation gains and looking at the base cost of the 1982 market
value cost where that is appropriate. There seems to be a mismatch
between general business taxation and the taxation of life assurance
companies. Some issues of shareholder capital losses also float
through. It is not a particularly straightforward piece of legislation
which is why, despite the consultation that has been taking place since
June last year, we are still making changes as we approach the end of
May. The Government are still proposing changes, with the tantalising
prospect of further amendments to come. I should be grateful for some
clarification on those
points.</div>

							<a name="07052339000533"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> This is the last time that I will raise this
matter, but I do so because I am getting sick of it. Amendment No. 93
starts with the word, &#147;But&#148;. It is not only ungrammatical
but completely redundant. I have been making the point throughout the
Bill that I hope at least in next year&#146;s Finance Bill we can
have some decent and grammatical wording and not include redundant
words.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): This
morning, the Economic Secretary waxed lyrical about the consultation
process. He stressed its importance and the openness and trust that has
built up between the industry and the Government. Indeed, he was very
open and honest about some of the difficulties that arose in the autumn
of 2005, which he put down in part to a lack of consultation. Why,
therefore, does the ABI state in its briefing to members of the
Committee:</div>
					<a name="07052339000443"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;HMRC have tabled last
minute amendments, which have not been subject to the consultation
process and we are concerned at the late changes to legislation that
had previously been discussed at
length&#148;?</div>
					
					<a name="07052339000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000535"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> Let me answer those questions as briefly as I can.
On the subject of the word, &#147;But&#148;, we shall reflect and
try to draw wider lessons as part of the Finance Bill process about the
excessive use of that word at the beginning of sentences. The hon.
Member for Fareham made three points. The first concerned the
definition of structural assets and insurance dependants. Insurance
dependants are by far the most significant set of assets, which is why
the provision provides for them expressly. However, the schedule
includes the power to add other assets by means of regulation.
Discussion will continue, and if other assets need to be added to the
same category, that will be
possible.</div>
					<a name="07052339000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
misapprehension on the second point; interest receivable will be taxed,
so there is no asymmetry. On the third point, I refer the hon.
Gentleman to the industry views that I quoted in my introduction to
this part of the Bill. Ernst and Young&#146;s Budget website
said:</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 318</div>
					<a name="07052339000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A key lesson from the
life tax consultation is the efficiency of the working group approach.
The use of the working group as the primary means of progressing issues
of both broad policy and fine detail is now deeply embedded as a
feature of the regular working relationship between HMRC, industry and
advisors.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052339000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
constitutes substantial progress from where we were 18 months ago, so
although I do not hesitate to say that improvement was clearly needed,
I hope that that has been delivered.</div>
					<a name="07052339000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">There were late representations
from the ABI and others in relation to the new provision&#151;I do
not use the word &#147;late&#148; in a value-loaded way, I mean
merely that the issues arose late in the consultation. We could easily
have decided to postpone any attempt to sort those issues out, but we
decided that we could deal with Government amendments Nos. 91 and 92
consensually, when more time was available. The ABI requested
clarification and indeed relaxation, and our judgment in relation to
Government amendments Nos. 130, and 131 to 133, was that clarification
was the right course, even if we could not deliver the degree of
relaxation that the ABI wanted. I know that it is disappointing that we
cannot go as far as the industry would like, but we judged that maximum
clarity at this stage would be the better
choice.</div>
					<a name="07052339000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said, the issues are very complicated&#151;even more so than some of
those that we have already debated in connection with the relevant
clauses. We do not know how much the problem is theoretical rather than
real, and the best commitment that I can give to the ABI and to the
Committee is that we shall closely monitor the operation of the system.
If it works heavy-handedly or if there are indeed problems in relation
to capital gains treatment, we shall revisit the legislation. I have
already expressed my willingness to table further amendments or
regulations before next year if
necessary.</div>

							<a name="07052339000536"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I was not sure whether the Minister was about to
conclude, so may I prompt him to deal with my point about the different
treatment of gains on structural assets. Structural assets held by a
non-life insurance company will be subject to a different capital gains
tax regime from that which will apply to structural assets held within
life assurance funds. I should like to understand the reason for the
difference.

83XA(6), which deals with the capital gains treatment of structural
assets. It is a complex issue, which we are still trying fully to
understand, and the best that I can do is repeat that discussions with
the ABI will continue in the coming weeks. If I can give more detail to
the hon. Gentleman after that, and after further expert consultation, I
shall be happy to write him a letter. Pre-empting that would be

						</b> The schedule repeals complex mechanical tax rules
that were introduced in 2000 to limit any tax advantage if general
insurers&#146; provisions to meet policyholders&#146; claims were
greater than necessary. It provides for transition and a new set of
rules that will provide a more proportionate response for the tax risk.
The rules will be supplemented by regulations.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 321</div>
					<a name="07052339000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government amendments to the
schedule arise from discussion with Lloyd&#146;s. Government
amendments Nos. 76 and 77 will substitute for &#147;reinsurance to
close contracts&#148; the term &#147;reinsurance to close
amounts&#148;. Reinsurance to close is a mechanism by which a
Lloyd&#146;s syndicate closes its accounts. The commercial definition
of reinsurance to close has evolved over time. The amendments ensure
that the tax rule reflects the definition in Lloyd&#146;s rules and
that the schedule has its intended scope.</div>
					<a name="07052339000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government amendment No. 78 is
a response to the concern of Lloyd&#146;s that the schedule could
have unintended unfair results in particular circumstances. It will
enable the making of regulations to deal with those circumstances,
which include members leaving syndicates and members having their own
reinsurance arrangements in addition to arrangements that the syndicate
may have. Officials are discussing with Lloyd&#146;s an appropriate
solution to the issue, so draft regulations are not yet available to us
or to the Committee. Any regulations that are passed under the new
power would reduce or eliminate the effects of adjustments that would
arise under the schedule. They will be discussed in detail with
Lloyd&#146;s before they are laid. I commend the amendments to the
Committee.</div>

Committee. If it is the Committee&#146;s wish or if it would be
easier to take a general debate on clause 46 and the Government
amendments to schedule 13, we can do
that.</div>
					<a name="07052339000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the stand

Nos. 102 to 104 to schedule

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000546"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> Clause 46 introduces schedules 13 and 14. Schedule
13 constitutes a comprehensive new regime for the charge to corporation
tax of sale and repurchase transactions entered into by companies.
Those transactions are widely known as repos.</div>
					<a name="07052339000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 14 contains a number
of consequential amendments to other provisions of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988 made necessary by the repeal of the existing
provisions for taxing repos and their replacement by the rules in
schedule 13.</div>
					<a name="07052339000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The three
Government amendments make a minor modification to schedule 13. They
correct a defect that might have led to loss of tax. The new rules for
charging sales and repurchase agreements to corporation tax provide
that where a company sells securities under a repo, it is to be taxed
on income arising on the securities as if the sale had not taken place.
That is subject to the requirement that the company must recognise the
income in its accounts during the period of the
repo.</div>
					<a name="07052339000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">That requirement
may result in income falling out of the charge to tax in which the
borrower is taxed on a receipts basis in respect of income arising on
the securities. For accounts purposes, it recognises that income before
entering into the repo. In that case, it will not recognise the income
again during the repo. If the amendments were not made, the income
could not be charged to tax. The amendments, therefore, omit the
requirement that recognition of the income for accounts purposes must
take place in the same period in which the arrangement is in force.
That ensures that companies remain taxable on the income, provided that
that is reflected in their
accounts.</div>
					<a name="07052339000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments allow us to move forward with schedules 13 and 14. Repos are
widely used in the financial markets as a form of secured loan. They
involve the sale by a person of securities&#151;shares or
debentures&#151;under an agreement that those will subsequently be
repurchased at an agreed date at a price agreed at the outset. The sale
of the securities realises cash that is economically equivalent to a
loan that is repaid with interest, in the form of an increased
repurchase price, when the securities are bought back.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column323" />Column number: 323</div>
					<a name="07052339000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">As hon. Members know, at the
time of the pre-Budget report we made a formal announcement of our
intention to consult on new legislation in this area. Since then, there
has been detailed consultation. HMRC has sought the views of interested
parties on the way forward, including on the draft legislation. The
consultation has been very constructive; we believe that we have given
all interested parties an opportunity to ensure that the new
legislation works properly. However, if business representatives
consider that there are difficulties or strong reasons why the
commencement should not happen on 1 October as specified, we will
consider what they say.</div>
					<a name="07052339000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
complex area. However, given our consultation, we should be able to go
for commencement on 1 October. That will give business sufficient time
to prepare for the new rules and accounts and for how lenders will be
taxed. As I said, this is a modernisation of the interaction of tax and
accounting; it will reduce the amount of legislation devoted to repos
and simplify the current rules.</div>
					<a name="07052339000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer to the question put
by the hon. Member for Fareham is yes. The details will be set out in

Hoban:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. Illsley, for that rapid
canter through the provisions on insurance. Now I shall slow down the
Bill&#146;s progress&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> Well, I shall slow
it just a little, to ensure proper scrutiny of this important schedule
about how the Government have chosen to effect their response to the
Cadbury Schweppes judgment on controlled foreign companies.</div>
					<a name="07052339000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth starting with a
general point about the whole interaction between our taxes and EU law;
my hon. Friends will be keen for me to make it. We had a lengthy debate
on the issue in last year&#146;s Finance Bill Committee, although we
do not intend to reprise that at any great length this
year.</div>
					<a name="07052339000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the European
Court of Justice judgment recognises, it is the sovereign right of
member states to determine their policies on direct taxes. However,
there are conflicts between that principle and other areas of EU
policy; later, when we consider some of the changes to the rules on
venture capital trusts, we shall come to another issue in which that
conflict
exists.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07052339000475"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07052339000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I might
summarise the European Court of Justice judgment on Cadbury Schweppes,
it is that where a company was incorporated to undertake a genuine
economic activity in another member state, the fact that the motivation
to do so&#151;or to use a more familiar term, one of the main
purposes of so doing&#151;is to enjoy the lower rates of tax in that
territory does not mean that the company&#146;s profits should be
taxed at the higher rate applying in the UK. In particular, that issue
emerges when the mainstream rate of corporation tax in the UK diverges
from rates elsewhere in the
EU.</div>
					<a name="07052339000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Court ruled
that the profits of a business established in another European economic
area state can be taxed at the UK rate only if the arrangements were
wholly artificial. Let me quote from the Court
judgment:</div>
					<a name="07052339000446"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
checking those factors leads to the finding that the CFC is a
fictitious establishment not carrying out any genuine economic activity
in the territory of the host Member State, the creation of that CFC
must be regarded as having the characteristics of a wholly artificial
arrangement. That could be so in particular in the case of a
&#145;letterbox&#146; or &#145;front&#146;
subsidiary.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052339000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have taken the Court judgment and sought to apply it to UK
law; that is what schedule 15 seeks to achieve.</div>
					<a name="07052339000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, when one examines the
schedule and particularly the guidance that was published at the time
of the pre-Budget report, one sees that the Government&#146;s view is
that the only form of legitimate economic activity in the context of
CFC legislation is one that is based on labour, as it profits only from
labour that can fall outside UK taxation. If the profits are generated
by capital, then broadly they must be included within UK taxable
profits. So a company that decides to manage its intellectual property
in one 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column325" />Column number: 325</div>member state rather than in the UK would find that its profits from that
intellectual property were taxable at the UK rate.</div>
					<a name="07052339000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even the definition of what the
Government consider to be labour for the purposes of the rules is
tightly defined. If a UK company sets up a subsidiary in another EU
state and that company outsources some of its functions, the value
created by the outsourcing does not count towards genuine economic
activities. It is to broaden that definition that we have tabled
amendment No. 111. Furthermore, the schedule also assumes that seeking
a lower tax charge is not a valid creator of economic value, which I
suppose is rather odd to all those companies that have sought to leave
the UK for lower tax rate jurisdictions elsewhere in the EU. Amendment
No. 109 would remove the relevant subsection from the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07052339000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a way, it is
odd that we have this quite narrow definition of what constitutes
genuine economic activity, since it is predicated on the basis of
labour. As the hon. Member for Wirral, West perceptively pointed out,
the economy has changed somewhat since the second world war and we are
now a more knowledge-based economy. There is much more intensive use of
intellectual property and different types of assets to generate
revenue, so it seems rather strange to create the distinction between
profits from labour that is not outsourced, which is a good thing, and
profits from outsourced labour and from the utilisation of capital and
other assets, which are a bad thing.</div>
					<a name="07052339000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I have sought to do in
tabling amendments Nos. 110 and 111 is broaden in two ways the range of
activities that can be deemed to be genuine business activities.
Amendment No. 110 would define general business activities by reference
to the wording used in the Court judgment and amendment No. 111 would
eliminate a rather artificial and old-fashioned distinction between
staff employed by the company and other labour, in order to recognise
that a large number of companies seek to outsource part of their
activities as a way of maximising value.</div>
					<a name="07052339000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 110 would also
change the period
from</div>
					<a name="07052339000447"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;throughout the
relevant accounting
period&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052339000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">to during the
accounting period, to ensure that where, say, something has been set up
or closed during the accounting period, its profits can be excluded
from UK taxation for the purposes of this
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07052339000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
wording that I have chosen in amendment No. 110 comes from the ECJ
judgment: it deals with an establishment having regard to premises
staff, equipment and assets and also reflects the Government&#146;s
representations during the hearing. Let me quote from paragraph 66 of
that
judgment:</div>
					<a name="07052339000448"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;That
incorporation must correspond with an actual establishment intended to
carry on genuine economic activities in the host Member
State&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07052339000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also worth
listening to the opening of the judgment. Paragraph 67
states:</div>
					<a name="07052339000449"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
suggested by the United Kingdom Government and the Commission at the
hearing, that finding must be based on objective factors which are
ascertainable by third parties with regard, in particular, to the
extent to which the CFC physically exists in terms of premises, staff
and equipment.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 326</div>
					<a name="07052339000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment No. 100 reflects Government
representations made at the time. It is odd that they have not sought
to reflect those representations in their definition of economic
activities under schedule
15.</div>
					<a name="07052339000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">With your
permission, Mr. Illsley, I should like to make two further
comments to preclude the need for a stand part debate on schedule 15.
The schedule changes procedure so that a UK company has to make an
application for the profits of a EEA entity to be excluded from UK tax
computation. Seeking that approval increases uncertainty and could be
an impediment to reasonable tax planning. Could there not be a
pre-transaction clearance procedure? In the previous debate we
discussed one in respect of the insurance clause. The Government are
not dogmatic in their opposition to pre-clearance procedures, so
perhaps they could again demonstrate their flexibility by introducing
one.</div>
					<a name="07052339000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule
contains no deadlines setting out a time by which HMRC has to grant or
refuse approval. The Chartered Institute of Taxation suggested in its
submission that the onus should be on the tax authorities to show that
the arrangements are artificial, rather than on the company to persuade
the tax authorities that they are genuine. The CIOT also thinks that
the list in the appendix to the explanatory notes of the 20 items that
a business must provide to HMRC to get clearance is deliberately long
and unduly onerous and almost suggests that it is a disincentive for
people to apply for such
clearance.</div>
					<a name="07052339000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
conclude with an extract from the CIOT&#146;s representations, which
captures part of the problem with the measure. Last year, we discussed
a similar problem when considering the treatment of group relief on the
Marks and Spencer case, where the Government took a fairly narrow
interpretation of the ECJ judgment which I think is now subject to
challenge. The CIOT is probably right in
saying:</div>
					<a name="07052339000450"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
think the whole approach is fundamentally defective and unacceptable,
even as an interim measure pending conclusion of the discussions on the
reform
of...taxation&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07052339000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even
given the further reforms that my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping
Barnet mentioned this morning, the schedule is defective and
unacceptable in the eyes of industry

							<b class="B">Julia
Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): Again, echoing
the comments of the hon. Member for Fareham, I shall make observations
relating to the stand part debate so that we do not need to have the
same debate
again.</div>
					<a name="07052339000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, in
addition to the representations made by the Chartered Institute of
Taxation, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
has some serious concerns and has noted that the provisions in schedule
15 are identical to the draft schedule published at the time of the
2006 pre-Budget report in December last year. I should like the
Minister to confirm whether the schedule is identical to the draft
schedule, and if that is so, whether the Government took into account
the serious concerns of various professional
organisations.</div>
					<a name="07052339000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
I am trying to understand the basis on which the decision was made to
introduce the schedule as a stop-gap before more detailed, permanent
formulations 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column327" />Column number: 327</div>are introduced. I understand that a consultation is due to start in the
next few weeks. However, the Institute of Chartered Accountants has
stated that</div>
					<a name="07052339000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we do not
believe it is appropriate to attempt to introduce UK domestic
legislation, even for a short period, which is contrary to the EC
Treaty as determined by the Judgment in the Cadbury Schweppes case.
Aside from the uncertainty and litigation that will inevitably follow,
the approach brings UK tax policy formulation into disrespect
internationally, undermining efforts to ensure that the UK remains an
internationally competitive location to do business.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052339000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should appreciate a more
detailed explanation from the Minister about why it was necessary to
introduce the stop-gap legislation now, rather than engage in proper
consultation that would have resulted in legislation that did not
provoke the number of concerns that organisations such as the Chartered
Institute of Taxation and the Institute of Chartered Accountants have
raised.</div>
					
					<a name="07052339000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000551"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> As my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham mentioned,
we discussed at some length last year the consequences of ECJ judgments
on corporation tax. He will be pleased to know that I do not intend to
revisit that debate at any great length, other than to say that the
judgments collectively have cost the Exchequer billions of pounds; they
have on occasions caused complications for British business; and
Parliament has not at any point consented to direct taxation being
under the jurisdiction of the ECJ.</div>
					<a name="07052339000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">In holding that belief, as I
do, I can have some sympathy with a Government who wish only grudgingly
to implement ECJ judgments. However, the difficulty is that that leads
to uncertainty, and the remarks that my hon. Friend the Member for
Fareham and the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne made highlight
that point. The hon. Lady referred to a consultation document on the
taxation of foreign profits, which we discussed this morning. The word
from the Chief Secretary was that the document would be published
shortly; I do not know whether the Financial Secretary can be any more
precise about that point. The document was due to be published in the
spring, but we still do not have it. I do not know whether
&#147;published shortly&#148; means later this month or next month.
I understand that the Treasury is somewhat distracted by other matters,
but it would be useful to know whether there has been any
progress.</div>
					<a name="07052339000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Lady mentioned, and as I believe is the case, the contents of the
schedule are the same as were published at the time of the pre-Budget
report in 2006. Several bodies have made representations highlighting
the difficulties with that situation. Since then, the ECJ has also made
its judgment on the thin capitalisation legislation, in respect of
which measures introduced by the House were again reviewed to check
whether they were appropriate and allowable. It covers similar ground
to that which we are discussing, particularly with regard to whether a
national measure restricting freedom of establishment may be justified
in particular circumstances. The ECJ&#146;s judgment on 13 March was
that it may be so where it specifically targets wholly artificial
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07052339000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
light of that judgment, I should be grateful to know whether the
Financial Secretary still considers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 328</div>the schedule consistent with the attitude of the ECJ to the extent that
we can anticipate a future case on the matter, whether he thinks that
the thin capitalisation case can give us clues about whether the
schedule&#146;s wording is appropriate and whether he has considered
revising that wording as a consequence of the
judgment.</div>
					
					<a name="07052339000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000552"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):
						</b> May I
welcome you, Mr. Illsley, back to the Chair this afternoon,
and Committee members back to the proceedings? If the amendment is
pressed, I shall ask them to reject it, and I shall explain why in a
moment.</div>
					<a name="07052339000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall first
deal with a couple of the points raised by the hon. Members for
Falmouth and Camborne and for South-West Hertfordshire, after which I
shall cover the purpose of the controlled foreign companies rules,
because that will put the matter into context and help explain why the
amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Fareham would not help, and in
some ways, would hinder the proper operation of the
rules.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07052339000476"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07052339000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
and the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire were both concerned
about consultation and the timing of the proposals. We published the
draft for the measure alongside the pre-Budget report for the purpose
of consultation and, since then, we have been in detailed discussions
with those with a direct and representative interest in the matter.
Most of the comments then were about the guidance that accompanies the
operation of the rules. We will be issuing revised guidance shortly to
reflect those comments. We have carefully considered the points that
were made and how they applied to the Bill, and it remains essentially
as it was set out in the pre-Budget report. That is not because we have
taken no notice of the responses that we received. We considered them
carefully, and we believe that we are taking the correct approach as I
shall explain.</div>
					<a name="07052339000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne, I want to
explain that we are taking such an approach now rather than waiting for
the UK court judgment for two reasons. It is important that we act as
soon as possible after the judgment to be able to deal with any
potential uncertainty that can remain in light of the judgment if we do
not amend the rules. Moreover, it is a fact that the UK court may take
some time before it reaches it own judgment, and it does not seem
sensible to wait for
that.</div>
					<a name="07052339000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire that we do not implement such
rules on the CFCs grudgingly. We implement them accurately and in a way
that we judge to be fully and rightly in accordance with the European
Court of Justice&#146;s
judgment.</div>
					
					<a name="07052339000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000553"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> A similar comment could be made about the real
estate investment trust relief provisions last year in the Marks and
Spencer case. Since then, a court judgment held that what the
Government did last year was inadequate to meet the ECJ&#146;s
judgment on Marks and Spencer. I am merely pointing out that the same
thing might be about to happen.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column329" />Column number: 329</div>
					<a name="07052339000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000554"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> If a court such as the European Court of Justice
makes a judgment that has ramifications for, or is relevant to, our
legislation, we have to take it into account as we are doing under
schedule 15. We doing so in a way that we believe is entirely in
accordance with the judgment and as accurately as is necessary. We are
taking such action in that spirit, not
grudgingly.</div>
					<a name="07052339000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
now deal with the rules themselves after which I shall come to the
points made by the hon. Member for Fareham. They are designed to
prevent groups of companies from avoiding UK tax by diverting profits
artificially to low-taxed foreign subsidiaries and therefore play an
important role in protecting the UK tax base. Similar rules are in
place and are in common with those in many other major economies. Their
use is endorsed internationally by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, which also helpfully provides established
principles for international
taxation.</div>
					<a name="07052339000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our rules
were subject to the challenge in the Cadbury Schweppes case at the
European Court of Justice. The judgment in 2006 confirmed that the CFC
rules are in principle compatible with European law providing that they
are not applied to profits from genuine activities undertaken in an
actual business establishment located in another member state. I may
keep coming back to that because it is at the heart of the principles
that the European Court of Justice affirmed in its
judgment.</div>
					<a name="07052339000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me quote
from the judgment. The hon. Member for Fareham did, and I do not want
to miss out. It
states:</div>
					<a name="07052339000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;By
providing for the inclusion of the profits of a CFC subject to very
favourable tax regime in the tax base of the resident company, the
legislation on CFCs makes it possible to thwart practices which have no
purpose other than to escape the tax normally due on the profits
generated by activities carried on in national territory...such
legislation is therefore suitable to achieve the objective for which it
was it adopted.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052339000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
court said that the parent company must be given an opportunity to
produce evidence that a controlled foreign company is established in
another member state and that its activities are genuine, which,
incidentally, is what our clearance process is designed to do. If that
is the case, the CFC rules must not be applied to the profits of those
genuine activities.</div>
					<a name="07052339000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">UK
rules already provide a number of generous exemptions to cover genuine
activity undertaken by controlled foreign companies. However, we
believe that there may be circumstances at the margins where the
application of the rules is not entirely clear in light of the court
judgment. For that reason, we announced our intention to amend the
rules in the pre-Budget
report.</div>
					<a name="07052339000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to be clear about what the European Court of Justice did and
did not do; what it did and did not define. The ECJ did not define in
any detail what might constitute profits arising from genuine economic
activities undertaken in a business establishment in another member
state. To provide the clarification that is needed, schedule 15 first
establishes a clear and more certain application procedure through
which a UK company should produce the evidence to prove the extent of a
CFC&#146;s genuine economic activities in a business established in
another member state. Secondly, the schedule provides clear statutory
tests on what constitutes such activities and, thirdly, it states how
to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column330" />Column number: 330</div>calculate the profits arising from them. The schedule provides that
profits are those created for the group as a whole by staff working for
the controlled foreign company in a business establishment that has
genuine substance in another member
state.</div>
					<a name="07052339000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause and
the schedule have a particularly focused role: to provide clarity about
how the CFC rules will operate following the judgment. The legislation
achieves that without undermining the effectiveness of the existing CFC
rules in preventing as far as possible the artificial diversion of
profits from the UK. If I understood the remarks of the hon. Member for
Fareham correctly, he did not dispute the importance or the principle
behind having the CFC rules, but he was concerned about the practice of
their implementation. His amendments would increase the uncertainty of
the situation and the scope for the artificial diversion of profits. I
will say why in a
moment.</div>
					<a name="07052339000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
particular points that the hon. Gentleman raised, when he quoted the
court, he talked about wholly artificial arrangements, which was a term
used in the judgment. At that level, it is not a term that can be taken
literally or can be considered outside the context of the rest of the
judgment, which focuses on the purpose of the freedom of the
establishment and the importance of ensuring that CFC rules do not tax
profits from genuine business activity. It is clear that when the
judgment was read in the round, the ECJ intended a meaningful
distinction between profits from genuine activities and artificial
transfers of profit within the same economic group. The legislation is
designed to achieve that
clarification.</div>
					<a name="07052339000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also suggested that the definitions and the workings of
schedule 6 somehow entirely exclude the profits from capital. That is
not the case as long as they arise from genuine business activities
that are carried out in another member state and not from the
artificial diversion of profit to that member state. The ECJ has spoken
clearly about the purpose of the freedom of establishment and about the
objective factors that indicate that a business is genuinely
established and undertaking a genuine activity. The draft guidance
makes it clear that that implies a distinction between profits created
in another member state and profits diverted within the same economic
group so that they can be located artificially in a member state with a
lower tax rate.</div>
					<a name="07052339000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman posed two questions, one of which was: why not have
pre-clearance arrangements? Such arrangements are not normally
established in this sort of procedure, and I do not see any good
reasons to establish them here. There are established clearance
arrangements, which after all underpin the operation and the
application of the CFC
rules.</div>
					<a name="07052339000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also asked about the idea of a timetable, set out perhaps in
statute, for HMRC to respond. HMRC operates very tightly according to
performance expectations. To a large extent, particularly in cases such
as this, its ability to come to judgments and assessments, which is
what we are discussing, depends on the quality and the
comprehensiveness of the information that it receives from
taxpayers.</div>
					<a name="07052339000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments, as I think the hon. Member for Fareham said, attempt to
broaden the scope of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 331</div>exemptions and application of the CFC rules. He said that particularly
in relation to amendment No. 110, but more generally as well. He seems
to have attempted to frame the amendments using the type of general
language used in the ECJ judgment but when the ECJ hands down a
judgment, it is not writing legislation. It is our job to write
legislation in a way that captures the principles that underpin the
Court&#146;s judgment and puts them in our own tax code. The reason
why we are introducing clause 47 and schedule 15 is to make explicit
how the rules will apply in accordance with those EU principles, so
that we have a firm basis for both HMRC and taxpayers to operate and
apply the rules in
practice.</div>
					<a name="07052339000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
clause and schedule were amended as the hon. Gentleman proposes, they
would have the opposite effect. They would leave the legislation in a
state that neither dealt with the uncertainty arising from the judgment
nor protected the UK tax base against the artificial diversion of
profits.</div>
					<a name="07052339000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
109 appears to be explicitly aimed at facilitating the sort of tax
avoidance that we are concerned about, because it would delete the
provision in the schedule that excludes a reduction or elimination of a
tax liability from the scope of the new legislation. If we accepted
that, we would in effect be allowing some big businesses to avoid tax
by unfairly exploiting the ECJ&#146;s decision, leaving the general
taxpayer to pick up the bill. It is not in the interests of business or
the Government to make the effect of the new legislation unclear and to
make it potentially open to abuse. I therefore hope that the hon.
Member for Fareham will not press his amendments to a vote. I ask my
hon. Friends to reject them if he
does.</div>
					<a name="07052339000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I want
to emphasise the point with which I started. The Government are not
acting grudgingly to ensure that the ECJ&#146;s judgments are given
proper effect in our rules. The potential revenues are very
significant. In the pre-Budget report, we identified the revenue impact
of the changes that we propose in this legislation. The forecast of our
tax revenues will be adjusted as a result of the changes that we are
making&#151;from this year by &#163;100 million and next year
&#163;175 million, and by 2009-10 we are talking about a reduction in
the forecast tax revenues through the changes that we propose of
&#163;0.25 billion. The sums potentially at stake are very
significant. Therefore, the onus on us is great to get the legislation
right in a way that gives effect to the principles of the ECJ judgment
but protects properly the UK tax base by preventing the artificial
location of
profits.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07052339000477"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07052339000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
do not focus on genuine business activities. If they were made, groups
would be able to set up tax avoidance schemes within the new rules.
They would undermine our controlled foreign companies rules and would
put the public purse at substantial risk. They would also put the
measures at odds with aspects of the ECJ judgment. The proposed changes
would increase, not decrease, uncertainty for business and HMRC in
operating the
rules.</div>
					
					<a name="07052339000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000555"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I thank the Minister for his thorough and
well-reasoned response to the amendments and for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column332" />Column number: 332</div>his justification of the Government&#146;s activities. My hon. Friend
the Member for South-West Hertfordshire hit the nail on the head when
he went back to last year&#146;s debate on the Marks and Spencer
case. The way in which the Government have sought to interpret and
implement that judgment through schedule 15 leaves them open to
challenge. People out there will push back and challenge the rules, and
they may well prove to be right, in which case the Government will have
to reconsider the matter.</div>
					<a name="07052339000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is difficult to strike a
balance between what is a genuine business activity and what is wholly
fictitious, to use the language in the judgment. In considering that
point, I looked at the draft guidance that was published at the time of
the pre-Budget report. Diverting profits to a controlled foreign
company using intra-group loans is given as an example that would
involve some deliberate tax avoidance through the structuring of the
transaction. I found the next example, about relocating intellectual
property in another European economic area member state, less clear. It
could be managed there, rights could be sold and value could be
generated, and the guidance says that there could be some profit
related to the administration of those activities. That example
illustrates the difficulty of putting the judgment into practice,
because I should have thought, from my reading of the judgment, that a
business could reposition a property in an EEA state and have all those
profits chargeable at the lower rate, rather than simply the return on
the administration costs.</div>
					<a name="07052339000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the problem with future
interpretations will lie with whether the Government have complied with
the ECJ judgment. This afternoon&#146;s debate is partly intended to
probe the Government&#146;s thinking; I suspect that the place where
the measures will really be scrutinised and tested is not here, in this
Committee Room, but in court. We might well come back to this topic
next year, just as we have been referred back, this year, to what
happened in the Marks and Spencer case. I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the amendment.</div>

							<b class="B">Adam
Afriyie</b> (Windsor) (Con): I shall not speak for long. I
simply want to make two, related, observations on this clause and the
next about the vaccine research and development credit, or tax relief,
which is designed to encourage investment in research on vaccines. The
clause is welcome, because it corrects a loophole, and neither I nor, I
am sure, hon. Members on either side of the Committee, object to its
overall thrust.</div>
					<a name="07052339000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
main observation is that we in the United Kingdom have a currency
called sterling that is familiar to everyone. Everything that we do in
our everyday lives is denominated by it: company accounts are
denominated in sterling, and it is clear and overt. For small and
medium-sized businesses, accountants and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column333" />Column number: 333</div>everyone else, turnover is clear and they can predict pretty well what
their turnover and profit will be. Consequently, they are able to
ascertain whether they qualify for certain reliefs and what size of
business they are classified as.</div>
					<a name="07052339000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Exchange rates fluctuate and
are uncertain, however. At times over the past five to 10 years, we
have seen sterling move quite dramatically against the dollar and the
euro, so businesses might be caught unawares. As I said, I do not
object to the clause in principle, but businesses might not know into
which category they fall. A business might be working on the basis that
it falls within the small or medium-sized category, which might be
clear from the staffing levels. However, it might not be clear whether
that business falls into that category in terms of either its balance
sheet value, which does not necessarily move dramatically during the
year&#151;although the exchange rate might fluctuate&#151;or its
turnover, which would enable it to qualify for the credits under
clauses 48 and
49.</div>
					<a name="07052339000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout the
Bill, pretty much everything is denominated in
sterling. Duties, corporation tax, grants, credits, the reliefs for
investment in the music industry and a lot of the capital and asset
transfers&#151;they are all denominated in sterling. Therefore, why
is uncertainty being created in clause 48? I am sure that the Minister
can tidy the issue up fairly quickly. Is the answer that we are subject
to EU regulations? If so, which EU regulations tie the
Minister&#146;s hands in that regard? Why are we denominating
turnover and balance sheet value in sterling, which creates an enormous
amount of uncertainty and makes it difficult to plan during the year,
as to whether a tax credit will be achieved? I urge the Minister to
make a small change and denominate those figures and values in
sterling.</div>

clause to denominate in sterling, not in euros. I did not find the
Financial 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column334" />Column number: 334</div>Secretary&#146;s previous answer in any way satisfactory or
reassuring, given the hundreds and possibly thousands of businesses
that will be at those thresholds. I wonder whether he can reflect a
little longer and give a reasoned answer as to why we are denominating
in euros rather than in sterling, which seems to cover every other
aspect of the Bill. I understand tradition and convention, but will he
give a clear answer as to why he wants to perpetuate that uncertainty
for those
businesses?</div>

Healey:
						</b> If the hon. Gentleman studies the provisions
covering the research and development tax reliefs and the vaccine
research relief, he will see that some of the qualifying criteria that
we use for companies are established at the European level. As he will
appreciate, not only do we have to take into account the size of a
company, based on the definitions of small or medium-sized companies
and large companies, but, where turnover or similar criteria or tests
apply, we have to use the European set standard, which is denominated
in euros.</div>
					<a name="07052339000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
we have to take account of those criteria is that, in order to put in
place a tax relief system such as the one that we have for research and
development, it must receive clearance under the state aid rules. In
other words, we are restricted in our ability to introduce direct
support to firms for particular activities and policy purposes in the
UK, in order to ensure that it is consistent with state aid rules. That
is the established process within the European Union, to which we
signed up as part of our membership of the Union and the single market.
Where the European Commission exercises its judgment in setting
criteria, it denominates in euros. We have transferred that approach
into our domestic legislation, and have done so from the
start.</div>
					<a name="07052339000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said on
clause 48, we are making what are, in essence, minor or technical
amendments to the operation of the tax reliefs. Therefore, it is not
appropriate to revisit questions about the integral design of the
approach that we have established for R and D tax relief since
2000.</div>

							<a name="07052339000564"></a>Dr.
Cable:
						</b> This is my first contribution to the work of the
Committee. It is a tribute to the excellence and stamina of my hon.
Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne that we have not had to
make more use of those on the substitute&#146;s bench.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column335" />Column number: 335</div>
					<a name="07052339000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">These are probing amendments.
Our understanding is that there is at present a restriction on the size
of companies&#151;from 250 to 500 employees&#151;that can take
advantage of the reliefs, and that the Government are imposing this
restriction because of limitations set by the European state aid rules.
In essence, the purpose of the amendments is to try to establish the
Government&#146;s thinking behind the
legislation.</div>
					
					<a name="07052339000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
state aid rules are summarised in a set of guidelines that were
produced last year, &#147;Community guidelines on state aid to
promote risk capital investments in small and medium-sized
enterprises&#148;. We understand that the Government must comply with
the rules, but we have some questions about
them.</div>
					<a name="07052339000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">A quick reading
of the European guidance suggests that Governments have a fair degree
of flexibility in interpreting the rules. The first question is why the
Government have interpreted the provision in such a restrictive way.
Many medium-sized companies will be removed from the provisions on
venture capital because of this legislation. Could the Minister explain
why he had to interpret the European rules in this
way?</div>
					<a name="07052339000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">It appears that
the Government have set the maximum restriction, with a number of
employees&#151;50&#151;that is below the present level. On the
other hand, it appears that the number of employees has increased for R
and D tax credits, which are also governed by European state aid rules.
We are trying to understand why the rules should be interpreted in a
particularly permissive way for R and D tax credits but in a more
restrictive way for venture
capital.</div>
					<a name="07052339000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Institute
of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is particularly perturbed
by this measure because its judgment, which is based on its research,
is that venture capital measures are more helpful than the R and D tax
credit in encouraging innovation by this group of companies. The
institute cannot understand why the Government have apparently moved in
the opposite direction. They have reduced the range from 250, which is
the normal threshold for medium-sized companies, to 50, which is the
threshold for small companies. What in the guidelines required the
Government to make that shift for these provisions but not for the R
and D tax
credits?</div>
					<a name="07052339000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">There may be
perfectly good legal reasons for the wording in the schedule. We
understand that the Government have to comply with the guidelines, but,
given that the rules offer some flexibility, we wish to find out from
the Minister why he has interpreted them in this
way.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000565"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I want to echo the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
comments. We see in the Red Book that the changes to various venture
capital schemes have been made in response to the new guidelines on
state aid that were published last year. Like him, I am rather
surprised that the Government have felt the need to make the changes,
as it appears from examining those rules that if a robust case has been
made and there is evidence to back it, the EU is prepared to grant
exemptions.</div>
					<a name="07052339000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, in paragraph 5.1(a) of the rules there is a safe harbour
whereby an investment below €1.5 million is not
deemed to be state aid, and if a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column336" />Column number: 336</div>member state can produce evidence of a market failure affecting that
limit, state aid can be used in connection with stimulating small and
medium-sized enterprises. In paragraph 5.1(b) permission is given for
Governments to support schemes providing finance to medium-sized
companies. Does the Financial Secretary believe that firms employing 50
full-time equivalents are medium sized? I am not sure whether I would
see them as medium-sized
businesses.</div>
					<a name="07052339000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
other examples in the state aid rules that would create an exemption
allowing the Government to continue with venture capital trusts and
perhaps set a more generous level. Will the Financial Secretary clarify
whether the Commission has given approval to the VCT rules as set out
in the Bill? The Red Book is a little opaque as to whether that
permission has been received. It would be useful to know whether it
has, and to understand more about the case that the Government employed
for retaining the status quo prior to the schedule being introduced.
The hon. Member for Twickenham also highlighted, appropriately, the
contradiction between this schedule and schedule 15&#151;a more
generous number of employees is set for R and D tax credits and a tight
number for venture capital
schemes.</div>
					<a name="07052339000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
congratulate the Treasury, for a change, on other changes made in the
schedule. On Report of last year&#146;s Finance Bill I discussed an
amendment on the 70 per cent. rule, and we also debated inadvertent
breaches. I am grateful to see, a year later, that the Minister has
listened to my representations and that those changes are in the
schedule.</div>
					
					<a name="07052339000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000566"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I welcome the hon. Member for Twickenham to the
Committee&#146;s proceedings. If the Liberal Democrats have that sort
of quality on the substitutes&#146; bench, they match Chelsea. It is
a pleasure to see him reappear. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i>
Indeed&#151;they did not actually win this year, but there we
are.</div>
					<a name="07052339000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why have we
interpreted the rules as we have? As we set out in the Budget text, we
are required to introduce the employee head count test, on which the
hon. Gentleman focused his questions, to meet the requirements of the
European state aid obligations. I shall be honest with the Committee:
we did not want to introduce the head count test or the new employee
limit. We are acting essentially to ensure that we can secure the
future of the venture capital schemes.</div>
					<a name="07052339000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The corporate venturing scheme,
the enterprise investment scheme and the venture capital trusts are
important elements in helping to tackle the equity gap, but to continue
they need to meet the state aid requirements set out by the European
Commission, particularly the new state aid rules on risk capital that
were introduced last August. We have spent a good deal of time and
effort, particularly since then, on submitting strong evidence about UK
market failures in such investment.</div>
					<a name="07052339000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our situation is not
necessarily the same as that of other European states, particularly as
we have a mature market. Of course, the state aid risk capital rules,
with some flexibilities, are designed to apply across Europe. We argued
that we need national policy measures if we are to respond to the
structural problems affecting our national capital markets. The
Commission did not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column337" />Column number: 337</div>accept our argument that the additional provision that
we wanted to make in all areas for mid-size
companies&#151;the sort of provision that is set out in these
amendments&#151;would be compatible with the Common
Market.</div>
					
					<a name="07052339000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we were to persist with that
approach or, indeed, if we were to amend the Bill in the way that the
amendments suggest, it would bring the continuation of these schemes
into question. Therefore, we will continue to propose amendments and to
discuss the matter. I hope that, in conjunction with the industry, we
can collate further evidence that might encourage the Commission to
make greater use of the flexibilities that can be found within the
rules that it introduced last year. For the moment, our schemes need to
be judged as compliant by the Commission by August this year. Because
of our detailed discussions with the Commission, particularly in the
past 12 months, I am confident that we will get clearance. However, we
have not formally had it
yet.</div>
					<a name="07052339000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
welcome the comments of the hon. Member for Fareham on our amendments
about the inadvertent breaches and the 70 per cent. rule. He did indeed
raise those points in our discussions last year, and I took them
seriously. They were raised by others as well and we have had the
chance to examine them over the past 12 months. For that reason, I am
glad that we have able to cover them in the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000567"></a>Dr.
Cable:
						</b> Will the Minister comment on the further point that
both the hon. Member for Fareham and I have raised, which is: if the
Commission was so tough on the 50-employee rule, why were the
Government allowed to move in the opposite direction on the R and D tax
credits scheme? Does a different set of principles apply, or is there
an inconsistency in the Commission?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000568"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The rules that we are trying to meet in the three
schemes are set out in the state aid risk capital rules, which were
introduced by the Commission in August last year. They clearly apply to
this policy territory, but they do not apply in the same way to the R
and D tax credits. The changes that we are making to the R and D tax
relief scheme are being made not because we are required or encouraged
to do that by the Commission, but because we have established that
there is evidence of under-investment in innovation and research and
development by mid-size companies. It is an area of the economy that we
want to support, and in which we want to see greater activity. There is
clear evidence and a clear policy purpose for what we are proposing in
the R and D tax credits. The circumstances that apply there are
different from those that apply to venture capital and EIS
schemes.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000569"></a>Dr.
Cable:
						</b> I want to acknowledge that the Government have
confirmed on the record that they approached the Commission and pushed
as hard as they could on this point. We have accepted in this short
exchange the potential for damage to middle-level companies in the
industry, which is a particular problem for regional funds that are
struggling to establish themselves. However, I accept what the
Government say. It was pointed out to me that the Chartered Institute
of Taxation has accepted that the Government have done the best that
they can. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
was a little more sceptical, but I accept the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column338" />Column number: 338</div>Minister&#146;s word that he has tried and that this is the most that

						</b> I shall be brief, unless members of the Committee
want to dwell in detail on any of these measures. Government amendments
Nos. 166 to 174 concern paragraphs 9 to 11 to schedule 16 and are
designed to bring two improvements that will benefit companies seeking
to raise finance under the enterprise investment scheme, the corporate
venturing scheme and the venture capital trust
scheme.</div>
					<a name="07052339000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments Nos. 159 to 164 attempt to achieve the same thing in
relation to the enterprise management incentives legislation. They
provide first for the transfer of relevant intangible assets within a

providing a greater flexibility for the venture capital schemes. Clause
60 makes the equivalent changes to the enterprise management incentives
legislation. The changes have been welcomed by the Enterprise
Investment Scheme Association&#151;Opposition Members will be

					<a name="07052339000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last year, during the Finance
Bill, I debated with the Economic Secretary the introduction of the new
regime of real estate investment trusts, which subsequently went live
in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2007. Since that time, the
Government have had the opportunity to consider the initial operation
of the scheme. Via clause 51 and the associated schedule 17, they have
introduced what might be characterised as a number of tweaks to the
regime, designed to improve its operation. Unfortunately, some
important issues have still not been addressed.</div>
					<a name="07052339000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 51, which introduces the
schedule, allows some of the changes contained therein to be backdated
to the introduction of the introduction of the REIT regime on 1
January. Moreover, the changes proposed in schedule 17 include relaxing
some of the qualifying conditions that must be met in order to achieve
REIT status. That the Government are still tweaking the REIT regime is
evidenced by the fact that schedule 17 is now being amended by 20
Government amendments&#151;amendments Nos. 138 to 158&#151;which in
practice all relate to demergers and are largely corrective. In other
words, they represent a further tweaking of the tweak.</div>
					<a name="07052339000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have relatively little to say
about the Government&#146;s drafting amendments to schedule 17, aside
from an important procedural point that I shall come to when we get
there. However, I want to give you notice, Mr. Illsley, that
when we come to schedule 17 stand part, I want to raise several points
about the schedule and how it effects the REIT regime to date and in
the future.</div>

						</b> I shall be brief because it is clear that the hon.
Gentleman does not intend to raise detailed issues about the
amendments. It is for you to make a judgment, Mr. Illsley,
but from my point of view it would be fine if we range
widely.</div>
					<a name="07052339000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
that we have just agreed to introduces schedule 17, which amends
provisions in part 4 of the Finance Act 2006. As the hon. Gentleman
reminded us, we debated that set of clauses in great detail a year ago
in a spirit of co-operation, and we made progress in mutual
understanding of some of the
issues.</div>
					<a name="07052339000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regime
came into force on 1 January after some years of detailed and
constructive consultation and engagement with the industry. By allowing
indirect investment in property to enjoy the same tax treatment as
direct investment, the UK REIT regime will improve the quality and
quantity of finance for investment in property, promoting a wider range
of savings products for individual investors and supporting structural
change in property markets</div>
					<a name="07052339000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased to say that the UK
REIT regime is already proving a success with 13 companies converting
to the regime from a wide variety of sectors, and now a 14th company
setting up with the express purpose of being a UK REIT. The total
market capitalisation of the UK REIT sector is now &#163;35 billion,
and two of the UK REITs include both commercial and residential
property in their
portfolios.</div>
					<a name="07052339000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since last
year&#146;s Finance Bill, we have continued our consultation with the
industry to ensure that the regime works as effectively as possible.
The changes in the schedule are the result of that consultation and
were announced at the time of the pre-Budget report. As the hon.
Gentleman suggested, they are minor changes clarifying some of the
definitions and powers in the existing
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07052339000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also
announced at the time of the pre-Budget report that we would introduce
changes to the regulations to extend the regime to make it easier for
companies to become UK REITs, and the Chief Secretary circulated draft
regulations for that purpose to Committee members on 9
May.</div>
					<a name="07052339000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since publication
of the draft clause and schedule at the end of March, the Law Society
has come forward with a further representation on the technical detail
of the regime as it relates to demergers from UK REITs. Continuing that
spirit of consultation, we are keen to accommodate those points, hence
the amendments.</div>
					<a name="07052339000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
happy to respond to questions or requests for clarification, although I
have the impression from remarks by the hon. Gentleman on the previous
clause that he accepts that these are minor, technical drafting
amendments.</div>

Francois:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>We got there in the end. As I said in my
remarks on clause 51, these amendments are essentially drafting in
nature. They modify the elements of the schedules specifically relating
to demergers. As such we have no quarrel with them and I have only one
specific question to put to the Minister about them. However, there is
a procedural point which I do not want to let pass without comment. I
raise it more in sorrow than in anger because last year we debated
REITs in a rather consensual manner and managed to cover a lot of the
detail as a result.</div>
					<a name="07052339000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have already had one
occasion in Committee when Ministers were taken to task because details
of draft Government regulations had been circulated in advance to
selected members of the Committee but unfortunately not to others.
After that, as I recall, Ministers, including the Chief Secretary,
apologised to the Committee and said that they would do their best to
prevent that sort of thing from happening again. However, when I
returned to my office this lunchtime, newly arrived in my e-mail inbox
was an electronic copy of a letter dated 16 May from the Economic
Secretary to my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet. According
to the electronic copy, there was a hard copy for the hon. Member for
Falmouth and Camborne, the Chairman and Clerk of the Committee, but to
no one else. Among other amendments, it refers to the REITs amendments,
which we are debating this afternoon, and it was the first time that I
had seen or heard of that letter.</div>
					<a name="07052339000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">If Ministers are going to write
to members of the Committee explaining the reasoning behind their
amendments, which is a laudable aim and quite often the right thing to
do, could they please try harder to ensure that they circulate the
information to everyone 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 344</div>on the Committee&#151;Back Benchers and Front Benchers&#151;as
simple courtesy would suggest? As this has already happened once on
this Committee, I hope that we will not get a hat trick. I make a plea
through you, Mr. Illsley, that Ministers do their best to
take this point on board. If the Minister wishes to intervene, I will
sit down, but I still have a question for
him.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000588"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> I conducted the Finance Bill on the REITs clauses.
I remember us having a substantive consensual discussion, with some
areas on which there was disagreement. As I understand it, we have
operated this year in exactly the same way as in previous years in
ensuring the circulation of letters and amendments to members of the
Committee. I am happy to be corrected by the hon. Gentleman if there
has been a change in our procedure. As I understand it, we have done
things in the same way as in previous years when no difficulty arose at
all.</div>
					<a name="07052339000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know
whether there is a problem because once again the circulation has not
been carried out by the Committee Clerks or the hon. Member for
Chipping Barnet has not circulated it to her colleagues. The hon.
Gentleman said that he was making his point more in sorrow than in
anger. If he suggests that there has been a procedural mistake, it
would be helpful to us if he specified what we have done differently
this year from last year so that we can rectify

						</b> I am not accusing the Minister of not letting me
see the regulations&#151;they are amendments, not regulations. I am
saying that he wrote to some Committee members explaining the rationale
behind those amendments, but not to others. My understanding is that,
normally, when a Minister does that, he should write to all Committee
members. He cannot just e-mail one or two and expect them to circulate
it on his behalf. That is my understanding; I think that you have
confirmed from the Chair, Mr. Illsley, that, as a rule of
thumb, if a Minister writes to one Committee member with information
relevant to a debate, he should write to everybody.</div>
					<a name="07052339000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">So that the Minister
understands me, let me say that I behaved as I did simply because this
has happened once already in the Committee and we were told, in
essence, that it would not happen again. It has happened a second time,
so I did what I did. I hope that he understands that and that it will
not happen a third time. I hope that the lesson can be learned. With
that, I would like to ask the Minister about the amendments, which I
believe, he is here to answer. Amendment No. 138 replaces the word
&#147;transfers&#148; with the words &#147;disposes of&#148; an
asset&#151;others make similar provisions. For clarity, will the
Minister explain the technical reasoning behind that change in
drafting?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000597"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> I am happy to explain the thinking behind all the
amendments. As I said, we put the amendments out to consultation, and
since their publication, the Law Society has made further
representations on the technical details of the regime for demergers
from UK REITs. The Government amendments will ensure that schedule 17
provisions relating to demergers within UK REITs apply where a demerged
property or subsidiary is transferred to a new company that then
becomes a UK REIT
itself.</div>
					<a name="07052339000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
will ensure also that the terminology used to describe the demergers is
consistent with that used elsewhere in UK REITs legislation by using
the word &#147;disposal&#148; rather than
&#147;transfers&#148;. Amendment Nos. 138 to 148 will mean that the
provisions in paragraph 11 of schedule 17 will apply to a company that
acquires a subsidiary company to which the ring-fenced assets have been
transferred. The amendments allow also the company time to satisfy the
conditions for entry to the UK REITs regime. That extends the same
flexibility to disposals of ring-fenced assets by a single company UK
REIT, as paragraph 16 proposes already for demergers from group UK
REITs. That accords with our policy of aligning the treatment of single

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000598"></a>Mr.
Francois:
						</b> Schedule 17 contains a number of detailed
changes to the REITs regime, which began operation on 1 January 2007.
For instance, paragraph 2 of the schedule alters the definition of the
types of loans that REITs may undertake without breaching the regime,
and paragraph 3 modifies the restriction on income from owner-occupied
property that REITs are allowed to generate. We debated that last
subject in considerable detail last year, under what is now part 4 of
the Finance Act
2006.</div>
					<a name="07052339000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 5
amends section 109 of the Finance Act 2006, effectively allowing
certain previously non-listed companies to benefit from the REITs
regime. That relates specifically to close companies which technically
have difficulty in satisfying the requirements of the REITs regime on
their first day as listed companies. It is a modest relaxation of the
section 109 requirements, about which the British Property Federation
said:</div>
					<a name="07052339000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There is
currently a problem for new REITs at the time of listing and converting
to REIT status because there could be a very short period during the
first day of converting, when they were not actually
listed.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052339000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition welcome the changes so far as they go. However, even when
revised by the 20 Government amendments that have been tabled, the
changes proposed by the schedule still do not address two key issues on
the REITs regime that were highlighted to the Economic Secretary by the
Opposition a year
ago.</div>
					<a name="07052339000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first issue
is the continuing denial of REITs status to those companies listed on
the alternative investment market of the London stock
exchange&#151;AIM, as it is more popularly known. According to recent
figures from the British Property Federation, some 14 companies with a
total market capitalisation of some &#163;36 billion have converted
to UK REITs status since 1 January 2007. That figure looks impressive
at first glance, but it is important to note that approximately
&#163;30.1 billion of that value&#151;more than three
quarters&#151;is represented by just five companies: Land Securities,
with &#163;9.4 billion, British Land, with &#163;7.8 billion,
Hammerson with &#163;4.8 billion, Liberty International at
&#163;4.5 billion, and SEGRO at &#163;3.6 billion. In other words,
the regime has been dominated to date by the larger property companies,
which were always likely to convert to REIT
status.</div>
					<a name="07052339000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">The British
Property Federation argued in its May 2007 briefing, which lists the 14
REITs that have converted so far,
that:</div>
					<a name="07052339000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whilst
this represents an encouraging start it should be noted that the above
list is almost entirely represented by those existing, listed property
companies that have always been viewed as best placed to convert to
REITs.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052339000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">The federation
goes on to
say:</div>
					<a name="07052339000456"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We have
concerns that, under the current legislative framework for UK-REITs the
medium/long-term growth of the UK-REIT market will be limited and that
actions need to be taken in the short term in order to address these
concerns.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052339000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
brings me to the issue of allowing REITs to be listed on AIM as well as
on the principal stock exchange. As the Economic Secretary will recall,
we debated that issue as well in considerable detail last 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 348</div>year, including on Report. So that it is not said that I have misquoted
him, let me say that he did not commit to launching a formal
review&#151;he was clear about that, and I remember what he said. He
did, however, say that he would keep the issue broadly under review. I
hope that I have not misrepresented him. In light of that, is it still
Government policy that REIT status should be denied to property
companies that are listed on AIM, even at the risk of inhibiting the
potential growth of the UK REITs market? In other words, has the
Government&#146;s position moved since last
year?</div>
					<a name="07052339000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
important issue that the changes to schedule 17 fail to address, and
which the Economic Secretary should likewise recall from last
year&#146;s debates, is the lack of establishment of residential
property REITs. Those established so far have been almost entirely
commercial property REITs. On that point, the British Property
Federation
said:</div>
					<a name="07052339000457"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
noticeable that there is no material residential property within the
existing REIT regime. This is despite the fact that the development of
a tax efficient listed residential property market and the wider
benefits that this could bring to the UK economy was one of the key
policy objectives for introducing UK
REITs.</div>
					<a name="07052339000458"></a><div class="hs_brev">The UK
Government should actively seek to use the REIT structure as a tool to
encourage the growth of a listed residential sector. This will be
achieved by working with the industry to develop the REIT regime so
that it is more suitable for a residential business
model.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052339000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I
raised that issue with the Economic Secretary last year in Committee,
in advance of the launch of the new regime, he
said:</div>
					<a name="07052339000459"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Over the
course of this year and not just when the regime begins, we will be
monitoring closely whether residential companies enter the regime. I
explained that I was not surprised that early indications had come from
the commercial sector, because of its larger scale and sophistication,
but I also said that there had been private and public indications that
residential property companies would come
forward.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i>
8 June 2006; c. 507.]</div>
					<a name="07052339000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">He then
committed to keep that matter as well under review during the year
ahead.</div>
					<a name="07052339000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">Almost a year
on, and now that the regime has been operating since January, will the
Economic Secretary explain to the Committee why, despite his
encouraging prediction a year ago, the REIT regime remains
overwhelmingly dominated by commercial property and hardly any
residential property companies have converted to REIT status? He
attempted to fudge it by saying that two REITs had both a commercial
and a residential property element, but a REIT can have a very small
residential property element and still meet that description. Have any
out-and-out residential REITs entered the regime? I ask because, if
part of the Government&#146;s aim was to create a REIT regime to
foster the development of new residential housing, particularly
affordable housing, they appear to have failed thus far in that
important objective. I should like to press the Economic Secretary to
reply to those
points.</div>
					
					<a name="07052339000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07052339000599"></a>
							<b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): I mirror some of those
questions. Debate on Report last year was particularly heated about
allowing REITs to be created not simply with full stock exchange
listings but by other means of funding. I recall perfectly well that
throughout the process, the Economic Secretary said&#151;I think that
it was in good faith&#151;that he would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 349</div>monitor the situation and keep it under review. I mirror the questions
asked, particularly in relation to small REITs providing social
housing. Many of us saw a great deal of potential in the tax benefits
of REITs that do not require the massive start-up costs of a full stock
exchange listing.</div>
					<a name="07052339000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also have a question about schedule 17. Paragraph 7(b) deals with
section 116, &#147;Minor or inadvertent breach&#148;. Proposed new
subsection 3A(b)
states:</div>
					<a name="07052339000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
regulations may make provision about, or by reference to, anything done
by or in relation to a company or any sum arising or treated as
arising...in the calendar year during which the regulations are
made&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07052339000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">rather than the
financial year, tax year or accounting year. Why is the calendar year
specified?</div>

Illsley, and to all Committee members. If the Treasury, my office or I
have failed in any way to follow the proper and normal procedure for
circulating amendments to all Committee members, I will wholeheartedly
and unreservedly apologise. I am unclear about whether we have made
such an error, and because of how the hon. Member for Rayleigh chose to

shall apologise unreservedly. I fear that, like me&#151;perhaps more

dealt with the issue courteously. If he agrees to look into the matter,
I hope that he will discover exactly what happened. I genuinely think

Opposition Committee members in a courteous and proper manner when it
comes to how we go about these proceedings. It seems entirely
appropriate that we should disagree on the politics; however, in my
previous debates with the hon. Member for Rayleigh, I have always
conducted myself in that courteous manner. Indeed, when the issue arose
last week&#151;I had had no knowledge of it until the Committee
started&#151;I said not only that if we had made a mistake we would
apologise, but that I would shift us from negative to affirmative

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000606"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> I am happy to take your guidance, Mr.
Illsley.</div>
					<a name="07052339000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the
schedule and the two questions raised by the hon. Gentleman. As I said,
the schedule makes some minor changes to the existing legislation. The
definitions of profits, financing costs and owner-occupation now work
in the same way for group and single-company UK REITs. The definition
of derivative contracts has been extended to make it clear that such
contracts that hedge risk in relation to liabilities in the property
rental business, as well as assets, are covered.</div>
					<a name="07052339000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">The condition prohibiting
profit-linked loans has been relaxed so that companies can use ratchet
loans, in which the interest rate for borrowing money reduces as
profits increase. The proposed legislation also clarifies the powers of
the special commissioners in respect of appeals and ensures that
charities are exempt from tax on distribution from UK
REITs.</div>
					<a name="07052339000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the
extension of the regime. The changes will make it easier for companies,
particularly new listed ones, to become UK REITs. Companies will no
longer need to be listed on a recognised stock exchange before they
give notice to join the regime but will be able to join on the first
day on which they are listed. The changes also allow companies to join
the regime if they cannot meet the asset test on the first day on which
they enter it. That will make it easier for newly established or newly
listed companies to join, by allowing them time to acquire rental
properties.</div>
					<a name="07052339000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
announced at the PBR, there will be a tax charge if the company
breaches the asset test on day one of entry to the regime, the detail
of which is contained in the Real Estate Investment Trusts (Breach of
Conditions) (Amendment) Regulations 2007. A draft copy of the
regulations has been made available. Following consultation on them, we
propose a further relaxation so that failure to meet the asset test at
the beginning of day one of the regime will not count as a breach of
conditions, as it would under current 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column351" />Column number: 351</div>regulations. That will make the relaxation on listing more effective for
potential entrants to the regime.</div>
					<a name="07052339000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final change allows
extensions to the Real Estate Investment Trusts (Joint Ventures)
Regulations 2006 to be effective from 1 January. A copy of the draft
joint venture group regulations has been made available. The revised
regulations extend the rules for single-company joint ventures to cover
joint ventures carried on by groups. Again, following consultation, we
propose a further relaxation to the draft regulations. That is to allow
companies 60 days after the regulations come into force to give joint
venture notices for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January
2007. The relaxation will allow companies to wait until the regulations
come into force before giving a joint venture notice, and will still
enable them to take advantage of the retrospection offered by paragraph
14 of the schedule.</div>
					<a name="07052339000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Rayleigh
asked whether we were minded to change the qualification rule that
there should be a full listing, rather than an AIM listing, to the
stock exchange. He repeated my commitment of last year to keep the
matter under review, although I did not announce on Report a formal
review. Since then, I have actively championed&#151;in the UK and in
other parts of the world&#151;the benefits of the AIM regime and its
lighter regulatory approach.</div>
					<a name="07052339000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Gentleman knows, we
judged last year that it was important, particularly when the REITs
regime was becoming established, that investors could have confidence
that they would have the regulatory protection of a full stock exchange
listing, especially given that we were trying to encourage retail
investors to see the attractions of such collective investments. Our
judgment on that matter has not changed; we have not decided to change
the AIM requirement, but I am happy to say to him that I will continue
to keep the matter under review. Furthermore, at the time of the
pre-Budget report, we will set out in detail our thinking on the
matter, following nine months&#146; operation of the regime. It is
too early at this stage, however, to reach a judgment different from
that of a year
ago.</div>

							<a name="07052339000607"></a>Mr.
Francois:
						</b> I thank the Minister for that comprehensive
answer. We look forward to hearing what he comes up with in the 2007
pre-Budget report. In connection with that, I shall briefly offer him
the thought that allowing REITs to list on the AIM would be a good way
of boosting residential REITs, because residential property companies
often have a much smaller market capitalisation, as many are not listed
on the full London stock exchange. Perhaps he will bear that in mind
ahead of the pre-Budget report.</div>

							<a name="07052339000608"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. A
year ago, we discussed in detail our judgment that that was not the
right road to go down at this stage, but I am happy to set out more
fully our thinking in the light of 9 months&#146; operation of the
REITs regime. It is too early to reach a different judgment at this
stage.</div>
					<a name="07052339000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also asked about residential REITs, and I did not seek to
fudge the answer. There are no residential REITs; there are 14 REITs,
of which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column352" />Column number: 352</div>two have a residential element but are not fully residential. In the
past year, we have consulted widely with the residential sector.
Indeed, at the instigation of the right hon. Member for North-West
Hampshire (Sir George Young), who took a particular interest in such
matters, I met him following our consideration of what became the
Finance Act 2006. I then met a group of experts, whom he had put in
touch with Treasury officials, to discuss the issues. We have not been
inactive on that score.</div>
					<a name="07052339000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">The nature of the residential
and rental markets in the past year has complicated potential
residential REITs. We said&#151;it was debated fully&#151;that it
was more complex for residential REITs and registered social landlords
to take such a step and that it was therefore no surprise to us that
the lead came from the commercial sector. Proposals involving wider tax
changes, which go beyond the residential REITs regime, have been put to
us and we are studying them. If there are barriers to the operation of
residential REITs that we can deal with, we will do so. The regime is
not set in stone, but at the same time, we set out clearly our
objective of a revenue-neutral shift to a REITs regime. Issues on the
tax side were proposed to us which, to say the least, would have
required close and careful attention before we made any decision to
move forward.</div>
					<a name="07052339000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
worth noting that Lend Lease has been public about the potential for
floating a residential REIT around their development in the Olympic
area and we are watching that with interest. However, at this stage a
residential REIT has not come forward, although after only five months
it is not possible to conclude that none will do so. As I said, if we
can, we will address the relevant issues and we continue to keep a
close eye on developments in the residential
sector.</div>
					
					<a name="07052339000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000609"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> I am heartened by my hon. Friend&#146;s
comments, particularly what he said on the wider changes being proposed
to him and his colleagues in respect of residential REITs. I still have
a fear, which I expressed in the Committee last year, that if
residential REITs simply buy up existing property, it could lead to an
increase in house prices, which are already overblown. Most people are
keen that there should be much more house building in the United
Kingdom and I hope that REITs will have a role to play in that respect.
Paragraph 3.121 on page 69 of the Red Book refers to a</div>
					<a name="07052339000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;target to raise the number of new
houses being built to at least 200,000 net additions a year by 2016.
Substantial progress towards this target is being made with over
180,000 net additions in the year to March
2006.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052339000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">I make
two comments on that paragraph. It ties into the residential aspect of
the REITs regime if we can encourage new house building, but 200,000
net additions a year in housing stock in the UK is woefully inadequate.
There are approximately 150,000 divorces each year and probably almost
as many partners who are not married who break up, many of whom have
children, and that is likely to lead to the formation of many more
households. There is also considerable migration into the United
Kingdom, which has brought much benefit to the economy but put pressure
on the housing stock.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 353</div>
					<a name="07052339000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">The figures that have been
published since the Red Book itself was published show that housing
starts in the United Kingdom fell in the year to March 2007. They went
below 180,000 by several thousand; we actually went in the wrong
direction in that financial year. The Government must consider whether
the REIT regime could be used or whether the wider tax changes referred
to by my hon. Friend are needed markedly to increase the number of
houses and flats&#151;residential units, if I may put it that
way&#151;being built in the United Kingdom each year. The figure in
France, which has a similar population, is 300,000 units a year and it
still has markedly increasing house prices, although not to the same
extent as in the United Kingdom in recent years. It causes great social
pressure in our country and great distress to people who cannot afford
to buy a house because supply is too limited, meaning that prices go up
very considerably.</div>
					<a name="07052339000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not a housing expert, but I believe we need to build more than
300,000 units a year and the market is not doing that. There is clear
market failure in that regard, perhaps occasioned by land companies
holding on to their land banks and not developing them. I urge the
Treasury to consider the wider issue of what tax changes could be
brought about, perhaps by means of penalties for those sitting on land
banks, tax encouragement for those who wish to create new housing
stock, or a combination of the two. That may or may not fit into the
residential aspect of the REITs regime. In terms of the AIM issue,
which might suit residential REITs better, I understand why my hon.
Friend is keeping the matter under review, as REITs have been in
operation only since January. The Treasury and the Government need to
look at the tax regime to encourage a step change upwards in the number
of housing units being built in the United Kingdom each
year.</div>

the REITs regime could contribute to our wider objectives on housing
supply. I explained then that the real issue was whether we could reach
a consensus in the country about building more houses, but that
consensus is proving
elusive.</div>

							<a name="07052339000613"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> The clause introduces tax rules on a type of
Islamic bond known as a sukuk. In the Finance Acts of 2005 and 2006, we
introduced legislation that set out the tax treatment of several
sharia-compliant financial products, on which interest is not paid, but
an alternative financial return is paid instead. The broad principle of
the tax rules is that when a return paid to or by a saver or borrower
is economically equivalent to interest, it is taxed as though it were
interest.</div>
					<a name="07052339000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
measures were part of our wider agenda to make the City of London a
global, wholesale financial centre for Islamic financial products and
to ensure that the Muslim community in our country has the widest
possible access to Islamic retail financial products. In pursuing our
agenda to take forward those twin, complementary objectives, we have
established a standing committee of Islamic finance experts, the first
meeting of which I chaired a few weeks ago.</div>
					<a name="07052339000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the meeting, there was
acclaim around the table for the consensual steps forward that we have
taken in this House in previous Finance Acts. I am sure that the signal
that the UK is changing its tax law in the whole Islamic finance area
to encourage the commercial issuing of sukuk has been widely welcomed
around the world. Our subsequent announcement that we are considering a
Government bond issue that is consistent with sukuk principles has also
been widely welcomed. That sends out a powerful
signal.</div>
					<a name="07052339000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
make small but important technical changes, and were drafted as a
result of the consultation. Although sukuk are economically similar to
debt securities in law, they are not debts or loans, which gives rise
to difficulties with applying the tax rules that normally apply to
debts and loans. The interaction of the rules in the clause with
certain tax rules was not fully appreciated when the Bill was
published, and the amendments deal with some of those interactions. I
am happy to answer more detailed questions on the amendments, which
ensure that the Bill will achieve our announced
intentions.</div>
					
					<a name="07052339000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000614"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I have a few remarks to make that embrace both
the amendments and the clause, which I welcome. They are intended to
enable UK-based companies to issue sharia-compliant bonds, which are
commonly known as sukuk. I welcome also the greater clarity that the
measures will bring to the tax treatment of people who invest in sukuk,
whether they are issued by UK or foreign companies.</div>
					<a name="07052339000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">During Committee debates on
clauses 95 and 96 of last year&#146;s Finance Bill, on wakala and
musharaka finance, I recall drawing the Committee&#146;s attention to
a range of other sharia-compliant financial products, including sukuk.
Indeed, I believe that that was the sole reference to the word
&#147;sukuk&#148; in the whole of <i class="I">Hansard</i> until this
afternoon, although I must acknowledge that I made an error by
referring to the plural of sukuk as sukuks, which is
incorrect.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 355</div>
					<a name="07052339000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pointed out last year the
growing importance of sukuk issuance, and I am therefore very pleased
to see that the Government have subsequently chosen to legislate to
make it easier for the City of London and UK-based operators to obtain
a share of that increasingly important market. On many occasions during
this year&#146;s and last year&#146;s Finance Bill proceedings, I
have had harsh things to say about the Government and their failure to
respond to people&#146;s concerns, but I must say that I have had
extremely positive feedback about the Government&#146;s efforts on
that issue and on the meeting to which the Economic Secretary referred.
The amendments under consideration today are a direct result of the
discussions at that meeting, which is why they are welcome.</div>
					<a name="07052339000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have only one qualification.
There is in one way in which the proposals have disappointed. The new
rules should assist people seeking to securitise Islamic mortgage
portfolios using a sukuk, and the focus on mortgages is demonstrated by
subsection (3)(b). It expands the definition of &#147;financial
institution&#148; in section 46 of the Finance Act 2005, but only in
relation to bond assets that fall within sections 47 and 47A, which
include the tax provisions that govern the two main structures used by
banks to provide Islamic mortgages.</div>
					<a name="07052339000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have received representations
that the clause&#146;s focus on mortgage securitisation limits its
scope. The Treasury seems to view sukuk as the Islamic equivalent of
securitisation, rather than the equivalent of corporate bonds in
general. It is worth considering, perhaps for next year&#146;s
Finance Bill, ways of broadening the scope of the provisions to make
them more usable for all companies that wish to raise long-term finance
using sukuk. It may be worth consulting further on that
point.</div>
					<a name="07052339000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
that the measure represents a new area and that we are in relatively
uncharted territory, so we must take care to ensure that changes that
are meant to facilitate sharia-compliant financial products neither
cause unintended consequences nor produce tax loopholes. However, if
the Government are genuinely enthusiastic about making London an
attractive destination for Islamic finance&#151;and I believe that
they are&#151;it is worth taking time to determine whether it is
possible to broaden the clause without causing any negative
consequences.</div>
					<a name="07052339000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome the Economic Secretary&#146;s announcement about considering
whether the Government should issue debt that is structured as a sukuk.
There is in the idea an interesting potential for gaining access to a
wider range of investors, and it would be useful to hear what progress
is being made with it. Some of the state governments in Germany have
issued sharia-compliant bonds, so there is a precedent for it. It will
be interesting to see what the progress the Government have
made.</div>
					<a name="07052339000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
recall again my speech last year on the issue, when I mentioned not
only sukuk but a range of Islamic financial products, including ijara
leasing transactions, ijara-wa-iqtina, which replicates hire purchase,
takaful insurance products and Islamic risk-mitigating instruments.
Just as the Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 356</div>responded to my comments last year about sukuk, I hope that they might
look into whether the tax structure might be adapted to facilitate
other sharia-compliant products, not only for the reasons of allowing
the City to take a significant share of the market, but for the reasons
to which the Economic Secretary has referred regarding the importance
of ensuring that financial inclusion is extended to all sectors of our
community, including those of the Muslim
faith.</div>

Villiers:
						</b> The clause provides a welcome correction for
some errors contained in the trust modernisation legislation that we
had the pleasure to consider in last year&#146;s Finance Bill. I
confess that the error escaped my research in preparation for the
scrutiny of that Bill, although I recall that there was still a lengthy
list of problems on which we sought clarification.</div>
					<a name="07052339000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause appears to achieve
the intended outcome. It will restore the mechanism that was in
operation prior to the 2006 Act by which trustees of a settlement who
receive a payment made by a company on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 357</div>purchase of its own shares are taxable only on the excess over the
original subscription payment for the shares. The drafting error in the
2006 Act would have meant that they were taxed on the entire
payment.</div>
					<a name="07052339000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like me, the
Chartered Institute of Taxation welcomes the clause, but it has
expressed serious concerns on two points. First, it expresses regret
that the period for consultation was short. It pointed the problem out
on 3 August 2006, which should have given the Government a period for
consultation. Secondly, the CIOT highlights a more significant problem
with the approach taken to implementation, stating
that</div>
					<a name="07052339000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we reiterate our
concern at how HMRC intend to implement aspects of these changes, given
that the Notes and Tax Calculations for the 2006/07 Return are
inaccurate.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052339000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on
to state:</div>
					<a name="07052339000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is most unsatisfactory that Returns for 2006/07 submitted before Royal
Assent is given should be filed on the basis that the whole amount of
payment received on a buy-back of a company&#146;s shares is taxable,
with a correction having to be made subsequently.</div>
					<a name="07052339000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">It is disappointing that our
comments on improving the clarity of Explanatory Notes to the

ignored.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052339000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some
sympathy with the CIOT&#146;s point of view. It does not seem to make
a great deal of sense to require that tax returns submitted before
Royal Assent have to comply with the existing and incorrect
legislation. The CIOT states that that</div>
					<a name="07052339000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is a recipe for muddle and
confusion&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052339000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
is</div>
					<a name="07052339000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;accentuated by
numerous piecemeal changes to the trust taxation regime over the past
few
years&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07052339000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bearing
in mind that the provision will be backdated when the clause is
enacted, it seems pointless to require people to submit returns that
will have to be corrected. It also seems unfair to require people to
include in their tax return a sum of money&#151;the excess over the
subscription price paid for the shares&#151;that HMRC knows will not
be taxable once the Bill comes into effect. The CIOT
concludes:</div>
					<a name="07052339000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
taxpayer should not be penalised through enactment of defective
legislation&#148;.</div>

will not accept returns submitted on the basis of the legislation as

					<a name="07052339000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion,
I should like to put on record a general comment about the provisions
in the 2006 Act on the income and capital gains tax treatment of
trusts, which the clause seeks to amend. The provisions were billed as
simplifications and modernisations, but this is one of the most
mind-boggling, opaque and complex structures it has ever been my
misfortune to read about&#151;and that is even before one gets into
the twists and turns of the changes to the inheritance tax regime that
caused such controversy in relation to schedule 20. I suspect that the
Economic Secretary may return to this Committee in future years with
further corrections to this problematic
legislation.</div>

						</b> I hope that the next time the Minister responsible
returns to this piece of legislation, we will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 358</div>be celebrating the return of the Paymaster General, who is far more of
an expert on these matters than
myself.</div>
					<a name="07052339000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
amends a minor omission in last year&#146;s trust modernisation
legislation concerning payments received by trustees, as the hon.
Member for Chipping Barnet said. The omission in the Finance Act 2006
meant that in a buy-back the whole payment is taxed. The clause
corrects the position so that only the whole payment, less the original
subscription price, is taxable. Because the legislation that we are
correcting came into force on 6 April 2006, we are backdating the
clause to take effect from that date to ensure that nobody loses out.
HMRC consulted on the draft legislation, and representative bodies said
to us that they were content. A further minor omission in the same
legislation has been identified and is corrected by clause
55.</div>
					<a name="07052339000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">The omission is
regrettable but neither HMRC nor the representative bodies, nor any
other interested parties, picked it up during the passage of last
year&#146;s Finance Bill. A small number of trusts will be affected.
Each year, an estimated 20 trusts, out of some 200,000 trusts that make
a return, will receive a payment from a company&#146;s purchase of
its own shares. The return for 2006-07 had to be finalised by HMRC last
summer before it was aware of the omission. However, the return is
based on how the legislation was always intended to work, and is
rectified by the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07052339000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC issued
guidance advising trustees affected by the omission to wait until the
Finance Bill received Royal Assent before making their return. For the
small number of cases that are likely to be affected by the clause,
return guidance will lead trustees to enter an amount in accordance
with the legislation as was always intended. Therefore, taxpayers who
are not aware of the omission will not be disadvantaged. The
consultation did not last as long as we would have liked, but we are
satisfied that we consulted properly and, as a result, we have
addressed the omission that the hon. Lady
identified.</div>

that the HMRC is trying to get the information out to ensure that the
trusts affected know that they should not make their return before
Royal Assent. However, those who do not receive, or are not aware of,
the information will still be required to submit a return based on
incorrect legislation. Is that correct? I just wanted to check that I

out as a result of the process of correcting the omission. I do not
know whether we know the 20 trusts, but if we do that would mean fewer
letters to write than those sent to Committee members. We ought at
least to be able to manage
20.</div>

offshore funds on a similar footing in respect of tax for UK investors
in UK funds. The sector is fast moving and aspects of the regime have
begun to act as a barrier to commercial developments. That is why we
announced in October that the Government would consult with a view to

							<a name="07052339000625"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> The clause allows television companies that do
not qualify for film tax credit to opt out of the new tax regime for
film companies. I am delighted to see that provision in the Bill,
because I asked the Government to include it during the debate on the
Finance Bill last year. In scrutinising last year&#146;s Bill, it
seemed unfair to inflict a controversial new tax framework and a
significant compliance burden on companies producing TV and films that
were not destined for general release, and which therefore could not
qualify for the film tax credit.</div>
					<a name="07052339000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">I therefore tabled an amendment
to remove from the new accounting regime those companies that could not
qualify for the tax credit, such as TV companies. The response of the
Economic Secretary on that occasion, as recorded at column 234 of the
<i class="I">Hansard </i>report of Standing Committee A for 18 May 2006, was to
dismiss my amendment as going &#147;completely against the
intention&#148; of the Bill. Although I am pleased that he has seen
the light and responded to my concerns, I have to ask why the
Government could not get the issue right the first time around. The
explanatory notes refer to discussions with the industry, which no
doubt were useful, but the problem was flagged up with the Government
in Committee last year, while they still had time to solve it in that
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07052339000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
recurring theme in the history of the Chancellor&#146;s film tax
legislation. Since he first introduced his film tax break in 1997, the
rules have been revised by Finance Acts in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2005 and
2006, and now they being revised again in 2007. When I highlighted that
unfortunate history in the debate on last year&#146;s Finance Bill,
the Paymaster General and the Economic Secretary dismissed my concerns.
They were entirely confident that they had got film tax completely
right, even though they had got it wrong so many times in the past.
Their confidence has proven to be sadly misplaced, because here we are
again, although this is not the first time that the House has been
asked to consider film tax since the previous Finance Bill. It is
regrettable that after five major changes to the film tax regime in
seven years, the Government have had to come before the House twice in
the past 12 months to ask for approval of its cultural test for its
film tax regime.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column361" />Column number: 361</div>
					<a name="07052339000426"></a><div class="hs_Para">I asked the
Economic Secretary last year whether he anticipated any problems
obtaining European Commission approval for the new film tax credit. In
his confident response, he
said:</div>
					<a name="07052339000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The hon.
Lady suggested that the approach to defining UK expenditure in clause
35 was in some way determined by the European Commission. There was
absolutely no truth in her statement. On the contrary, the definition
of UK expenditure reflects our policy aim of encouraging producers to
make full use of film-making skills, facilities and infrastructure in
the UK.</div>
					<a name="07052339000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">It is true
that, as is required, we have been discussing with the Commission the
securing of state aids approval for the new relief, but the Commission
has not indicated any concerns about how we define UK expenditure nor
requested that we change the definition in any way. We have, for
example, reduced the qualifying limit from 40 per cent. to 25 per
cent., and we made that decision on the basis of the points put to us
during the consultation. In our view, the definition is well within the
ambit and requirements of the state aids rules. We are confident that
those discussions will proceed
apace.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052339000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Economic
Secretary goes on to say a little later
that</div>
					<a name="07052339000471"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;productions for
which filming has taken place predominantly or wholly overseas will be
entitled to a level of benefit lower than that of productions filmed in
the UK. That is entirely in line with the
Government&#146;s policy aim, set out clearly in the legislation, of
encouraging filmmakers to make full use of facilities and
infrastructure in the UK. This is an enhanced tax relief for making
British films in Britain, so it is not our intention to spoil overseas
film industries.&#148; &#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,
Standing Committee A,</i> 18 May 2006; c.
232.]</div>
					<a name="07052339000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, that was exactly
what the Commission later told the British Government that it could not
do. It required the deletion of that element of the Economic
Secretary&#146;s cultural test that gave favoured status to films
made in Britain. The only permissible criterion was whether or not a
film was culturally
British.</div>
					<a name="07052339000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
despite the brave words of the Economic Secretary, the Commission would
indeed determine the approach taken to &#147;UK expenditure&#148;
in relation to the film tax credit. Hence, the Paymaster General was
forced to return to the House to ask for its approval of a second
revised cultural test instead of the one debated in Committee last
year. That had a highly destabilising impact on a number of UK films
which thought that they were going to qualify for the new tax credit,
but then found that they could not. It also delayed the implementation
of the new film tax rules and forced the Government into a temporary
extension of the reliefs outlined in sections 42 and 48 to plug the
gap. Those were the reliefs that the Economic Secretary had repeatedly
told the Committee last year were flawed.</div>
					<a name="07052339000430"></a><div class="hs_Para">To compound that chapter of
accidents, no sooner had the Treasury announced the temporary extension
of the sections 42 and 48 reliefs, then it announced out of the blue
that it was going to scrap sideways loss relief in relation to those
reliefs, thereby undermining their value. It was reported that more
than 100 films would be negatively affected, including &#147;Casino
Royale&#148;. The film industry lobby swung into action. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column362" />Column number: 362</div>Three days later, it forced one of the swiftest U-turns in Government
history. It was frankly astounding that the Government announced a
significant crackdown on sections 42 and 48 reliefs, which they had
just agreed to extend and which HMRC was actively encouraging
filmmakers affected by the debacle over the cultural test to
use.</div>
					<a name="07052339000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">Frankly this is a
shambles. The Government&#146;s incompetent handling of film taxes
has cost the taxpayer billions and caused significant instability for
film financing. I very much hope that the Economic Secretary does not
have to return yet again to this Committee next year to ask for further
changes to the film tax
regime.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052339000626"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Clause 57 allows companies to opt out of the
special rules for film production companies, for which we legislated in
the Finance Act 2006. The clause is designed to respond to
representations from the TV industry in particular and has been
welcomed by it. The laws introduced last year were discussed with a
number of TV production companies and tax professionals. We believed
then, and still believe, that they make sense for many companies.
Therefore, we want to leave them in place. As the hon. Lady said, the
point was made in Committee last year that concerns had been raised.
Rather than rushing to make sudden changes then without consultation at
a later stage in last year&#146;s Finance Bill, we had further
discussion with those who saw problems and proposed a simple
proportionate solution, which is the clause before us today.</div>
					<a name="07052339000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the European matter that
she raises, the EC treaty prohibits subsidies that distort competition
and trade. Aid is allowed on cultural grounds for films. The Commission
has set out criteria for that. The UK&#146;s cultural test was
notified in December 2005. The Commission considered the test last
September and raised concerns that it was too focused on economic
rather than cultural factors. The Treasury, with the Revenue and the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport, then worked to produce a
revised test that met those concerns, while still supporting the
development of a sustainable film industry. We made those changes to
ensure that, consistent with our European obligations, we would transit
to the new regime, which is operational.</div>
					<a name="07052339000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">In recent years, we have had to
make changes to the film regime to ensure that tax avoidance was
addressed. Last year&#146;s regime, which we debated at length, is a
simplified, sensible and effective regime. The fact that we have such a
small change before us today is a tribute to the success of that new
regime, and I commend the clause to the Committee.</div>
