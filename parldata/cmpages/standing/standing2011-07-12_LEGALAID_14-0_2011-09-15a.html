key parties in the case. The clause is a much-weakened version of the
pledge given by the Tory party in opposition, before the general
election, to have transparent sentencing. I know that it considered
maxi-min sentencing. I know that it wanted to make release halfway
through a sentence

remains.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000046">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Of
course, in examining these matters, the Government have understood that
by and large the public simply do not understand why, if a person is
sentenced to four years, they are spending only two years in prison.
Until and unless we can make that clear to victims, we will not be able
to make it clear to the public. That is why our amendments refer
specifically to
them.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000047">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Another
problem is that the clause weakens the current obligations to explain
the meaning of the sentence by giving the Lord Chancellor a blanket
exceptions provision to exclude by order any crimes that he chooses.
That point was made strongly in representations by Liberty and Justice,
so I hope that the Minister can explain that
weakening.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000048">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
299 is designed to ensure that the offender understands the sentence.
Clearly, there is little point in sentencing someone if they do not
understand what they have done wrong and what is to happen to them or
what they must do as punishment and to rehabilitate themselves with
society. What may seem like ordinary language to a judge or magistrate
may not be clear to the offender. Our amendment is designed to improve
the drafting. I will speak about several classes of offender who are
particularly likely to have difficulty in understanding what is being
said to them. We could have drafted a more complex amendment that
referred to foreign languages, children’s particular needs and
intellectual development, and the use of Braille, but I decided not to
because the issues come down to one factor: the offender must
understand what is going

have speech, language or communication difficulties. That research was
done in 2007. A more recent study in 2010 showed that 65% have language

statistics that she has raised and has proposals for early intervention

however, clause 54 is helpful because it places a duty on the court to
explain matters “in ordinary language.” For example,
instead of referring to “your counsel”, the judge could
say “your barrister”; instead of
“mitigation”, the judge could use other words to explain
proceedings to the defendant in ordinary language that they will
understand. At the end of proceedings, the judge could make it clear to
the defendant that their barrister will explain again the full effects
of the sentence that has been passed, so that they have a full
understanding. The problems that the hon. Lady rightly raises will be

                  </div>difficulties faced in the criminal justice system by people who have
speech and communication problems. The amendment has been tabled
because we know that people have such problems. If people do not
understand proceedings, the risk is that they will not comply with the

come down hard on them, meaning that an injustice is done.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000060">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">That
contentious subject obviously arouses passions among Conservative
Members, so I shall move on to amendment 300. A custodial sentence is
the most serious penalty a court can impose, and it is right that the
sentencer explains why it has been given and why, if alternatives such
as a fine or community order were available, they were not
used.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000061">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 302
extends the list of people who will receive a written copy of the
sentence. During the evidence-taking session, we received submissions
that suggested a much longer list that would include all lawyers to all
parties and the press; the right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd
included that in one of his amendments. My amendment suggests a
slightly shorter list because I wanted to capture the essential parties
while avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy or imposing high levels of
resource cost on the court system. The amendment seeks to pare down the
parties involved to those considered essential.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000062">&#160;</a>

often not understanding the sentence. However, rather than having a
prescriptive procedure, which would be extremely costly and a nightmare
to administer, we should recognise that the failing and the fault lie
with the police officer who fails to liaise with the family, especially
in more serious cases, so that they understand the sentence. That
face-to-face explanation is the way to approach this; it is by far the
more humane and sensible approach. It would explain things tonnes
better than writing them down on a piece of paper, which, again,
assumes that the recipient can read.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000071">&#160;</a>

reduction in bureaucracy depending on who is required to give the
information. We had a long discussion earlier about legal aid, which is
paid for by the taxpayer, but I cannot see that there would be any
great reduction in the resources used if the barrister or the police,
rather than the court, have to write the letter. At the moment, there
are no such requirements on those people, so it is significant that
Victim Support says that the sentencer should cover such matters. It
would like what is said in court to be followed up by a letter from the

need to communicate more consistently and better with victims. It may
well be that mechanisms within the Crown Prosecution Service, such as
letter writing and proper liaison, can be improved. Let us consider the
position of a Crown court judge, perhaps with a busy list on a Friday
of six or seven different sentences, some of which involve more than
one defendant. How will such a proposal work for the judge who is
trying his best to get through the list and deal with every case in
turn? Will that judge be expected to write out verbatim each set of
sentencing remarks before he or she gives the judgment? That will lead
to a bit of a problem due to the bureaucracy involved, and it will
affect the swift and proper administration of justice when we are

                  <strong>Helen
Goodman:</strong> That remark is slightly misconceived. We could not
possibly have coverage of all the cases that are going on in the entire
nation. What victims, or those who have some particular relationship to
the crime, are interested in is their case. I do not suppose that the
BBC, Sky or others would broadcast cases about somebody smashing down
Mrs Jones’s back hedge. It would not be fantastically
fascinating to the great British public, but it would be of supreme
importance to Mrs Jones and it is she who would like to see that.
Whatever one’s views about the broadcasting of court cases, the
hon. Lady’s remarks are slightly
misconceived.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000082">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Coming
back to the amendment, I want to explain why I included
parents on the list. It is, I think, common ground across the House
that we want to support, reinforce and, in some cases, increase the
responsibility and control that parents exercise over their children,
particularly teenage children. If they are to do that, they must have
information about what their child is expected to do if they are on a
community order. That seems to be pure common
sense.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000083">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
included co-defendants, which I hoped was a way of avoiding confusion,
as well as probation and youth offending teams. We know that
co-ordination and co-operation between different parts of the criminal
justice system needs to be addressed. It is not as good as it should
be, and lack of communication seems to be one of the reasons why things
that ought to happen do not always
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000084">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
me turn to amendment 301 and the associated new clause 9, which require
the court to consider the impact of any sentence on children
and dependants, and to explain it to the offenders. The children of
offenders are the invisible victims of the criminal justice system, but
they should not be. That should be given more attention, particularly
when one considers the very large number of children whom we are
talking about.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000085">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In any year,
at any time, 160,000 children will have one parent or another in
prison. That is two and a half times the number of children who are in
care, and six times the number of children on the child protection
register. Each year, more children will have a parent in jail than will
experience their parents’ separation. Everybody knows, or can
easily imagine, that that is an unhappy and extremely disturbing
situation for children. The Department for Education believes that 7%
of all children will at some point in their childhood experience having
a parent in prison. Some 54% of prisoners have children under the age
of 18, and 17,700 children are separated from their mothers each year
because their mothers are in prison.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000086">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The position
of children whose mothers are in prison is of the most extreme concern.
I shall describe why that is, and why we need to address the issue in a
more strategic way than we have done hitherto. A lot of attention has
been focused on women in the criminal justice system, and the Minister
is trying, with limited resources, to continue the work begun by my
hon. Friend in the other place, Baroness Corston. The
children  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 595<a class="bkMark" name="Column595">&#160;</a>
                  </div>of offenders have not had sufficient attention. One
fifth of mothers in prison are lone parents, which is a higher
proportion than in the general population, where the figure is 9%, so
these children are already contending with issues of poverty and so
forth.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000087">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <h4 class="hs_Timeline">1.30

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">The
most interesting fact that I discovered when I researched the
issue—this is why I became increasingly concerned about
it—is that 92% of men in prison who have children say that their
partner is looking after their children, but only 9% of women in prison
who have children say that their partner is looking after
their children. That is extremely alarming—90% of children are
not with either parent. Only 5% of children with a parent in prison are
able to stay in the home that they were living in before the parent was
imprisoned; the other 95% have to move. That is why I come back to the
remark—I know that it sounds rhetorical, but I think that there
is truth in it—that these children are the hidden victims of the
criminal justice system.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000088">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am sure that
the issue causes concern to all Members across the House. We are
talking about the welfare of the child and the long-term effects on
them, their potential and their future in society. Obviously, there is
also an effect on their parents—particularly their mothers, as I
say—because nobody can be expected to concentrate on some
programme requirement if they are anxious about what is happening to
their children outside prison. There is also a cost to us
all.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000089">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However, I am
not simply referring to the need to give information and to address the
needs of dependants when parents are sent to prison. We have included
fines and curfews in the list. We will come back to curfews when we
discuss a later clause, but on fines, I remind hon. Members that the
Financial Services Authority produced a report for the National
Offender Management Service that found that 48% of prisoners have a
history of debt. It also found, not surprisingly, that 60% of families
become worse off while a member of the family is in prison.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000090">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am not
arguing, of course, that people with children should never go to
prison; that would be an absurd proposition. I am not arguing that they
should never pay a fine or compensation. I am not arguing that no
mother should ever go to prison, although there are people who argue
that, but that is not my view or the view of the Opposition. Of course
there are dangerous and violent women who need to be locked up, just as
other people who are dangerous and violent need to be locked up.
Sometimes, of course, women need to be kept away from their children
for the welfare of the child. However, if we look at what is going on
overall, we see that we have the balance wrong at the
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000091">&#160;</a>

have children who are under 18 should not be taken into account? That
would mean that payment of child tax credit or child benefit would

us to be satisfied if it takes decisions irrespective of the
consequences and simply expects social services departments to pick up
the pieces. Social services departments will have to do that unless the
impact on children is taken into account at the point of decision. I
will go so far as to say that the way that the interests of children
are ignored is
irresponsible.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000093">&#160;</a>

asked of a lone parent’s representative is: “What is
happening to the children, and what provision has been made for
them?” In my experience, all magistrates and judges know
precisely the consequences of a lone parent receiving a custodial
sentence, because invariably the state has to pick up the pieces, and

                  </strong> The hon. Lady says that, but I will go on to give
her some more information that suggests that things are perhaps not so
rosy, or operating so well. In a survey of 1,400 women in Holloway with
children, 42 of them—4%—did not even know where their
children were and who was looking after
them.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000097">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
I am sure that the hon. Lady has read the Corston report, and I suggest
that she re-read it. It contains alarming data collected by a voluntary
sector organisation called Hibiscus. The children of foreign national
prisoners are those most at risk, as they are sometimes left to fend
for themselves. No account is taken of that, even though the children
might be abroad. The hon. Lady needs to pause, therefore, and consider
whether things are quite as well organised as she
suggests.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000098">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
first problem is the shock for the child of a parent suddenly
disappearing. The judge might know what will happen, but not the child.
In 85% of cases this is the first significant separation between the
child and the parent. Only 5% of the children can live at home and the
other 95% have to move. Of the children of women prisoners, 9% are
looked after by their fathers, and 25% by grandmothers. Some of the
children go into care, fostering or adoption, but the Ministry of
Justice’s statistics do not add up to 100%. We do not know what
is happening to all the children, and I hope that if the Minister
cannot tell us today, he will initiate an investigation and collect the
numbers, because a policy cannot be reasonable if it is not based
properly on the
facts.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000099">&#160;</a>

fantastic, but I honestly do not believe her, and in any case I do not

people receive pre-sentence reports. When a probation officer speaks to
a defendant, they will ask about his or her family circumstances. That
whole duty then kicks in. The judge will notice from the pre-sentence
report whether there are children and what arrangements are in place.
There is no evidence to suggest that judges and magistrates do not take
into account family circumstances. Where is the evidence that they do
not? In my experience and—I suspect—that of everyone

that the outcomes are so poor for children whose parents are in prison.
The hon. Member for Broxtowe suggests that in some cases—I am
sure that she is correct—the outcomes would be poor irrespective
of whether those children’s parents are incarcerated. However, I
suspect that that is quite a small number, and that the incarceration
of the mother, in most cases, will make the situation worse. In
particular, the fact that so many children seem to be forced to move

magistrate for 16 years, both the attention that pre-sentencing reports
paid to the position of dependants and the attitude of magistrates
regarding whether they were legitimately taking account of the

			Column number: 598<a class="bkMark" name="Column598">&#160;</a>
                  </div>well-being of children were patchy. I support the
amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland not
to create more bureaucracy, but to ensure that we are consistent and
systematic in placing the well-being of children at the forefront of
sentencing
decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000104">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that
intervention. I said that there are several reasons why we need to take
the matter into account. Another is the implications for the taxpayer.
On average, a prison place costs about £40,000 a year for a man
and £56,000 a year for a woman. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation
believes that, where there are children, the average cost is about
£5,000 per family, which will be higher in cases where children
are being taken into care, fostered or
adopted.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000105">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
also need to take account, as I said at the beginning, of whether the
separations are conducive to prisoners rehabilitating themselves. As I
said before, there are particular problems for women. Only half the
women maintain contact with their children while in prison. That is
made considerably more difficult for them because, inevitably, the
women’s estate is more sparsely distributed around the country.
A high proportion of women are more than 100 miles from their homes.
People have to travel long distances to visit, and there is no
financial support for families to make those
visits.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000106">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Another
aspect is the long-term costs for the child. Unsurprisingly, the
prognosis for such children is poor. They have a higher chance of being
not in education, employment or training. I think the Ministry of
Justice knows that there is a trebled risk of antisocial behaviour. The
experience of having a parent in prison is traumatic and stigmatising.
It is bad for children’s health and education, and it means that
they are more likely to live in
poverty.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000107">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">By
not addressing the needs of such children at the outset, we are setting
them on a path to being far more likely to be involved in the criminal
justice system for the rest of their life. Some 37% of prisoners come
from families in which someone has been found guilty of something more
serious than a motoring offence, and 32% of prisoners come from
families in which someone has been in prison. The “Cambridge
Study in Delinquent Development” published in 2005 found that
having another member of the family in prison was the biggest risk
factor for people’s future options, being bigger than any of the
other social and economic problems that they
face.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000108">&#160;</a>

speech. We need more community sentences, which is why we have
pioneered the women’s centres. I am extremely disappointed that

such an alternative is available.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000110">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> My hon. Friend says that they are, but I have
checked what is going on and I have to tell her that women have
received the same length of sentence for similar crimes. The problem is
that they are more likely to be given a custodial sentence early on:
for a first offence, 28% of women receive a custodial sentence compared
with 13% of men. To pick up precisely the point made by the right hon.
Member for Carshalton and Wallington, 70% of the men in prison but 82%
of the women in prison are there for non-violent offences, which is why
we need to reconsider the
balance.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000113">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
hope that the Minister will see that I am arguing for a system that is
more humane but also more economic in the long run. The New Economics

               <p class="tabbed">I
am in broad agreement with most of what the hon. Lady has said, but I
will confine myself to the amendments that I have tabled. In effect,
amendment 267 would place a duty on courts to notify in writing the
offender, the offender’s legal representative, victims of the
offence, family members or representatives of the victims, the Crown
Prosecution Service, co-defendants, other legal representatives, the
probation service, the offender’s guardian or parent if the
offender is under 18, and representatives of the media. I will explain
why I refer to representatives of the media.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000116">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The amendment
would effectively remove the Lord Chancellor’s power to
prescribe by regulation cases in which the duty to give reasons for the
sentence imposed and explain its effect in court
should not apply. I believe that the duty should apply in all cases. It
is also highly desirable for a written version to be provided of the
reasons for and explanation of the sentence. The amendment provides for
cases in which offenders are not present in court for sentence, for
example because they have chosen to absent themselves. Under the
amendment, the judge or bench would still have a duty to explain to
those in court the reasons for imposing the sentence, as
well as its effect, but a written version would be given to the
offender. The amendment would also provide for
written versions to be distributed to representatives of the
victim’s family, as I explained.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000117">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am not
speaking to my amendment just for the sake of it; perhaps I could not
say so of anybody else either. The hon. Member for South Swindon is an
experienced barrister dealing with criminal matters. He knows that on
Fridays, judges sentence many people, and some 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 600<a class="bkMark" name="Column600">&#160;</a>
                  </div>people only get a few succinct remarks. Often,
Fridays are frantic. I have no doubt that he, as an experienced and
well-regarded barrister, would explain things to the client, as would
the hon. Members for Broxtowe and for Kingston upon Hull East and I.
However, I will give an example. It is true, which is why I will not
name the person. I was representing a young man whose parents were
elderly. He had somehow succeeded in burrowing a hole through the back
yard fence and had set up a huge tent in the adjacent field, which was
not being used, to grow 120 or 130 cannabis plants. He came up for
sentencing in Caernarfon Crown court. Up until that point, he had had
an educational record that many of us in this room would envy. He had a
hatful of A-pluses and was destined to have at least four As at
A-level. He was a high flyer who would undoubtedly go to
university.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000118">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I went down to
the cells to see him, and I said, as one would, “I’m
sorry, nobody can avoid a custodial sentence. My job will be to keep it
as short as I possibly can in the circumstances. What are you going to
do when you’re released?” He turned to me and said,
“I’ve thought about that.” I said,
“Good,” and made some notes. He said, “For the
last nine or 10 months, every apple I eat, I’ve kept the apple
core, and I’ve planted it. When I come out, I shall sell the
apples.” That showed that he was not very lucid, and that I was
not getting through to him. I am not making fun of the young gentleman.
He had been smoking cannabis, the strong stuff, since he was 13 years
of age, and that was what happened. I could not get through to him, and
I have no doubt that the judge did not get through to him.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000119">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I went down to
see him after the sentence, which was mercifully short, but
a custodial sentence none the less. I explained to him once again and
said, “Do you understand?” He said, “Yes, I
do.” The following day, his father rang my chambers, because the
young man could not explain what had happened or what
sentence he had received. I am afraid that that
is not uncommon, given the huge amount of strong cannabis that is now
being taken and the number of people suffering from
delusions, drug problems and so on. Others, of course, might have
hearing problems. That is a snapshot that illustrates why
the amendment might be
useful.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000120">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some
time ago, Lord Justice Leveson came before the Justice Committee. I put
it to him that it would be a useful addition to our practice if
sentencing judges or magistrates included a brief
résumé—say four sentences—of what the
sentence was, why it was imposed and how long it would be in effect. He
said that, unfortunately, courts would be very busy. I have no doubt
that the clerks in the magistrates courts and the associates in the
Crown court are very busy. However, if we are serious about
transparency and making the public aware of what a sentence means, why
it was imposed and how it works, it is not too much to ask for a brief
résumé of four or five sentences to be taken and for a
copy of that to be sent to a list
of—<em>[</em>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We should also
consider the amendment in relation to reporting. Not so long ago, a
circuit judge in south Wales sentenced a paedophile. As a result of the
operation of two or three different Acts, he could not give that wretch
a longer sentence than the one that he imposed—he could not
possibly do it. He was vilified in the press. I went on local radio to
defend that judge, who is highly regarded and fair minded. The remarks
that he had made in sentencing were ignored. He had clearly said that
he was constrained by particular Acts and therefore could not sentence
that man to a day longer, but the press came out and said
that he was treating a paedophile very softly indeed and had not
imposed a proper sentence on him.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000124">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That is not
the first and will not be the last example of the press, by design or
otherwise, misconstruing what judges have said. Such cases could be
cleared up if we followed the simple procedure in the proposals. It
just so happens that the judge in question, who was completely
exonerated from day one, is now a member of the High Court bench, and
rightly so. The point is that time and time again, some parts of the
press think that misconstruing judges creates a good story, which it
does, because people like to read about other people getting things
wrong and making an appalling mess of it.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000125">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment’s purport is to ask for a succinct note of the
business end of the sentencing remarks to be made available. That is
not too much to ask—it would be transparency at work. The hon.
Member for South West Norfolk referred to televising court proceedings,
which is not a good idea. People might play to the gallery,
witnesses’ words might be constrained or people might say things
that they would not dream of saying were they not in the public
gaze.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000126">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
televising sentencing remarks might be useful. I am not against what
the hon. Lady said. I am against televising routine cases throughout
their proceedings, but televising sentencing—yes.
However, that will not be an answer to the problem, because although
there might be a growth in local television, there will not be a
television camera in every Crown court in England and
Wales.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000127">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The mechanics are important. The Crown courts
automatically tape proceedings. The court associates have access to a
national computer system and they are busy typing in the orders that
are made, so they have a lot of work on their hands already, and that
is vital because the judge can look at a living file on every occasion.
Finally, the judges themselves are doing a tick-box exercise because
they are taking part in a national survey on sentencing. Already, there
is a lot of paperwork. I am sorry if I am repeating my point. I am
concerned that this is yet another burden and that it may be the straw
that breaks the camel’s
back.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000135">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> That may be so, but we could argue about that. The
hon. Gentleman knows that judges often do not fill in the boxes anyway
because they feel overworked. Perhaps the answer is to list five of six
fewer pleas on a Friday. I have made the point as best I can. I should
like also to refer to the victims in all of this. Sally Gimson told the

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is a real measure of where the Government are that we are having such a
discussion. It is exciting because, for the first time in a long time,
we are having substantive discussions about deep, penal reform. It is
also encouraging to have heard the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland
making such constructive suggestions and engaging in what, I hope, is a
momentous point in our prison history. It is also interesting to see
how her attitude is diverging from that of other members of the
Opposition Front Bench, especially her boss, who has been giving a
rather different impression of what he thinks about non-custodial
sentences.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000140">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments have one thing in common, which would be to add complication
and detail to what is already a large Bill. There are many things that
we need to correct, particularly in sentencing. We are dealing with a
massively over-extended Courts Service, one which almost approaches
chaos at points. We are attending to what is, at times, a dysfunctional
CPS, which is unable to proceed in the normal sense of administrative
efficiency. We are also dealing with a broken social service system,
which too often does not take the needs and requirements of women
offenders and their children into account. We know about that, but to
try to make perfect the enemy of the good now would be
counter-productive. By adding in so many requirements, the gist of
which I think that everyone on the Government Benches would support, we
would be making life harder for the Courts Service at the point at
which it will see the largest revolution in sentencing for many
decades.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000141">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
hope that, in time, there is the prison capacity to bring proper
min-max sentencing to bear. We know that we cannot do that at the
moment because there is not the capacity. When we have the capacity for
a more civilised approach to women prisoners, we can repeat what is
done in Doncaster prison, for example, by bringing families together on
a twice-weekly basis, and bring some of the best practice from Norway
about part-time prisoners. With the available resources, we can
reconsider such issues. However, given the significant challenges faced
by the Minister with responsibility for prisons, such issues would
muddy the Bill and be
counter-productive.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000142">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
suppose that I am one of the few members of the Committee who is not a
barrister, but I have sat on the bench with a Crown court judge during
his sentencing process. His big worry was having the time to think
through sentences and give the right one instead of filling out forms
and ticking boxes all the time. For him 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 604<a class="bkMark" name="Column604">&#160;</a>
                  </div>and his colleagues to have to go through the process of writing
statements and much of what is referred to under the amendments tabled
by the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland and the right hon. Member for
Dwyfor Meirionnydd could also be counter-productive because it could
lead to an increase in poor sentencing, which is already a concern for
the bench. The right hon. Gentleman tabled a typically generous and
kind-hearted amendment, but an increasing requirement on both the
Courts Service, which itself is barely able to manage, and on judges
could produce an increase in bureaucracy and administrative costs that
will take money from the probation service and other parts of
Government where it could be better spent.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000143">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We will end up
in a difficult situation if judges are required to distinguish
custodial and non-custodial sentences; I have discussed that with the
Prison Reform Trust, which raised the issue with me. Government
Members, with support from some Opposition Members, are seeking tough
non-custodial sentences that the public understand to be as onerous for
the offender as a custodial sentence. If we write into the Bill a
requirement that sets a bar, almost suggesting that a custodial
sentence is more serious and onerous than a non-custodial sentence, it
could have a counter-productive impact on public opinion. Amendment 300
is, therefore, misconceived. I understand its purpose but think that it
could have a perverse impact on the media relations that we know we
must somehow correct.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000144">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The amendments
speak to many of our concerns about language, women and explaining
sentencing to the public. However, I have considered each of them
carefully and feel that each could end up having a perversely bad
effect on what we are trying to achieve across the House. I hope that
we can revisit them at a later point in proceedings, but I cannot
support them.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000145">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Although we might not see it from casual
observation, there is much consensus in the Committee about the issues
under discussion, and I was struck by the comments made by the hon.
Member for Ipswich, which were sensible and realistic in many respects.
I want to add a couple of points about sentencing and the consideration
of dependents. This has been a useful discussion and I think it would
be helpful to put them on the record.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000146">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have spoken
a lot about what already goes on in court, but we must make a
distinction between magistrates courts, where the vast majority of
cases are heard and where most of the judiciary are not professional
judges but lay magistrates, and the Crown court where more serious
cases are heard, and where judges have a high degree of professional
expertise and deal with considerable pressures given the importance and
busyness of their courts. There has been some blurring over what
mechanisms are in place to record sentences and what goes on in court,
and how that information is fed back to defendants, their victims and
anyone else who is interested. We need careful and detailed plans so
that the right mechanisms are in place for each judicial forum. It is
important to understand that what works in the Crown Court might not
work in the magistrates
court.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000147">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When
I sat as a magistrate between 1993 and 2009, the process of sentencing
decisions improved considerably. The structured approach that
magistrates began to take, and the way they approached decision making
and used 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 605<a class="bkMark" name="Column605">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the sentencing form to record the basis for their decision as they went
along, was a significant improvement on what happened when I was first
on the bench. We have, therefore, the bones of a structure that can be
used to improve communication, and I hope the Minister will tell the
Committee how he thinks we might build on that improvement in
sentencing procedure and improve the communication of
sentencing.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000148">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Unfortunately,
one downside to the improvement in sentencing structures is that they
become very complex; the hon. Member for South Swindon referred to
that. For example, a community penalty can have a number of different
elements. I have bitter memories of flicking backwards and forwards
through sentencing guidelines on pronouncements because I was trying to
describe a community penalty that had three or four different
components, none of which was on the same page. There were different
options for which parts to read out, depending on how far the process
had gone, who the defendant was, how many times they had previously
appeared in court and whether they had pleaded guilty. Discounts are an
important part of our sentencing framework but, as is accepted across
the Committee, they add further complexity to making and communicating
a sentencing decision. I am in favour of anything that helps simplify
the process of explaining how different components come together,
because we have not yet achieved perfection.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000149">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I was
interested in the remarks made by the hon. Member for Ipswich about not
wanting to downplay the seriousness of a community penalty by putting
in extra explanations about when a custodial sentence is imposed that
would not otherwise be applied. I understand his point and will reflect
on it, but the converse argument is that custody is a very serious
penalty and we should ensure that when magistrates and judges are
reaching for it they can absolutely verify and validate the process by
which they arrive at the conclusion that no other sentencing option is
possible. A pronouncement explaining that might help to ensure that the
decision is absolutely rock solid and
secure.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000150">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
I made most of my comments on dependents in my earlier intervention on
my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland, but I would say that
there are still judges and magistrates who are unsure and ambivalent
about the weight they ought to give to the existence of children in the
family of a defendant, particularly a mother, who is facing a custodial
sentence. It would help to be explicit that not only is it legitimate,
but it is required of courts to take that factor into account. It would
not predispose the judge in their ultimate sentencing decision, but it
would be useful explicitly to say to the courts: “This factor
falls within the purview of your sentencing decision.” Whatever
the hon. Member for Broxtowe and others might believe is the practice
in most cases, the extent of poor outcomes for children whose parents
are incarcerated suggests that we are not giving the weight that we
should to the well-being of
children.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000151">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I want to speak in support of the amendments
tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland. I think that I

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 606<a class="bkMark" name="Column606">&#160;</a>
                  </div>debate, and sometimes with Opposition Members,
because some valid points have been made. In fact, I almost became Lib
Demified at some point; I could not really decide who I was supporting.
I was almost completely ashamed of myself, and would have needed to be
dealt with by a
judge.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000152">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
a serious note, it is important that defendants, parties to proceedings
and victims understand properly the detail of the sentence. I do not
agree with the argument that it is too much trouble for a judge to
spend a couple of minutes filling out a simple form. I have not been a
judge, but the hon. Member for South Swindon sat as a Crown court
recorder and would have had a busy list on a Friday, so I am sure that
he has much more experience than I have of the pressures on the
judiciary in a Crown court situation. In my experience, however, the
judiciary go to great lengths to try to explain sentences, and I do not
think that it would take them more than a couple of minutes to explain
what the sentence outcome was. That would provide more transparency and
act as a safeguard for the judge, to an
extent.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000153">&#160;</a>

“But it is unnecessary.” We have had a good debate on the

worthy. The amendments are

the practicalities of recording every sentencing are difficult. It

of televising courts; I do not agree with it. There is a tendency for
advocates to play to the gallery, as the right hon. Member for Dwyfor
Meirionnydd said, and I think there is a danger that the judiciary
might do so as well. In my experience, if the press are in the public

replaces section 174 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 with a

proposal was widely supported by the vast majority of those who
responded to the consultation paper “Breaking the Cycle”.
Many people, not least in the judiciary, have said clearly that the

legislation is difficult to locate and understand, and can become
simply impracticable in the day-to-day operation of the courts. The
Government want to address those problems, which is why we created
replacement section 174 to simplify, shorten and consolidate the
various changes made to the section since 2003. In doing so, however,
we have retained the important statutory requirements placed on courts
to explain the effects of a sentence and, crucially, the duty to state
in open court, in ordinary language, the court’s reasons for the
sentence. That means that not only the offender but victims, witnesses
and the public can see justice being done. It is a balancing act
between the need to ensure that courts make it clear why a sentence is
being imposed and the need to avoid burdening courts with unnecessary
and prescriptive provisions that confuse rather than clarify.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000163">&#160;</a>

to explain the clause. I know that the first set of amendments was
inspired by the briefing produced by Liberty, and they are none the
worse for that; we all rely on advice. I turn to why the Government
believe that amendments 267 to 270 are unnecessary and
impractical, and why they are unlikely to achieve what the right hon.

of amendment 267 would delete a power that allows the Lord Chancellor
to prescribe cases where the duty to explain does not apply, or where
the explanation of a sentence may be made in the absence of the

would change the nature of the duty to explain the effect of a sentence

                  </div>it in place. One of the arguments made to me was that the power was put
in place in 2003, so we might as well leave it there. I have to say
that preserving anything that was put in place in 2003, given the
quality of that particular piece of legislation, was not an argument
that I found terribly convincing.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000166">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Consequently I
am happy to say to the right hon. Gentleman on the specific point about
section 174(4) that I will go away and look at the power, and I will
see if anyone cleverer than me can come up with examples of where it
might be used. If they do come up with an example, we may want to
preserve it, but if they do not I see no reason not to get rid of it,
which would be consistent with the aim of simplifying the
position.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000167">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 267
would also change the nature of the duty to explain the effect of a
sentence when the offender is not present in court, so that it became a
general duty to explain rather than a duty to ensure that the effect of
a sentence was explained to the offender. The Government consider that
the duty to explain is rightly directed at the offender, whether or not
they are present in court, because it is primarily the offender who
must be made aware of the implications of their non-compliance with
their sentence.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000168">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Practical
issues arise with the next part of the amendment, which would place a
requirement on a court to provide written reasons for sentencing and a
written explanation of the sentence in every case. The amendment would
go on to require, again in every case, that these written remarks are
given or posted to the offender and no fewer than nine other groups.
That is simply not a practical proposition. More than 1 million
sentencing decisions are made each year and providing written reasons
in 10 million letters would lead to a large increase in the work load
of courts at very significant expense. In addition, such a proposition
would not help to build understanding of sentencing among the public.
Sending sentencing remarks to representatives of the media in every
case, as the amendment also requires, would simply swamp the media
organisations. Swamping the media organisations may have its own
appeal, but perhaps it should not be done at the expense of the
taxpayer.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000169">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>As
we are representing the interests of the taxpayer here, I have a
problem with “a very substantial cost” being added to the
system, and it would also complicate the life of court administrators.

fear that I must invite the Committee to resist the proposal.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000173">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">That
is not to say that there is no written record of the sentence; just
because judges do not always issue written sentencing remarks does not
mean that there is no written record. For offenders receiving a
custodial sentence, the sentence is first recorded by the court clerk;
normally, the offender’s counsel or legal representative will
then explain the sentence to the offender before they leave the
building, as members of the Committee have made clear. The witness care
unit has an obligation to explain the sentence to both victims and
witnesses in writing in due course, and when the offender is taken to
prison, a warrant issued by the court is given to the prison detailing
the sentence that has been handed down. The prison then calculates the
release date for the defendant and informs him or her of that as soon
as possible. For community orders, the probation service receives a
record of the court’s order and explains the implications to the
offender at the first meeting. With fines, the offender is issued with
a collection order that sets out the terms and methods of
payment.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000174">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">For
those reasons, we oppose any further prescriptive additions to
legislative duties, although I do not want to suggest that we have
dismissed the thoughts behind the amendment. We want to increase the
public’s understanding of sentencing, on which both sides of the
Committee are in agreement. That is why the court service has agreed,
in response to the victims commissioner’s recent report, to make
transcripts of sentencing remarks in cases involving deaths available
to the family of the victim. We are also making sentencing information
more available and transparent. As has been recently reported, and as
referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for South West Norfolk, we are
considering televising sentencing remarks. They are practical measures
that will help victims, witnesses and the public understand sentencing,
and I hope that the right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd will agree
that they form a more achievable approach than his amendment,
particularly in the current economic circumstances. Our approach
is consistent with both his objective and our aim of
generally reducing prescription and the burden of
administration.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000175">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
268 to 270 would reinstate in section 174 the requirement
for a court to set out where an offender has received a custodial
sentence because they have met the custodial threshold, or where they
have met the threshold for a community order. Such thresholds are
contained in sections 148 and 152 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. In
revising section 174, we have removed the unnecessary provisions, such
as those that the amendments seek to reinstate. There is already a
general duty to give reasons for a sentence in ordinary language under
subsection (2). Where an offender receives a custodial sentence or a
community order, the court will invariably say why it has imposed that
sentence, that the offence is so serious that a custodial sentence is
necessary, or that a community order is warranted. The general duty
already covers the need to explain if a custodial or community order
threshold is met. I am alive to the issues raised by my hon.
Friend the Member for Ipswich about making community orders
more robust and punitive. He made a sound point about the overlap
between the punitive effects of sentences in the community
and in prison.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000176">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Listing
specific custodial and community sentence threshold requirements in
section 174 is an example of how the 2003 Act has become overly
complex, and that is what we are trying to address in the Bill, and I
hope that the explanation will reassure the right hon. Gentleman that
amendments 267 to 270 can be
withdrawn.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000177">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
298 to 302, which were tabled by the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland,
cover similar ground, although in a different way. I have already set
out why we think that the general duties to give reasons and the effect
of a sentence are important. Amendment 299 would, however, delete the
duty to explain in open court and in plain language the reasons for
imposing a sentence. That general duty in subsection (2) is crucial to
ensure transparency and public confidence in sentencing. It is also a
long-standing legal requirement set out in statute and, for many years
before that, in case law, that a court must give reasons for its
sentence, rather than simply stating what the sentence is. It is also
crucial for the appellate court, so that it knows the court’s
reasons for a particular sentence.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000178">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 299
would also replace the duty to give reasons for a sentence with a duty
on the court to take reasonable steps to ensure that the offender
understands the terms of the sentence. That, however, is exactly what
subsection (3) of revised section 174 will do. In short, amendment 299
would delete a crucial duty and replace it with a requirement that
already exists.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000179">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 300,
as I understand it, seeks to add to the duties of the court. It would
add a requirement to explain why a custodial sentence has been imposed;
in other words, to explain that the offender has met the custodial
threshold, as set out in section 152 of the 2003 Act. As I
have already said in relation to amendment 270, we have
removed the specific requirement to outline when an offender has met
that and the community order threshold, because that requirement is met
by the general duty to give reasons for a sentence in
subsection (2). That reduces the detail of section 174
without losing the important duty to give reasons. However, amendment
299 would delete the duty to give reasons for a sentence, so the
specific requirement would, rather oddly, create a duty to give just
the one reason for a sentence. To compound the confusion, the duty to
give a reason for a custodial sentence is inserted into section 174(3),
which is the duty to explain the effects of a sentence. That would
confuse the reasons for and the effects of a
sentence.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000180">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
302 is similar to amendment 267 in that it would place a requirement on
the court to provide written sentencing remarks. As I have said,
written sentencing remarks can be valuable, especially in very serious
or controversial cases, but to require them in every case, even for
five rather than 10 groups, is simply
impracticable.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000181">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
I understand the thinking behind amendment 300 and new
clause 9, which are both designed to ensure that the court considers
the existence of children and dependants in sentencing. They are both
well intentioned. Amendment 300 would add to the duty on the court to
explain the effect of a sentence a new duty to explain the effect on
the children and dependants of the offender. I do not believe that such
a change is required, is in keeping with the clause or is a practical
proposition. The duty in subsection (3) of revised section 174 is to
explain to offenders the effect of the sentence imposed 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 611<a class="bkMark" name="Column611">&#160;</a>
                  </div>on them—for example, what will happen if they breach a
requirement of the community order or when they will be released from a
custodial sentence. The effect of a sentence on children is a wholly
different subject that will be considered when deciding what sentence
to impose, not when explaining the effect of the sentence for the
offender.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000182">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">New
clause 9 would place a specific requirement on a court to consider
children and dependants in sentencing. I do not believe that such a
specific addition to the law is necessary. In considering a sentence,
courts must take into account the offence’s seriousness, which
relates to the harm caused and the culpability of the offender. In
deciding on the seriousness of an offence, courts will have regard to
any mitigating circumstances of the offender, including consideration
of the offender’s responsibility for the care of children or
dependants. That is a long-established practice, and guidance is
provided by judgments of the Court of Appeal on the weight to be given
to care responsibilities as a mitigating factor. Although I understand
the reasons behind new clause 9, I do not think that it is necessary to
place yet more prescriptive provisions into law when the judiciary can
and already do consider such matters as mitigating factors in
sentencing.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000183">&#160;</a>

the increases in sentencers’ discretion in the clause to allow
for cases where a breach of conditions under a community order is
trivial. In amendments 303 and 304, however, we oppose the use of fines
in the event of such a breach. Essentially, we have three objections to
that measure. First, it undermines the community order regime;
secondly, it will privilege the very wealthy who might come into
contact with the criminal justice system; and thirdly, we have doubts
about the efficacy of the fining regime.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000244">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">First
I will look at some of the community orders. The community orders
include offending behaviour programmes, which might include programmes
to address patterns of domestic violence or sexual offence, curfews and
community orders intended to address people’s drug or alcohol
problems. If attitudes and behaviours are driving people’s
criminal behaviour and the offender refuses to comply with an order to
go on a programme to address the underlying drivers of the offending
behaviour or to acknowledge and address their problems, we do not
accept, and the public will not accept, that fining will be adequate
recompense or a way of making people change their behaviour in the
appropriate
manner.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000245">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to remind members of the Committee of what is going on at the
moment. I am grateful to the National Association of Probation Officers
for this information. Of all community orders imposed in 2009, some 52%
ran their course successfully, 12% were terminated early for good
progress, 16% were terminated for failure to comply and 10% were
convicted of further offences. The pattern will not be significantly
different in other years. Perhaps one quarter of people will be fined
instead of being sent to custody or required to complete their
community orders.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000246">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As an example,
take someone who is beating his wife. It cannot be acceptable that he
should avoid dealing with that problem through paying a fine. That is
not a fanciful example. When I went to visit the probation office in
Middlesbrough, which covers both my constituency and that of my hon.
Friend the Member for Stockton North, I met one of the probation
officers, who told me that she was dealing with an offender who had
repeatedly been up on domestic violence charges. He begged her not to
be recommended for a domestic violence programme and to have an
alternative. She was obviously highly resistant to that, which was
right.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000247">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We need to
make it absolutely clear to people that a fine is not acceptable and
that we will not flex the system to that extent. That view is also held
by the Magistrates’ Association, given the example that it gave.
If a person is on a curfew, and the curfew is that they have to be at
home on a Saturday afternoon instead of being at a football match
having a fight, as they do on a regular basis, it is no use to give
them a fine if they breach that. That is not an acceptable
alternative.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000248">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> My hon. Friend makes precisely a point that I was
going to come to. To the kind of people that my hon. Friend is talking
about, £2,500 is a trivial sum of money. They will take legal
advice and they will avoid the 100 hours unpaid community work, which
to them, on their stupendous salaries, would be worth thousands and
thousands of pounds. They will simply write the cheque. That is not
fanciful. I have here a report from <em>The Times</em> about Ms Naomi
Campbell. It
states:<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000250">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Yesterday
Campbell, 38, pleaded guilty to kicking and spitting at police officers
after flying into an uncontrollable rage on board a flight from
Heathrow to Los Angeles in April. Campbell had ordered the Captain
Miles Sutherland to get off the aircraft and look for her suitcase
personally, holding up the flight for almost an hour. When the cabin
crew eventually called the police to remove her she refused to
disembark and claimed she was targeted because she is
black.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000745">&#160;</a>

track of not performing 200 hours’ community service, she would
have written an even larger

additional punishment. The community order continues so, in such

correct me if I am wrong, but in the event of a breach and if the
transgression were minor, and explicable, the order would continue or
it would be revoked and there would be fresh sentencing. That fresh
sentencing is either likely to be a further community order, perhaps of
a more onerous or appropriate kind, or a custodial sentence. That still
seems to be a nod towards leniency in the sense that, for what may be a
breach more serious than something minor that is dealt with by allowing
matters to continue, in the example cited by my hon. Friend, the person
will be allowed to get away with paying a
fine.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000256">&#160;</a>

If he is right, and I am sure that he is, it seems that the Minister
was trying to get off on a technicality and that the substantive point
in our amendment is, in fact,
correct.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000257">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our
third worry about the clause is the unsatisfactory record of collecting
fines. It is obviously highly likely that people who are unreliable in
performing community orders or in paying compensation are also likely
to be unreliable in paying their fines. If the fines are not paid, they
will be seen to be getting away with it. That is how the public will
see the position. The Magistrates’ Association has told us that
it is particularly worried about the matter with respect to serial
offenders. Although there are penalties for non-payment, they are not
used frequently. How realistic is it to use the provision as either an
effective penalty or
deterrent?<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000258">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">Another
reason why there might not be a deterrent effect is that high fines are
imposed infrequently. For example, in 2010, the last year for which the
numbers are available, only 220 people were fined more than
£1,000. The Minister has drafted the Bill to provide for fines
of £2,500, which sounds fierce—I know that it is part of
the existing scale—but if only 220 people are being fined, how
realistic is it for him to say that the £2,500 fine will be
used? As I pointed out earlier, the Magistrates’ Association has
told us, based on information from the Ministry of Justice, that about
a quarter of the people on community orders are not completing them
satisfactorily or are breaching them. The provision therefore looks
rather
empty.</p>

discussion about unpaid fines this morning, in which I did not
intervene, did not ring true. During the adjournment, I looked at the
<em>Law Society Gazette</em>, which reported in July that unpaid court
fines have jumped £600 million in aggregate, while the number of

up-to-date remark. I looked at the 16th report of the Public Accounts
Committee for the 2010-11 Session. Last week, hon. Members objected to
our referring to briefings from pressure groups, but I hope that they
will not object to our referring to House of Commons papers. The report
explicitly stated that the Ministry of Justice’s defence of its
rate of payment, which was 86% in 2009-10, was not satisfactory. It
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000260">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“There
was little evidence of the sustained improvement in fine collection
rates that we were promised in 2006. As at 31 March 2010, outstanding
fines and confiscation orders in arrears and over six months totalled
just under £1.5 billion, of which just 30% was considered
recoverable.”<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000748">&#160;</a>

               <p>That
figure of about £500 million for what is recoverable is perhaps
the same as the number that my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith

continued:<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000261">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“Unpaid
court fines and penalties have increased year-on-year and the
Ministry’s primary measure of how effectively court fines are
being collected is inadequate. The Ministry still relies on payment
rate, despite our conclusion after our 2006 Hearing that the payment
rate fails to capture the amounts of outstanding arrears. We look to
the Ministry to introduce the promised improvements to performance
measurement by September 2011.”<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000749">&#160;</a>

offer the Minister a frank remark that is intended to be helpful. If,
when he next negotiates with the Treasury, rather than accepting all
its endless requests for short-term public spending cuts, he could pay
a little more attention to the scope for bringing money in under the
fines—the same issue arises on fee collection—some of the
public expenditure cuts, which I am sure that he is not particularly
happy about implementing, would not be necessary. If £1.5
billion of fines—a large sum of money—are outstanding and
£500 million is recoverable, he should look at doing something
to get that money in
quickly.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000264">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
shall give the Minister a further piece of advice: he should talk to
his colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions, because the
child maintenance executive, which has a similar problem of large
amounts of outstanding money, has looked into securitising the loans so
that the Government get their money now and someone else takes on the
liability and responsibility for collecting them. With that significant
improvement in the Department’s finances—£500
million is a lot of money—perhaps some other things that the
Minister has to do would not be necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000265">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We cannot see
a rationale in justice terms for the proposal. The only rationale that
we can see is that fines are cheaper in the short term for the
Government to administer. They want to save on probation and prison
resources by using fines as a penalty. We believe that it is wrong to
do that and wrong to make those cuts. We also believe that they can
recover that money and should have a proper strategy for it. That is
why we have tabled the amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000266">&#160;</a>

along with the Magistrates’ Association, believe that the
addition of a fine to the current options for dealing with a breach
would be valuable in ensuring that offenders face the appropriate
response for failing to comply with a community order. The only area in
which the Magistrates’ Association is at odds with us is the sum
of the fine. However, it supports the proposal in

               <p class="tabbed">At
the moment, an offender who is fined by a court but fails to comply
with any of the requirements of their community order must be dealt
with in one of two ways set out in statute. The court must either vary
the existing order by making its requirements more onerous or revoke
the order and resentence the offender as if they had just been
convicted of the original offence. The hon. Member for Hammersmith made
that point.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000268">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Clause 56 will
extend that limited menu by adding the option of a fine of up to a
maximum of £2,500. That is a straightforward punishment for
failing to comply with a community order. It is important to remember
that the community order will run on unchanged. The clause is
self-evident good sense. The offender does not get out of the community
order by breaching and paying a fine. That will bring home to offenders
the importance of adhering to the terms of their sentences and improve
compliance. It will also make a clear statement to the public that
failing to comply with the orders of the court will be dealt with
severely, if that is the right response.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000269">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The clause
will also allow the courts to let the offender complete the original
order as imposed. I understand that the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland
supports that part of the clause, which will give the courts more
freedom than is currently the case to turn the offender away from the
crime, if that is more likely in a particular case. That course of
action used to be available, as was the fine, but both were removed by
that outstanding piece of legislation, the Criminal Justice Act 2003.
We now propose to reinstate them. Both options already exist for
juveniles.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000270">&#160;</a>

rest of the hon. Lady’s remarks were about the apparent
inability to recover fines. The evidence produced in support of her
arguments and the helpful quote by the Law Society were as good a
condemnation of the wretched inheritance that we received from the

her children, came before the court on a benefit fraud involving a
guideline with a sentence of two years? Will not the proposal to extend
the suspended sentence provisions help the courts’ discretion in
dealing with difficult positions involving single parents caring for
children? Can she respond to that fundamental dichotomy at the heart of

clear in my remarks about children that there would always be people
who had committed extremely violent offences, and were perhaps a danger
to their children, who needed to be in custody. My point, however,
which I am sure the hon. Gentleman understood, was that at the moment
85% of women in prison are there for non-violent offences. Many of the

Suspended sentences are becoming more common; they seem to be given
more regularly as a more usual part of sentencing procedure. My hon.
Friend may or may not agree with my cynicism, but I am afraid that the
provision, like many in the Bill, is more about getting people out of
prison and bringing the bill for custody down than about anything else.

Many measures in this part of the Bill are designed to reduce the
financial burden on the Ministry of Justice, irrespective of the
long-term implications for people’s offending behaviour, of
whether or not justice is done and of how they will be seen by the
general public.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000294">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Let me make it
clear to Members on the Government Benches that when I refer to the
sentencing guidelines, I am not taking up some kind of theoretical
position. I have also had a look at what is going on in sentencing, by
which I mean the length of sentence that people are getting for
different crimes and the possibility that some of those crimes will now
move into the scope for being suspended.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000295">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Unfortunately,
because of the way in which the Ministry collects the figures, we
cannot see them between 12 and 24 months. Figures are collected between
12 and 18 months and 18 and 36 months, but the 12 to 18
months period is a good proxy for the zone that we are looking at. The
crimes include threat or conspiracy to murder, manslaughter and causing
death by reckless driving. I was interested to see that they included
reckless driving because my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon
Hull East has a proposal to beef up the sentencing for that crime,
which I thought that Government Members were minded to support. It
seems that there is some inconsistency about the matter.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000296">&#160;</a>

on to cover wounding or endangering life, cruelty to children, child
abduction, rape, sexual activity with a child under 13, abuse of
children through prostitution, and burglary in a dwelling. Then we move
on to the white collar crimes. They include fraud, false accounting,
forgery, production and supply of class A drugs, kidnapping and
firearms offences—firearms offences are in the wrong category
and should be under violent offences. The point that I am trying to
make is that hundreds if not thousands of perpetrators of serious
crimes could get away with neither a community order nor any time in
prison.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000297">&#160;</a>

including serious offences of rape, to try to draw the Committee to the
conclusion that, because there is an increase in a discretion to allow

sentence orders by Crown court judges. I caution her to take very great

suspended sentence order rules. All I can do, and I am sorry if this
does not satisfy the hon. Member for South Swindon, is look at what is
going on at the moment, look at the current guidelines and draw
attention to the risks that may follow. There seems to be something
rather incoherent in saying that a crime is so serious that the

useful in these debates to stick to more evidence-based proposals or
suggestions. The concern is that with this list of offences we are
moving into the realms of speculation by mentioning serious offences

careful, because we do not know the full facts of those particular
cases. My main point, however, which may reassure the hon. Lady, is
that all sexual offences are covered by the Sentencing Council’s
guidelines. The starting point for a serious sexual offence is always a
term of custody. There are ranges of terms of imprisonment between high
and low. The guidelines, to which sentencers must have regard, are to
start at terms of imprisonment and then apply mitigating factors that
would draw the court back below the custodial threshold. I say again
that we should be careful before jumping to the conclusion that
increasing discretion in such matters will somehow lead to unduly
lenient sentences being passed in serious
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000313">&#160;</a>

serious crimes, or crimes that appear serious, and lenient sentences.
The Bill could have an impact on sentences. She should not be put off
by the excitement on the Government Benches. It is for the Minister to
set out clearly which crimes will bring which sentences, so we should
not back away from it. So far, the Bill is unclear, but we hope that
the Minister will clarify exactly which crimes will bring which
penalties.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000315">&#160;</a>

Government Members that one of the most liberal pressure groups in
British civil society, the Prison Reform Trust, also opposes the
clause. It is not some eccentric frolic of mine. I also remind the
Minister that as well as asking him which crimes he thinks will be 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 623<a class="bkMark" name="Column623">&#160;</a>

measures will bring and why he is making the change retrospective. It
sounds as though the interest is more in saving money than in justice.
Finally, will he say something about the meaning and interpretation of
breach when there is no parallel community
order?<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000316">&#160;</a>

three questions? First, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith
said, suspended sentences have gone in and out of fashion over the
years, and if one looks at Government proposals in recent years, it
seems that they are more in fashion now. Will the Minister explain the
purpose of the change to the legislation and what he seeks to achieve
through longer periods of suspension in relation to sentencing
objectives? Does he see it as an opportunity for more rehabilitation,
or are there other sentencing objectives that he seeks to achieve? I am
confused about the purpose of the proposition.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000317">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly, what
is the Minister’s view on the likely level of compliance with
longer periods of suspension? I am sure that none of us wants to set up
people to fail. That is a completely pointless approach to criminal
justice. I would be grateful if he would tell us what assessment he has
made of likely compliance levels with longer periods of suspension.
Thirdly, what assessment has the Minister made of the impact on
reoffending
rates?<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000318">&#160;</a>

case. They illustrated clearly and with my full support the fact that

regarding the Government’s underlying intentions. I will be

               <p class="tabbed">The
clause is consistent with widening the discretion of courts to impose
suspended sentences, and the amendments would remove the effect of
clause 57 and the proposed changes. Currently, the courts can only
suspend a custodial sentence of less than 12 months. They are required
to impose at least one community requirement. We are proposing to allow
the courts to suspend a sentence of up to two years and to give them
discretion as to whether any community requirement needs to be
imposed.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000320">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Suspended
sentences can be a useful tool for the courts and we want to ensure
that they make the best use of them. Offenders on suspended sentences
have a lower reoffending rate than those sentenced to immediate custody
of less than 12 months. Any offence meriting up to two years’
custody could potentially attract a suspended sentence, but it is
entirely at the discretion of the court, taking account of all the
circumstances of the case as to whether a suspended sentence is
appropriate. This is of course the same position as now for offences
receiving 12 months or
less.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000321">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is the judiciary who have said that they consider it unlikely that they
would impose many long suspended sentences, but the option to suspend a
sentence of up to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 624<a class="bkMark" name="Column624">&#160;</a>
                  </div>two years is useful to deal with the full range of cases before them. I
want to make it clear that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe
indicated, the average sentence for rape is eight years. There is no
way that the provision is intended to address the list of offences that
the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland produced. Of course it is not. We
do not expect there to be many cases in which a long suspended sentence
would be justified, but we think it would be a useful extension of the
court’s powers. Before the current provisions of the Criminal
Justice Act 2003, the courts could suspend a sentence for up to two
years, so the provision is hardly a radical new departure in criminal
justice.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000322">&#160;</a>

rules for giving suspended sentences were completely different before
the 2003 legislation. This is now being done in a different context
where different considerations apply and different rules govern the
giving of suspended sentences. Today, there are some 46,000 people
getting suspended sentences. At the point when the periods were long,
the numbers were under 10,000—I think they were about 6,000; it
is a totally different
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000323">&#160;</a>

it relatively exceptional to use suspended sentences of such length,
but we think it right to return to the position before the 2003 Act to
give sentencers discretion. We also think it right that we should
actually trust our sentencers and give them appropriate discretion
instead of saying that they must impose a requirement whether or not it
is appropriate in their judgment. As I have made clear, we do not

that the offender has an uncharacteristic lapse of judgment, but is
unlikely to reoffend and has an unblemished record, the threat of
custody is likely to be sufficient incentive to make sure that that
offender does not stray on to the wrong side of the law in
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000326">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> If the Minister is saying that suspended
sentences in excess of 12 to 24 months will be given in exceptional
circumstances, that is not what the clause says. If he is saying that
it is expected—or even if he is trying to give guidance to the
judiciary—that these sentences will be used very rarely indeed,
I am afraid that that is not good enough either. I have entire
confidence in the judiciary to exercise their powers, but that is not
what we are talking about. Offences that can attract two-year custodial
sentences are likely to be serious offences. It is the
Government’s job to decide whether they are appropriate in

an unblemished record could be faced with a sentence of up two years on

flexibility, there will be more suspended sentences for more serious
crimes. Is that likely to improve people’s view of the justice
system?<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000333">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The purpose of the provision is to improve the
delivery of justice. It is appropriate for Parliament to give wider
discretion to sentencers and to restore them to the position they were
in before the 2003 Act. There is a difference in approach between the
Government and the previous Administration, whose sentencing reforms
took things in an extremely prescriptive direction. We believe that we
can expect our judges to uphold the law and give appropriate sentences.
The general direction of travel is then to give them more discretion,
and the provision is part of that process. It will give them greater
ability to do
justice.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000334">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
return to the community requirements. At present, the court has no
choice but to impose a requirement even when there is no obvious
rehabilitative need to be addressed. Again, such cases are unlikely to
arise often, but it makes no sense to waste scarce resources when the
court determines that they are unnecessary and that the sword of
Damocles held over the person, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Broxtowe suggested, is
sufficient.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000335">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
have to remember that a suspended sentence without requirements does
not mean that the offender has got off. The sentence is recorded as a
custodial sentence, as are the consequences that flow from it, and the
threat of custody hangs over the offender for up to two years. I assure
members of the Committee that having a two-year custodial sentence on
someone’s record is an extremely serious matter. Giving the
courts additional discretion will allow them to target suspended
sentences to best effect. I trust that the Committee will accept my
reassurances, particularly with regard to the context in which we
expect sentencers to use the powers, and that the hon. Lady will
withdraw amendments 305 to 308.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000336">&#160;</a>

increase in discretion under the clause. I am disappointed that the
Minister has not answered the basic question about which we had most
debate: which further crimes can now be punished with a suspended
sentence order? It is no good Government Back Benchers saying that is a
side issue or a non-issue, when the Minister has been completely
incapable of giving us any further information about what will actually
go on. I am sorry to say that I do not think that is an adequate basis
for legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000337">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Nor am I
satisfied with what the Minister says about community orders. The truth
is that a person who commits a crime and gets a suspended sentence
order might not have a community order as well. Although there is a
stigma attached to having a criminal record, a person who commits a
crime serious enough to carry a two-year custodial sentence might
receive no serious or adequate punishment. Furthermore, if someone does
not have a community order running alongside the suspended sentence
order, the only breach that will send them to prison is another
offence.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000338">&#160;</a>

made much of the group of people who have unblemished records and who,
in a moment of amnesia, commit a crime that carries a custodial
sentence of two years. I hope he will remember that the list that I
read out of crimes covered by the measures included false accounting
and fraud. That is the Guinness defence; it is precisely what was
argued in the Guinness case. People had expensive lawyers who could put
up good defences and say, “It was a moment of amnesia.”

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 627<a class="bkMark" name="Column627">&#160;</a>
                  </div>different objectives, and one difficulty is that it must balance them.
The criminal justice system must always punish people appropriately for
what they have done. It must also seek to rehabilitate people with
serious problem behaviour patterns who are serial reoffenders. It must
also protect the public. Frequently, in debates on the criminal justice
system, one group of people says that it is all about
punishment—the key priority; what everything is driving
at—while another group says that what works is all about
reducing reoffending, and that is the only thing that matters. That is
not my view or that of Her Majesty’s Opposition. We believe that
one of the difficulties in running the criminal justice system is that
we are doing a number of different things, sometimes with different
people and sometimes with the same people. The point of our amendments
is that if the offence is serious enough to warrant a two-year
custodial sentence, we do not think that suspending it is
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000346">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I shall explain to the Committee why I will ask
my colleagues to vote against clause stand part. Many of the arguments
that we had on the amendments to clauses 56 and 57 are compounded in
this clause. In essence, by including serious assaults, robberies,
frauds and violent crimes against children in extended sentence orders,
the Minister is proposing to allow breaches of these suspended sentence
orders to be penalised with a fine. As the Magistrates Association
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000377">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“There
is no point in increasing these fines or compensation when so much
remains
unpaid.”<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000751">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>It
is not an appropriate way in which to deal with the breaches if people
have committed offences for which they have received a two-year
sentence. It demonstrates that the Government are not taking a serious
view of the impact of serious crime on communities.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000378">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister tell us how frequently he expects this provision to be used;
what the reduction in the prison population will be; and what the cost
benefits will be to the Ministry of Justice? The figures in the public
domain from his own Department show that under the current, more
limited regime, the proportion of suspended sentence orders breached is
around 12% and the proportion of cases in which the person is convicted
of another offence is around 15%. It appears as though more than a
quarter of those receiving the suspended sentence orders would be
liable for a fine in the event of these
breaches.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000379">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Currently,
there are some 50,000 suspended sentence orders. The Minister’s
proposals will increase that number. He hopes—we all
hope—that there will not be a significant increase. He says that
he is confident that that will be the case, but Opposition Members are
not quite so confident. In any event, what we might expect is 12,000
breaches each year, a large number of which will undoubtedly be dealt
with by a fine. We do not believe that victims will find that
satisfactory or that it will be acceptable to the public. I do not wish
to repeat what I said previously, but I am sure that the Minister will
understand that the Opposition will vote against this
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000380">&#160;</a>
               </p>

                     <span class="hs_CLMember">Mr

                     </span>
                  </strong> Clause 58 is intended to increase the
court’s discretion in dealing with the breach of a suspended
sentence order. At present, there is a presumption that where there is
a breach of the order, the court will give effect to the custodial
sentence unless it would be unjust to do so in all the circumstances.
We have no plans to change that position. However, where the court does
not give effect to the custodial sentence it must at present make the
order more onerous either by amending the community requirements or by
extending the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 630<a class="bkMark" name="Column630">&#160;</a>
                  </div>supervision or operational period of the order. By introducing the
further alternative of imposing a fine for a breach, we are giving the
courts a wider discretion in dealing with offenders. A fine will be
available only when the court has decided that it would be unjust to
send the offender to custody. So we do not expect any significant
impact on the prison population as a result of the measure. As I have
said, consideration of a fine or other penalty will take place only
where the court would find a custodial sentence
unjust.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000381">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
measure sits alongside our general trend of introducing greater
discretion, including in the use of suspended sentence orders, by
providing such orders without the imposition of community requirements.
In such circumstances, if a court decided not to give effect to the
custodial sentence for a breach, the only other penalty available would
be to extend the operation of the order. The availability of a fine for
a breach will therefore be a useful alternative penalty for the
courts.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000382">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
do not expect fines to be routinely used as a penalty for breach,
because in the majority of cases a breach of a suspended sentence order
should and does result in a custodial sentence being given effect.
However, the availability of fines provides the courts with more
discretion in deciding on the appropriate penalty for a breach in each
case.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000383">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of amendments 310 and 311 is to retain the use of accredited
programmes. We accept the proposal in the clause that there can be
flexibility where a person attends or undertakes a community programme.
However, I have a question for the Minister: will there be any rules or
limits on travel time? It would not be acceptable if a person was
expected to travel long distances, as people could be dependent on
public transport, and would incur significant costs. I am sure that he
has thought of that and will have worked out the limits on travel time,
and I hope that he will be able to tell the Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000417">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is
important to retain accredited programmes, because the evidence shows
that they are effective in reducing reoffending. Further to the point
made by the right hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington a moment
ago, in our consideration of the amendments to the clause, we are
looking primarily at what can best be done to reduce reoffending and
improve rehabilitation. Currently, the reconviction rate for people on
short-term sentences is about 66%. For people who are supervised by the
probation service, it is about 50%, and if the person is on an
accredited programme as well as going 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 632<a class="bkMark" name="Column632">&#160;</a>
                  </div>for normal probation supervision, the reconviction rate is 35%. I can
see that the Minister is puzzled by that, and I hope to be able to give
him a little more detail on those figures later, which were given to me
by the National Association of Probation
Officers.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000418">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Given
that accredited programmes and custody are considerably more effective
than other ways of dealing with people, one is bound to ask for the
reason behind the Government’s actions. I am sorry to say that
the only rationale that we could come up with was to facilitate the
Government’s programme of privatisation and contracting
probation services out to the private sector. As I understand it, they
want to follow a black box approach, which means that there will be no
rules about what is done with people and everything will be measured on
payment by results. The Minister talks about payment by results, and I
will respond to him on that, except that I will not do it at this
juncture, because I am not convinced that that is strictly
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000419">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
risk of not having accredited programme and of contracting out the
running of community programmes, which is currently done by a
professional probation service, to the private sector is that such
programmes will instead be run on a large-scale and cheap basis that is
not attuned to the different needs, characteristics and learning styles
of offenders. If that happens, the programmes will not work and we will
see crime go up again. That is another example of the short-termist
approach that the Government have taken to the criminal justice
system—low costs now, risking higher costs to the community
later. The abandonment of accreditation, which most private sector
organisations will not be able to offer, will mean that such
organisations can put in cheaper bids than the probation trusts, which
have higher professional
standards.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000420">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am not saying that the accreditation system run by the Ministry of
Justice panel cannot be simplified; I think it can be. However,
abandoning standards in the area is risky and inappropriate. In 2009,
22,400 people were on community orders with accredited programmes;
12,500 were on suspended sentence orders with such programmes; 18,500
were on drug and alcohol programmes with community orders; and almost
7,000 were on drug and alcohol programmes with suspended sentence
orders. That makes a total of 60,000 people. I described levels of
effectiveness on reconviction rates: the difference between running and
not running accredited programmes might be as much as an additional
20,000 crimes a year. The proposal is therefore a worthwhile
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000421">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I briefly
remind the Committee of the principal accredited programmes. Thinking
Skills aims to reduce impulsive behaviour and improve problem solving.
I cannot help thinking that some such programmes would be useful for
Members of this House. The drink-impaired driving programme addresses
the causes of drink-driving and aims to avoid its repetition. A
low-intensity alcohol programme tackles moderate problem drinking. A
community drink-violence programme is different in that it addresses
the relationship between alcohol and violence, relating particularly to
binge drinking. The latter three are interesting because they
demonstrate that thought has been given to the different sorts of crime
and patterns of behaviour, and care has been taken over the need to
address those in different ways.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000422">&#160;</a>

which has considered the probation service’s role and has found
that probation officers are too tied up in bureaucracy. That is a valid
criticism. It is true that officers do not have enough face-to-face
time with clients. Too much report-writing and, as Government Members
would call it, box-ticking is a problem that must be addressed. I also
agree that we must broaden the scope for professional judgment in the
probation

and Urmston is extremely helpful because it makes it clear that people
should be on programmes that are properly evidenced. If someone happens
to be on the wrong programme or, in the opinion of their offender
manager, could be on a better one, we offer precisely that flexibility
to the offender manager, without having to return to court. I agree
with the hon. Lady that things need to be done on the basis of
evidence, and it is common sense that we give offender managers the
opportunity to make such a change.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000430">&#160;</a>

is not clear from what the Minister says is why if a programme is
backed up evidentially as being effective it does not become
accredited, so I will wait to hear what he says about that, and
consider his response. We need to be careful that the Minister’s
well-intentioned plan to improve flexibility is not at a later stage
used simply as a cost-cutting measure. The Opposition are conscious of
the fact that the probation service in some areas faces 10% cuts this
year. We agree with the Minister that community orders and
rehabilitation need to be effective, but I am not yet convinced that
what he says is what is in the Bill, nor am I convinced of what its
effect would
be.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000432">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
312 relates to programmes for people with learning difficulties.
Significant numbers of people entering the criminal justice system have
learning disabilities, and the amendment is designed to ensure that
they understand what is required of them and that there are programmes
they can do. Both of those things are necessary because it is pointless
for people to do things that do not work—it is a waste of their
time and our money—and if they do things, or do not do things,
that they do not understand, they will spiral
downwards.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000433">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In
its evidence to the Committee, Mencap stated that it was particularly
keen to see the change outlined in the amendment. Young people
accessing its “raising your game” project said that they
had difficulty, at the moment, in understanding where they had to be
and when they had to be there. It would be wrong if because of a lack
of appropriate provision people with learning disabilities were
excluded from community orders and unnecessarily sent into custody.
Unless reasonable adjustments are made, this group of people will be
unfairly sanctioned and more of them will end up in
custody.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000434">&#160;</a>

saying that all programmes will be accredited and the discretion for

                     </span>
                  </strong> That is the thrust of the clause because, at
present, when a court believes that an offender should participate in a
programme requirement, it must by law specify the particular programme,
the place where the offender must go to participate in the programme
and the number of days that they must attend the programme. However, it
sometimes becomes clear soon after the offender has started a programme
that a different course or programme would be more likely to deal with
their problems and turn them away from crime. For example, the offender
could have been sent on an anger management course but it soon becomes
evident that the problem is with domestic violence. Currently, the only
way to change programmes is to take the case back to court with an
application for the programme to be changed. That is bureaucratic and
takes time. The clause will allow the offender manager to make the
change without the necessity of going back to court, but that does not
mean that the offender manager is effectively sentencing the offender.
The court will still require the offender to take part in a properly
accredited programme and it must still specify the number of days that
the offender must participate in the programme. I hope that that gives
the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston the assurance that she was
seeking.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000439">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Because the
court will not know the exact programme that the offender will follow,
it cannot specify the location and the clause reflects that, which
takes us on to the question that the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland
asked about travel. The clause makes no changes to how offenders travel
to attend programmes. It is up to the offender manager and the offender
to agree what is reasonable in the circumstances of the case and that
is plainly appropriate. The law will still require any place where the
offender is sent to be properly approved and it will still require the
offender to comply with instructions from his responsible officer and
anyone running the course that they are
on.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000440">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
310 and 311 would reinstate into section 202 provisions that
only make sense where a court is specifying a particular programme,
which courts will no longer do. For example, a court cannot be required
to check that the course is available since it will not specify a
course; indeed, the court will not even know which course the offender
will be following. So these amendments would create duties that cannot
possibly be complied with under the new arrangements and that therefore
would be totally unreasonable.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000441">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At this point,
I must say that I wonder who here is actually trying to support the
probation officers in exercising their responsibilities to rehabilitate
offenders most effectively? In that sense, I have been slightly
surprised by the tone of the remarks by the hon. Member for Bishop
Auckland, because anything that moves towards effectively enfranchising
probation officers and giving them the necessary discretion to deliver
the most effective programmes and the most effective outcomes for the
people in their charge is an appropriate direction to take. The court
will have made the appropriate disposition about the number of days
that the offender is required to attend a programme and about the fact
that the offender must attend a programme, but the clause is an
absolutely sensible way of entrusting probation officers within the
limits set down by the sentence of the court.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000442">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 312
would place statutory duties on both probation trusts and other bodies
in relation to programme requirements. Those duties would require
trusts to provide programmes for every level of intellectual ability
and understanding, and they would require bodies imposing orders to
explain their effect to offenders. These changes would either replicate
existing law or prescribe a level of detail in the content and delivery
of community orders and suspended sentence orders that is not
appropriate to primary legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000443">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In any case,
every care is already being taken to ensure that programmes are
tailored to the needs of offenders, including their intellectual
capacity. I wonder what on earth everyone is trying to achieve
regarding all these professionals who we entrust to deliver these
programmes? The road to hell, in legislative terms, has been paved with
good intentions over the last decade or 15 years, whereby we have
over-prescribed the outcomes in Parliament. It has all been part of a
direction of travel that has not helped the professionals on the front
line who are trying to deliver. That is why we are making the changes,
to get proper exercise of discretion at the appropriate
level.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000444">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Courts
are already under a statutory duty to explain to offenders in ordinary
language and general terms the effect of the sentence imposed on them.
In addition, responsible officers have a statutory duty to make any
necessary arrangements in connection with offenders’
requirements and to promote compliance. In the case of a programme
requirement, his duty must surely involve discussing with the offender
what he must do and how he can best participate in the programme chosen
for him in the light of his
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000445">&#160;</a>

misreading this clause, it is a lot simpler to understand. The
amendment is about an extension of the amount of time in any 24 hours
for which a person can be curfewed. The Government are proposing to
increase the time from 12 to 16 hours. Our amendment seeks to hold it
at 12 hours. Amendment 314 aims to strengthen the law on the impact
that any curfew might have on other members of the
household.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000452">&#160;</a>

main reason for moving the amendment is that, on this occasion, the

If people are curfewed for 12 hours, such as from 7 o’clock at
night until 7 in the morning, it is still perfectly feasible to go to
work, to attend a training course or even go to school—although
young people’s things are different, so I will not confuse the
argument. However, if we move to a curfew of 16 hours, it
would be impossible for anyone to have a full-time job. I simply cannot
see how that fits with what the Secretary of State has repeatedly said
he wants people to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000453">&#160;</a>

that the provision will not be used much is not a sensible way for us
to progress. We want people to rehabilitate and to have jobs. The
Secretary of State has even said that he wants offenders in prison to
do a full week of work and that he wants people on community orders who
are unemployed to do a full week of unpaid work. The provision under
discussion is not consistent with that. Although the hon. Member for
South Swindon has assured me that the 16 hours will be used
infrequently, it is highly likely that, if people are given curfews of
16 hours, it will be seen as an alternative to prison. In
other words, it is another cheap option from a Department looking to
save money.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000459">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">In its review
of curfews and tagging, the Magistrates’ Association said that,
from the point of view of the offender, curfews have the disadvantage
of loss of liberty, but no advantages in terms of security, bed, food
and structure to the day. The Magistrates’ Association made it
absolutely clear that it would view the longer curfews as an
alternative to custody for what are called not-so-serious crimes. It
also said that it has been using curfews in that way, in those
instances, when the probation service is overstretched and as an
alternative to unpaid work, and it is cheaper than unpaid work, too. It
is not acceptable to give people curfews because Ministers want to stop
building prisons and embark on a prison closure
programme.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000460">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
as I am sure the Minister is aware, the Department is sailing close to
the wind on civil liberties. When Justice gave evidence to the
Committee during the summer, it described curfews as “house
arrest.” The Court of Appeal found that, in the case of control
orders, an 18-hour curfew would be a breach of people’s human
rights. I hope that the right hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington
will tell us what he thinks about the implications for civil
liberties.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000461">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Once
again, I refer the Minister to a Public Accounts Committee report,
namely its 62nd report of the 2005-06 Session. It found that the
curfews were great in financial terms, because they are approximately
£70 a day cheaper than having somebody in prison. That is an
annual saving of £25,000 a year per person put on a 12-month
curfew, as opposed to sending them to prison. However, it also
said—and this is undoubtedly
true—<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000462">&#160;</a>
               </p>

rehabilitative effect of living on curfew needs to be further
researched.”<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000753">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>It
also said that, at the moment—I do not think that things have
changed since the report—no specific help is given to people
with respect to training and work that would help their rehabilitation.
The report also pointed out that families are not given the help and
support they need to live with a curfewee. That relates to
amendment 314, which aims to strengthen the consideration
given by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to the effect on relations with
the rest of the
family.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000463">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
risks in families fall into two categories. The first risk of an
inappropriately used curfew is that to the offender of domestic
violence. The Prison Reform Trust has said that<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000464">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“courts should be
specifically required to consider any potentially harmful impact on the
offender and in particular any increased risk of domestic violence as a
result of a curfew requirement. This would be particularly relevant
where there is a history of domestic violence or abuse to dependents
within the
family.”<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000754">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>It
also
believes:<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000465">&#160;</a>
               </p>

do not think I need to say more about the relationship between women in
prison and those who have suffered domestic violence and abuse. I am

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">The
second risk is the risk from the offender to the rest of the family. I
do not know about the constituency of the hon. Member for South
Swindon, but I can think of several cases in which mothers have had to
throw out their 18 or 19-year-old children because of the bad 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>influence and disruptive effect that they were having on younger
siblings. Those curfews are clearly also not suitable for violent
offenders.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000467">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
considering extending the hours from 12 to 16 they should remember that
curfews are highly likely to be used for people who do not live in
large four-bedroom houses with nice gardens, and who are not like the
WikiLeaks chap, who lived in a positive mansion when he was under a
curfew. Most people under a curfew will be living in small flats, in
overcrowded conditions. That is a major
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000468">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I rise briefly to support amendment 313 and endorse
everything that the hon. Lady has said about the extension of curfew
hours from 12 to 16. It is of great concern to many organisations that
that would amount to house arrest. The hon. Member for South Swindon
says that 16 hours would be a maximum, and that is true, as 12 hours
was previously the maximum, but there is grave concern that the power
will be used more often than many Committee members
imagine.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000470">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Poor
educational achievement and unemployment are catalysts for offending,
as we know. I wonder how a young person—or someone of any
age—who is under a 16-hour curfew while looking for work, will
come to terms with trying to get gainful employment or do something
useful, without sliding back into
crime.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000471">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
are reminded by Liberty that it is important for offenders to be given
the opportunity to address their offending, and the provision seems to
stand in the way of that. In the Green paper issued in March the
Government envisaged the implementation of tough new measures in place
of custodial sentences. I tend to think that that suggests things will
veer towards the making of more 16-hour curfews, not fewer. That is not
to say that the hon. Member for South Swindon is not sincere in what he
says; but I think the underlying trend will not be towards minimal use,
but the other way.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000472">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is true
that the deprivation of liberty involved in that imposition is less
than in a custodial sentence, but several organisations, including
Liberty, are concerned that, once legislation is passed to introduce
new and excessive tagging and curfew powers, there will be few measures
to ensure that they are used as a maximum, as intended. In the past,
tougher community penalties have not always been used as an alternative
to custody. Rather, they have been additional and possibly harsh
punishments, available to courts in circumstances where a custodial
sentence might not be
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000473">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">Curfews of the
proposed duration will make it difficult for individuals to hold down
regular work or perform other useful functions. That will not do
anything to rehabilitate anyone. This level of punishment in the
community, which is tantamount to house arrest, is likely to have a
further stigmatising effect thus preventing successful reintegration.
Such requirements will disrupt family life, affecting not simply the
individual concerned, but his or her family or those residing with the
person, including siblings, children and so on. Despite accepting the
sincerity of the indication that 16 hours would be a maximum, I am
afraid that it would become almost the norm in many
cases.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
are going into a completely unacceptable area of punishment, but
whether it borders breaching human rights is another matter. Cases may
well be taken on 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 640<a class="bkMark" name="Column640">&#160;</a>
                  </div>that basis—I know not. We know that 18 hours has been shown to be
in breach, and 16 hours is perilously close to that. I fully support
the hon. Lady’s comments. If she is minded to divide the
Committee, I will support the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000474">&#160;</a>

is discretion. I am sure that the Minister will have strong
expectations, as I am sure all other Members have, that when the powers
are applied, the impact of the curfew and the ability of the person to
whom it is being applied, who may often be a very chaotic individual,
to understand its implications and the implications of breaching it
will be examined carefully. Therefore, a lengthy curfew will apply only
when there is an appreciation that the person to whom it applies can
respond to it appropriately.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000475">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> We have a lot of guessing here. The intention is
that the provision will replace sentences where people would otherwise
have gone to custody. Several remarks have been made about the effect
of having to live with an offender on a curfew in their home, but hang
on a minute, what about the effect of living without the offender if
the offender has gone to prison? That deprives a family of the
principal breadwinner, and leads to all the rehabilitative consequences
of having to put someone inside for a short sentence. I am not
disguising from the Committee that the intention is to make community
sentences, in terms of curfew, more punitive and better capable of
protecting the public. That means that those sentencing people to the
orders in the community can do so with greater confidence and the
public can have greater confidence that the objective sentences will be
met.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000478">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However, there
will be maximum use of the power. For example, if it replaces the
sentence of someone who would otherwise have gone to prison due to
concern about the threat they might pose to the public, and due to the
punitive weight that the sentence required, it will be appropriate for
it to be

is also being done to deliver the kind of flexibility to which my hon.
Friend the Member for South Swindon referred. For example, one might
choose to curfew someone for 16 hours at the weekend and curfew them
for less during the week so that they can remain in employment and

                  </strong> We are considering allowing the court to impose 16
hours, and instead of the overall maximum length being six months, the
court will be able to impose a curfew of up to 12 months. Enabling
courts to impose longer curfews in this way will make a community order
capable of being more punitive, and attractive as a suitable disposal
for more serious offenders, possibly some who might otherwise have gone
to prison. It will also increase the confidence of the public, who will
see a community sentence regime that is more demanding and more likely
to protect them.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000485">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 313
would remove the increase to the daily curfew amount, leaving it at a
maximum of 12 hours, but I note that amendments have not
been introduced to restrict the increase in the maximum duration of
overall requirements to 12 months. The Government believe that
increasing the maximum hours of curfew per day would give the courts
more scope to use community orders to punish offenders, protect the
public and encourage compliance. A curfew period of 16 hours could
enable courts, for example, to curfew offenders for 12 hours overnight,
as happens now, but also add a further period designed to ensure that
the offender is at home immediately before a community payback session,
for example, to increase their likelihood of attending those kind of
programme
requirements.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000486">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
314 would extend the existing duty of the courts to obtain and consider
information about the possible effect of the curfew requirement. At the
moment, before imposing a curfew requirement, the court has to consider
the effect that the curfew might have on other people living at the
curfew address. That relates to the domestic violence point that the
hon. Member for Bishop Auckland adduced in support of her arguments.
With longer curfews, one would accept that it would be even more
important for the court to take account of the views of family members
before setting the curfew

               <p class="tabbed">The
extension in amendment 314 is very wide. It would require the court to
obtain and consider information about the risks of both physical and
mental injury, of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 642<a class="bkMark" name="Column642">&#160;</a>
                  </div>such risk being caused or increased both by and to the offender or by or
to any person associated with the offender. Such associated persons are
defined as including but not only relatives, spouses, cohabitees and
fiancés. It is unreasonable to impose on the court such a
complex duty before it can sentence the offender. Offenders can have
many relatives, not all of whom will be contactable, meaning that the
duty could not be complied with in many cases. This would not be good
law. That is not to say that the courts will not take account of such
matters if known to them. Of course they will. Many will be picked up
by the investigations that they already have to carry out, as I have
explained. Others will properly be drawn to the attention of the court
by the offender, particularly if he or she believes that they might be
at risk if curfewed to a particular address. So there are sufficient
safeguards in place, and the dangers that amendment 314 understandably
seeks to mitigate can already be discovered and taken into
account.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000488">&#160;</a>

hope that the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland will be reassured and
withdraw her amendment. I am absolutely clear that the measure is an
important addition to our armoury. I am delighted to oppose the
amendments and, of course, ensure that the clause becomes part of the

                  </strong> I preferred it when the Minister was not on the
punitive side of the argument. This is deeply concerning. The
Minister’s remarks have made me more worried than I was
previously about the implications of the

               <p class="tabbed">To
revert briefly to an earlier argument, people go to prison to punish
them with the hope of rehabilitation and to provide greater safety to
the public. It is clear that, of the three aims that we have constantly
to bear in mind, in looking at this, the Minister has focused solely on
punishment, to the exclusion of the two other
aims.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000491">&#160;</a>

the right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd that this is a way of
keeping someone in work and training who would otherwise have gone into
custody. Keeping someone in work or training rather than sending them
to prison is a critical part of ensuring that they can be
rehabilitated.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000492">&#160;</a>

a Member of Parliament, but I have never had a job that I could travel
to, do, and travel home from within eight hours. Most people do not
have that. It is completely impractical. One minute the Minister talks
about breadwinners; the next, he is giving people only eight hours. It
does not stack up.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000493">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
the Minister said that people should have curfews if they were a threat
to the public, which concerns me. That suggests that that person has a
tendency to behave in a violent and unpredictable manner. It is
precisely because of that that we tabled amendment 314,
which would strengthen the requirements on the court to address the
other members of the household. I am sorry, but the Minister has not
satisfied Opposition Members, so I will press the amendment to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000494">&#160;</a>

Spurr believes that 10% of people in the criminal justice system suffer
from serious mental health problems. The Royal College of Psychiatrists
believes that 90% of people have a problem, and 70% of people have two
problems. The Opposition agree that prison is not suitable for such
people. It is a matter of concern that last year, only 1,200 people
were moved from the prison estate to an NHS secure hospital. That might
be connected with the fact that while the cost of a prison place is
just over £100 a day, the cost of a secure hospital place is
about £480 a day. That is why we think that the £5
million that the Ministry of Justice and the Department of Health have
put into diversion is helpful. However, before the Minister tells us in
too glowing terms how marvellous that is, I point out that in reality
it would pay only for between 40 and 60 professionals around the
country. They will be offering a signposting service, not the extra
treatment needed where there is a massive shortage of resources. The
Centre for Mental Health estimates that sorting out the problem would
cost about £50 million, although I accept that community
treatment with drugs is a cheaper option.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000548">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Given the hon. Lady’s remarks about medical
professionals, my comments may enable her to support the clause. It
aims to simplify the procedural requirements necessary for a court to
impose a medical health requirement treatment as part of a community
order or suspended sentence order, and it removes the specification for
a senior clinician—a section 12 medical clinician, as specified
under the Mental Health Act 1983 —to carry out the
initial mental health assessment. The clause removes the reliance on
senior clinicians, who tend to operate in secure mental health services
and in general do not deal with lower severity cases where a
community-based approach through a mental health treatment requirement
would be more appropriate. It means that a broader range of mental
health specialists, such as doctors practising as psychiatrists, and
psychiatric nurses and psychologists, can carry out the initial health
assessment, and it will help to ensure that assessments are carried out
more promptly and reduce court delay. If necessary, complicated and
particularly serious cases can be referred to senior
clinicians.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000556">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The clause
does not affect existing requirements, which will maintain the
safeguards necessary for administering a treatment requirement. Before
making the requirement, the court must continue to be satisfied that an
appropriate assessment of need has been carried out, that arrangements
are in place for treatment to be delivered, and that the offender has
expressed their willingness to undertake and comply with treatment. The
legislation addresses a serious and appropriate issue, and I hope that
the hon. Lady will be reassured.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000557">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am not reassured. I knew there was a practical
problem; I was going to address it and will tell Government Members
why. As I understand it, the Mental Health Act 1983 extended the range
of professionals whose approval was necessary to certify treatment. In
the Mental Health Act 2007, the definition was broadened to include the
following: a registered medical practitioner, a chartered psychologist,
a first-level nurse whose field of practice is mental health or

Minister seems to suggest that it is difficult to get reports from that
long list of professionals. Opposition Members, however, feel that the
clause is too risky and that it is inappropriate. Evidence from the
Royal College of Psychiatrists and the charity, Rethink, shows that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 646<a class="bkMark" name="Column646">&#160;</a>
                  </div>people are currently paid only £60 for writing such reports,
before court proceedings. For that reason, there is huge difficulty in
getting those people to prioritise them in their work load, which is
why the pre-sentence reports take time to write and why there are
delays.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000559">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have had
evidence from somebody—since the Minister disrupted me, I cannot
find my notes. However, evidence shows that when the right medical
report is not received at the right time, people may end up having more
court hearings than they would have had otherwise. We would like the
Minister to understand the matter in a slightly different way, because
we think that putting medical practitioners to one side carries two
risks. The first is that people who should have mental health treatment
do not get it. The second, which is equally problematic, is that people
who do not need it, get it. I put it to the Minister that such a
situation would be rather Kafkaesque.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000560">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
evidence given to the Justice Committee in 2008 found that defending
barristers frequently recommend their clients to refuse to go along
with mental health treatment requirements if the requirement, which is
part of the community order, is longer than an alternative custody
sentence that might be given. That is seriously problematic, because
for completely inappropriate reasons, people are not getting the
treatment that they need. People suffering from mental health issues
are not in the best position to judge their own mental health, and
those who are involved in the criminal justice system are already
people who, because of mental health problems, may sometimes—not
always—be extremely difficult to manage. The Minister is trying
to rely solely, as we read the proposals, on the individual’s
consent.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000561">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Another point
made by the Royal College of Psychiatrists was that where a person
refuses treatment but still requires it under a mental health treatment
order, they might not fulfil the criteria for sectioning. That is why
the college would like to see a section 12 approved person involved in
the process.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000562">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am sorry to
say that the proposals look like a very inappropriate public spending
statement, which is not at all in line with the Bradley report of 2009,
which said:<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000563">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The

good early identification and assessment of problems, which can inform
how and where they are most appropriately treated.”<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000564">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>If we do not have the
involvement of people who are medically qualified, that simply will not
happen. Probation officers are not trained in mental health and it is
quite wrong to put responsibility for making judgments on to them, just
as it is unfair to the offenders.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000565">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I hope that
the Minister read the Bradley report before he proposed the measure.
Let me remind him of what Bradley said. He said that the pre-sentence
report needed to address four things: culpability, or whether the
mental health problem explains the crime; the risk of repeat; the
feasibility of the community order versus custody; and supervision,
should psychiatric treatment be involved. He also wanted the sentencer
to consider whether going to prison would make the person’s
mental health condition better or
worse.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000566">&#160;</a>

                  <strong> </strong>With leave, Mr Hollobone, I will reply. The
hon. Lady has very properly raised her concerns, but there is a serious
danger that if the Committee accepts her amendment, it would have the
unintended consequence of preventing mental health treatment
requirements from being made and getting people in a timely fashion
into mental health treatment. The current requirement is for a full
psychiatric report to be carried out by a senior clinician—a
section 12 doctor as per the Mental Health Act 1983. The limitations
that we are trying to remove act as a barrier to getting more eligible
offenders on to a mental health treatment requirement. Those doctors
tend to be found in secure mental health services and do not generally
deal with mental disorders at a minimum or lower level of severity,
where a community base would be more
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000568">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady will share with me and with Lord Bradley the objective of
getting people into mental health treatment when that is more
appropriate, rather than into justice treatment. The practical problem
with the limitations under the law as it now stands is that the current
process for receiving an assessment can take several weeks, even up to
two months, which causes delays in court time as well as for offenders
who require mental health treatment.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000569">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
says, “Get more senior clinicians in place to make these
assessments.” It would be great if we could turn round and
manage to deliver that, but she will understand that in the current
resource environment, that is not a practical outcome. We are faced
with the proper choice to be made. It would be a perfect situation if
there were enough senior clinicians to carry out all the assessments,
but there would be an issue about whether they were being diverted from
people for whom they were more appropriate. However, we are not in that
position. We want people to have timely access to mental health
treatment
requirements.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000570">&#160;</a>

is also pushing? People in prison are facing significant problems in
accessing mental health treatment, because their primary care trusts
are not dealing with them quickly enough.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000571">&#160;</a>

progress. The unintended consequence of the hon. Lady’s

and inappropriate, and his arithmetic is not even right. We are all
agreed that psychiatric reports written by the four classes of medical
professional are not currently arriving in a timely way. I urge the
Minister to look again at the Bradley report, which made two
cost-benefit analyses. One addressed the court process and one looked
at effective sentencing to the community.

			Column number: 648<a class="bkMark" name="Column648">&#160;</a>
                  </div>On the court process, Bradley found that spending money properly on
speeding up the arrival of reports and managing the situation, would
bring a net benefit to the taxpayer of £3 million, because fewer
people would be sent to remand. On sentencing, the report took the view
that people getting the mental health treatment requirement orders that
they wanted, rather than going to prison, would benefit some 2,000
people and produce significant savings, estimated at £40
million.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000573">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The amendments would remove the requirement for a
person to consent before being given a drug rehabilitation order or an
alcohol treatment requirement order. The Minister will know that people
with drug and alcohol problems are a major issue in the criminal
justice system. It is frequently assumed that the problem
with drugs in the criminal justice system is the acquisitive crime that
people engage in to feed their habit, but anybody who has spent any
time looking into the issue or meeting people will know that the drugs 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 649<a class="bkMark" name="Column649">&#160;</a>
                  </div>themselves also have a serious impact on people. People who are addicted
to drugs suffer from a serious loss of rationality, so there must be a
question about whether they are in an appropriate state to make a
sensible decision about
themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000599">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">When
we look at this, we have to balance a number of things. The impact on
the community if we allow people to continue with their drug treatment
is not being given sufficient weight at the moment. I met a number of
people working at Holme House prison in the constituency of my hon.
Friend the Member for Stockton North, and they told me that half the
drugs smuggled into the prison are not illicit. They are prescribed
drugs that people on prescriptions in the community are not using in a
regular way, as they said they would. Those people in the community
abstain and flog them off. The drugs are then smuggled or sold into the
prison.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000600">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When
we address this, we need to take into account the massive cost of
people who refuse to give their consent to drug rehabilitation orders,
which the taxpayer is being asked to bear and which, according to
parliamentary answers given by Ministers, comes to some £60
million. The cost of keeping someone on methadone for a year is
£2,500.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000601">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that the Minister will refer me to the ECHR judgment on drug
treatment, which the Government lost in 2003. I find it ironic that
Members of this House, who are up in arms about considering the
implementation of an ECHR judgment on prisoner voting, seem to have
completely missed the ECHR judgment on drug treatment, which has a far
greater impact on the whole community, on the criminal justice system
and on offenders. As Ministers look at this, they need to take account
of why we lost the case. We lost the case because people were taken off
drugs immediately, which meant that they went through cold turkey. The
case turned on whether that was inhuman and degrading treatment. Such
treatment would not follow from agreeing to the amendment; what would
follow is the completely sensible, rational approach to drug treatment
that is followed at the moment, in which people’s dosage is
reduced gradually over a period of six months, 12 months or 18 months.
That does not have the same
impact.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000602">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
anything, the alcohol issue is even clearer. Drink-driving offences are
a huge problem for the whole community. Of those convicted of
drink-driving, 63% of men and 40% of women admit that they have driven
hazardously in the previous months. In half of violent crime cases, the
victim believes that the offender was drunk. High levels of binge
drinking are fuelling violent crime on Friday and Saturday nights. The
issue is community
harm.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000603">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
the case of the alcohol amendment, I want to reinforce the fact that we
are not talking about medical treatment. When we discussed programme
requirements and considered some of the alcohol programmes, I pointed
out to the Committee that they were courses to teach people how to
control their drinking and avoid drink-driving. It simply does not make
sense that, although we do not negotiate with people about whether we
will curfew them, fine them or send them into custody, we must
negotiate when it comes to alcohol treatment requirements. We need to
toughen up on that. I hope that the Minister will take the amendments
seriously.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000604">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I recognise that the hon. Lady’s intention
is to ensure that more offenders undertake the treatment that they
require to tackle their substance misuse, with the aim of supporting
recovery and reducing reoffending. However, I do not believe that the
provisions will deliver those outcomes; indeed, they could have an
adverse
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000605">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Putting
aside the legal difficulties for a moment—it was not the case
that I was thinking of but a more general difficulty—I do not
believe that compelling an individual to undertake treatment against
their wishes will result in more effective compliance and achieve the
desired outcomes. As with any person with drug or alcohol dependency,
the individual’s willingness to undertake and comply with
treatment is surely essential to their rehabilitation and recovery. The
same conditions must therefore apply to offenders undertaking drug
rehabilitation and alcohol treatment requirements. It is not the same
as the court ordering a punishment, which is the comparison that the
hon. Lady drew. If the offender does not show willingness to comply,
offender managers may be less likely to recommend treatment
requirements to the court because they cannot provide firm evidence
that the process will result in improved outcomes and aid
rehabilitation. In turn, if the court applies a treatment requirement
against the offender’s wishes, significant increases in breach
rates could be incurred if the offender fails to comply.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000606">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As I
mentioned, there are also legal difficulties with the amendment.
Perhaps the most significant is the general principle, protected by
law, that a person should not be subject to medical treatment without
their consent. If a court decided to force a person to submit to
medical treatment against his will, there is a risk that that would
amount to a disproportionate interference with his right to respect for
his private life. The court’s decision would therefore be
vulnerable to challenge.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000607">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The amendment
would also act against the principles of the national health service
constitution, to which we must pay due regard, that any individual has
the right to refuse treatment offered to them and not to be given any
physical examination or treatment unless they have given valid consent.
If the person does not have the capacity to do so, consent must be
obtained from a person legally able to act on their behalf, or the
treatment must be in their best interests. Outside the circumstances in
which a secure hospital order is applied, that would be particularly
problematic in respect of treatment
requirements.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000608">&#160;</a>

the offender substance abuse programme and the addressing
substance-related offending programme, require
consent?<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000609">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I will have to come back to the hon. Lady on advice
with the detail of the different programmes. The point that I am making
is that there are two issues. One is legal—the amendments would
open us up to legal risk—and the second is practical. Such
programmes are rehabilitative elements of the community sentencing
framework, and rehabilitation, by its very nature, is in the
offender’s interest. It is also in society’s interest,
obviously, because it puts offenders back on the straight and narrow.
It is to offenders’ benefit to engage with such programmes, as
it is to society’s.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000610">&#160;</a>
               </p> 
               <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 651<a class="bkMark" name="Column651">&#160;</a>
               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">However, the
fact is that if offenders decline to engage with them, the programmes
are highly unlikely to work. In the light of that, sentencers should be
in a certain position. If they are not going to engage and the
probation officer has come to that assessment and makes that point
clear in the pre-sentence report, there is precious little point in
sentencing people to these programmes. They quite properly should be
getting the full punitive tariff; part of the tariff is going to
protect the public and make reparation to the victim of the crime. If
they are not going to engage in rehabilitation, why are we wasting
society’s resources trying to rehabilitate them?<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000611">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There are
proper issues to address. We obviously have to try to ensure that we
people want to engage with rehabilitation. We have to explain to the
offender that this part of the sentence is in their
interest. If they are not going to engage with it, the
punitive elements of the tariff and those parts of the sentence that
protect the public remain available to sentencers, both then and in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000612">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">While
the key aims of treatment requirements are to aid reduced reoffending,
they are also about addressing health needs and enabling the recovery.
That should be addressed through consent. For the reasons I have set
out, I hope that the hon. Lady will accept my reassurances and withdraw
her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000613">&#160;</a>

                  <strong>:</strong> I knew that the Minister would say that,
if people had not consented, it would not be so effective to go down
that path. The fact that it would be less effective does not mean, of
course, that it would have no effect.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000614">&#160;</a>

purpose of the public services is not to satisfy the professional
ethics of the people working in the public services. It is to provide a
public service. I also knew that the Minister would raise his legal
worries. We are in danger here of seeming virtually to be giving people
a legal right to be maintained at a certain level of drug use by the
taxpayer. I do not think that is acceptable. However, I recognise that
this is an extremely contentious area and I shall not press for a vote.

the right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd made clear, the amendment

interaction of the new breach of detention and training order with
other custodial sentences, and it will therefore be technical in
nature. It will cover circumstances in which, for example, young
offenders who breach a detention and training order are dealt with in
parallel for another offence for which they receive a custodial
sentence, having reached the age of 18.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000629">&#160;</a>

regulations will set out how a further period of detention for a DTO
breach would apply with such a custodial sentence or in any other
potential circumstances where the young offender is serving a custodial
sentence, having reached the age of 18, but then receives a detention
period for having failed to comply with the DTO before reaching the age
of 18. Although some of those circumstances are likely to be rare and
unusual, we must make provision for them.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000630">&#160;</a>

Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland in relation to this clause,
particularly in relation to the period of curfew and our objection to
the extension from 12 to 16 hours.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000643">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I would like
to say a few words about the particular relevance of this clause to
young people. It is right to say—this would apply to young
people and adults—that the extension may limit the
offender’s capacity to carry out positive rehabilitative
activities and might contain them in premises that are unsuitable for
that degree of confinement, where they may be in company or in
circumstances that put them at risk of experiencing or perpetuating
abuse, neglect or criminal behaviour. This is of particular concern in
relation to children. Increasing the extent of curfews may result in a
ratcheting up of curfew requirements and community sentences generally,
and the comments the Minister made seem to support that view.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000644">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Concern has
been expressed in a number of briefings from the Prison Reform Trust,
Liberty, Justice, the Howard League and even the Magistrates’
Association. Although the Magistrates’ Association supports the
extension of powers, it states that<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000645">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“making maximum
use of the new powers to impose a curfew of 16 hours per day, 7 days
per week for 12 months would entail a severe restriction of liberty and
would have implications for others in the same
household.”<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000756">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This is a
significant step forward in sentencing policy. Liberty has
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000646">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“This
level of punishment in the community, amounting to virtual house
arrest, is likely to have a stigmatising effect preventing successful
reintegration. Such extensive curfew requirements further severely
disrupt normal family life, effecting not simply the individual
subject, but also family members and others residing with
him.”<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000757">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
view<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000647">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“applies
with still greater force in relation to young people, for whom long
curfews may have a particularly profound effect. 16 hour
curfews lasting for up to a year are likely to ostracise a young person
in his or her community in an important time in their personal and
social development and may impede effective rehabilitation, for
example, by preventing children from taking part in productive
activities such as after-school sports or music
classes.”<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000758">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>The effect of a 16-hour
confinement for up to 12 months on a young person is
significant. I think the Minister said that we did not appear to be
objecting to the duration of 12 months, but only to the 16 hours. We
object more to the 16 hours, but we are also concerned about imposing
that degree of confinement on a young person for a year. I will in due
course ask the Committee to divide on amendment 345. I will not ask it
to divide on amendment 346 or clause stand part, but I express concerns
about the clause as a whole.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000648">&#160;</a>

We are concerned because developmentally 12 months is a very
long period for a young person. We heard that clearly in oral evidence
at the start of our consideration in Committee. Although a year is a
relatively long time for a curfew order to be imposed on an adult, for
a young person, as a proportion of their life and in 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 656<a class="bkMark" name="Column656">&#160;</a>
                  </div>terms of how they can envisage such a period of time and contextualise
the nature of their sentence, it is simply
inappropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000649">&#160;</a>

                  <strong> </strong>My hon. Friend is absolutely right. It
shows that even if the Government have given thought to the principle
of extending curfews—they appear to have given that thought in
two divergent ways—they have not given particular thought to how
such additional punitive measures would affect young
people.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000650">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“Before

               <p class="hs_brev">“obtain

               </p>
               <p>That is in the Criminal
Justice and Immigration Act 2008. The Prison Reform Trust
says, and we adopt its argument, that the courts should be specifically
required to consider any potentially harmful impact on the offender; in
particular, in the increased risk of domestic violence as a result of a
curfew requirement. Confining people for longer periods—longer
periods of the day and longer periods of the year—means that
more care needs to be

point. I only have two further points to make and he brings me on to
one of them, which is whether this is a breach of article 5 rights. I
will not go through the case law, which I have here, and the history in
relation to control orders—the 18 hours, what was said in those
cases in relation to 16 hours and so on—but we have spoken to
very senior barristers who are expert in this field. We are advised
that it may well be something that the Minister should take cognisance
of. There may well be a breach of article 5 rights. The case law
suggests that the legality is judged by the impact on the individual.
If, in a specific case, it is seen that this, which effectively amounts
to house arrest, will amount to that degree of impact, then it is
perfectly possible, particularly in relation to young people, that the
human rights aspects have not been considered by the Government. I very
much look forward, having prompted him, to the Minister’s
response.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000655">&#160;</a>

Member for Carshalton and Wallington said: “Oh well,
we’re not necessarily expecting people to use 16-hour curfews;
it’s just a matter of discretion.” No, it is not. The
Government are clearly saying that it is reasonable to impose a curfew
of 16 hours. If the right hon. Gentleman, who was expressing
mild concern, thinks that 16-hour curfews for young people are
unreasonable, he should say so and vote against the

someone as young as 12, 14 or even 16 in what might be highly
unsuitable premises for 16 hours a day over a year is seriously being
advanced by the Government as an alternative to custody, this measure
is not the way to do that, even with all the safeguards that go with
it, including the education and supervision that we have in secure
training centres. We should at least be properly consulted, and the
proposal properly put forward, not slipped in in that slipshod
way.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000662">&#160;</a>

through the agency of the Minister, to be liberalising the sentencing
regime, and all they are introducing is a series of half-thought-out,
cheap ways to save money, because of the ridiculous level of budget
that has been accepted, which no other Department would sign up to. It
is obnoxious when adults are affected, but it is doubly so when young
people
are.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000666">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It is important to put on record how strongly I
feel about the amendment, in relation to children and young people. The
hon. Member for Ipswich has made some very valuable contributions to
our debates over the past few weeks, but I am sorry to say that his
latest set of interventions was absolutely the opposite of
valuable.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000667">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Children
and young people are different from adults, and we owe them special
protections. The youth justice system cannot simply mimic the adult
one, and nor should it, because we need to take different steps to
intervene and to seek to effect improvement in young lives. We have to
care for and treat children differently, and we recognise that through
so many aspects of
law.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000668">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is not right to start talking about tough community punishments,
without asking whether they are an appropriate form, at this extent,
for young people and children. I believe that they are not, and I have
already said that 12 months is an exceptionally long time in a young
person’s life. It is difficult for a young person, particularly
one from a dysfunctional background who has never known boundaries or
order in his or her life, to get any sense of what a 12-month sentence
means. A sentence that is not meaningful to a young person is
worthless, and I am concerned that that might be the case here. I am
deeply concerned about constraining young people in one place for 16
hours, limiting their opportunities for social interaction and
participation in broader educational and extra-curricular activities,
and limiting their ability to exercise and move around in their
community and be part of their neighbourhood and their environment. I
am deeply concerned that in some cases the home is not a very safe
place for young people and to keep them there for longer may render it
even less safe.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000669">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I therefore
plead with Government Members, especially those who have made so many
thoughtful contributions to the debate so far, to take on board the
fact that children and young people are different from adults
and  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 659<a class="bkMark" name="Column659">&#160;</a>
                  </div>that a simple read-across of the framework of penalties that applies for
adults is inappropriate. I was not happy with the framework for adults
anyway, but even if I were, I would be arguing that this type of
penalty for children and young people is too severe, too constricting
and inappropriate. I beg hon. Members to think carefully before they
push ahead with
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000670">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Amendment 345 would amend clause 67 so that the
maximum number of hours a day for which a curfew could be imposed
remained at 12. Amendment 346 would require the court to
obtain information in order to consider whether there was a risk of
harm by or to the offender or the offender’s family associated
with the imposition of the curfew
requirement.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000671">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government believe that it is important to provide the option of a
curfew that extends for a longer period than currently applies, for
both young people and adults. The extension in the court’s
powers will enable the court to impose a curfew requirement more
creatively and more appropriately, based on those critical times when
the offender is most likely to reoffend. That does not mean that the
curfew would automatically have the same duration every day. A young
person attending school, for example, would need flexibility during the
school week, but their movements could be more tightly restricted at
the
weekends.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000672">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
noted that the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston said that the
measure might limit their opportunities for social interaction. That
might be one of the precise objectives of the curfew, given the social
interaction that some of those young people will have been inflicting
on their communities. That is why these curfew requirements are
appropriate. I think that if the hon. Lady has had the same
constituency experience as I have, of young men and women under the age
of 18 who can be a real problem to their communities, she
will begin to see the benefit of a flexible curfew regime that can be
properly applied in order to help protect the communities from which
they
come.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000673">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is important to ensure that the youth rehabilitation order is
recognised as a punitive and demanding order and is a sentence that has
the confidence of both the courts and the public. We believe that
giving courts the power to impose longer curfews will achieve that
aim.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000674">&#160;</a>

made checks and they have written a declaration saying that they

think that there are questions about everything that has been written

is unnecessary to require the court, under amendment 346, to
consider whether there is a risk of harm by or to the offender or the
offender’s family associated with the imposition of the youth
rehabilitation order curfew requirement. The youth offending team
already carry out a risk assessment of possible harm
to  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 660<a class="bkMark" name="Column660">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the young person or family when they complete a pre-sentence report for
the court. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hammersmith is familiar
with the ASSET form. That form, which is the tool that the
youth offending team use, includes assessments of all the risks that
Opposition Members have adduced in support of their arguments. That
makes it clear that there will have been a proper appreciation of the
circumstances in which the young offender would be made subject to a
curfew. It will be part of the recommendation from the YOT worker to
the court about the appropriateness of a curfew sentence. In the light
of the conclusions of that report, the court will consider whether a
curfew requirement is appropriate or
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000677">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Equally,
local authorities also have an obligation under section 17 of the

                  </strong> The clause replicates what was in
clause 62, but it relates to young people rather than
adults. I will endeavour not to repeat the matters that were dealt with
in that debate and will adopt the argument made by my hon. Friend the
Member for Bishop Auckland.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000703">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
we are concerned about the downgrading of the need for a proper medical
assessment. Notwithstanding the difficulties that there are in
obtaining the relevant professional advice, the answer is not
immediately to say that we will deal with the matter by perhaps looking
to alternative medical advice that is not of equal status or standing.
I simply say again that if such an approach is right for adults, it is
doubly right in the case of children. We think that without the correct
degree of medical opinion, the orders may be imposed inappropriately
and unhelpful burdens may be placed on the individual. That will fail
to contribute towards effective rehabilitation, which, after
all, is the objective here.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000704">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This is not an
issue on which people wish to fall out. I suspect that there is
agreement among all Committee members about the need to see the
effective, sensitive and appropriate use of mental health treatment. We
simply disagree on whether, for reasons of expediency, this is the
right approach to take at present. Greater sensitivity is required in
the guidance of young people. Young people’s minds are still
forming in a way that is far more profound and immediate than
adults’. The matter is particularly sensitive for young people
who also have mental health difficulties, and it requires a high level
of expertise. When such young people have emerged from a difficult
phase of development, even in the course of offending behaviour, we owe
it to them, and to wider society, to give them the benefit of the doubt
and the most thorough and appropriate treatment. I therefore ask
Government Members who are not persuaded by my hon. Friend’s
arguments against clause 62 carefully to consider clause
68.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000705">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The aim of the clause, in parallel with matters
debated earlier, is to simplify the procedural requirements for a court
to impose a mental health requirement as part of a youth rehabilitation
order. It achieves that by removing the need for a medical clinician
approved for the purposes of section 12 of the Mental Health Act 1983
to carry out the initial mental health
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000706">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">The clause does
not remove the need for any assessment; it merely aligns assessment
with what happens in practice. The initial health assessment is carried
out by a broad range of child and adolescent mental health services
specialists, such as child and adolescent psychiatrists, specialist
mental health nurses and child psychologists rather than by senior
clinicians, to whom assessments would be restricted if the clause were
not passed. Removing the unnecessary current requirement for a section
12-approved medical clinician sign-off will speed up the process and
reduce court delay. Where necessary, the CAMHS team will refer
complicated and serious cases to an appropriate forensic clinician. We
have debated this matter before: it remains the case that the court
cannot make a YRO with a mental health requirement unless the young
person has expressed a willingness to comply with it. I therefore hope
that the Committee will allow the clause to remain part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1109166000707">&#160;</a>
