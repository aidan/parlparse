<P>
<B>Mr. Seamus Mallon </B>(Newry and Armagh): I beg to move amendment No. 48, in page 30, line 40, leave out from "Ombudsman" to end of line 41 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"shall himself bring disciplinary proceedings.
<P>
(5A) Any such cases thus brought shall be presented by the Ombudsman to an independent tribunal established under subsection (8) which is empowered
<P>
(i) to adjudicate on the merits of the case, and
<P>
(ii) in the case of a finding of guilt, to make recommendations to the Chief Constable as to the penalty.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 49, in page 30, leave out from beginning of line 42 to end of line 4 on page 31.
<P>
No. 50, in page 31, leave out lines 8 and 9.
<P>
No. 102, in page 31, leave out lines 10 to 18.
<P>
No. 51, in page 31, leave out line 21.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I want to speak to all the amendments tabled in my name as, to a large degree, they are consequential on amendment No. 48. They would amend the Bill to allow the ombudsman to bring himself into the proceedings in cases in which the Chief Constable is unwilling to bring disciplinary proceedings against an accused officer. That problem has been pointed out in the Hayes report and in the triennial review of the Independent Commission For Police Complaints. The matter has been laughed at and scorned by every lawyer in Northern Ireland who has ever been briefed in such cases.
<P>
At present, although the Chief Constable might have decided not to bring disciplinary proceedings against an officer, he can be instructed to do so by the independent commissionas it is now. That results in the unedifying spectacle of the Chief Constable, who has established his unwillingness to bring a case, being required to do so, and almost always briefing lawyers on it. That case, which he was reluctant to bring, is then brought before a tribunal that he chairs. That is a wholly undesirable and cumbersome way to deal with the problem.
<P>
Amendment No. 48 would bypass such problems by giving the ombudsman the power to bring disciplinary proceedings. He would be able to bring cases before a properly established tribunal, to make representations and, in findings of guilt, to make recommendations about the penalty to the Chief Constable.
<P>
There can be no serious argument against a change in the provisions. The amendment does no more than give effect to the recommendations of the Hayes report and to those of the triennial review of the ICPC. It introduces nothing new. It is in tandem with the other provisions in the Bill regarding the role of the ombudsman. It would remove the absurdity of situations in which the Chief Constable had decided not to bring disciplinary procedures, but was directed to do so before a tribunal that he chaired. That is hardly in the interests of due process, natural justice, or public confidence in the police system. In view of the recommendations in the Hayes report and the triennial review, such situations can no longer be supported.
<P>
The Bill is silent on this matter. It makes no suggestions. We do not know what the Government are thinking or whether they have other views on the matter. In particular, there is no suggestion that there will be any changes. I suspect that the word "regulations" might be used again. Surely the situation that I have described is such a contradiction and so absurd that the matter should be dealt with in the Bill.
<P>
I look forward to the Minister's comments. If he has any doubts about my presentationwhich at this time of the morning can always be questionedI suggest that conversation, however formal, with any of the barristers who have dealt with relevant cases in the north of Ireland, would provide convincing arguments about the absurdity of the matter, and the need for change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): Welcome back to the Chair, Mr. Jones for what is, no doubt, the final furlong.
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Steady on!
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I want to speak to amendment No. 102, which is a probing amendment.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Tony Worthington):</B> Ah!
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister is gleeful about that. The amendment concerns clause 59(8), which relates to wording in the Bill that also appears in clause 50(3) of the Police Act 1996. Clause 59(8) of the Bill refers to what will become section 25(3) when the Bill is passed. That provision concerns procedures. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Without prejudice to the powers conferred by this section, regulations under this section shall
<P>
(a) establish, or make provision for the establishment of, procedures for cases in which a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary may be dealt with by dismissal,".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That wording is identical to that in section 50(3) of the 1996 Act. However, clause 59(8) of the Bill deals not with procedures, but special procedures.
<P>
The Police Federation for Northern Ireland argues in its submission that that is completely unacceptable. In the federation's view, the special procedures have yet to be defined. Will the Minister provide clarification? Both the 1996 Act and previous provisions of the Bill refer to procedures established under regulations. The concept of special procedures is introduced suddenly in clause 59(8) and those special procedures have not yet been defined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I think that I can deal with the points raised by the hon. Members for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) and for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) to the satisfaction of both of them. I have always been an optimist.
<P>
The clause concerns cases in which any criminal aspects have already been dealt with. At that point the ombudsman would consider disciplinary action. If he decides that there is evidence of a breach of police discipline, he will make the appropriate recommendation to the Chief Constable, giving the reasons and background. The Chief Constable would consider the matter, and if he agreed with the recommendation would bring disciplinary action. The case would be heard under the established disciplinary procedures. That is important. It would, as pointed out by Maurice Hayes, enable the Chief Constable to be responsible for the discipline of his own force. That is the central principle of the Hayes report. If the Chief Constable disagrees with a recommendation, he should give reasons for that to the ombudsman. The Bill provides for the ombudsman to consult the Chief Constable. There would be an exchange on the subject, and the Chief Constable would give the ombudsman his reasons for disagreeing with the recommendation. For example, the Chief Constable may notice a flaw in the evidence, and the Bill gives him an opportunity to come back to the ombudsman on the subject.
<P>
If agreement was reached between the Chief Constable and the ombudsman, the Chief Constable would bring disciplinary charges. If the ombudsman was convinced by the Chief Constable's case, there would be no charges. If agreement cannot be reached
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Under-Secretary referred to subsection (5), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Ombudsman may, after consultation with the Chief Constable, direct him to bring disciplinary proceedings."</font></ul>
<P>
Therefore, if the ombudsman stands his ground, he can direct the Chief Constable to bring disciplinary proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The hon. Gentleman is pinching my next line.
<P>
When agreement cannot be reached, and the ombudsman continues to believe that a charge is appropriate, he can direct the Chief Constable to bring a charge.
<P>
There is some confusion, and a misunderstanding that if the Chief Constable brings a charge, he also brings the case. That is not so. The Chief Constable would bring the charge, but the ombudsman would bring the case. The Chief Constable must bring the charge because he is responsible for discipline in the force, but the case would be handed to the ombudsman for preparation and presentation. A hearing would take place before a tribunal, as recommended by Maurice Hayes. The tribunal would be independent. I shall consider that subject later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> Perhaps my timing is wrong, and the Minister is about to say that established disciplinary procedures will be changed. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire asked a probing question. What will happen if the Chief Constable, who is unwilling to bring disciplinary charges, chairs the tribunal that adjudicates the case brought by the ombudsman? Is the Under-Secretary about to say that there will be a substantial change in the composition of the tribunal to ensure that such nonsense does not occur?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Yes, I am. When the Chief Constable and the ombudsman disagree, the ombudsman can direct the Chief Constable to bring the charge. The ombudsman controls the case, which will be heard before an independent tribunal.
<P>
I was relieved when the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said that amendment No. 102 was a probing amendment, because it would destroy the clause. Subsection (8) provides for regulations to establish a new procedure. The independent tribunal would make a finding of innocence or guilt, and make a recommendation to the Chief Constable on punishment. It would be up to the Chief Constable to determine the punishment, but subsection (9) states that the Chief Constable should notify the ombudsman of the outcome.
<P>
I know that the wording of the clause is complex. A good deal of time has gone into the clause and we are still working on it. I appreciate that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh wants to see the disciplinary tribunal in the Bill. We shall give further thought to whether there is a way of doing that, but I give him the assurance that the term "special procedure" means that it will be an independent tribunal and not a police body in cases where there is disagreement between the Chief Constable and the ombudsman.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The first amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, amendment No. 48, refers to the ombudsman bringing disciplinary proceedings in certain cases. At present, the legislation requires the Chief Constable to do that, but it is a purely technical device. It is for the Chief Constable as the appropriate disciplinary authority to prefer charges. However, regulations will provide that the ombudsman presents the case where the Chief Constable has brought the charges on direction. The hon. Gentleman's amendment No. 49, provides for the ombudsman to present the case in those instances. Again, regulations will provide for that. Amendment No. 50 seeks to remove the ombudsman's power to allow the Chief Constable to discontinue disciplinary proceedings. We resist that, because circumstances can change as more becomes known about a case. If the evidence was flawed, it would be necessary to give the ombudsman power to allow the Chief Constable to discontinue disciplinary proceedings. We resist that, because circumstances can change as more becomes known about a case. If the evidence was flawed, it would be necessary to give the ombudsman power to allow the Chief Constable to discontinue disciplinary proceedings, but again the power is with the ombudsman and not with the Chief Constable.
<P>
I think that I have answered the points raised by amendment No. 102. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said that it was a probing amendment, but if it were accepted, the clause would disintegrate.
<P>
I hope that, following my assurances about the ombudsman's powers, the direction of the case and it being an independent tribunal, the hon. Gentleman will seek to withdraw his amendment. If we can find a form of wording that makes the issue clearer, I assure hon. Members that we shall present it on Report.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I think that I understood what the Minister said, although some small matters of clarification still worry me. He says that there will be an independent tribunal when the ombudsman and the Chief Constable disagree. I take it that an independent tribunal would not be chaired by the Chief Constable, who has already taken a position by refusing to proceed with the case. I also take it that there will be an independent tribunal when the Chief Constable and the ombudsman do not disagree, and that the tribunal's independence would be reflected in both circumstances. It would be difficult to sustain the argument that in one set of circumstances there would be an independent tribunal, which, I take it, would not be chaired by the Chief Constable, and that in circumstances where there was no disagreement between the ombudsman and the Chief Constable, the tribunal did not have the same independence.
<P>
I ask the Minister to clarify those points. I shall seek to withdraw the amendments. I am never sure of the proper time to do that, but I give notice that that that is my intention. However, if the anomaly and absurdity in the provision is not removed, I will have to return to it later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I again give the assurance that the independent tribunal will be chaired not by the Chief Constable but by an independent legal figure. The independent tribunal is appropriate for cases of disagreement between the Chief Constable and the ombudsman about the action requested of the Chief Constable by the ombudsman. That is right and just. Where there is no disagreement and it is agreed by both the Chief Constable and the ombudsman that disciplinary charges should be brought, normal police disciplinary procedures will apply.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh will accept my full assurance that those matters are all under the control of the ombudsman, not the Chief Constable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> In circumstances of agreement between the Chief Constable and the ombudsman, would it not strengthen the Bill, the police, the control of the ombudsman and the credibility of the entire process for the same independent tribunal to apply in both circumstances? I put that question to the Minister and ask him to consider the matter again. All the evidence shows that the process would be strengthened without taking any powers of discipline away from the Chief Constable. It would be a much more credible process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> That goes way beyond the amendments. Guided by Maurice Hayes's investigation, we maintain that an important element of the constitutional framework for the police force is the Chief Constable's responsibility for discipline and that should not be undermined by an external body. The check is present, albeit not on individual cases. If the ombudsman felt that internal police disciplinary procedures were not working, it would be publicised and brought to the attention of the Secretary of State. We would then be aware of a breakdown in the system.
<P>
This procedure is necessary to deal with disagreement between the Chief Constable and the ombudsman. It will probably be used in only a tiny number of cases, but it will provide an important assurance that the process is driven by and is under the control of the ombudsman. The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh spoke about the Chief Constable unwillingly bringing a case on which he would have to pronounce judgment, but that will not happen. I hope that I have provided him with powerful assurances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I have a quick question for the Minister. In his reply to the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, he said that the special procedure of the independent tribunal will come into play, under subsection (8) only when there is disagreement under subsection (5), to which subsection (8)(b) makes reference:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in compliance with a direction under subsection (5)".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, subsection (8)(a) states that the ombudsman can bring the "special procedures" into play in "exceptional circumstances"nothing to do with agreement or disagreement.
<P>
The Minister was not seeking to mislead the Committee but the procedure under subsection (8) is relevant not only in cases of disagreement; it can come in differently, provided that the ombudsman believes that there are "exceptional circumstances" surrounding a case. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify and endorse that point, as well as giving the Committee some idea of the "exceptional circumstances" that the subsection is designed to embrace.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I think that I am grateful to the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. This morning I received a letter from someone asking me to define "exceptional", and this seems to be the day for trying to crack it, although it is difficult.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for pointing out subsection (8)(a), which I forgot to mention when responding to the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh. There is nothing different about subsection (8)(a): the power exists already in the 1987 order. It is a failsafe power. If the ombudsman believes that there are good reasonsbecause of the exceptional, the out-of-the-ordinary, or the unprecedented circumstances of a casewhy a special procedure should be set up, we should do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister. I shall wait to see what may appear on the amendment paper on Report. I have heard his assurance that the Bill will deal with the absurdity of a Chief Constable who does not wish to bring proceedings having to adjudicate on those proceedings as chairman of the tribunal. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clauses 59 and 60 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 61</center></H4>
<H4><center>Reports</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 103, in page 32, line 25, after "2(4)(a)", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and any other information which the Police Authority may reasonably require for the discharge of those functions.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause deals with the reports that the ombudsman will make during his or her activities and responsibilities. Subsection (7) deals with general or statistical information which the ombudsman considers should be brought to the attention of the Police Authority in connection with the authority's functions under clause 2(4)(a). We have revisited that subsection, which sets out the overriding duty and responsibility of the Police Authority, many times. Given the import of that responsibility, it should not be left to the ombudsman to decide what information he or she passes to the Police Authority; it should be for the Police Authority to say to the ombudsman, "Because we, not you, are tasked with the responsibility under clause 2(4)(a), we would like this additional information so that we can satisfy ourselves that we are exercising our duty properly." The amendment would add the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and any other information which the Police Authority may reasonably require for the discharge of those functions"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to the end of subsection (7), making it clear that in the transfer of information, it is not just left to the ombudsman to decide what information is important to the Police Authority. If the authority feels that there are gaps in the information, that it is not explained in enough detail or that there are limitations in the statistics, it will be empowered under the Bill to ask the ombudsman for that additional information.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I cannot see a problem with that and, from the Police Authority's point of view, it is important to state clearly in the Bill that the authority takes ownership under clause 2(4)(a). It should be in control at all times of whatever means are necessary to discharge its extremely important functions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): For the sake of brevity, I shall not repeat the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, but there is another small dimension that can be stressed in support of the amendment. My hon. Friend said that under subsection (7), as it stands, the onus is on the ombudsman to provide the Police Authority with the information that he believes should be brought to the authority's attention. My hon. Friend rightly argued that the Police Authority itself should have significant input into the type of information that it receives.
<P>
Another factor that should be noted, however, is the limitation of definitions of information in subsection (7). The draftsman has specified two categories of informationstatistical and generalbut it would not be unreasonably pedantic to suggest that some information would fall into neither category. Detailed specific information might be required by the Police Authority, so why has it been excluded as a third category? The amendment would give the Police Authority not only a statutory power to request information, but would include the third category of "any other information", which is information that is distinct from statistical or general. Therefore, I support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The amendment is about the relationship between the Police Authority and the ombudsman. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Ombudsman shall send to the Police Authority any statistical or other general information which the Ombudsman considers should be brought to the attention of the Police Authority in connection with its functions under section 2(4)(a)."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It complements the requirement in clause 61(5) for the ombudsman to send his or her reports to the Police Authoritythe subsection places a mandatory duty on the ombudsman to send information to the Police Authority. That would include information that comes into the possession of the ombudsman or which he or she establishes, for example, through research.
<P>
The subsection repeats the provisions of the Independent Commission for Police Complaints in article 17(6)(b) of the Police (Northern Ireland) Order 1987. As far as we know, that has not been a contentious issue. If the Police Authority requested certain information from the ombudsman, the clause would require the ombudsman to send that information, if he or she had it, provided it was relevant to the Police Authority's function. The amendment adds nothing to that requirement.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said that if the Police Authority wanted additional information, it should be in control of the situationI realise that I am extemporising a little. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that it is important to establish that the ombudsman is independent of both the Policy Authority and the Chief Constable. The ombudsman cannot be told what to do. However, he has a mandatory duty to supply the Policy Authority with information that is relevant to clause 2(4)(a), which will ensure that the Police Authority has the information that is necessary to fulfil its function.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): I agree with the Minister's latter point about the independence of the ombudsman. However, is there not some conflict between his argument on the Police Authority and the provisions in clause 61(1)? The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Ombudsman shall, at the request of the Secretary of State, report to the Secretary of State on such matters relating generally to the functions of the Ombudsman as the Secretary of State may specify".</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no independent choice for the ombudsman. On this occasion, it is probably right that he has a responsibility to report to the Secretary of State, as she may specify. However, if it is sauce for the goose, it should be sauce for the gander. The argument of the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire seems to be justified on those grounds. The Minister's argument does not stand up because of the contradiction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I do not see any contradiction. We have tried to make clear just how independent the ombudsman is of all contiguous authorities. I have assured the Committee that where the Police Authority needs information under subsection 2(4)(a) to carry out its functions, there is a mandatory duty on the ombudsman to supply that information.
<P>
In reference to the point made by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis), clause 61 establishes the power of the Secretary of State to request information from the ombudsman on how the ombudsman is carrying out his or her duty. It is a standard part of any Actit provides that any body that is established by Parliament is ultimately answerable to Parliament and must give an account of the way in which it is carrying out its functions. That is standard practice and not at all ominous in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister, who has given me and other members of the Committee some assurances on the matter. He said that the subsection places a mandatory duty on the ombudsman to send information to the Police Authority. I do not deny that, but if there were outstanding information that the Police Authority believed it should have, it is not clear from the subsection whether the ombudsman is mandated to send it to the authority. The subsection states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"which the Ombudsman considers should be brought to the attention of the Police Authority".</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are the key wordsthe onus is placed on the ombudsman to decide whether he or she considers it appropriate to bring such information to the attention of the Police Authority. There may be a disagreement, as the Police Authority may consider it appropriate for certain information to be brought to its attention, but the ombudsman may not agree. What happens in those circumstances?
<P>
Clause 2(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Police Authority shall secure that the Northern Ireland Police Service is efficient and effective,"</UL></FONT>
<P>
which places a heavy responsibility on the Police Authority, Clause 2(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In carrying out its duty under subsection (3), the Police Authority shall keep itself informed as to<br>
(a) the workings of Part VII (police complaints and disciplinary proceedings).</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are discussing clause 61, but there are 15 clauses under part VII of the Bill, much of which is new, such as the concept of an ombudsman. It should not be left to the ombudsman to decide what information the Police Authority needs to discharge its functions under clause 2(4)(a). The wording should ensure that any information that the Police Authority deems necessary for it to fulfil and discharge its functions should be made available to it. If the Minister can give me such an assurance, I will withdraw my amendment.
<P>
I simply want to make it clear that if there is a difference of opinion about what information is relevant to the Police Authority's duty, the authority should be able to access that information. Otherwise, the Police Authority could concludeand rightly sothat it is unable to discharge that particular function under clause 2(4)(a) because there is a gap in the information that it requires to carry out a certain task. If there is a way around that problem under the Bill, no doubt the Minister will explain it. However, given the way in which the provision is worded, the Police Authority has no come back on the flow of information from the ombudsman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The issue that the hon. Gentleman raises is a non-problem. I do not believe that there will be difficulties between the ombudsman and the Police Authority in deciding what information is required. Throughout our proceedings we have talked about openness and transparency and about clearly laying out the procedures that are to be followed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Could the Minister expand his comments and explain the history of the adjectival phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"statistical or other general information".</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why are those two categories specified? Why cannot the phrase "all or any information" be used?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> It is a neat little phrase, which covers the sort of information that might be sought by the Police Authority and which can be provided by the ombudsman. In many cases, such information will be statistical information. However, if we stuck to statistical information, the Police Authority would be denied some useful information, which is covered by the phrase "general information".
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Hesford </B>(Wirral, West): Does the Minister agree that one of the matters in clause 61(1) that the Secretary of State may want investigated would be if the Police Authority made it plain that it was not receiving the information that it thought it might receive from the ombudsman.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> That was a helpful intervention, but we are labouring the point a little. The ombudsman has a mandatory duty to supply the statistical and general information that is necessary to enable the Police Authority to fulfil its duties.
<P>
It is important to establish the independence of the ombudsman. The Police Authority cannot tell the ombudsman what to do across the whole range of his functions. That would not be acceptable. It should be for the ombudsman to decide what information to supply to the authority, but a mandatory duty is placed on him to supply whatever information is necessary to allow the Police Authority to fulfil its duties.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West (Mr. Hesford) pointed out, if, under any Act, an authority does not fulfil its statutory duties, redress can be sought. It is perfectly fair to put a mandatory duty on the ombudsman to supply non-contentious information, but the ombudsman must have control over what information is providedwith the safeguard, as pointed out by my hon. Friend, that if the law is being broken the usual legal redress is available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The intervention by the hon. Member for Wirral, West seemed to throw a lifeline to the Minister, but I do not believe that it covers the point. The Minister yet again assures us that the Bill creates a mandatory duty, but has not said how the Police Authority can get hold of outstanding information. Why should it be for the ombudsman to determine what information the[Mr. Moss]
Police Authority needs to fulfil its important functions under clause 2(4)(a)? I am not satisfied that the Minister has attempted to meet us even halfway on the matter, so I shall press the amendment to a Division.
<P>

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I had not intended to speak until I heard the Minister dig himself into the hole that was carefully prepared for him by the hon. Member for Wirral, West.
<P>
We are attempting to have a sensible debate. Therefore it is ridiculous for the Minister to say that the Secretary of State's powers, as distinct from the Police Authority's rights, are conferred simply to ensure that the authority has its rights accorded to it. The Police Authority and the ombudsman will regard themselves as having a common purpose. If the Minister were sincere, he would, instead of creating the potential for conflict between the two, have sought means whereby, if difficulty arose, the Police Authority would not be precluded from having extended discussions of any sort with the ombudsman, so as to reconcile differences at that level rather than run off to the Secretary of State. I assume that the Minister was rightthat the Secretary of State wishes to ensure that the Police Authority has all the information that it requires to enable it to meet its obligations under clause 61(4)(a).
<P>
Once again, even in a clause covering the functions of the ombudsman, the rights and the authority of the Police Authority for Northern Ireland are being eroded. I will not go into the reasons now. I shall deal with those at considerable length when in my own time I reveal the thinking of the Northern Ireland Office on the future of the police in Northern Ireland. Matters have come to my attention which will, I hope, be in the public domain within the next 24 hours. It is quite ominous that even in a clause on which we all largely agree, a conspiratorial attitude emanates from the Northern Ireland Office. It is designed to clear the path for certain action in respect of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and is intended to put its future beyond the direct control and influence of those who regard it as a matter internal to the Administration in Northern Ireland. I wanted that on record. No doubt the Minister will give the impression that he does not know what I am referring to. I apologise to other members of the Committee for not being more explicit, but time will reveal that the Minister does know, and will allow others to learn of the conspiratorial approach to policing in Northern Ireland.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I have two brief points to make about the clause. First, we have again come up against the problem that runs through the Bill, namely, how to define authority, responsibility and accountability. In this context, the accountable body is the Secretary of State, not the Police Authority. To ask whether the Secretary of State rather than the Police Authority is the appropriate authority returns us to an argument that we had earlier, and which we shall continue to have throughout our consideration of the Bill. I made that point at the start of our proceedings, and I shall not labour it here.
<P>
Secondly, the clause contains one small item that causes me concernalthough it does not worry mebecause it could cause anomalies. Part VII of the Bill, which is about police complaints, states that the ombudsman is required to report to the Secretary of State at least once every five years. that suggests that he could do so only once every five years. The ombudsman's tenure of office is five years, and the report could therefore become an obituary at the end of that five-year period, although, in practice, that would probably not happen. It would be bad for the system if the ombudsman's observations about this crucially important part of the Bill were given only at the end of his tenurethe system would lose its effectiveness.
<P>
Finally, I pose a question for the Ministeralthough I suspect that I should have posed it in another way, Mr. Jones, and I beg your indulgence. Could clause 64(4) be amended, even at this late stage, to include the requirement that the report be made more than once?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh makes a relevant point, which my party supports. Reports from those who are about to retire tend to be a compendium of observations and to include the statement, "I could have done the job better if I had had better opportunities." The onus passes on to the successor, who may not necessarily agree with those observations. The ex-chairman of the Police Authority took that approachhe tried to place obligations on his successor after he was removed from his job. I admit that I had not thought of it before, but there is some justification for arguing that during the ombudsman's term in office he might produce a report half way through and at the end of his tenure in office. I hope that the Minister will consider the proposal favourably.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The clause is not contentious. It provides that the ombudsman shall report to the Secretary of State if asked to do so
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"on any matters coming to the Ombudsman's attention"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and if he or she feels that that is in the public interest. There would be objections if that did not occur.
<P>
That brings me to the points raised by the hon. Members for Newry and Armagh and for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. The clause places three requirements on the ombudsman. First, to bring matters that he or she believes are of concern to the Secretary of State at any time. Secondly, to produce an annual report that brings out such issues. Thirdly, to deal at least every five years with issues related to the working of the office and the overall situation. The clause gives the ombudsman freedom. It does not stipulate that an obituary be issued only at the end of the ombudsman's term of office.
<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone said that the clause precluded discussion between the Police Authority and the ombudsman. It does no such thing. One expects considerable discussion between the ombudsman and the Police Authority about what information and statistics are necessary in a collaborative atmosphere. That has happened in the past and I am confident that it will continue. It is a good clause that merits the support of the Committee.

<P>
We have already dealt with amendment No. 65, which was subsequent to this amendment. The amendment would give the complainant a record of the outcome of the procedure without his having to ask for it. There is an awful condescension and a confounded arrogance about the phrase

We are talking about someone whose rights may have been infringed and the record may inform him of that infringement. In the interest of the transparency that the Bill should enshrine, the complainant should be informed of the outcome of the informal resolution without having to grovel for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> It is Christmas for the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(e)conducting and commissioning research on matters pertaining to policing."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> We are making rapid progress now. I was right: this is perhaps the final furlong.
<P>
The amendments refer to the definition of general administrative purposes of the Police Authority as set out in clause 73(3). Amendment No. 121 would make it clearer that there is a distinction between the functions of the Police Authority, which we have discussed on many occasions, and those of the Chief Constable. Amendment No. 122 takes us back to our debate on clause 45 and deals with the powers to conduct and commission research.
<P>
We had a long debate on that subject and covered most of the angles, so I do not wish to revisit it, although we may come back to it on Report. The Police Authority recommended amendment No. 122 for inclusion in the Bill so that it would contain the Police Authority's clear responsibility to undertake research into matters relating to the discharge of its functions. That also comes under the umbrella of general administrative purposes as defined in subsection (3).
<P>
These are fairly harmless amendments. In the Police Authority's eyes, amendment No. 122 would insert into the Bill, for the only time, its function to conduct research into policing. How can it develop the interface with the general public or understand the public's views about policing matters if it does not undertake research? Opinion research is only one type of research, but in many respects it may be the most important that the Police Authority will undertake in the future.
<P>
The thrust of the Bill is to give the Police Authority added powers and responsibilities and to set it up as the conduit for the public to have a say on their perception of the policing of Northern Ireland. Undertaking research is an important function of the Police Authority and it should be written into the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> As the Committee would expect, I shall deal first with amendment No. 121 and then with amendment No. 122. Both amendments relate to the general administrative purposes of the Police Authority.
<P>
Amendment No. 121 would include, under the term "general administrative purposes", any functions that are not expressly carried out by the Chief Constable. It is unclear exactly what the amendment would achieve. If the intention is to clarify the position, that is unnecessary as the term "general administrative purposes" is already clearly defined in the Bill.
<P>
However, the amendment would have one damaging effect. It would remove the specific reference to section 7, whose aim is to encourage local accountability and[Mr. Worthington]
develop the relationship between the Police Authority and district councils. Consultation is one of the primary roles of the authority, so it is important that it is specifically covered under the terms of clause 73.
<P>
In view of that, and the fact that the amendment as tabled is defectivethe use of the word "hereby" would restrict the reference to powers exercised by the Chief Constable under the clauseI invite the Committee to resist the amendment.
<P>
Our legal advice on amendment No. 122 is that the Police Authority already has adequate powers to enable it to conduct its own research. When we debated clause 45, I undertook to consider the matter again, and I have now done so. Any body corporate, of which the Police Authority is one, has the power to undertake research activities. That is why it not necessary to make that explicit.
<P>
The Police Authority already undertakes valuable research. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire referred to its work with the public. Its valuable research should be developed and the powers for it to do so are already in the Bill. With those assurances, I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press his amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I thank the Minister for his response and for his further consideration of the points that we raised when debating clause 45. I am satisfied with his clarification and I am sure that the Police Authority will also be satisfied to know that it possesses the requisite powers as a body corporate. I am happy to accept the advice of the Minister's legal advisers. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a second time.
<P>
The new clause is an attempt to deal with certain circumstances in which the ombudsman must make a judgment. It is essential that the Bill includes such a provision because of the remarkable situations that can develop in Northern Ireland. The new clause would not remove any of the Chief Constable's disciplinary powers. It would permit the ombudsman to ask the Chief Constable to enforce those powers in circumstances that no one could quibble with. Public interest is involved in such matters, and the investigation of grave allegations against a police officer should not be impeded.
<P>
The new clause would promote public confidence in the Bill and in its operation. When members of the public have been seriously injured and police officers are involved, one of the major concerns that has been expressed is that those officerswho might have been involved in serious crimescarry on with their normal duties while the cases are investigated. That would not apply to other civilian professions, and I assume that we regard the police service as a civilian service, although, no doubt, that matter will be clarified on Report.
<P>
The greatest compliment that we can pay to the police service is to say that it is civilian. In that case, there should be the same rules, regulations and conventions that apply to other professions. If a serious allegation is made about a doctor, a teacher, a social worker, or even a bank manager, they would be suspended until the resolution of the investigation. The situation should be no different if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a police officer has committed an offence.
<P>
There is also anxiety that if a police officer is not suspended, he might interfere with the investigation, in very limitedbut none the less conceivablecircumstances. It would be appropriate, therefore, for the ombudsman to have a statutory remit to express an opinion on the matter. I accept that those would be exceptional circumstances and that there would be few such cases, but they could occur.
<P>
Under the present arrangements, police officers can be suspended. The new clause would bring that process under the influence of the ombudsman, without removing the Chief Constable's right to determine whether officers should be suspended. It does not interfere with the Chief Constable's autonomy. It would enable the ombudsman to request involvement when he judges that there is a public interest in the matter, when he believes that the investigation might otherwise be impeded, or when the case is of such gravity that his intervention would be warranted. The new clause would protect the position and role of the Chief Constable, and reinforce the ombudsman's options to continue with an investigation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Jones.
<P>
I am in difficulties, with which being a village schoolmaster does not help. I believe that the wording of the new clause is erroneous. I may be wrong, and I should like some advice. I shall give my interpretation of the new clause and ask whether it means something different from the intention of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If at any time in the course of an investigation by an officer of the Ombudsman or a police officer investigating on his behalf the Ombudsman ... concludes that it would impeded his investigations not to do otherwise ... he may make an application to the Chief Constable"
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I shall treat the hon. Gentleman's remarks as a speech, not a point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> With great respect, Mr. Jones, you brought me to a halt at the wrong moment.
<P>
I am worried about new clause 2(a)(ii) and the phrase, "not to do otherwise". The new clause continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"he may make an application to the Chief Constable for the suspension of any officer who is the subject of an investigation".</UL></FONT>
<P>
I believe that the new clause should state that the ombudsman could make an application to the Chief Constable if he concluded that it would impede his investigations "not to do so." My point is purely pedantic, and I leave it to others to decide whether I am right.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is not for me to interpret the new clause. Perhaps the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh will speak later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I greatly enjoyed the hon. Gentleman's point of order, and I hope that I can tackle it.
<P>
We appreciate the reasons for the new clause. The ombudsman will possess all the information on the investigation of the majority of complaints, especially serious complaints in circumstances that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh described. Therefore, we agree that the ombudsman should have the power to suggest to the Chief Constable that an officer should be suspended. However, a new clause is unnecessarythat might cover the point that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone made. The matter can be tackled through regulations. The subject of the new clause is appropriate for regulations and we shall introduce an amendment to the regulation power on Report. We are grateful to the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh for bringing the matter to our attention. On the basis of that assurance I ask him to withdraw the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I am grateful to the Minister.
<P>
I take the point made by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone about the limitations of the village schoolmasterI was one. I cannot but be aware of Oliver Goldsmith's remarks about the capacities of the village schoolmaster. It strikes me that I was in the company of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone the last time that I went through
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Sweet Auburn, loveliest village of the plain,"</UL></FONT>
<P>
from where Goldsmith wrote. I hope that in future his words will inspire me to write my amendments better, and the hon. Gentleman to understand them with more facility.
<P>
I am prepared to withdraw the new clause on the ground that the Minister will examine the matter. I do not like matters to be dealt with in regulation when they could be included in the Bill, but reluctantly I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<P>

<P>
(iv) resigns voluntarily from the force,
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
Again, I am attempting to stop a practice that has over the years been one of the more obvious causes of concern in the north of Irelandthe option, in effect, for a police officer to end an investigation that has been taking place, by retiring, taking early retirement, taking retirement on sickness grounds, or resigning voluntarily from the force. The new clause is an attemptand a valid one, I thinkto treat such a practice as incompatible with the thinking behind an ombudsman's role.
<P>
An option that enables some police officers with ease to evade the consequences of misconduct by opting out of the system before disciplinary action catches up with them is in many ways an affront to any credible police complaints system. The new clause is an attempt to acknowledge the public concern about the matter and the desire that the police complaints system should, within the limitations, be the best possible. To achieve the best system, starting from scratch, we should give thought to the aspects of the police complaints procedure that could blight it.
<P>
Many serving members of the police service, who would seldom agree with me about policing policy matters, would have some sympathy with the new clause, because it is invidious for good policemen working in difficult circumstances if an officer who has transgressed can walk away before the investigation has been concluded.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The investigation of the possible criminal or disciplinary aspects of the case should be concludedin the interests of the public, of the procedure itself and of the vast majority of police officers who do not recognise that as a legitimate exit for someone who has transgressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I broadly agree with the hon. Gentleman's proposals. Many of us, and many in the Royal Ulster Constabulary, are concerned because police officers who commit an offence that is to be investigated can escape the consequences of their action through retirement or resignation.
<P>
However, I shall not support the new clause as drafted, because there is a happy medium. There are policemen who, having given many years of honourable and decent service to society, find that towards the end of their service they make a mistake or are guitly of an unintentional indiscretion, which is an offence and[Mr. Maginnis]
needs to be properly investigated. I know of two specific examples.
<P>
Although the Minister might consider the merits of new clause 3, he should seek to ensure that the ombudsman has a degree of discretion over whether retirement or voluntary resignation from the force could be acceptable as a resolution to a problem. It should not be, as it has been in the past, a means whereby anybody can escape the consequences of irresponsible, criminal or indisciplined action. I oppose the new clause in its present form, but I ask the Minister to accept the need to give the ombudsman discretionary powers over the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> This is another area that causes concern in the Committee, and in the House in general. In the past I have been involved in it in connection with Home Affairs Select Committee investigations. It was also raised in the context of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.
<P>
The effect of the new clause would be that both criminal and disciplinary investigations into complaints would have to continue when an officer retired or resigned. That is a difficult area, which several jurisdictions have found hard to manage because the interests of justice must be borne in mind in all cases.
<P>
The recent report by the Home Affairs Select Committee on police disciplinary and complaints procedures dealt with a different part of a related issuewhether disciplinary hearings should proceed when officers are on sick leave. However, that does not help us with the matter under discussion. The Hayes report did not issue any guidance on it, either.
<P>
New clause 3 would require the continuation of "criminal and disciplinary aspects" of an investigation, but criminal investigations would not be affected by a person's resigning from the police force; they would continue. The new clause is inaccurate in that respect. If criminal offences were involvedwhich, I assume, would be in relation to the most serious offencesthe new clause would not be needed, as such matters would be dealt with by continuing criminal investigations.
<P>
On the disciplinary front, there is no provision stopping the continuation of a disciplinary investigation. Such investigations can continue. If a police officer has left the force, it is likely that he will no longer co-operate with the investigations. Thus it will be less likely to be brought to a satisfactory conclusion, but that may still be possible in the light of the findings. As the hon. Members for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and for Newry and Armagh said, a disciplinary outcome would be unlikely, which is frustrating and unsatisfactory for the organisation and the complainant.
<P>
Throughout the United Kingdom there are moves to bring about a different style of disciplinary arrangements in the police service, and the new clause would go against that. We must consider the matter in terms of civil liberties. It would be unthinkable for a civl servant to be unable to resign, even if discipline was pending. To remove the ability to change jobs would be difficult. If someone left the force because he saw the writing on the wall, people could argue that it was better for that person to be out of the service, without the need for a lengthy investigation. It could be said that justice had, in a sense, been donealthough not in the way that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh would wish.
<P>
We recognise that there is a problem, but we do not consider that the new clause would solve it. The hon. Gentleman would agree that it is defective in its reference to criminal offences. An investigation can continue, although probably without the co-operation of the police officer involved. However, that distinction could be slightly academic, because the police offier would be unlikely to give complete, open-hearted co-operation anyway. We cannot accept the new clause. The matter is not a huge problem in Northern Ireland, and has tended to receive more publicity in connection with the English police force. Over the past three years, an average of four officers a year have left the RUC while disciplinary action was pending.
<P>
If police officers had left the force and criminal offences were involved, the case would continue. However, as I said earlier there might be virtue in some of them leaving as quickly as possible if that is what would be right for the force.
<P>
There is a small problem: it will seem that justice has not been done if someone can escape discipline charges by fleeing the coop. We cannot support the new clause, but as the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh said, there is dissatisfaction within the RUC on the matter, and many people are looking for a better solution. The search goes on for a better answer, but we do not believe that it is to be found in the new clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I note the points made by the Minister and others. I recognise the defective nature of the new clause, but it was right to raise the matter and to see whether the problem could be dealt with more formally. I accept what the Minister said about the civil liberties of those involved. Someone facing criminal or disciplinary proceedings may be genuinely ill, and should not be prevented from resigning on the grounds of that illness. I accept that one cannot create a just situation by implementing injusticesand it is obvious that criminal proceedings would proceed in any case.
<P>
I am willing to withdraw the new clause. Given our unease on the subject, I ask the Minister to consider more formal ways of dealing with it, that do not suffer from the defective elements in the new clause and would not impinge on people's civil liberties. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<H4><center>Standard of proof in disciplinary proceedings</center></H4>

<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The subject of new clause 4 has been debated almost ad nauseam. I believe that the standard of proof in disciplinary proceedings should be based on the balance of probabilities. That is not the procedure in Scotland, and I understand that it is being considered for England and Wales too. I see no reason why the north of Ireland cannot follow the Scottish lead. A certain niche has been created in Scotland for such legal matters.
<P>
The fact that the standard of proof in disciplinary proceedings is that used in criminal proceedings is itself an anachronism. It is probably rooted in the military court-martial model of an earlier policing service. It has no place in the modern civilian police service, whose members are public servants with no greater moral right then any other public servant to hold on to their jobs or to avoid the penalty if they are guilty of misconduct.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There are those who will defend that standard of proof to the last gasp, and interesting arguments will be made against the new clause. Some see the matter as a debt of honour to the type of policing that they believewith great sinceritythey are defending. However, they do no great service to the police and they risk not freeing it from what I called an anachronism. Almost every other professionagain, I emphasise that policing is a profession and a civilian serviceis subject to the civil standard of proof, which should apply in all disciplinary matters.
<P>
There is value in the new clause. In the north of Ireland, we are creating a system that we hope will be successful for years to come. We should not toddle along behind the English system or evendare I say it?behind the Welsh system. I hope that I can curry favour with the Minister by saying that we should follow the Scottish system and adopt the balance of probabilities as the standard of proof in all disciplinary matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The hon. Gentleman again raises an important matter, and he mentions the situation in Scotland. He did not mention the report of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, which was about police discipline and complaints arrangements. It was published on 15 December and the Government are currently considering its recommendation that the civil standard of proof should apply in police disciplinary cases.
 <P>
Any change from the current standardnamely, what is "beyond reasonable doubt"would apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, because the disciplinary arrangements are essentially the same in each of those jurisdictions. The matter is more appropriately dealt with in disciplinary regulations, because it more directly involves discipline rather than complaints. That approach is contained in the Royal Ulster Constabulary (Discipline and Disciplinary Appeals) Regulations 1988. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary hopes to make an announcement on that matter shortly in the Government's response to the Select Committee's report. I am sure that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, who is a fair man, recognises that it would be premature to take action before my right hon. Friend makes his announcement, and I hope that he will withdraw his new clause. His viewsand those of several other Committee membershave been noted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I had hoped that the Minister would say, "Yes, we have an opportunity to make a decision about the north of Ireland, which will inevitably be followed in England and Wales." It will inevitably be followed because of the recommendation made to the Home Office. It is a small point, but it would be good to leave the Committee this morninggiven the speed at which we are going, we mighthaving broken new ground on not only the police complaints element of the Bill but this issue. Perhaps it is too much to hope for on a day such as this. There is no valid argument against the balance of probabilities as the standard of proof. From what the Minister said, I conclude that the standard of proof will apply in the near future. I would like to it to do so when we finish debating the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McWalter </B>(Hemel Hempstead): I understand the hon. Gentleman's concern, but the matter must be thought through. When, for example, a finding is made on a disciplinary matter, declarations may be wanted on the level of probability that the panel believes has been established. Also, close decisions on probability groundsdecisions made only barely on the balance of probabilitiesmight also affect the actual level of disciplinary sanction that would be used. Such matters need to be considered thoroughly. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that it is appropriate that this be done through the Home Office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> Yes, I would wait to hear what the Home Office had to say. Perhaps the Minister can reassure me that he anticipates a change in the Home Office position. In the type of world in which we now live, I should have thought that, in terms of discipline, balance of probabilities applies to almost every walk of life. I feel that to retain a different standard of proof for police complaints would be to retain some of the worst elements of policing practice, with no advantage to the community or protection for police officers involved in allegations. I look forward to the day when Northern Ireland, England and Wales catch up with Scotland on that basic point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I had anticipated that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyronewhom I am always tempted to call "my honourable Friend" but will not because he gave me no breathing space on the previous two amendments; perhaps he will take the hintmight oppose the new clause. I imagine that there will be opposition to it because of its proposal for a division of powers and its proposal on the powers of the High court.
<P>
The new clause is an attempt to focus thinking about the scope of the ombudsman and suggests that the ombudsman be given the powers of the High court. It suggests that he has powers over the attendance and examination of witnessesincluding the examination of witnesses abroadand the administration of oaths or affirmations and the production of documents. That is a matter that should be examined. I can understand that there may be reluctance to give the ombudsman such powers, but there should be an arrangement to deal with a refusal to adhere to the specified requirements. There should be a relationship between the ombudsman and the High Court, so that witnesses who may be tempted to impede an investigation can be brought to book for their behaviour.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The hon. Gentleman should not have tempted me, as he did at the beginning of his speech. When I am silent it can be assumed that there is a degree of acquiescence, but when I rise to speak, hon. Members should assume that I am about to oppose something. On this occasion, I oppose strenuously what the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve by means of new clause 5.
<P>
We need to be exceedingly careful, when putting in place safeguards for society, that we do not establish an alternative system of justice. The new clause appears to be part of an alternative system of justice, and the Ulster Unionist party is opposed to it. If the matter were of such gravity that the ombudsman considered that all the powers contained in new clause 5 were necessary, he would hand the matter over to allow a criminal investigation to take place.
<P>
It would be disadvantageous to give the ombudsman such wide-ranging and drastic powers. The success of the ombudsman system depends on the almost natural liaison between ordinary members of the public and the ombudsman. He must be accessible and be seen to be providing an immediate facility for complaints by the public against the police. To elevate the ombudsman by giving him the powers that the High Court exercises would remove him almost beyond access by ordinary members of society. For that reason the new clause is dangerous and the Government should resist it strenuously.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> New clause 5 essentially draws on article 14 of the Ombudsman (Northern Ireland) Order 1986, which gives the assembly ombudsman for Northern Ireland evidence-gathering powers for investigations into allegations of misconduct, mainly by Government Departments. Clause 64(2)(i) states that the ombudsman
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"shall be supplied with such information or documents of such description as may be prescribed at such time or in such circumstances as may be prescribed".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That covers new clause 5(1).
<P>
New clause 5(2) deals with the attendance and examination of witnesses. We plan to give the ombudsman's staff constables' powers to enable them to carry out investigations, so that they could, for example, caution or arrest if necessary. Subsections (3) and (4) deal essentially with disclosure and privilege, specific to an ombudsman dealing with civil investigations into government maladministration, and provide that the Department should not have the protections otherwise available, such as privilege for legal documents.
<P>
The Bill does not contain public interest provision other than a guidance-making power. I therefore do not understand why the subsections are necessary, especially as they are aimed at the Crown, which has little more than a spectator role in the matter. The ombudsman's staff will have constabulary powers, while the assembly ombudsman will not. The Independent Commission for Police Complaints has not, as far as we are aware, been unable to have, or been denied, access to any sensitive material that it wants. The hon. Gentleman may have other compelling reasons for pleading that the subsections are necessary and if so, we would be happy to consider them. If he does not, I ask him to withdraw the new clause.
<P>
New clause 6 is unnecessary. It would introduce a new offence of obstructing the ombudsman. Clause 56(4) already provides that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Section 66 applies to a person to whom subsection (3) applies"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, a person employed by the ombudsman
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as it applies to a constable".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 66 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Any person who assaults, resists, obstructs or impedes a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty, shall be guilty of an offence"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and shall be liable
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to a fine, or both".</UL></FONT>
<P>
The powers in the Bill are therefore broader than the hon. Gentleman allows. They cover obstruction, resistance and impeding an investigation and, unlike the new clause, enable arrests to be made without a warrant. The penalties provided in the Bill are more severe than those under the order. Clause 66 is therefore sufficient, and I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> As I said when I moved the new clause, I am aware that many people have reservations about the link between the ombudsman and the courts. I share that view in regard to new clauses 5 and 6. The minister made a compelling case for clause 66 and its potential. In view of the arguments that he has put so cohesively, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>".In circumstances where an investigation on behalf of the Ombudsman concludes that a complaint is upheld but that it is not possible for reasons of identification or other cause to pursue the matter further the Ombudsman shall issue a memorandum to that effect and copy it to the appropriate disciplinary authority and to the complainant.".[Mr. Mallon.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a second time.
<P>
New clause 7 relates to what is probably one of the most difficult elements in the complaints procedure against the police, when it is accepted by the Chief Constable and by colleagues in the police service that an offence has been committed, but, for identification or other reasons, the matter cannot be pursued further. That probably leaves a greater residue of resentment among complainants than any other factor. I have seen it at first hand and I know how debilitating it can be. I am aware of certain cases at the moment that will probably never be fully resolved, for that exact reason. The new clause is an attempt to ensure that a case does not stop because it runs up against that problem, but can be concluded.
<P>
We had a short debate about the way in which procedure can be concluded by illness, resignation or early retirement, and in many ways the Bill and the procedure will fail if there are many such circumstances. If the ombudsman issues a memorandum to the effect that it was not possible to reach a conclusion because of an identification problem or for a similar reason, the memorandum should be copied to the appropriate disciplinary authority and the complainant.
<P>
It is probably the most difficult and debilitating type of situation, and it does happen. I am aware of one case in which the vice-chairman of my party is involved at present. I do not want to go into the detail of it, but there is no doubt that his arm was broken in circumstances that did not justify action by the police service. The problem is that the person who did it will probably never be identified. The people involved, the good policemen who were there that night and who also could not identify the culprit, the complainant and everybody connected with the occurrence will experience a sense of "We told you so". The frustration is bad for the procedure. I shall leave it there.
<P>
The new clause is simply an attempt to round off complaints rather than leave them hanging in mid-air. If that is done through the type of memorandum proposed, at least they have a conclusion, even if it is not the one that justice demands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh puts a cogent and compelling argument in support of new clause 7. However, my party is opposed to such a vague insert in the Bill. There must be corporate justice as well as justice for individuals. No police servicewhether a constabulary in Great Britain or Northern Irelandcan allow avenues to be exploited to its overall detriment. That applies in this case to the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
<P>
In a riot, complaints may be made by people who are attacking the police, but their injuries may not stem from any direct action by the police. Injuries may arise from running away in the face of police action to quell a riotin other words, people can injure themselves as a result of the mel\aee rather than through the activities of an individual policeman.
<P>
Some people could make an allegation, which at first sight appears to be just, but which is non-existent and unfair to a constabulary. Including this new clause in a police Bill, without requiring any onus of proofor, rather, without any proof having been obtainedcould by inference reflect badly on the good name and integrity of the constabulary. That is why we should reject the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I shall deal first with the points raised by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. Currently, where evidence is found of wrongdoing by a police officer, it is acknowledged, even if no officer or officers are identified. That will also apply under the ombudsman.
<P>
As to the issue raised by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, currently the appropriate disciplinary authority, which may be the Chief Constable or the Police Authority, is informed when a complaint has been substantiated but the officer has not been identified. The complainant is also advised of those circumstances.
<P>
The new clause is unnecessary. As we said when we debated amendment No. 65, which was also tabled by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, the regulation power will be used to provide for complainants to be notified of the outcome of cases. They should be told the outcome, even when it is not conclusive in terms of identifying specific officers. The regulations therefore take account of the matter. With that assurance, I hope[Mr. Worthington]
that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh will withdraw the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I understand some of the points made by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. There is validity in both points of viewin the thinking behind the new clause, and in the opposition to it. Perhaps the two points of view can be expressed only through regulations.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I want to ensure that we achieve the best possible legislation. We do not want a Bill that needs the addition of occasional changes through regulations. We face an uncertain future, but we should at least have the certainty that in this most sensitive areaand it is probably more sensitive in the north of Ireland than anywhere elsewe have the best possible set of arrangements.
<P>
I accept the arguments that have been made, especially the Minister's point about regulations and, in the light of his remarks, I reluctantly beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
On the face of it, the clause contains similar provisions to the ones that I proposed in other new clauses and would meet with the same reaction from hon. Members in relation to the courts. However, if something causes such a reaction, perhaps it contains a germ of truth.
<P>
The ombudsman, the parliamentary commissioner for complaints, has the power to make awards and to recommend the amount of compensation. I can understand people's reaction to the granting of such powers to an ombudsman. However, the person given the award retains the right of appeal to the courts, and the Chief Constable and the Police Authority can appeal against the award.
<P>
The ombudsman should be a person of stature, with the power and the control of investigation that is appropriate to that position. He would be the best person, therefore, to assess the validity and genuineness of any claim for compensation, or the amount of compensation that is commensurate with the breach of regulation. Surely that makes sense.
<P>
If the new clause were accepted, it might bring remarkable advantages in five years' time. We have had some interesting debates about vexatious claims. They occur with great regularity in the north of Ireland. One of the most effective ways to deal with them would be to have them adjudicated by someone who has the independence of an ombudsman, who has been through the police complaints procedure at every stage of an investigation, who knows the background to it, and who will not be too easily convinced, as sometimes happens in the courts.
<P>
There may be circumstances when someone pursuing a claim vexatiously will think twice about it, knowing that the ombudsman is involved and that the opportunities for gilding the lily are not so obvious as they might be in court. We have heard consistently over the years that police complaints have been made for malicious, vexatious and unsubstantiated reasons, many of which were just to obtain compensation. Some werethere is no doubt about that. The sums of money paid out in Northern Ireland in claims that have gone through the courts show that there are problems. With due respect to the legal profession, in such a case it may seem easier for someone to be represented in court than before an ombudsman, although we would know the case and the procedures in detail. I am not saying that anyone in the legal profession takes such cases for financial gainfar from itbut the process costs the state a huge amount of money in compensation and representation.
<P>
I know the arguments that will be made against my new clause, but I predict that we shall see the day when there will be an arrangement akin to my proposal. The ombudsman's office will be used confidently as a means of determining compensation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The new clause would provide that when criminal or disciplinary procedures had been dealt with, the ombudsman would consider the matter of compensation for the complainant and, if the circumstances warranted it, he might direct the Police Authority to make such compensatory payments to the complainant as he considered appropriate. We recognise the importance of the issue, which is a matter of genuine concern. The new clause would also provide for the compainant to appeal to the courts if he were dissatisfied with the level of award, and the police or Police Authority could appeal to the courts if they objected to the level of the award directed by the ombudsman. That brings us to some of the complexities involved.
<P>
It is worth noting what Dr. Hayes recommended in paragraph 17.25 of his report. He accepted that there should be limited levels of compensation when a compainant was out of pocket in pursuing his or her complaint, when there had been measurable loss resulting from the complaint, or when there had been measurable loss resulting from the police action complained of, for example, the complaint had been substantiated. Dr. Hayes said that the ombudsman should, in appropriate cases, at his or her discretion, recommend to the Chief Constable the payment of an ex gratia sum; that would be sufficient authority for payment. Dr. Hayes anticipated that the sums would be modest, perhaps up to the limit payable in the small claims court. He also recommended that the ombudsman should be able to pay necessary travelling and other expenses. Clause 64 enables the ombudsman to reimburse a complainant for expenses incurred and compensate him for the loss of his time. Dr. Hayes recommended that compensation should be payable where there had been measurable loss, but he did not recommend that the ombudsman should be able to make compensation payments per se.
<P>
The issue is important and we have taken legal advice on it. We intend to implement, through guidance, Dr. Hayes's recommendation on compensating specific loss. New clause 8 goes much further than his recommendations. We are sympathetic to the introduction of a wider compensation provision for substantiated cases, with a simple procedure. Although we do not undertake to introduce that, we are considering it. The argument of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh has some appealalthough, as I said earlier, the issue is complex. We shall tell hon. Members our conclusions on Report. I hope that with that assurance, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I thank the Minister for his observations. I realise the Government's legal obligations in the matter. The new clause attempted to focus on potential compensation arrangements. Locking together the compensation and complaints procedures would afford substantial advantages to everyone, not least the police. There is potential for development along those lines, although it is difficult to argue for that now prior to the establishment of the ombudsman's office and in the face of legal advice. I have noted that the Minister will examine wider compensation procedures and I look forward to his observations, which I understand will be made without commitment, on Report. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I compliment the Committee on its rapid progress. The amendment removes the requirement that the Bill places on the Police Authority to maintain a public order committee and is consequential to changes made to the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998, which removed the requirement for the Secretary of State to consult the Police Authority's public order committee before issuing a banning order under section 12 of that Act. It was inappropriate to involve the Police Authority in the decision-making process for banning orders, as the interested community is now formally represented by the Parades Commission.
<P>
It was also inappropriate to make the Police Authority party to a banning decision, when the authority would be required to hold the Chief Constable to account for the actions of his force in enforcing such a decision.

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The amendment is modelled on the Ombudsman (Northern Ireland) Order 1996. If such arrangements are appropriate for the Northern Ireland ombudsman, they are surely appropriate for the police[Mr. Mallon]
ombudsman who, it could be argued, has as much need for them to carry out his duties without let or hindrance.
<P>
The police ombudsman should have security of tenure because that is an important safeguard for the office and, consequently, would enhance the independence and public confidence in the police complaints system. I anticipate some of the arguments that will be put against the proposal and I understand some of the implications in terms of fair employment and other aspects. If nothing else, it is worth hearing the reasons why such an amendment, under which the ordinary ombudsman or the commissioner for police complaints in Northern Ireland is appointed, should not apply to this ombudsman.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The effect of amendment No. 63 and the related amendments is the same and, with the leave of the Committee, I shall discuss them together. The effect is to appoint the ombudsman to office until retirement, subject to good behaviour. The ombudsman could then be removed from office only by Her Majesty, following a recommendation from a panel appointed by Parliament.
<P>
Such a panel could be assembled only on the application of the Secretary of State to inquire into any concerns that the Secretary of State might have about the ombudsman's good behaviour in the execution of his duties. The appointment of an individual to the office of ombudsman to retirement would be contrary to the recommendations of Lord Nolan, who was appointed to examine current concerns about standards of conduct of all holders of public office. The method of appointment that is proposed in the Bill and the conditions of tenure of office are in line with the code of practice for public appointment procedures, produced by Sir Leonard Peach, the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Northern Ireland, as well as in Great Britain.
<P>
We considered the matter carefully because we anticipated such a debate. We consulted with Sir Leonard Peach on the issue and, recently, I discussed the point in detail with Dr. Hayes. The Bill provides for the maximum term because it can be justified, particularly as it is renewable. The provision combines a reasonable security of tenure with regard to good management of such matters and best practice elsewhere.
 <P>
A couple of public appointments are made on the basis of tenure, subject to good behaviourfor example, those of the assembly ombudsman and the Chief Electoral Officer for Northern Ireland. However, the origins of those provisions date from a long way back. It has been the practice in recent legislation to make appointments for fixed terms. A recent tendency is to provide three-year tenuresfor example, for service on the Criminal Cases Review Commission, for the chairmen of the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights, the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Fair Employment Commission and the Commission for Racial Equality. Those are also the usual terms for the chairmen of the Independent Commission for Police Complaints.
<P>
Sir Leonard Peach said that three years was about right, and that the total period of service should be six to eight years. The Bill provides for a five-year tenure, which is renewable for a further five years, so we have been as generous as possible with tenure.
<P>
If we establish an open public appointments procedure and a five-year tenure, the overriding principle of selection on merit will ensure that the individual who occupies the post is the best person for the job.
<P>
Amendment No. 63 would affect the proposals for the possible removal of the ombudsman. The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh would like a panel to deal with that. Amendment No. 12 also tackles that point. It would remove the Secretary of State's power to require the ombudsman to retire in the interests of efficiency or effectiveness.
<P>
Time and again, we have said that the ombudsman must beand must be seen to beindependent. The Committee is unanimous on that. That requires the ombudsman's appointment to be secure, but it does not mean that the ombudsman should remain in post if he or she does not perform effectively or efficiently.
<P>
Schedule 3(1)(7) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State may call upon the Ombudsman to retire ... in the interests of efficiency or effectiveness".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I stress the word "may". A similar provision applies to the Chief Constable of the RUC, chief constables in England and Wales, and the director general of the National Criminal Intelligence Service. They are all appointed on fixed-term contracts. That should also apply to a single post holder of the importance of the police ombudsman. If he or she is inefficient or ineffective, the Secretary of State should act to protect the credibility of the office.
<P>
The Bill gives ample scope for the ombudsman to appeal against a call to retire. It also provides the power to remove an individual who manifestly fails to carry out the requisite duties, even when the conduct is not criminal. Schedule 3(1) is in the interests of the public; it also protects the ombudsman's office. I therefore, hope that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We could now come to amendment No. 14, but in the absence of the hon. Members who tabled amendments Nos. 14 and 15, and of any hon. Member who wishes to move them, we shall proceed to amendments Nos. 13, with which we had intended to discuss amendments Nos. 61, 104 and 62. In the absence of the hon. Members who tabled amendment No. 13, perhaps we could move on.
<P>
Does the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh want to move amendment No. 61?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 61, in page 43, line 11, leave out from "Ombudsman" to "for" and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may enter into arrangements with the Chief Constable".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 104, in page 43, line 11, leave out "shall" and insert "may".
<P>
No. 62, in page 43, leave out lines 20 and 21.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I am mindful of the time, but amendment No. 61 is the most important amendment that I have tabled. The Bill is designed to protect the independence of the ombudsman, yet the schedule determines that, by law, the ombudsman and the Chief Constable
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"shall enter into arrangements for members of the police force to be engaged for a period of temporary service with the Ombudsman."</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not worried by the use of the police service, but by the use of the imperative, "shall".
<P>
The amendment would change "shall" to "may". It is straightforward. The consistent wish of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee is that the independence of the ombudsman should be retained. How can that be done if the law tells the ombudsman who he may or may not employ or use to carry out an investigation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Amendment No. 104 is in line with amendment No. 61, as it would change the word "shall" to "may". The sense is the same. We would like the Minister to explain why the word "shall" is used in the Bill. In the final analysis, we hope that it is the Government's intention that a strong ombudsman's office should be capable of conducting all inquiries, with staff appointed personally by the ombudsman. There would then be no need for recourse to the police or the Chief Constable. We contend that the word "may" is strong enough to enable those arrangements to take place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We have made such rapid progress that we cannot, as we had hoped, deal later with some of the points raised this morning.
<P>
I have asked the parliamentary draftsmen to consider the wording, because our intentions may be misinterpretedeven by those who advise the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. We do not mean the Bill to say what others interpret it to say. It provides a framework and an arrangement for pay and conditions. As suggested by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, we can return to the question on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I thank you, Mr. Jones, and your co-Chairmen, Miss Widdecombe and Mr. Atkinson, on behalf of the Committee. We have had useful and constructive debates. Several arguments have been developed, and we shall return to them on Report. We have spent about 42 hours in Committee, which is a good example of how a Bill of this nature should be considered. We have not had many late-night sittings, and all our debates have been constructive.
<P>
I pay tribute to you, Mr. Jones, and to your fellow Chairmen, to the Clerks who assist you, and to those who assisted me and my colleagues to make such tremendous progress this morning. I thank all members of the Committee for their help and forbearance.
<P>
<H5>1.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I, too, thank you, Mr. Jones, and your fellow Chairmen for the way in which you have conducted our proceedings. I thank the Hansard reporters for the accuracy of their reports and for the way in which they dealt with matters generally. I compliment the civil servants who had advised the Ministerthey are not officially here, but they are visibleon the courtesy that they extended to me on a number of occasions. I pay tribute also to my hon. Friends, who have given the Government a fairly good run for their money. We will chase them further on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I concur.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Bill, as amended, to be reported.
