</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> With your leave, Mrs. Dunwoody, I will explain the nature of the proposed amendments, together with the impact of clause 1. That will avoid the need for me to speak again to clause 1 stand part. The amendments will make sense only if I explain the purpose and intent of clause 1.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Chair highly approves of clarity and brevity. I am sure that the Minister will bear both those points in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I shall do my very best.
<P>
The Bill's purpose is to amend existing legislation to reduce the number of adjournments in minor summary offences, principally traffic offences, in the magistrates courts. Section 12 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 allows the police to issue a summons for minor summary offences. The summons will include what is known as a statement of facts, which is a concise summary of the facts supporting the accusation. The summons will also include forms describing the procedural steps to be taken by the recipient of the summons.
<P>
On receipt of the documentation, defendants have three options. First, they may plead not guilty by post or in person at the magistrates court. A date will be set for trial, which will proceed later.
<P>
Secondly, the defendants may choose to plead guilty by post or in person. As long as the statement of facts with the prescribed form was issued with the summons, the case may proceed. If no such statement was served with the summons for any reason, the case cannot proceed under the section 12 procedure of the 1980 Act, except where the defendant is unequivocally willing to plead guilty. No guilty plea can be accepted and the case must be proved in full. The documents or evidence to prove the case must satisfy the stringent provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1967. Detailed statements must be set out and prepared in full or witnesses must come to court to give evidence. A further effect is that the Crown Prosecution Service must take responsibility for prosecuting the case even though it is not actually being contested.
<P>
The harm that the Bill seeks to address lies in the third option. It is very common that someone who has been summoned simply fails to respond or appear in court. The difficulty is that the 1980 Act does not allow the statement of facts alone to be sufficient documentation on which to try an absent defendant. All the documentation has been sent out, but the court has no knowledge of whether it was received by a defendant who simply chooses to ignore the summons.
<P>
The court must assume that the charge is contested if there is no response. The court must therefore take steps to obtain sufficient information to try what is apparently a contested case. Where the defendant ignores the information sent to him or her, the court is forced to treat the case as if it were a not guilty, disputed case. That is essentially the harm that this modest legislation, especially through clause 1 seeks to address.
<P>
The Bill will allow witness statements to be served on the defendant with the summons as an alternative to the statement of fact. It will permit someone who is in receipt of a summary or of a full statement to be dealt with by the court, even though he has simply failed to respond to an invitation by the court to attend to be dealt with.
<P>
Clause 1 essentially establishes that either document will be satisfactory for the court if a guilty plea is entered by post. If the defendant fails to respond to the summons, the witness statement--the full details--can then be used to prove the case on the listed day in the defendant's absence. That will save the considerable procedural inconvenience of having to transfer the case to the CPS to deal with it as if there were a not guilty plea. It will therefore save considerable time and expense.
<P>
That is the state of play as revealed by the Bill as originally drafted. If we agreed the Bill without the proposed amendments, it would mean in practice that the full section 9 statement--the full details proving the case--would have to be read out. However, the Bill is designed to save time and to avoid the inconvenience of further adjournment. Reading out the full statement in each case obviously might be a time-consuming exercise. It might be necessary even when the defendant has unequivocally demonstrated to the court that he or she intends to plead guilty.
<P>
Having attempted to explain, I hope, clearly and briefly, the impact of clause 1 as drafted, I should like to turn to the amendments. Several practitioners in the field have brought the Government's attention to the problem of clause 1 as drafted. The Government have carefully considered what practitioners have said, and believe that the amendments will further improve the procedure that the Bill establishes.
<P>
When a case comes to court, the amendments will allow the court clerk to give an oral account of, or to summarise, the witness statement that has been served on the defendant, if the defendant has written to the court to say that he wants to plead guilty. Perhaps I should explain why reading out a witness statement might be a time-consuming exercise. Inevitably, reading a full witness statement will take longer than reading a statement of fact, because it is a thorough and detailed account of what a witness saw, heard and did. It will have been prepared as an instrument of proof in the event of a not guilty plea for proving the case in the absence of a defendant who fails to respond.
<P>
For example, a speeding case statement will include details of all steps taken to check the accuracy of a calibrated speedometer in a police vehicle. If there were, for example, 100 speeding cases before the court on a particular day, it would be necessary to read out the same details for each of the 100 cases. Clearly, the evidence is technically necessary to rebut any suggestion that the equipment is faulty, but such detail is not necessary in a guilty plea case. When many similar cases are dealt with on the same occasion, the time taken can be excessive. It is important to find a way to short-circuit the problem.
<P>
The problem also occurs, for example, with statements for the offence of overloading a vehicle. The statements may contain lists of the permitted and actual weight for each of the several axles of a heavy goods vehicle. If a person admits that he overloaded a vehicle, it should not be necessary to read out in exhaustive detail all the permitted and actual weights.
<P>
The Bill as originally drafted would undoubtedly reduce the number of adjournments, and therefore save the court's time. However, there is a risk, which has been drawn to our attention, that each guilty plea could take longer than it does at present if each witness statement were read out verbatim. It may not take long to recite the full statement in a single case, but the cumulative effect in a busy court of reading out each and every statement in full could reduce the time and costs that the new procedures would otherwise save.
<P>
The amendments stipulate what is to be read out to a court by the court clerk in guilty plea cases. What is read out will depend on whether the summons is accompanied by a statement of facts or by a witness statement. When a summons is served with a statement of facts, the court clerk will simply read out that statement to the court, as is done at present.
<P>
When the summons is served with a witness statement, the clerk will read that statement aloud to the court, unless the court gives a direction that the clerk should give an oral account of so much of the statement as is not read aloud. The requirement for the court to give a direction means that it will always control the proceedings and that the court clerk may not summarise or give an oral account of what is in the statement without the court's express authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Garnier </B>(Harborough): Before I discuss the amendments, Mrs. Dunwoody, I must welcome you to the Committee. I am sure that our deliberations will be short--and a good deal shorter than the deliberations that the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy) will have with the five absent Labour Committee members. The fact that five--and, at one stage, six--Labour Members felt that it was inconvenient to attend the Committee shows that complacency has reached a new level: or perhaps I should say a new depth. We are altering the law and we are, I hope, doing so seriously.
<P>
On Second Reading, the Lord Chancellor said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``These are simple and practical procedural reforms''.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 24 July 1997; Vol. 581, c. 1519.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. and learned Gentleman may not quote what was said in the House of Lords, but he can, of course, summarise what was said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am grateful, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
The Lord Chancellor said that these were simple and practical procedural reforms, and he imagined that they would be uncontroversial and should therefore receive general acceptance. I am not sure whether he envisaged that the Labour party would fail to attend Committee in sufficient numbers to ensure the Bill's easy passage through the House. Perhaps Labour Members failed to attend because the Bill, which the new Labour Government are passing, was proposed by the previous Conservative Government. I helped the Minister after the Second Reading debate by saying that we should support the Bill, and I am happy to assist him again this morning. I hope that it eases his worries somewhat to know that although the Government are now in a minority in Committee, we shall not oppose the amendment.
<P>
I am grateful to my hon. Friends and to the hon. Members for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) and for Colchester (Mr. Russell)--who, I believe, is sitting on his first Standing Committee--for accepting the duty to attend the Standing Committee. We are doing the Government's work for them, because Labour Members are not prepared to attend the Committee to do their own work.
<P>
The amendment is uncontroversial--it will clear up a minor potential defect. Will any statement that is summarised, and not read out in full in court, be available to the public and, in particular, to the press? In civil proceedings, if a statement is not read out or a witness does not appear in court to give evidence in chief, other than through a written statement, that statement is made available to the public with the leave of the court. What does the Minister intend to do about the public availability of statements relied on and summarised?
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am grateful to hear that no summary of a witness statement will be permitted without express authority. I may have misheard the Minister, but I assume that the express authority of the court means that of the stipendiary magistrate or the three lay justices. In those circumstances, public access to justice and to what goes on in court should not be materially impaired.
<P>
The Minister is fortunate that we are feeling co-operative this morning and that we will not force a vote now that he is in a temporary minority in the Committee. Even the Labour party may come to feel the stresses and strains of minority government. That time may not be too far away.
<P>
I thank you once again, Mrs. Dunwoody, for chairing our proceedings. I trust that we will not be delayed for long.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): As a new boy, I do not know whether I should welcome you to the Chair or not, Mrs. Dunwoody, but I do, anyway.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is a doubtful pleasure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> What concerns us lies in the generality of the Bill. I should like the Minister to elucidate on the issue of the presumption of guilt if a defendant does nothing. What provision is there in statute to draw to a defendant's attention the effects of ignoring summonses? What is the situation for people such as members of the armed forces, who often travel, or for those who, in this increasingly cosmopolitan world, live and work elsewhere? Those are great concerns. I hope that the Bill addresses them and ensures that people will not be unfairly convicted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins (Surrey Heath):</B> Like other hon. Members, I welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody. I want to make a brief point to which I hope the Minister will respond. Will he reassure us on what happens when a court clerk summarises a witness statement? Like the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Lock), who is also on the Committee, I practised at the Bar in the West Midlands for several years. In fact, the hon. Gentleman and I are former members of the same chamber, although at different times, which lends an air of cross-party unity--a nice symmetry--to our proceedings.
<P>
From my experience in the West Midlands, I became aware of a small minority of court clerks who sometimes did not summarise matters accurately. The Minister may also be aware of that problem. The vast majority of justices' clerks are extremely responsible and do their jobs superbly. All members of the Bar and the solicitors' profession have cause to be grateful to them, as do the magistrates. However, I am slightly worried about the tiny minority of court clerks who sometimes do not summarise well.
<P>
I think that hon. Members of all parties would like to include a safeguard which would require court clerks to check their summaries carefully. Perhaps there should be a reserve power for magistrates to intervene if, on inspection of the papers, they believe that their clerk has not summarised accurately. In the quicker procedure--I approve of the idea of saving court time--magistrates should be able to check a summary because it is, after all, a magistrates court. I would not regret a suggestion that the court clerk is able to dominate proceedings because when that happens, mistakes and miscarriages of justice can occur. I am sure that the Minister will agree that, even on guilty pleas, an accurate summary is vital.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Hurst </B>(Braintree): On the face of it, this is not a controversial Bill; I shall seek to proceed accordingly.
<P>
The evil to be remedied is that which the Minister and other hon. Members have pointed to--people's failure to respond to the issue of a summons. If the Bill seeks to deal with that problem, certain aspects of the Bill and the amendments thereto cause me concern.
<P>
Clause 1(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In subsection (7) of that section''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which refers to the Magistrates' Court Act 1980--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for paragraph (a) there is substituted''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The difficulty is that before one reaches paragraph (a) in the Magistrates' Courts Act, clause 12(4) of that Act states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Before accepting the plea of guilty and convicting the accused''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As a result of the use of those words before the substitution of paragraph (a), the purport of the legislation is to deal only with cases in which a guilty plea has been entered. If that interpretation of the legislation is correct, the Bill does not remedy the evil that it is intended to remedy--the failure to respond to a summons. If my understanding is correct, I would invite my hon. Friend to consider further amendments to the Bill on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell </B>(Colchester): I should like--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It would be helpful if hon. Members who wish to speak were to rise in their places, which is how the Chair knows they wish to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Russell:</B> I am much obliged, Mrs. Dunwoody. This is the first time that I have been a member of a Committee, and I hope that it will be in order for me to speak to clauses 2 and 3--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No. I have called Government amendments Nos. 1 and 2, which are the amendments we will discuss at this time. Hon. Members will be allowed to speak on other clauses when we reach the relevant parts of the Bill. I am sorry if it is a little harsh when the Chair reminds members of the Committee of procedure, but sometimes even the most eminent people get it wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> First, I am grateful to the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) for his support on this matter--
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I take it that the Minister is particularly grateful this morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am particularly grateful this morning. As ever, I have cause to admire the hon. and learned Gentleman's optimism.
<P>
I shall respond to the specific points that have been made in relation to the amendments and the impact of clause 1. The summary will be available to the public because it will be read out in court, which will assist observers in the court. The express authority of the court will be required before the procedure can be adopted, which is set out specifically in Government amendment No. 2.
<P>
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon had concerns about the generality of the Bill, and the need to draw to defendants' attention the consequences of not responding to a summons. He is right--the consequences should be vigorously set out in the documentation. The hon. Gentleman is taking us a little further than the Bill makes necessary, but I anticipate that the changes that the Bill will introduce will be drawn to defendants' attention by the form of words sent out when they are summoned. Defedants would thereby be aware that their failure to respond would allow the court to proceed in their absence with the--if I may put it this way--abbreviated procedure that we are contemplating this morning. I anticipate that there will be a warning to the defendant that the matter can be dealt with in his absence--which is what most concerns the hon. Gentleman--and that the new procedure is likely to deal with the matter more rapidly than hitherto. The primary purpose of the Bill is to avoid the necessity for a series of adjournments before the matter is resolved.
<P>
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) emphasised the importance of checking the summaries by court clerks and I suspect that he has experience of such matters. It would be difficult in each and every case for each and every chairman of a magistrates' court to check precisely the summaries that are read out by the court clerk. The experience of most magistrates is that if a clerk cuts corners in a series of cases, that will become self-evident and I anticipate that in such circumstances each and every case would be checked to ensure that the clerk is doing his job properly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Does the Minister accept that there is a duty on the prosecutor to ensure that the facts presented to the court, whether in summary form or in a full statement, are accurate? My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath highlighted the need to emphasise the duty on prosecutors. Will the Minister ensure that when and if the Bill is enacted, the Crown Prosecution Service, the police and others in magistrates courts are made abundantly clear of their duty to ensure that there is no corner-cutting or slackness in the accurate presentation of summaries and facts?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for setting out the position so well. The court's approval of the procedure is necessary in the wider interests of justice. Although there is obviously a duty on the prosecutor to ensure that the summary of facts presented by the clerk is accurate, I anticipate that the problem to which the hon. Member for Surrey Heath referred concerns the possibility of a prosecutor cutting corners, a clerk going along with that in the interests of administrative efficiency and with no regard to the interests of a defendant who is not present in court and who then could receive a stiffer sentence on the basis of an unfair summary of the facts which no one has properly investigated. I hope that I have summarised the hon. Gentleman's anxieties accurately. It is important that the court should supervise the procedure as set out in amendment No. 2 and I hope that that is a sufficient explanation of the safeguard in the amendments.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Hurst) raised some technical points on the nature of the amendments. I learned on Second Reading that he knows the subject from detailed practical experience and I am sufficiently concerned about his comments to examine carefully the words in the existing statute and to introduce technical amendments on Report if his research has identified problems. I hope that that undertaking is sufficient to deal with the technical matters that he raised.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 2, in page 1, line 23, leave out from beginning to first `the' in line 25 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(7A) Where the court gives a direction under subsection (7)(aa) above the court shall cause an account to be given orally before the court by the clerk of the court of so much of any statement as is not read aloud.
<P>
(7B) Whether or not a direction under paragraph (aa) of subsection (7) above is given in relation to any statement served as mentioned in that paragraph'.--[Mr. Hoon.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 1, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Evidence of previous convictions in motoring cases</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Clause 2 also simplifies the process of securing evidence before the court in summary and road traffic cases. It allows previous convictions for endorsable offences to be proved on the evidence of Drive and Vehicle Licensing Agency computer records for defendants convicted in their absence who have not forwarded their driving licences to the court.
<P>
This problem compares with that in clause 1. Where someone who simply ignores a summons is convicted at the end of the process, including adjournments if needed, the court does not have a driving licence available. Although the endorsement details on all licences are replicated on the DVLA computer print-out provided to the court, they cannot be used in the absence of a licence unless the defendant is served with at least seven days notice of the court's intention to cite previous endorsements.
<P>
That leads to an absurd situation in which everyone knows the previous convictions and endorsements, but the case has to be adjourned for permission to be obtained to deal with those previous convictions in the way that they could have been dealt with if the licence had been available. That is a considerable waste of time and public resources.
<P>
Clause 2 is designed to deal with the problem by removing the requirement to notify a convicted offender of the court's intention to take into account previous summary convictions as detailed in the offender's driver record as held by the DVLA. Where the offender fails to respond to the orignial summons or to deliver a driving licence to the court, magistrates will be able to take previous endorsements into account without adjourning to serve notice of their intention to do so. It is a modest change but it will significantly improve magistrates court procedure.
<P>
Unless anyone specifically requires it, I shall not go through the details of subsections (1) and (2) which are essentially technical and consequential provisions.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody, for what happened earlier.
<P>
Does the Bill anticipate additional problems at courts in future when there will be fewer of them because of closures? Does it anticipate an increased work load? Are the Government getting legislation in first so that the courts can cope with the non-appearance of people who will not go to court because the courts are too distant?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hurst:</B> The hon. Member for Colchester is a good trier. I, too, may wish at some point to raise the prospective and ill-advised closure of magistrates courts at Braintree, but this is not the occasion on which to do so.
<P>
Clause 2 is welcome but, it is not a panacea. Those who have practised in the magistrates courts will know that print-outs from Swansea are not tablets of stone that can be absolutely relied on. Certain defendants convicted and sentenced in their absence--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that that bleeper is outside the Committee Room.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hurst:</B> Indeed, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
If a defendant believes himself to be wrongly or harshly sentenced on the basis of an incorrect print-out, there is a mechanism by which he may bring the matter back before the courts. He may be terribly unfortunate. If his name happens to be Jason Smith or J. Smith and the date of birth is not quite right, quite a few J. Smiths will come up for that incorrect date of birth and some will give no trace. If the court proceeds on that basis, the J. Smith in question will be very fortunate. The clause may bring disadvantages to the CPS and advantages to the defendant.
<P>
Unless the trouble is taken to issue a warrant, some people will never turn up. The courts have the discretion to issue warrants if they are not satisfied with print-outs. We can normally rely on the common sense of stipendiary and lay justices.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Eleanor Laing (Epping Forest):</B> I agree with the Minister's comment that the clause will make magistrates courts run more smoothly--that is a perfectly fair aim--but they do so when defendants do not appear. Does he agree that, where possible, it is preferable for defendants to appear at magistrates courts?
<P>
I want to pursue the comments of the hon. Member for Colchester, although that may raise wider issues. There is a significant consensus in my constituency that the proposed closure of courts will make it much more difficult for people to attend, especially when a court that takes over from three courts, for example, and which serves a large area, is situated where there are no bus services. It is important for people who do not have driving licences, for whatever reason, to use public transport to get to a magistrates court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I have previously had reason to admire the ingenuity of the hon. Member for Colchester. As we speak, a press release is no doubt winging its way to the Colchester gleaner describing the hon. Gentleman's sterling efforts to stick up for the local magistrates court. I assure him that we made our proposals not in anticipation of an increased work load but in recognition of problems that have previously arisen. They involve technical changes that will allow for the increased efficiency of the courts today; they are not specifically designed to deal with anticipated problems.
<P>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree for his support. My comments do not need repeating for the benefit of the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing), save to say that I entirely agree with her that it is always preferable for defendants to appear. Sadly, however, not all defendants take that opportunity. Indeed, if they did so in relation to relatively minor motoring offences, the courts would be in considerable difficulty. It can be advantageous for people to plead guilty by post. Perhaps the hon. Lady is seeking a compromise: perhaps we should not encourage everyone to attend at court, but we should encourage people to respond to a summons. The most effective way for them to do so--assuming that they accept the details contained in the summons--is for them to say that they agree with them and allow the court to proceed on the basis of the guilty plea that they enter.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to issue warrant for arrest of accused after conviction where disqualification proposed</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> This is a further procedural refinement to the way that summary road traffic offences are dealt with, and it relates to the disqualification of defendants from driving.
<P>
Magistrates courts may disqualify a defendant from driving in his absence by following certain procedural steps, although the bench may wish to compel him to attend court to hear the reasons for the disqualification. The relevant powers are contained in section 13 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980.
<P>
When a defendant is convicted following sworn oral evidence from witnesses, a warrant can be issued. Increasingly, such cases are decided using section 9 written statements, which I mentioned earlier, and which are served on a defendant prior to his trial. They are mostly admissable to the same extent as oral evidence, but they do not meet the section 13 requirement that information should be substantiated on oath. That means that at present courts must secure the attendance of a police officer to substantiate the information, whether singly or in batches. That wastes police time and court time and it is often entirely meaningless because the officer may have no personal knowledge of the matters about which he swears. We are trying to modernise our court procedures, which currently assume that every case is contested and can be sworn to by an officer with personal knowledge of the facts. When magistrates courts deal with a large volume of relatively minor motoring offences, in practice that is not the case.
<P>
Similar difficulties arise when a defendant has pleaded guilty in person on a previous occasion, and was convicted without consideration of the evidence, or when the court has accepted a written guilty plea under section 12 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980. The Bill amends section 13 of the 1980 Act, so that in the case of a convicted person, the court can issue a warrant for a disqualification hearing without the need to substantiate information on it. That removes the need for a police officer to give up valuable time to attend a court to swear to details of which he or she may or may not have personal knowledge. We hope to free that officer to pursue those who need to be brought before the courts because they have committed offences.
<P>

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I want briefly to ask the Minister a few questions about the appointed day--that is to say, when the Bill will come into force. Clause 5(2) states that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This Act, except this section, shall not come into force until such day as the Lord Chancellor may by order made by statutory instrument appoint.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister give us some idea of when he hopes that the Bill will achieve Royal Assent? Will he explain briefly clause 5(3)(a), which allows the Lord Chancellor to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``appoint different days for different purposes''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What does the Minister imagine that the Lord Chancellor envisages complies with paragraph (a)? Will he speculate on what the word ``savings'' in clause 5(3)(b) means to the Lord Chancellor? Subsection (3)(b) states that an order under subsection (2)
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may include such supplemental or transitional provisions or savings as appear to the Lord Chancellor to be necessary or expedient.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The only person allowed to do the looking, the noticing or the appearing is the noble and learned Lord Chancellor. We have heard much about his views on the question of savings recently. Will the Minister elucidate further on that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I shall try to deal with each of those points in turn. I cannot as yet tell the hon. and learned Gentleman when the Bill will come into force, as it must clear its remaining stages on the Floor of the House. Although we have made consistent progress today--with Opposition Members' assistance--I cannot yet say when the matter will be further considered.
<P>
Clause 5(3)(a) is included to avoid doubt, but, as I have tried to demonstrate, the three principal clauses with which we are dealing today address three different problems, although they are related in as much as they all attempt to eliminate inefficiencies in magistrates courts. In such circumstances, although I do not anticipate this, it may be necessary to bring the three different clauses into force at different times. I hope that that is sufficient explanation. Although it is unlikely that the three clauses will be introduced at different times, I recognise that it is a theoretical possibility.
<P>
As for clause 5(3)(b), the hon. and learned Gentleman will know that its form of words is routinely used in Acts of Parliament, usually without any great investigation into their precise meaning.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Bill, as amended, to be reported.
