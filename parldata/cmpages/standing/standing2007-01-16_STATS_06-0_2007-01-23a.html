							<b class="B">Mr.
Michael Fallon</b> (Sevenoaks) (Con): On a point of order,
Mr. Olner. During your absence this morning, in our debate
on clause 11, the Financial Secretary referred at length to a letter
that he had distributed to members of the Committee. I was puzzled by
that as I did not recall seeing it, but I did not raise it at the time
because I assumed that I was perhaps the only Member who had not had
it. I then discovered a copy of the letter in my second post at
lunchtime.</div>

Theresa Villiers</b> (Chipping Barnet) (Con): I did not
receive the letter either, but I was able to obtain a copy during the

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012479000474"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I want briefly to flag up the issue of devolved
statistics, which the Minister could deal with either now or under
clause 18. There is a reference to devolved statistics in clause 11(6),
and it would be useful to have the Minister&#146;s clarification as
to what it means. I do not think that that concept is defined in the
Bill, but he may be able to correct me.</div>
					<a name="07012479000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I shall explore in our
debates on clause 18, the concept of devolved statistics raises certain
concerns about the fragmentation of statistics across the UK. There is
consensus on both sides of the House that we want to avoid the
fragmentation of statistics and to grapple with and reduce the related
problems that have arisen. Subsection (6) seems to insert the concept
of devolved statistics, which could cause a problem and exacerbate the
fragmentation difficulty that the Bill is partly designed to deal with.
I reiterate that I am happy to deal with that point in our debates on
clause 18.</div>
					<a name="07012479000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reserved
my next point for this part of the debate because it was not really
covered by the amendments. Subsection (8) refers to the rules on
pre-release access relating to</div>
					<a name="07012479000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;statistics in their final form
prior to publication.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 202</div>
					<a name="07012479000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						
						Leaving
aside for a moment all the discussions that we had this morning about
who should decide what the rules are, it seems to me that a key problem
with pre-release is the use of information prior to the finalisation of
figures circulating around Departments&#151;possibly to be leaked or
used to soften up the news agenda in the way that we
discussed.</div>
					<a name="07012479000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The drafting
in subsection (8) seems to suggest that there will be no regulation of
the raw data and statistics and their use until the last i has been
dotted and the last t has been crossed. Does the Minister expect that
the new rules will provide guidance as to how data should be dealt
with&#151;who may see it, who may use it and what treatment it may
receive&#151;prior to the finalisation of its release for
circulation? If there is to be complete freedom to use and circulate
data before they reach their final form, that seems to constitute a
significant loophole in the rules that the Minister is
contemplating.</div>

							<b class="B">Rob
Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): May I
reciprocate a favour that the hon. Lady extended to me earlier? I think
she will find the definition of devolved statistics in clause
63.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012479000476"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I am grateful for that clarification, but it
would still be useful to have further clarification from the Minister
as to how all this will work and how we will prevent it from leading to
further fragmentation problems.</div>
					<a name="07012479000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion, I say only that
for the reasons we discussed earlier, the official Opposition would
like the opportunity to vote against the clause. We believe that the
board and not Ministers should set the rules on
pre-release.</div>

								Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I propose to be brief on this set of amendments
because it mainly raises the same issues about scope that were
discussed extensively on Thursday under the first group of amendments
to clause 10. Amendments Nos. 142 and 144 are linked to those that were
discussed in the earlier groups and would transform the duty of the
board to assess particular statistics against the requirements of the
code of practice into a duty to assess whether Government Departments
are complying with the
code.</div>
					<a name="07012479000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
145, 146 and 148 are consequential changes that are linked with those
two amendments of substance. Their effect would broaden the scope of
the reform from statistics nominated by Ministers to become national
statistics to cover all official statistics. The Opposition strongly
support the amendments for reasons that were given at length in the
earlier debate. The Minister assured the Committee that he expected the
board to promote the code as a code of good practice throughout all
Departments. However, that still leaves in tact the two-tier structure
for statistics about which many have expressed concerns. It also still
leaves Departments free to ignore the code should they so wish in
relation to departmental statistics that are not national
statistics.</div>
					<a name="07012479000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The board
would be without the authority to impose and enforce the code against
Departments. In the Minister&#146;s words, it would have only an
audit function, not a regulatory one. As Dr. Ivan Fellegi, the chief
statistician of Canada, said to the Treasury Committee, it is a power
to name and shame. In effect, there is little difference between that
power and that which the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 204</div>Statistics Commission already has, so for the reasons given in the
earlier debate the Opposition strongly support the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07012479000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 184 is slightly different. It provides an alternative and less
radical way in which to tackle the same worry that we discussed on
Thursday. Rather than completely demolish the two-tier structure and
apply the code to all Departments, and hence to all official
statistics, the amendment would merely remove a Minister&#146;s right
to veto the commencement of the assessment process for a statistic to
go into the national statistic system and be governed by the full
rigour of the reforms that we are debating
today.</div>
					<a name="07012479000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
change is not as comprehensive a change as that proposed under the
other amendments, it is a compromise option that would mitigate several
of the worries that have been expressed about the Bill. The board would
still have only an audit rather than a regulatory function, but at
least Ministers would no longer have the right to keep certain
departmental statistics out of the national statistics system or be
able to determine whether the legislation applied to their statistics
in full or not, which would remedy an important flaw in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07012479000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said last
Thursday, it is difficult to see that the prospect of independent audit
and scrutiny will motivate Ministers to opt into the new system.
AsDr. Fellegi said to the Treasury Committee, that is more
likely to be a disincentive rather than an incentive to opt
in.</div>
					<a name="07012479000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister told
the Committee last week that he expected the proposed system to evolve,
but unless the Bill is amended it will evolve only at the pace that
Ministers wish. If the amendment is adopted, the board will have the
power to drive that process of evolution and determine which numbers
are important enough to be brought within the new framework and be
subjected to the code of practice as part of the national statistics
system.</div>
					<a name="07012479000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s main counter to my argument was that some statistics
were important enough for the code to be applied to them and some were
not. The Opposition believe that all official statistics are important
enough to merit that treatment, and to merit good practice, integrity
and honesty. However, if we cannot persuade the Minister on that point
I hope he will consider the issue of who would take the decision about
which statistics are important enough to be subjected to the code of
practice.</div>
					<a name="07012479000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
stated that there was a significant difference between statistics on
how many television licences the Department holds, for example, and
those on UK jobless figures. The Financial Secretary referred to those
two figures as being of a significantly different magnitude and he
argued that they should be subjected to different treatment, but who is
to say whether statistics on business survival rates or armed forces
medical discharge, for example, which are not national statistics, are
less important that the cider survey and the monthly statement on
bricks, blocks and cement, which at present are national
statistics?</div>
					<a name="07012479000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister focused strongly on the distinction between important,
significant statistics that require the application of the code of
practice and what he saw as less significant statistics that did not
require the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 205</div>application of the code of practice. At the very least, if that
distinction is as important as the Financial Secretary suggested, it
should be the board that takes that decision; it should not be left to
Ministers as that would leave a significant loophole in the framework
set up by the Bill. If the reform is to succeed, the board should make
the call on which statistics are important enough to be subject to a
code of integrity and impartiality. We hope that the Minister will
seriously consider accepting the amendment.</div>

								Dr.
Vincent Cable</b> (Twickenham) (LD): We are dealing with a
sub-set of issues around the bigger question of the two-tier system,
and the Minister&#146;s role in deciding which should belong to which
category. The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet helpfully suggested a
compromise to enable the board to have a role in the process. My
amendment, which in some respects is even more of a compromise, is
another way of approaching the same problem, but it gives the board a
status in the process.</div>
					<a name="07012479000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We argue that
the board should have the authority to initiate an assessment process
to designate any set of official statistics as national statistics. At
least that would give the board some access to the problem to challenge
ministerial discretion. My amendment is a modest, compromise proposal
and I would be surprised if the Minister could advance strong reasons
why it is not acceptable. In the spirit of trying to find a middle way
between the Government&#146;s proposals and an outright abolition of
the two-tier system, I hope that the Minister will accept one or other
of the amendments.</div>

Healey:
						</b> The Opposition seem to be proposing what is, to
put it bluntly, an extraordinary arrangement in amendments Nos. 142 to
146 and 148. The proposal appears to be that the board will assess all
official statistics against the same code and without specific requests
for it to do so. To me and, I hope, to other members of the Committee,
that is clearly absurd. It is a certain recipe for rendering the board
ineffective. The approach proposed by the hon. Member for Chipping
Barnet risks drawing the new statistics board into a sea of statistical
assessments and
approvals.</div>
				
					<a name="07012479000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
statistics produced by several hundred public bodies are already
captured in the core definition of official statistics that we have
debated and approved in clause 6. The range is vast and the volume is
greater still, but often, I have to say, in inverse proportion to their
importance. I have been doing a bit of work to try to gauge some of the
statistics that, under clause 6, will constitute official statistics,
including the sources of those data, which increasingly are new under
freedom of information in relation to parliamentary
questions.</div>
					<a name="07012479000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Examples
of what would now be classified as official statistics include, from
parliamentary questions, the level and source of departmental income
arising from unclaimed lost property in the royal parks, the number of
calls made from call centres in the Department for Transport using
predictive diallers, how much has been spent by the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport on dieting and vitamin supplements since 1997
and&#151;this is my favourite&#151;the total amount spent on
Ferrero Rocher chocolates in UK embassies.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012479000505"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> The Minister is very gracious in giving way
again. I think that he has misunderstood the impact of amendments Nos.
142 to 144. They would not require the board to carry out an assessment
process in relation to each and every statistic; they would require the
board to monitor the statistical activities of the different
Departments. That is a different
thing.</div>
					
					<a name="07012479000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012479000506"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> With respect to the hon. Lady, I do not
misunderstand her argument at all, because she has made it several
times. Her fundamental objection is to what she calls two-tier
statistics. The case that the range of official statistics that I have
set out in my exposition can or should be treated in the same way for
the board&#146;s assessment and approval functions is clearly flawed.
I hope that at least we can agree on that
principle.</div>
					<a name="07012479000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it
is right and it is reasonable, as the hon. Lady has also argued, that
we expect all official statistics to be produced with integrity. We
have discussed that point in Committee and I confirm that I entirely
accept it, for this reason. We have given the board an objective of
monitoring the production and publication of all official statistics
and commenting on concerns about the quality and good practice in
relation to all official statistics. I have also made it clear that I
expect that the board will do that in part through promoting the code
of practice for national statistics as a code of practice across all
official statistics, clearly laying out good practice and standards in
the production of statistics for all to
follow.</div>
					<a name="07012479000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However,
the active assessment programme will necessarily bring with it certain
resource and operational implications for the board and the data
producers. Rightly, we want to concentrate the programme on the core
statistics that are the key indicators on which the Government,
business and the public rely for an accurate, up-to-date, comprehensive
and meaningful description of the United Kingdom in this day and
age.</div>
					<a name="07012479000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely what is
important is not that all official statistics should be covered by the
assessment and approval function and remit of the board, but that all
the most important statistics are. That is why we have said that the
established set of about 1,300 national 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 207</div>statistics will be subject from the outset to the new system of
independent board assessment and approval against the code of practice
that the board will draw up and use for such
assessments.</div>
					
					<a name="07012479000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012479000507"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> Am I misreading, or does my hon. Friend agree that
were amendments Nos. 142 to 144 to be accepted, clause 12(1) would
read, &#147;The Board must, in accordance with this Part, assess and
determine whether the Code of Practice for Official Statistics under
section 10 has been complied with by the authorities responsible for
producing any official
statistics.&#148;?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012479000508"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> My hon. Friend has a keen eye for detail, and in
my view he is absolutely right. I started by saying that the practical
effects of amendmentsNos. 142 to 146 and amendment No. 148
were precisely as the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet has tried to
argue in principle. She does not accept the concept of two-tier
statistics&#151;that some statistics are more important than others
and should be subject to greater scrutiny. Under our proposals, there
will be a rigorous, independent system of assessment and approval. My
hon. Friend is right. If the hon. Lady seeks to press the amendments, I
shall ask my hon. Friends to resist them.</div>
					<a name="07012479000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we accept that it is right
in principle to concentrate on what matters most, that raises the
question of where to draw the boundary in practice. This debate is
important, because it cuts to the heart of the proposals in the Bill
and the concerns that some have
expressed.</div>
					<a name="07012479000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The nature
and number of official statistics is ever-changing and rapidly
increasing, and the boundaries are becoming blurred. As I showed with
one or two perhaps extreme examples, they are very wide-ranging. We
have drawn the scope of official statistics as defined in the Bill
extremely wide and flexible on purpose. We did so to reflect our desire
that the board should be able to promote and safeguard the quality of
the wide and ever-evolving range of data produced and used by the
Government.</div>
					<a name="07012479000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In seeking to
frame a practical and principled argument about where any boundary or
definition may be drawn, it is important to understand the changing
nature of Government statistics&#151;particularly if one wants to
argue that the current set of national statistics is not the right
starting point, despite the fact that our system can evolve in future.
The changing nature of statistics and the method of their collection
means that we no longer use only the traditional collection methods of
census and survey. Increasingly, important statistics are derived from
administrative and management systems such as those used for the
delivery of the benefit or education systems.</div>
					<a name="07012479000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Undoubtedly, statistics derived
in that way are often important&#151;often more so than the examples
that I gave earlier. However, they impose additional and different
statistical challenges, given that the primary purpose of the system
that produces the data is not itself statistical.</div>
					<a name="07012479000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example, concerns have been
expressed, including during our consideration of this Bill, about Home
Office statistics. However, as we have heard in recent weeks, apparent
statistical problems are in fact a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 208</div>manifestation of other problems that are not statistical. Of course we
would want to deal with those statistical issues, but the solutions are
primarily administrative or policy-related and not statistical. It
would be unrealistic and misleading to suggest otherwise. With the best
will in the world, there may be occasions when data derived from
management or administrative systems would not and could not meet the
standards set out in a code of statistical practice.</div>
					<a name="07012479000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current scope of national
statistics in this country is wide and comparable with those of most of
our international comparators. However, the additional benefit of the
proposed system is that it does have the scope to evolve in the light
of experience. Therefore, additional statistics can be put forward for
assessment and approval as new national statistics, thus allowing both
adaptation to changing statistical demands and an increase in the scope
of national
statistics.</div>
					<a name="07012479000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not
rehearse our arguments about where this responsibility should lie
unless the Committee particularly presses me. I have explained why
Ministers must ultimately decide, given their responsibility for their
Departments. Equally, I have been clear that the board will be able to
comment on which statistics should be national ones.</div>
					<a name="07012479000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second Reading, the hon.
Member for Sevenoaks suggested that if the board had the power to
recommend that change, it would be</div>
					<a name="07012479000414"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a huge comfort to those of us
worried about that point. Nobody is arguing that every conceivable line
of official statistics should become a national statistic at the whim
of the board&#148;.&#151;[Official Report, 8 January 2007; Vol.
455, c. 108.]</div>
					<a name="07012479000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that that is still his view now that we are in Committee because I have
said not only that I would expect the board to comment on which
statistics should be national ones but that this will encourage more
statistics into the system. I have been very clear that one of the
board&#146;s objectives in discharging its responsibilities is to
safeguard the comprehensiveness of the official statistics system,
including national statistics. However, in the end, Parliament has the
scope and the role under the provisions of this Bill to hold Ministers
and the board to account for what they do and do not decide to
do.</div>
					<a name="07012479000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Therefore,
I do expect the board to comment on such matters. I also expect
Parliament to take a strong interest in those matters&#151;and the
board&#146;s statements on them&#151;and to call Ministers to
account when departmental outputs or activities have been commented on,
but not recommended, for inclusion as national statistics. I hope that
this has been a useful debate and that, in the light of my further
clarification and explanation, hon. Members will not press amendment
No.142 or seek to move the others in the
group.</div>

							<a name="07012479000509"></a>Dr.
Cable:
						</b>
						The Minister has made some
sensible points, but he has not answered the issue raised in amendment
No.78. He quite correctly said that the decision as to whether
something should be a national or an official statistic must be
governed by considerations other than statistical ones, such as
administrative factors. That is absolutely true and a perfectly valid
point. That is why it is important and quite right to say that one does
not need some overarching bureaucratic structure which necessarily
involves the board.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 209</div>
					<a name="07012479000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However, he
then conceded the central point that the board should have a role in
making comments. How is that different from our suggestion that the
board be given the authority to initiate an assessment process to
designate any set of statistics official or national and a pro-active
role in selecting cases that seem anomalous. The Minister&#146;s
essential point is that the definition will remain fluid and determined
by many other factors which are not necessarily statistical so what is
the problem with the proposed
amendment?</div>

Villiers:
						</b>
						The Minister may consider that
the Opposition&#146;s proposals are not practical, but they are
supported by a range of organisations which contributed to the
consultation process. I drew the Committee&#146;s attention to their
comments at great length on Thursday afternoon. I do not propose to do
that again, but the Committee should listen when organisations such as
the Statistics Commission, the Royal Statistical Society and a host of
other organisations that responded to the consultation express strong
support for the abolition of the two-tier system and for expanding the
scope of the code of conduct to official statistics. That is evidence
that this is not some hare-brained, impractical scheme. There is no
reason why we cannot trust the board to come up with a proportionate
and common-sense code of practice that is capable of being applied
across the board to the statistical activities of
Departments.</div>
					<a name="07012479000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the
Minister, I will not rehearse the arguments that we pursued on Thursday
and on Second Reading, but if a statistic is worth producing and
relying on, it is worth producing in accordance with the principle of
good practice that will be set out in the statutory code at the heart
of this reform.</div>
					<a name="07012479000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister himself said that there was an issue as to where to draw the
boundary between those statistics that are and those that are not
sufficiently important to be subjected to the code of practice . We do
not believe that that boundary should be drawn at all, for the reasons
that I have given. However, the Minister acknowledged that the boundary
was crucial and said a few minutes ago that it went to the heart of the
matter. Yet it is Ministers who will decide the boundary under the
scheme proposed by the Government. If this is really at the heart of
the matter and the Bill&#151;I agree with him that it is
important&#151;I appeal to the Minister to accept amendment No. 184.
Even the amendment tabled by my Liberal colleague, the hon. Member for
Twickenham, would do something to mitigate the problem; the boundary
would be determined by the board and not by Ministers. That would mean
that many of the concerns expressed by people such as Lord Moser, and
by the Statistics Commission and the RSS would be answered. It is not
ideal, but it is a sensible and defensible compromise.</div>
					<a name="07012479000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Minister is so
enthusiastic about the board&#146;s power to comment on the scope of
national statistics and its power to recommend the designation of a
statistic as a national statistic, why can he not go that one bit
further, give the board real teeth and allow it to require that the
assessment process is started? If the Minister wants to claim the place
in history that the
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 210</div>hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said was there for the taking,
I appeal to him to accept amendment No.184 or others in this

						I feel that I should respond to
the hon. Member for Twickenham. We had a principled and detailed debate
about the points that he raised today in a sitting last week that he
may not have attended. In essence, in a decentralised system the
responsibility for submitting statistics for assessment must lie with
the Departments. My argument is that Ministers are responsible for
making policy and arguably, as such, are better placed to know which
statistics are most critical for the development and delivery of that
policy. Ministers are also responsible and accountable for allocating
and managing resources in their Department, including those devoted to
statistical production. Principally, I see those as policy and resource
decisions and, therefore, as more appropriate matters for Ministers
than for the statistics board. I hope that that is helpful to the hon.

much.</div>

						</b>
						This is the first of a series of
clauses that provide important supplementary functions for the
statistics board. The others&#151;clauses 14 to 17&#151;deal with
programmes of assessment, principles and procedures, lists of national
statistics and transitional provisions. Clause 13 provides for the
reassessment of statistics, designated as national statistics under the
previous clause, in order to determine whether they continue to comply
with the code of practice. Thereafter, their designation as national
statistics can be either confirmed or cancelled. This process will
apply either because the statistics have been assessed previously by
the board as meeting the code or because they are national statistics
at the commencement of the new system. I suspect and
hope
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 212</div>that there will be rather less contention around this and some of the
subsequent clauses, but nevertheless it is important and I commend it
to the
Committee.</div>

							<a name="07012479000569"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> I would like to ask my hon. Friend about the time
frame for clauses 13 to 15, because I do not see one. Clause 16 refers
to &#147;once every financial year&#148;, and clause 17 contains
transitional provisions for the old regime to continue until the new
one is in place, but clauses 13 and, as I read them, 14 and 15, set no
time limit on the board and could leave us struggling on under the old
regime indefinitely. That seems rather unsatisfactory. Has he thought
about including a time limit in the clauses to ensure that the board
carries out its functions within, for example, a year of the Act
receiving Royal
Assent?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012479000570"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> My hon. Friend is right. It would be undesirable
and unacceptable for the transitional period to struggle on for a long
time. I explained earlier that I want to move quickly as the
legislation proceeds through Parliament and to appoint a chairman of
the shadow board. With the good will of those who want the system to
work, I expect and hope that the board will be up and running without
undue delay. This will be one of its core functions and something to
which I expect it to give its attention early on. In principle, he
might have put his finger on a potential problem, but in practice I do
not share his concerns. Clearly, a fixed and precise timetable is
difficult to legislate for. It will depend on the board, which will in
many ways determine the pace of
progress.</div>

					<a name="07012479000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
might be a purely semantic grappling point that need not detain us for
long. However, I was struck by the fact that, throughout, the Bill
makes reference to, &#147;the board may&#148;, or &#147;the board
must&#148;, or &#147;the board shall&#148;, or &#147;the board
is&#148;, but suddenly the parliamentary draftsman got excited and
wrote, the &#147;board may itself produce&#148;. It may just be
purely a coincidence and a case of the parliamentary draftsman getting
a bit bored and feeling the need for a little variety, but it seems
rather pointless. If there should be any point of emphasis, this is
probably not the place to put it. The thrust of the Bill is that the
board will be responsible not just for oversight but for production of
statistics. As has been explained, that will operate through Chinese
walls and it will be the National Statistician who carries out the
production. So this is a very odd place to emphasise the board&#146;s
role.</div>

probably extremely pedantic little point of redrafting, perhaps we

again.</div>

not sure that the amendment would make a significant difference to the
clause, although I would say that it would make it a little less clear,
rather than clearer. The intention behind the drafting of this
particular point in the clause is to make it clear that, unlike the
preceding clauses, it is about statistics that the board produces
rather than the statistics produced by other organisations, such as
Departments, which the board monitors. I think that the wording in the
Bill probably helps to preserve that clarity, and I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will not feel it necessary to press the matter to a
vote.</div>

is right that the inclusion of &#147;itself&#148; in subsection (1)
leads to greater emphasis and greater clarity, surely that greater

have explained, in subsection (1), clearly the emphasis on
&#147;itself&#148; is to try to make clear the distinction between
statistics produced elsewhere and statistics produced under the aegis
of the board, in other words by the current Office for National
Statistics. Clearly the publication of information or advice given
regarding statistics produced under subsection (1) does not require
that construction in order to give the board the freedom and the remit
to do so.</div>

								Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> The clause provides a welcome opportunity to
address matters relating to devolution and the problems that have
arisen from the fragmentation of statistics across the UK. The reason
for that is the fact that subsections (3) to (5) place limits on the
board&#146;s activities in relation to so-called devolved statistics,
to which the hon. Member for Dundee, East just referred.</div>
					<a name="07012479000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Opposition made it plain
earlier that we believe that the functions set out in the clause should
be those of the National Statistician and not the board. We have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 215</div>debated that at length already and we do not need to go back over the
groundwork. However, just to reprise that, it would be useful if the
Minister could clarify whether &#147;board&#148; in the clause is
taken to include what is now the ONS. That is important in addressing
the devolution issues, because under the clause it seems as if the ONS
will be prevented from producing so-called devolved statistics without
the permission of the relevant devolved Administration. No doubt the
Minister will correct me if I have misinterpreted it, but that seems to
be how the clause
works.</div>
					<a name="07012479000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">That looks like
an element of political control, which goes against the thrust of
giving independence to statistical services and to the board. If a
Minister in a devolved Administration felt, for example, that a
statistic might expose policy failures on their part, the clause would
presumably enable him or her to bar the ONS from collecting it. There
seems to be no comparable restriction for English statistics. The
clause seems to involve a reduced level of independence for statistics
relating to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. I would welcome the
Minister&#146;s clarification of whether I have understood the clause
correctly, and if so, of what the justification for that
is.</div>
					<a name="07012479000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another potential
undesirable consequence of subsections (3) to (5) is the further
fragmentation of statistics across the UK, which leads to the general
issue that I should like to address. The proposed application of the
new framework across the devolved Administrations is welcome&#151;it
is right that the areas where government is devolved should produce
statistics that reflect their own local circumstances and meet the
needs of local users&#151;but as the Treasury Committee pointed
out:</div>
					<a name="07012479000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Equally
important...is that the basic data which is needed at UK level is
capable of being compiled in a coherent form across the
administrations, in order to ensure that there is a set of UK-wide
numbers, that this allows users to compare and contrast the impact of
policies in different parts of the UK&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07012479000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many expressed concern during
the consultation that it was becoming more and more difficult to obtain
statistical data that covered the whole of the UK. That fragmentation
of statistics makes it more difficult to assess the effects of
devolution. Simon Briscoe, statistics editor of the <i class="I">Financial Times,
</i>put the problem as follows in his evidence to the Treasury
Committee:</div>
					<a name="07012479000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
there are policy areas that a devolved assembly has decided to take a
different policy stance, say Scotland from England, I think it is a
shame that we do not have harmonised data so that we can actually see
what the impact of the different policies are. If we cannot see the
results of that little bit of experimentation, then nobody is going to
be any the wiser about which policies were
best.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012479000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
inability to compare figures across the country on issues as
significant as health, housing and poverty makes it more difficult to
develop coherent evidence-based policies and programmes to tackle them.
As the Treasury Committee pointed out, difficulties in producing
consistent UK-wide statistics could also jeopardise the UK&#146;s
ability to meet its international obligations on statistics. The Royal
Statistical Society described the problem as &#147;serious and
worsening&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07012479000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The evidence
seems to suggest that the problem did not start with devolution but may
have been intensified or brought into sharper focus by that process.
Particular 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 216</div>concern has been expressed by the Statistics User Forum, which described
the lack of coherent UK-wide statistics as</div>
					<a name="07012479000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a long-standing problem that is
not improving. It is a major source of frustration for professional
users and confusion for non-professional
users.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012479000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
forum&#146;s chairman, Mr. Keith Dugmore, pointed out to
the Treasury Committee that locations about which it is difficult to
obtain data might lose out on inward investment as companies opt for
areas where they can easily get hold of the information that they want.
He expressed the user community&#146;s frustration when he
said:</div>
					<a name="07012479000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
are people out there who are the actual customers and users of
statistics saying, &#145;Why on earth can I not grab the same thing
for Northern Ireland as I can for Devon and Cornwall or
wherever?&#146;&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012479000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
pointed out that the compilation of different indices of deprivation in
different areas of the country meant that one could not, for example,
determine whether poverty was more serious in Glasgow or in the east
end of London.</div>
					<a name="07012479000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
anxieties were echoed recently by Dr. Kadhem Jallab, head of Tyne and
Wear Research and Information. In consultation during the run-up to the
Bill, he
said:</div>
					<a name="07012479000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Devolution
obviously risks further disintegration of comparability...The
index of deprivation in England is not directly comparable with that in
Scotland. These effects make the comparison of Tyne and Wear with
Glasgow and Edinburgh
impossible.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012479000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Dr.
Jallab went on to note that work on housing market areas in the
north-east based on migration patterns from the census had been
compromised by the different approaches taken on census statistics in
Scotland and England.</div>
					<a name="07012479000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Particular problems arose in
relation to the 2001 census. I refer again to Simon Briscoe&#146;s
evidence to the Treasury Committee. He felt that the ONS had been so
enfeebled by the 2001 process that it had managed to produce only a
limited set of UK-wide figures. For other census data, users had
to</div>
					<a name="07012479000421"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;fumble
around on three different websites to try and cobble together a figure
for the
UK&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07012479000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alison
Macfarlane, professor of perinatal health at City university, told the
Committee how she tried to produce figures for what she described as a
very basic set of maternity indicators. She
said:</div>
					<a name="07012479000422"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I had
gone round the houses liaising with people in four countries and sent
in data derived from 18 separate data sets. Even then, there were a
number of
holes.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012479000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Professor
Macfarlane called for the ONS to have a much stronger co-ordinating
role.</div>
					<a name="07012479000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems that
at present there is a political imbalance. The pull from devolved
Administrations to localise the census is stronger than the
counterweight of a few statisticians in London who want a consistent
approach across the country. The chairman of the RSS&#146;s national
statistics working party, John Pullinger, who was heavily involved in
the 2001 census, described how such problems
arose:</div>
					<a name="07012479000423"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
census is clearly a very sensitive topic. The Scottish Parliament
decided to make some changes. That was not in itself a problem, but
when the Welsh Assembly saw that the Scottish Parliament had made some
changes, they wanted some changes, and the thing began to fragment
because the forces pulling it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 217</div>apart were stronger than Pullinger sitting in a room in Whitehall with
his counterparts. They were stronger and we were unable to pull it
together, so in fact we had three different
censuses.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012479000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Pullinger identified a key problem for this Committee to consider. We
clearly need to produce a common core of statistics across the UK. The
question is how to provide the counterweight to the natural pull away
from the centre. How can we give the board or the National Statistician
the authority to provide it?</div>
					<a name="07012479000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the Minister that he
still has a chance to change his mind and vote in favour of amendment
No. 98 to give the National Statistician a formal duty to promote
consistency of statistics across the UK. We have debated it but are yet
to vote on it, and I hope we will have a chance to do so. That would
have provided an important boost to the authority of the National
Statistician.</div>

						 I am trying to follow the hon.
Lady&#146;s logic, but she is rattling through the briefing in front
of her. She seems to be talking about a tension between consistency of
national statistics and issues that are of interest in a devolved
system. I would point out that in some circumstances there may be
devolved interest in the regions of England, as well as in Wales or
Scotland. However, does the hon. Lady not realise that information
about use of the Welsh language and such matters gained through the
census is extremely important, not only for the National Assembly for
Wales, but for local authorities in Wales? Does she not accept that
there needs to be, not a tension or conflict between central
consistency and devolved Administrations, but a complementarity of
information that respects the differences within the United Kingdom?
That is part of the way in which we maintain its
unity.</div>

							<a name="07012479000589"></a>Mrs.

						 I agree that the ideal is to
have complementary statistics. Nothing that I have said should be taken
to indicate that the devolved Administrations or organisations within
areas that have devolved government should not be producing their own
statistics on certain matters. However, it is important to have a core
of statistics that are compiled in the same way across the United
Kingdom. Otherwise, it will be difficult to compare different local
areas, which will lose out as a result.</div>

Welsh Assembly and local government in Wales require not to be

money not to deal with it in the way that Members of this House have

for a uniform set of statistics to measure it. Water in Scotland is in
the public sector, while water in England is in the private sector;
although water supply is fully funded by the taxpayer through the
bills, it is deemed to be public expenditure in England but not in
Scotland. There is a massive disparity in public sector accounts of
spending per head on that basis alone. How does one collect uniform
statistics that give a meaningful comparison given those different
systems?</div>

I have heard nobody suggest that there should not be a core of
statistics enabling comparisons from region to region, country to

the centralised consistency that she seeks, we should collect
statistics on the speaking of Welsh in north-east England? It might be
interesting, but the resources would not be well devoted to
that.</div>

parties. The Minister recognises the importance of dealing with the
problem of the fragmentation of statistics. That is why he has worked
hard to bring the devolved Administrations into the new
framework.</div>
					<a name="07012479000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I hope that
the Bill will help to remedy the problems to which I have adverted. I
look forward to the Minister&#146;s reassurance that the Bill will
tackle fragmentation to ensure that we can compare poverty levels in
Glasgow, in Tyne and Wear and in the east end of London, for example.
That is an important function of our statistical services, and that is
why it is important that the Bill reduces fragmentation and ensures
that there is consistency between key statistics throughout the United

							<a name="07012479000602"></a>Stewart
Hosie:
						</b> I happen to agree with the hon. Lady about the
fragmentation of what I call British statistics, at least in so far as
ensuring their quality, accuracy and completeness, which is uniformly
first class throughout all statistics produced by the nations, the
provinces and the UK as a whole. It is also correct that there must be
UK data, not least to fulfil international obligations. However, there
must not and there cannot be uniformity for the sake of it. Should a
devolved Administration require statistics in a form that they define,
it would be a matter for them alone, so long as the statistics,
official or national, fulfilled all other criteria set by the board,
particularly on quality, completeness and on-time delivery.</div>
					<a name="07012479000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady suggested that a
devolved Administration may restrict or stop the calculation of a
statistic that shows them in a poor light. However, given the absence
of accurate data, particularly economic data, not only in the UK,
England and parts of England, but in Scotland, it is far more likely
that the Administration would seek to commission the information that
they required. The information that they may not consent to is
information or statistics that they presumably do not consider
necessary to set policy priorities, to measure the success or failure
of policies and so on.</div>
					<a name="07012479000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We know from
previous sittings that the Treasury controls the appointment to and
size of the board, and that the Treasury can restrict the
board&#146;s direction in the case of failure, which we will come to.
The Treasury can also restrict the disclosure of information to and
from the board, particularly if the devolved Administrations request or
demand it. The clause is a useful safeguard to ensure that
Administrations cannot have foisted upon them information that they
consider to be of no value. However, the provision relates only to
fully devolved statistics. State-wide statistics, which the hon. Lady
wants for the purposes of comparison, will of course be provided
because they are UK statistics.</div>
					<a name="07012479000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure what we heard
from the hon. Lady, but the clause offers a degree of protection
against Administrations becoming burdened with statistics for which
they have little or no use. Other clauses allow them to direct the
production of statistics that they need. The hon. Lady&#146;s fears
are unfounded. Given the Treasury&#146;s command and control of other
parts of the process, which we have discussed, I would have thought
that she would have been delighted to see that at least one part of the
process is fully in the control of the Assembly in Wales, the
Parliament in Scotland and the Administration in Northern
Ireland.</div>

opportunity given by the discussion of the clause to register a few
concerns about the nature of devolved statistics and comparability
across the United Kingdom, and she was right to do so. We share her
concerns, which was clear from the consultation and the way in which we
framed the Bill. The decision of the devolved Administrations to
participate fully in the provisions of the Bill goes some way to
addressing those concerns.</div>
					<a name="07012479000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the devolution
settlement, devolved Administrations have responsibility for devolved
matters such as education, health and local economic development. That
includes the production of statistics relating to those matters, such
as statistics on pupil numbers, cancer operations and local planning
applications. Devolved statistical production predates by some way the
devolution settlement and Simon Briscoe&#146;s comments in the
<i class="I">Financial Times. </i>Wales, Northern Ireland and particularly
Scotland have different legal, political and education systems, which
leads to the production of relevant statistics. That has meant that
direct comparability in those areas has been difficult for some
time.</div>
					<a name="07012479000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
devolution settlement and our determination not to open it up wider
with this Bill, it is right that the Board should obtain the consent of
the relevant devolved Administrations to produce statistics on devolved
matters. The clause allows the board to produce and publish statistics
on any UK matter. It is important that the board should continue to do
so, not least because we are concerned to aid the coherence of UK
statistics, as the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet is. The Office for
National Statistics compendium &#147;Social Trends&#148;<i class="I">
</i>covers both devolved and non-devolved statistics to give a
definitive overview of the United Kingdom. Where it impinges on
devolved statistics, it is right that consent is obtained from the
Administrations.</div>

technical and practical difficulties that analysts and researchers had
in bringing together statistics from devolved sources. Those concerns
were raised during the consultation, and we are as keen as she is to
deal with that issue. She urged me to confirm, as I think I already
have, that I believe that the Bill will be helpful because the devolved
Administrations have decided to participate fully. That means that the
board will have a responsibility in its remit to monitor and report on

							<a name="07012479000608"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 150, in
clause 19, page 8, line 37, leave
out &#145;the consent&#146; and insert
&#145;consulting&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07012479000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
tabled this probing amendment to explore the transfer of further power
over the retail prices index from the Chancellor to the board. The
progress in the direction of transferring power is welcome, but it
would be useful for the Committee to consider whether the powers that
are retained by the Chancellor under clause 19 are necessary. We want
to probe the Government&#146;s reasons for retaining the
Chancellor&#146;s power to veto measures that constitute a
fundamental change in the RPI, which would be materially detrimental to
the interests of the relevant index-linked gilt-edged
securities.</div>
					<a name="07012479000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
one has to approach the matter with great caution. The Library note on
the Bill tells us that the eight gilts relevant to our discussion have
an outstanding value of some &#163;90.8 billion. Of course, the
Opposition would not wish any measure to be put in place that would
require the Government suddenly and unexpectedly to have to repay
&#163;90.8 billion, because that would cause significant problems in
terms of the public finances and market volatility, but the question
arises whether the retention of the Chancellor&#146;s veto in this
context is necessary to prevent the risk from materialising. That is
why I tabled the amendment, which would essentially transform the
Chancellor&#146;s power to veto a proposed change into a right merely
to be consulted about the change after a decision has been made by the
Bank of England and the
board.</div>
					<a name="07012479000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The thrust of
the reform that the Government say that they wish to make involves
trusting the board and the National Statistician to make hugely
important, sensitive decisions that determine the flow of millions of
pounds in capital markets every day. If they can be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 222</div>trusted to make other key decisions about the definition of crucial
economic indices, we are interested to hear more from the Government
about why they feel that those people cannot be trusted in total to
make the decisions on the retail prices index. The Royal Statistical
Society, for example, has said that given the importance of the RPI it
is crucial to remove it from political control. We have at least to
consider the arguments to see whether the transfer of power from the
Chancellor to the board should be
total.</div>
					<a name="07012479000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
amendment were made, there would still be a triple safeguard to prevent
an irresponsible decision that would trigger automatic redemption from
being made. Not only would the board have to be convinced that the
change was needed, but the Bank of England would have to give its view
of whether the proposal would constitute a fundamental change. Of
course, the Chancellor would also have to be
consulted.</div>
					<a name="07012479000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Treasury Committee has considered the matter over a number of years and
it could find no other country in the world where the Executive
retained control over definitional matters in relation to the inflation
index. We should like the Government to give further justification for
why they wish to make an exception, albeit one that is now more limited
than in the past, because the Chancellor&#146;s continuing role
involves an exception&#151;albeit one more limited in scope than
previously. The concern is particularly significant in a month when
inflation has climbed to its highest level for 15 years. At a time of
rising inflation it is more important than ever to take measures to
rebuild the credibility of inflation indices, which many now worry do
not reflect the real cost of living. Given the pivotal importance of
inflation for economic stability and policy and for families, there is
surely an argument that the independent structures being set up in the
Bill should take over full responsibility for the definition of the RPI
and its
derivatives.</div>

						<a name="07012479000609"></a>
							<b class="B">Ms
Celia Barlow</b> (Hove) (Lab): The hon. Lady mentioned the
necessity of a safeguard. Would it not be more appropriate if that
safeguard were the Chancellor acting as an arbiter between the board
and the Bank, given that that has been his traditional responsibility
and index-linked gilts are part of our national
borrowing?</div>
					
					<a name="07012479000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012479000610"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> There are arguments on both sides of the debate,
which is why the amendment is probing. One of our concerns is that the
Chancellor&#146;s role in relation to the Bank of England is not
necessarily transparent and his continued involvement could jeopardise
public trust. When decisions are taken on changes to the methodology of
the RPI, people could suspect political motivation even when there is
none. I shall come on to that point in more
detail.</div>
					<a name="07012479000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Treasury Committee first called for the removal of the
Chancellor&#146;s powers in relation to the RPI in 1998 and it set
out its concerns in three reports&#151;in 1998, 2000 and July 2006.
The move to answer the Committee&#146;s concern has been slow in
coming. Clear tensions have emerged in the current RPI regime, which
splits responsibility between the National Statistician and the
Chancellor. Under the current rules, the National 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 223</div>Statistician is responsible for the methodology used to compile the
index, while the Chancellor covers its scope and definition.</div>
					<a name="07012479000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">That split responsibility
caused concern when a move was made in February 2004 to incorporate
hedonic regression methods of quality adjustment for a limited set of
goods. It was intended to adjust more accurately for the impact of
quality changes in the price of certain foods. There was a problem with
communication, which again goes to the issue of trust. The ONS covered
the matter briefly in its standard monthly press release; on the same
day the Treasury issued a press release announcing that the National
Statistician had made changes to the methodology of the RPI and that
the Bank of England had indicated that they did not represent a
fundamental change to the index. The debt management office had given
holders of gilts early warning of the prospective changes, but that did
not seem to filter through to a wider audience. The Statistics
Commission criticised the way in which the news was disclosed and said
that the ONS should have issued a separate press release to warn people
of the changes and separate the decision from the
Chancellor.</div>
					<a name="07012479000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
problems will clearly be mitigated by clause 11, but similar
communication difficulties might arise in relation to the residual
functions that the clause leaves with the Chancellor. There is an
important lesson on credibility to be learned from the hedonics
controversy. In examining it, the Statistics Commission noted that
disquiet had been expressed that the change had been politically
motivated, which was the problem I referred to in response to the
intervention by the hon. Member for Hove. The commission noted that
there had been speculation whether the developments flowing from the
shift to hedonics had been released in small packages to avoid
triggering gilt redemption
clauses.</div>
					<a name="07012479000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must make
it clear that the commission concluded that the changes were not
politically motivated and that they were objectively justifiable, but
that the Chancellor&#146;s continuing role had led some to look for
political motives behind the change. It concluded that more
transparency and information was required to reassure the public about
the governance of the RPI. It went on to
state:</div>
					<a name="07012479000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe that there is a strong case for going further than this and
looking again at the Chancellor&#146;s special role in respect of the
RPI.</div>
					<a name="07012479000425"></a><div class="hs_brev">The Commission is
not persuaded that there is public benefit in treating the RPI
differently from other key
statistics.</div>
					<a name="07012479000426"></a><div class="hs_brev">We believe
that this tends to undermine confidence that the construction of the
index is handled in an impartial
way.</div>
					<a name="07012479000427"></a><div class="hs_brev">It is therefore
also likely to have presentational disadvantages through the suspicion
it engenders.</div>
					<a name="07012479000428"></a><div class="hs_brev">In
short, the current arrangements create the worst of all possible
outcomes.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012479000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">What concerns
me&#151;I would like to hear the Minister&#146;s views&#151;is
the suspicion that changes to the index are politically motivated. That
suspicion was identified by the commission as a source of concern and
it could persist, even with the limited powers retained by the
Chancellor.</div>
					<a name="07012479000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
suspicion could be fuelled by the position of the RPI advisory
committee. For many years, that committee of learned experts played a
role as a guardian of the RPI. The committee provided a degree 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 224</div>of transparency and independence in a system where the Chancellor had a
unique role in relation to a hugely important index. However, that
transparency has been lost since the current Chancellor took over at
No. 11 because the committee has not met. It can only be convened at
the request of the Chancellor and he has chosen not to do so.</div>
					<a name="07012479000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is one of the reasons why
disquiet has been and continues to be expressed at the
Chancellor&#146;s role in relation to RPI, even if the changes go
through. It would be interesting to hear the Minister confirm that the
committee has not met since 1994, and it would be useful if he
clarified whether he envisages a continuing role for the committee in
dealing with the problems and the concerns about the
Chancellor&#146;s role in relation to RPI. Will it continue, for
example, as an adviser to the board or the National Statistician,
rather than to the
Chancellor?</div>
					<a name="07012479000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, the Committee will be well aware that even the smallest
changes to the index can save the Chancellor many millions of pounds in
benefit and interest payments. It is vital that we get the RPI
arrangements absolutely right, which is why the Opposition are seeking
a degree of further clarification from the Minister about how the
residual powers retained for the Chancellor will work and how they can
be
justified.</div>

						Were the amendment not a probing
one, I would certainly urge my colleagues to vote against it if it were
to be pressed. On a minor level, it is not properly worded because it
should have removed the word &#147;of&#148; as well, but on a more
major level, the amendment is completely potty. It is potty for some of
the reasons adverted to, but not made absolutely clear by the hon.
Member for Chipping Barnet in a very long speech. The matter dates back
to about the year of the hon. Lady&#146;s birth. Many older members
of the Committee will remember, during the run on the pound and
subsequent devaluation in 1967, the phrase used by the then Prime
Minister, Harold Wilson: &#147;the gnomes of Zurich&#148;. As a
result, legislation was passed in 1968 for index-linked gilts. The
index linking is important and it carried on until 2002.</div>
					<a name="07012479000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Labour
Members, if not Opposition Members, will remember that the under the
Conservative Governments who were in office for two thirds of the
period between the passing of the 1968 Act and the changes of 2002, and
in particular under the Government of John Major, the national debt
doubled. Under the present Government, until very recently, we have
been paying it off. The national debt is considerably lower than the
one we inherited in 1997, and unlike the situation under the
Conservative Government, we have something to show for it.</div>
					<a name="07012479000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						What would
happen if the amendment were to be passed? It would take the matter of
redemption out of the hands of any Government. The hon. Lady adverted 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 225</div>to one point but did not make it entirely clear. At this point, I shall
refer to the explanatory notes, which will please all hon. Members.
Stockholders, if there is a change in the RPI calculation, have the
right to require the Government to redeem the stock. That is
the&#163;90 billion in the Library note to which the hon.
Lady referred. That could happen overnight under the terms of those
gilts, and it would have, as the explanatory notes put it:</div>
					<a name="07012479000429"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a significant impact on financial
markets and potentially on public finances.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012479000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">If 90 billion quid became repayable by
the Treasury overnight, it would have to rush off to the money markets
to try to borrow another &#163;90 billion, which would cause chaos
and be most undesirable. That is why, as the Bill is worded and in
contradistinction to the amendment, and because of the delicate nature
of that power and the overhang from previous years of Conservative
borrowing, it leaves the matter ultimately with the Chancellor of the
Exchequer. Given that the stocks are due for redemption between 2009
and 2030 and that the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne)
hopes&#151;vainly&#151;to be Chancellor of the Exchequer during
that period, I say to the hon. Lady that I suspect her hon. Friend
would be absolutely horrified if such an amendment was
accepted.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012479000617"></a>Dr.
Cable:
						</b> I do not want to speak to the amendment; I have a
question about the clause. It may stem from ignorance on my part. I can
understand why it is important to have a clause on the index of
inflation; it is probably the most crucial of all economic indicators.
It links to so many other things, including benefit indexation and
index-linked gilts.</div>
					<a name="07012479000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">My question relates to the fact
that we have two measures of inflation&#151;the CPI and the RPI. The
CPI is no less important because it is the indicator that the Bank of
England uses when setting interest rates. It is therefore just as
important as the RPI. Why is there no comparable statement of the
process safeguarding the integrity and the independence of CPI
calculations? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 226</div>The answer in part is that the CPI is a European index, and people no
doubt place their trust in the Commission as the ultimate repository of
statistical honesty, and we do not need a European index to be embodied
in British legislation.</div>
					<a name="07012479000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it is a practical
point. The CPI is currently being reviewed in order to take account of
the fact that it does not capture housing costs. There is some
discussion about the fact that the CPI might be adapted separately for
the UK in order to capture housing costs ahead of any change made by
EUROSTAT. Who safeguards the process by which the CPI, as well as the
RPI, is compiled? Has it been omitted from legislation for good reasons
or simply because no one thought it was necessary to do so? It is not a
challenge to the provisions of the clause; it is simply a question
about the thinking behind its drafting.</div>
					
					<a name="07012479000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012479000618"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> Let me start by thanking the hon. Member for
Chipping Barnet for the welcome that she gave to the
Chancellor&#146;s transferring his essential powers over the RPI to
the board. I know that the Treasury Committee and others have followed
it closely and encouraged my right hon. Friend to do so for some time.
I am glad that we can do so. We will have the right provisions to
protect essential public finance interests and the stability of the
financial markets, as I shall explain later.</div>
					<a name="07012479000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">Essentially, the hon. Member
for Chipping Barnet invites me to explain the peculiarity of the
UK&#146;s debt market, which lies behind the role that we propose for
the Chancellor. As the Committee knows, all giltsare issued
under a prospectus, and in the UK the prospectus of certain
index-linked gilts contains the right for the holders of those gilts to
redeem them early at par, or face value, under certain circumstances
relating to changes in the construction of the retail prices
index.</div>
					<a name="07012479000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
said that it seems that no other country has such provisions as those
that we propose. That is because the prospectuses for index-linked
gilts issued in other countries do not contain the obligation for the
Governments of those countries to redeem those gilts in such specific
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07012479000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">Were
the clause to be triggered at a time when gilts were trading below face
value, there could be real and severe consequences to the financial and
debt markets and to public finances, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West has pointed out. That is why clause 19
provides that before the board makes any changes to the RPI it must
consult not the Chancellor but the Bank of England about whether the
change constitutes a fundamental change in the index that would be
materially detrimental to the interests of the holders of the relevant
index-linked gilts&#151;in other words, whether it is likely to
trigger the clause in those prospectuses. If, and only if, the Bank of
England is of the opinion that the change would be materially
detrimental, the board must obtain the Chancellor&#146;s consent to
that change. Should the Bank determine that the change is not
fundamental or materially detrimental to the holders of certain
index-linked gilts, the Chancellor will play no part in making any
proposed changes.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 227</div>
					<a name="07012479000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady&#146;s amendment
proposes that in the narrow and specifically defined circumstances that
I have just mentioned, consultation with the Chancellor would be
required rather than consent. I do not accept the amendment&#151;I
hope that she will accept my argument&#151;because it does not
provide adequate protection against the possible consequences for the
public finances or the severe disruption of an orderly gilts and wider
financial market.</div>
					<a name="07012479000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to give an indication of the scale of the potential consequences.
This is hypothetical, but nevertheless we might find circumstances in
which it could be the case. If the Government had to redeem the
index-linked gilts, that would lead to large-scale refinancing of up to
&#163;91 billion of additional and unplanned gilts. To put that in
perspective, it is three times the average annual gilt issue, which
stands at about &#163;31 billion. There could also be real fiscal
costs, as the hon. Lady will appreciate, principally because it is
likely that new gilts would need to be issued at higher yields than
those being replaced. That could lead, we calculate, to additional
fiscal costs of up to an average of &#163;0.9 billion a year for the
financial years through to 2030-31. That is why it is crucial that the
Chancellor, as the Minister who is democratically accountable in the
end for public finances, retains the ability to prevent such a
potentially costly event. Its possible impact under the circumstances
set out in the Bill is on the public finances and the financial
markets, not on statistics. It is right, therefore, that the Chancellor
should make the final decision rather than the board.</div>
					<a name="07012479000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not to say that we
would expect the role of the Chancellor to be triggered. The Bank of
England has not assessed any of the changes to the RPI since 1997 as
fundamental and materially detrimental to the holders of the relevant
index-linked gilts. Accordingly, even if the provision had been in
place since 1997, the Chancellor&#146;s role would never have been
triggered.</div>
					<a name="07012479000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was
an exchange between the hon. Lady and my hon. Friend the Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West about the use of a sunset clause. Although
there is not a sunset clause in clause 19, all the gilts to which it
refers are due to expire in 2030 so there is de facto an automatic end
to the point at which the Chancellor&#146;s role and consent would be
required. In relation to the question posed by the hon. Member for
Twickenham, it is necessary to have a clause not because the RPI is
somehow a statistic that is first among equals and more important than
the others but because of the matter of redemption rights in certain
index-linked gilts that attach specifically to the retail prices index.
That is the purpose of the clause and the reason for it and the
safeguards. The hon. Lady said that this is a probing amendment. I hope
that she has probed far enough and will accept the unamended
clause.</div>

						</b> With our amendment, we are once again having a
gentle tilt at the parliamentary draftsmen, but the amendment is wholly
uncontroversial and I hope that the Government will help us with it.
Clause 25 concerns the board&#146;s function in reporting to
Parliament. Subsections (1) and (2) set out the procedure for annual
reporting, and state that the board &#147;must&#148; produce an
annual report and lay it before Parliament and the devolved Assemblies.
Subsections (3) and (4) then state, for no obvious reason, that it
&#147;may&#148; undertake other reports on matters relating to the
exercise of its functions, and leave it open as to whether any such
report should be laid before Parliament and the devolved Assemblies.
That prompts the question as to what they are preparing such reports
for&#151;in a vacuum for their own amusement, perhaps.</div>
					<a name="07012479000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is about embedding
the reports of the board in parliamentary accountability. What we

certainly intended in that spirit, and I hope that the Minister will

						I have already discussed

him for raising this matter and for his constructive approach. Under
the present drafting of the Bill, reports produced under clause 25(1)
must be laid before Parliament and the devolved legislatures. In
contrast, under clause 25(3), the board has only an option of laying
discretionary reports before Parliament or the devolved legislatures.
Looking at the matter, I find myself in agreement with the hon. Member
for Twickenham. If the board produces a report under subsection (3)
about a matter relating to the exercise of its functions, it must lay
the report before one or more of Parliament or the devolved
legislatures. That is entirely consistent with the Government&#146;s
desire for parliamentary scrutiny to be at the heart of the new
arrangements. I will be happy to accept amendments Nos. 89 and

						Clause 27 gives the Chancellor of
the Exchequer powers to direct the board if it has failed to comply
with its objectives or perform any of its functions, placing the office
at the heart of the process when things go wrong, which hopefully will
be very infrequently. Clause 27(2), (3) and (4) appear to give Scottish
and Welsh Ministers, and the Northern Ireland Department of Finance and
Personnel, the same powers but, of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column229" />Column number: 230</div>course, it is not quite the same. Paragraph 116 of the explanatory notes
states that devolved Administrations will have powers in &#147;a
similar manner&#148;, but not exactly the same powers.</div>
					<a name="07012479000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
territorial appointments discussed in a previous sitting are not
actually made by the devolved Administrations but by the Treasury
following consultations. Scottish Ministers cannot offer disclosure of
information to or from the board without consent. Clause 27 operates in
the same way for the measures dealing with directions when things go
wrong. In a case of failure to comply or perform, the express consent
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, not the Treasury, is required
before the devolved Administrations can issue directions. I might argue
that clause 27 follows a rather sad pattern of Treasury command and
control of the size and composition of the board, appointments to the
board and so on, but I will not make the case speaking to my amendment.
I merely argue that it is completely unnecessary, not least because the
direction given by Scottish Ministers in clause 27(2) relates only to
Scottish devolved statistics, something in which the Chancellor has, or
should have, no locus whatever. My amendments would remove the
requirement for the Chancellor&#146;s consent in subsection (2), and
subsection (9), which is the catch-all measure that would stop Scottish
Ministers exercising the functions of the board in the case of its
failure to comply other than with the direct consent of the
Chancellor.</div>
					<a name="07012479000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tabled
the amendments because the powers given to the Scottish Ministers, even
with consent, relate only to devolved statistics, so UK Treasury
consent should be wholly
unnecessary.</div>
					<a name="07012479000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
speak briefly to amendments Nos. 9 to 12. Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 to
clause 45 would remove the requirement for Treasury consent before
Scottish Ministers can authorise the disclosure of information to the
board. Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 to clause 49 would remove the same
requirement before Scottish Ministers can authorise the disclosure by
the board. As with amendments Nos. 7 and 8, the proposals are
unnecessary as clause 45 applies only to Scottish public authorities
under the control of the Executive, and clause 49 allows information to
be disclosed only to public authorities.</div>
					<a name="07012479000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clauses allow the Treasury,
quite rightly in UK matters, to direct the board where there has been a
failure to comply or to perform and the Treasury has the ability to
authorise disclosure to and from the board to public bodies. Scottish
Ministers, Welsh Ministers and the Northern Ireland Departments have a
similar provision, but it still requires the consent of the Treasury.
It is a parent-child relationship which many will resent. However, the
key point is that the only information being discussed is devolved
statistics. In terms of disclosure to and from the board it relates
only to Scottish public authorities defined in the
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07012479000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
power of consent is completely unnecessary and I ask the Financial
Secretary to look again at the issue. The Administrations in Wales and
Scotland have their own mandate; they are properly elected, functioning
Administrations with a Parliament and an Assembly. I hope that one day
Ministers in Northern Ireland will take control again, as is specified
in the documentation with the Bill.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 231</div>
					<a name="07012479000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">To require Treasury consent, and
in some cases specific consent from the Chancellor in order for

is
unnecessary.</div>

Healey:
						</b> The clause has been drafted to ensure that the
devolved Administrations can play a full part in the work of the
statistics board and so that they can have control over matters
relating to wholly devolved statistics. For statistics that are not
wholly devolved, the Bill establishes an appropriate framework for
interaction between the board and the relevant devolved
Administrations.</div>
					<a name="07012479000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
respect of amendments Nos. 7 and 8 tabled by the hon. Member for
Dundee, East, the powers in clause 27 are designed to protect the
public interest so that if, and only if, the board fundamentally fails
to deliver, for any reason, the Government can intervene, always
publicly and in writing, to ensure that the board&#146;s obligations
are met. The clause provides an important safeguard, allowing the
Chancellor of the Exchequer or the devolved Administrations to give the
board such directions as are, in those circumstances, appropriate in
the event of such a serious failure by the board to perform any of its
functions or to comply with EU
obligations.</div>
					<a name="07012479000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say
this to the hon. Gentleman: it is appropriate that the
Chancellor&#146;s consent be needed for directions from Scottish
Ministers. That is a last resort because a board failure might affect
the position of statistics throughout the United Kingdom and so it is
important that such directions be consistent. The consent will ensure
that the directions are co-ordinated and that the Bill does not create
any potentially conflicting powers. In addition, the resourcing of the
board, in order to remedy a serious failure, will remain the
responsibility of the UK Parliament, to which the Chancellor will, of
course, be accountable. In such circumstances, shared accountability is
important for such decisions and
interventions.</div>
					<a name="07012479000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
been working closely with the Scottish Executive, as the Committee
would expect, to ensure that the provisions in the Bill are appropriate
to&#151;in this case&#151;Scotland. I can confirm that Scottish
Ministers have agreed to their role in giving directions to the board
in the case of a serious failure, including to the requirement for the
Chancellor&#146;s consent. The Scottish Parliament is being asked for
its consent as well via the legislative consent motion currently lodged
with it.</div>
					<a name="07012479000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendments
Nos. 9 to 12, we will discuss clauses on data sharing a little later.
Essentially, the Bill sets out a mechanism for data sharing for
statistical purposes between the board and public authorities only. The
key point is that the mechanisms in clauses 45 and 49 mirror the
mechanisms in other data-sharing clauses, which generally require the
consent of the Treasury, as the body with residual legislative
responsibility for the board, and of the Minister responsible for the
other body involved in the data sharing. That will ensure that the
Minister for the body disclosing data and the one responsible for the
body receiving the data are both content for the regulation to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 232</div>be made. I see no reason why the provisions in Scotland should be any
different from those applying else where. On that basis, I hope that
the hon. Gentleman will not press his
amendment.</div>

						</b> On amendments Nos. 7 and 8, I recognise that clause
27 is designed as a safeguard. I understand the argument that
identified flaws might be universal and not simply relate to Scotland.
However, on data sharing, which, as the Minister mentioned, we will
have the opportunity to discuss in more detail later, I take issue with
him when he said that the requirement is that both sides be content.
That might be the intention and what is provided for in other
legislation, but this Bill requires that the Treasury give consent, not
that both parties be considered content with the data sharing. However,
I shall not seek to press my amendments, although I might wish to
return to them on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

serious matter. A failure by the board to comply with its objectives or

likely to be given lightly. In reply to the hon. Member for Dundee,
East, the Minister said that it is right that the remedy remain with
Parliament because that is where, he hopes, due accountability will be
exercised under the process. As I understand the clause, directions
from the Chancellor or devolved Ministers must be in writing, but do
not have to be public.</div>
					<a name="07012479000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is true that under
subsection (7) a direction must be published in such a manner that the
authority to which it is directed must be aware of it. However, that
could mean any type of notice&#151;a notice in the <i class="I">Edinburgh
Gazette</i>, for example. It could be very localised. If Parliament is
to exercise its ultimate accountability functions, it must be aware of
any direction made. I suppose that it is too much to hope that the
Government might accept a second set of amendments, but I cannot see
how he could logically oppose this one. He introduced the idea that
Parliament has ultimate accountability, so I think that Parliament must
be aware of directions laid under subsection (7). That is the purpose
of the
amendment.</div>

						I do not think that that

intended to be used as a last resort when there is a serious failure to
carry out the duties with which Parliament will charge the board. It
may be that that failure will require rapid direction on the
Chancellor&#146;s behalf or that of Ministers in devolved

issue such directions might be the approach that the hon. Member for

strengthening and deepening public understanding of statistics? The
concerns in all parts of the Committee about possible misuses of
official statistics might be alleviated somewhat if the public had
greater understanding of their purpose, how they are used and how they
are collected. It is necessary to encourage people to participate in
official surveys, which might be easier if the public understood why
the surveys were being carried out and their importance to the policy
making process.</div>
					<a name="07012479000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Like
Opposition Members, I have been making international comparisons. A
number of countries set a lot of store by increasing public
understanding of the use of statistics, most notably Japan. There is
evidence that that encourages the public to participate in Government
surveys. Interestingly, there is also a national statistics day in
Japan, although I am not sure whether I advocate that idea. I have not
tabled an amendment, but I would be grateful for information on Report
about how we might encourage the development of greater public
understanding. I refer the Minister to a recent article in the
<i class="I">Public Understanding of Science </i>journal that makes the point
that statistical misunderstandings occur and that we should attempt to
tackle the problem. I would be grateful if that was
done.</div>

						</b> My hon. Friend has obviously been doing her
research. I was unaware that Japan holds a national statistics day,
which is not something that I am inclined to write into the Bill,
although we will bear it in mind. As she will understand, I cannot
answer for the board&#146;s intentions as she asks me to. She is
right that there is widespread concern about the difficulty of
maintaining high response rates to certain important surveys and that
better understanding of statistics and their use may well help. I
anticipate that as the board becomes established and starts to
undertake its duties, it will study the points made during our
proceedings and that it will want to consider the
matter.</div>

Michael:
						</b> On amendments Nos. 198 and 199, there is a point
of principle about sharing data to provide a public benefit. On
occasions, there have been problems with sharing data. Lazy
bureaucrats, aided and abetted by lazy data protection advisers and
lazy legal advisers, far too often respond to the possibility 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 236</div>of sharing information with others by acting as if it were safer not to
share data. They often claim that they are doing so on so-called data
protection grounds, but that is wrong. They ought to follow best
practice in data management, which involves balancing the benefits to
sharing data with the disbenefits. I am pleased that the amendment is
supported by the Association of Regional Observatories and
others.</div>
					<a name="07012479000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
199 is intended to tease out what I believe to be the intention of the
drafting&#151;that is, to ensure that access to statistics is as easy
and quick as possible for those who will use them for practical
purposes, such as to inform service delivery, develop local policies or
analyse the needs of groups in society or local communities. That is
what makes it essential for researchers in local government and in
non-governmental organisations or charities to have quick and easy
access, provided that they meet the criteria set out in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07012479000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">Access must not
be restricted to statisticians and researchers in universities when
such access is vital for those who work for the betterment of the lives
of those who are represented in the figures, through local authorities,
charities, NGOs and other agencies. I hope that my hon. Friend the
Financial Secretary will not only agree with me about that, but confirm
that what I am saying is the correct legal interpretation of the
clause. It is important for those people to have access to the
statistics with the minimum of
bureaucracy.</div>
					<a name="07012479000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">I learned
of an excellent example of the value of that only today, in discussing
housing complaints with representatives of the National Association of
Citizens Advice Bureaux, although I did not know that it would
illuminate this debate as effectively as I hope it will. Nowadays, 70
per cent. of citizens advice bureaux record their cases electronically,
on a system called Case. They can quickly analyse cases by age,
ethnicity, household size or income level, as well as the nature of the
complaints that lead people to seek advice. Citizens advice bureaux
have some 5.2 million client interfaces each year, whether on the
telephone or in interviews, so the system is of significance. To meet
their second aim of informing public policy, it is vital to overlie
those client statistics on official statistics, to provide an accurate
framework for comparison and analysis. The example of housing is an
excellent one, but similar examples can also be found that inform the
work of people at the local authority level in improving the quality of
life for our
people.</div>
					<a name="07012479000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some academics
work with policy makers to improve the quality of local life. I have
referred to some of them. They include Professor John Shepherd of
Birkbeck college and his work on rural statistics; Professor Jonathan
Shepherd at the University Hospital in Wales, whose work on reducing
violence was seminal; and Professor Howard Williams, who analysed local
data in the Ely area of the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member
for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan).</div>
					<a name="07012479000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also acknowledge the fact
that people working in the Office for National Statistics, Ministers
and Treasury officials have shown real commitment to enabling us to
drill down to the most local level of analysis. I hope that the
Minister will assure me on both points: that that is the
Government&#146;s intention and that the capacity to use information
properly to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 237</div>improve people&#146;s quality of life, which will be the focus of the
board&#146;s activities, is what the Bill is intended to bring
about.</div>
					<a name="07012479000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">Dr.
Cable:</b>
						There is an obvious link between clause 35
on the use of statistical information and the confidentiality
provisions of clause 36. The amendments that my colleague and I have
tabled relate to the confidentiality provisions. We want doubly to
ensure that there is no misuse, as provided in clause 35. The key point
is to be aware of the overriding purpose of statistics. The right hon.
Gentleman was absolutely right: both professionally and in our current
jobs, we all encounter examples of pettiness and restrictiveness in the
use of figures. There is often a box-ticking approach to regulation,
which is not very
helpful.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07012479000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
need to focus on the central objective, which is to build public
confidence&#151;both corporate and individual&#151;in statistics.
Businesses will not collaborate in giving accurate and honest
information if they have any suspicion that their data will be made
available to their competitors, unwittingly or otherwise. Similarly,
individuals are not likely to contribute to statistical surveys,
particularly in highly sensitive areas like the census, if there is any
suspicion that data might be misused. We therefore take the view shared
by the Royal Statistical Society and others that the confidentiality
provisions of the Bill need to be sharpened, although the Bill clearly
provides for some protection. We have suggested various routes in the
group of amendments.</div>
					<a name="07012479000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
new clause, which is brief and to the point, says that personal data
disclosed to the board or National Statistician is subject to the
provisions of clause 36. In other words, the use of data as described
in clause 35 is subject to all the penalties and protections of clause
36. Clause 36 should be sharpened and clarified. We have suggested two
amendments, amendments Nos. 118and 119, which are designed to
achieve that aim, particularly via a chapeau, a phrase, that covers
various groups of people by
saying:</div>
					<a name="07012479000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Personal
information...shall not be used except in relation to the exercise
of any of the Board&#146;s and National Statistician&#146;s
functions.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012479000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next
amendment then defines the groups of individuals to which it would be
legitimate and appropriate to release statistical
information.</div>
					<a name="07012479000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the
Government, our broad objective is to show that confidentiality is
protected, for public confidence reasons. There is a view, certainly in
the statistical community, that the Bill could be stronger and clearer.
That is why we have tabled our
amendments.</div>
					
					<a name="07012479000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012479000643"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I should like to speak first to amendment No. 153,
which is in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping
Barnet. We picked up on the point made by the hon. Member for
Twickenham at the outset of his remarks. The amendments are seeking to
probe the nature of the clause, with a view to establishing a greater
confidence in the security and confidentiality of data collected by the
board for the preparation of statistics. If we are to achieve some of
the benefits of the Bill&#151;greater access to administrative data,
for example, to reduce the cost 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 238</div>of preparation&#151;then we need to make sure that people are
comfortable that when data are supplied to the board their use is
protected and
safeguarded.</div>
					<a name="07012479000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
amendment No. 153 deletes subsection (4)(a), which states that
disclosure can take place where there has been a legislative enactment
to override the duty of confidentiality. My concern is that data are
collected for one purpose by the ONS&#151;statistical
output&#151;but the Government then seek access for a different
purpose, which is almost using the ONS as a conduit for acquiring
information. We should be very clear that the information gateway
should not be through the ONS but between the two end users, which is
why I am concerned about subsection
(4)(a).</div>
					<a name="07012479000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
154 leaves out subsection (4)(c). In clarification, given that
information is provided to the board to enable it in clause 36(1) to
undertake any of its functions, why is there an override in clause
36(4)(c)? I should have thought that the provisions of subsection (1)
would be adequate to cover
that.</div>
					<a name="07012479000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
155 to 159 are on approved research and access to data. Amendment No.
155 would delete clause 36(4)(h), and the other amendments are
consequential on that. I am concerned about why approved researchers
might need access to information that would enable them to identify
somebody. Why cannot that information be provided to them in an
anonymous form so that they cannot trace which individuals supplied it?
I would welcome clarification of that
point.</div>
					<a name="07012479000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 36(10)
contains exemptions on the use of data in cases where a person did not
reasonably believe that they could have identified a person from the
data that they used. On paragraph (c), I shall return to the example of
the 2001 census to illustrate the ease with which it is possible to
identify a person from data collected from different sources.
Information was collected at postcode level, so data were collected,
for example, for SO31 6NL, where I live. There are22 houses
covered by that postcode. I do not know the domestic circumstances of
all the residents of The Vale, but an analysis of the data might be
sufficient to identify which individuals supplied which data, based on
the number of children in a household, people&#146;s occupations and
qualifications and so on. We should be careful in giving carve-outs
exempting people from prosecution because the granularity of the data
provided, in conjunction with other publicly available information,
could mean that people inadvertently or even deliberately find personal
information.</div>
					<a name="07012479000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 162 would amend clause 38, which enables the disclosure of
information to service providers. A third party might be involved in
the census, for example, or data collection and analysis might be
subcontracted to service providers as part of the commercial
arrangements that the board might make. The clause states that the
board must consider whether it
is</div>
					<a name="07012479000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;necessary or
appropriate to do so&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07012479000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is interesting to compare that with clause 36(8), which states that
approved researchers must sign a declaration to demonstrate that they
have understood the requirements of that clause. No similar obligation
is placed on third-party service providers. There should be a degree of
consistency between the provisions for approved researchers and service
providers.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012479000644"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The amendments bring us to the part of the Bill
that is concerned with confidentiality and data access. I suspect that
we shall return in more detail to some of the points that have been
raised when we consider subsequent clauses.</div>
					<a name="07012479000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ONS and the government
statistical service have a long history of maintaining data
confidentiality. They already hold securely sensitive data including
census returns, employee earnings and businesses&#146; profits. We
are taking steps, not only in the Bill, to allow the continuation of
data sharing and to extendit under certain tightly controlled
circumstances, increasing the safeguards as we do so. The hon. Member
for Twickenham said that they need to be sharper: I say that they will
be stronger protections. The Bill introduces a criminal sanction
against the unlawful disclosure of information concerning both
individuals and businesses, whether held by board members and employees
or anyone to whom the board has passed data that identify an individual
or business or allow someone to deduce that
identity.</div>
					<a name="07012479000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
conscious of the human rights implications of the proposals and we are
sensitive to the need to strike an appropriate balance between the
wider public interest in data sharing and the rights of individuals.
The data sharing and confidentiality clauses are considered compatible
with the convention on human rights.</div>
					<a name="07012479000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon. Friend the Member
for Cardiff, South and Penarth rightly recognises the benefits to
statistics and public policy of data sharing, as do the Government and
I. He is concerned about the definition of &#147;approved
researcher&#148; in the Bill, which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 240</div>was why he tabled amendment No. 199. I want to make it clear on the
record that the definition is not limited to individuals in academic
institutions, which was his principal concern.</div>
					<a name="07012479000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 153 to 162
would all limit the board&#146;s ability to carry out the functions
that it is required by the Bill to discharge. With regard to amendment
No. 162, the board needs to be able to disclose information to service
providers. I think that the hon. Member for Fareham would accept, for
example, that the board must be able to pass data to an external IT
provider that has been contracted to undertake crucial data processing
on behalf of the board, as the ONS did when carrying out the 2001
census. I hope that after those remarks, right hon. and hon. Members
will be content not to press their amendments, although they may wish
to return to some of the points and examine them, together with the
principal case underlying our approach, in more detail as our
deliberations
continue.</div>
