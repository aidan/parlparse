<H2><center>Standing Committee A</center></H2>
<H4><center>Tuesday 16 May 2000</center></H4>
<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. Bill O'Brien in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/087/2000087.htm">Local Government Bill [Lords]</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. First, I welcome you to the Chair. As you have taken your jacket off, I assume that you are happy for the rest of us to follow suit.
<P>
I want to make a mild complaint about the late and non-arrival of certain guidance that backs up the Bill. A massive amount of draft regulations and guidance underpin the Bill, some of which we have seen, some we have not seen and some we have been promised. Some of it is in a fairly long pipeline. I think that I am right in saying that we received the second consultative drafts of the proposed guidance and regulations on new constitutions and so on only at the end of the previous sitting on Thursday. We have made efforts to go through them and take soundings, but professional and other organisations will clearly find it difficult to raise a range of issues on the basis of that late draft.
<P>
The modular constitutions to which paragraph 1.3 refers are not even included in the documents and we are told that they are likely to be available in the summer or autumn. I am sure that those involved have been doing their best and I make no criticism of them. However, that does make life rather difficult for those of us serving on the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is not a point of order for the Chair. However, I am sure that the Officers who take the minutes have taken note of the point that has been made.
<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Local authority to decide whether to</center></H4>
introduce executive arrangements
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 116 to 118.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State for Local Government and the Regions (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> I am delighted that you are in the Chair, Mr. O'Brien. From your many attendances and indeed membership of many local government Bill Committees in the previous Parliament, you know that it is probably unprecedented for a Government to have a second draft of guidance available a week before the Bill is first discussed in Committee, so I am a little anxious about the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson). He told us last week that he was not good in the mornings. On Thursday morning, he came in with the injunction that he would be extra churlish and difficult, because we were sitting so early and that was his wont early in the morning. As we gave him an early night last night and we have not had such an early start this morning, I had thought that he might have recovered, but he has not. Clearly, he went out on the town last night, had a difficult time and a late night. He has woken up with a sore head and we all have to suffer.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. I am sorry to interrupt the Minister in her flow. I was not out on the town last night, but I still do not understand why clause 9 is listed as clause stand part and three amendments that refer to clause 10 have been grouped with it, after which we will debate clause 10. I cannot understand the direction of our debate this morning. Could you assist me?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Clause 9 refers to making executive decisions mandatory. These amendments are part of that business and that is why they have been grouped together.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> With respect, the amendments are to clause 10.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am advised by the Clerk that that is not a problem. The amendments are related and that is the reason why we are opening with this group. This is a wide-ranging debate and the amendments have therefore been placed together.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am pleased that you answered that, Mr. O'Brien, because the grouping of amendments is a matter for the Chair and not for me. I am delighted that the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) wants to rescue the hon. Member for Eastbourne, whose difficulties I shall not discuss again. The hon. Member for Eastbourne knows that we have tried to make guidance available as early as possible. As I said, that is the second draft of the guidance, which will be redrafted following consultation. When the Conservative party was in power, we received guidance only after a Bill had completed all its stages and we certainly never had drafts on which to comment in Committee.
<P>
The Lords accepted Opposition amendments to the clause and, as I have said many times, those amendments were contradictory. To sort that out, we will not agree that the clause should stand part. I will fully explain the Government's approach to the clause and speak to Government amendments Nos. 116, 117 and 118. No amendments to the clause have been submitted, which is unacceptable because of the Lords amendments, so we do not want it to stand part. By making those amendments and not supporting the clause, we will reverse the situation created by the Opposition amendments made in the other place, and prevent councils from maintaining the status quo.
<P>
We have discussed our reforms of political management structures several times. To the Opposition, they are the most important aspect of the Bill. I regret that, because much more in the Bill is also important. The political management reforms will take place in the context of a series of modernising changes in local government. Examining those changes together will help one to understand the reforms that we are recommending.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The first page of the guidance contains the phrase ``reform and modernisation''. What is the distinction between those two processes?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> One could reform simply by abolishing local government. We are not doing that. We want to ensure that local government is fitted for the modern age and the way in which the world has changed during the past century, especially the post-war years. Local government is important and facilitates local democratic expression. It should have a role that enables it to be powerful in Britain, as it is today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I would like to make some progress, rather than become involved in pedantic wordplay that means little to the punters out there.
<P>
I suspect that the Opposition will say that councils should be allowed to decide how they operate for themselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I assure the right hon. Lady that I started the day in a relatively good mood, which I hope that she will not spoil. I urge her not to keep predicting my arguments or what I will say about the relative merits or importance of any provisions. She will have every opportunity to reply to my comments, but if she sticks to telling us why she thinks that the proposals are so great, she will save me from having to keep intervening and we shall make more rapid progress.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman really is in a state this morning. He is concerned that my case will draw on what he has said in the past, but I need to be able to make my speech in the way that I think is appropriate and that is what I shall do. I never attempt to tell the hon. Gentleman how to make his speeches, but perhaps I should—he might do a bit better.
<P>
At the Committee's first sitting, we had history lessons from a couple of hon. Members, including an interesting one from the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders). He set out to show that our proposals were not new, and, indeed, it is thirty years since the Maud committee reported on the management of local government. Its report saw the committee system as involving
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the production of increasing volumes of paper which demands staff, is often wasteful of officers' time, is expensive to produce and which often overwhelms members. The committee system makes heavy demands on members' time.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Thirty years later, the Audit Commission—an impartial voice—identified the same problems in its report ``Representing the People: The Role of Councillors''. The report concluded:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>committees can be unnecessarily slow and cumbersome,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the system is also expensive in terms of the opportunity cost of senior management time.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The greatest weakness of the committee system is that, despite the time and resources that they devote to running it, councils often take their major decisions outside it. I think that the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon may have been referring in his initial contribution to the 1993 report by the joint Government and local government working party, which includes both the Government and the local authority associations. The report concluded:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Most major policy decisions in practice are not taken by the full council, its committees or subcommittees but elsewhere within the ruling groups—where there is a majority group—or in consultation with the leadership of other groups where there is a minority administration or coalition . . . formal authority may rest with the full council, or with the committee, but the real authority rests with individuals.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford </B>(Mole Valley): I hear that with interest, especially when I recall the evidence that was given to the Joint Committee and the pilots that are being run. The statement that the Minister has just made applies equally to the new system that is being run under the pilots.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The research to which the hon. Gentleman refers—
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I am not referring to research.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The report, then, deals with the early work on a research project that is being paid for out of the departmental research programme. It says that local authorities face difficulties in developing new structures within existing legislation. That is a difficult task and the hon. Gentleman is right that that is borne out in the research. That means that few councils have a new system that has got rid of the problems of the past. That is the way of change and, at the moment, councils are learning.

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am sure that the Minister understands that the essential argument is about not whether local authorities should be permitted to have different structures, but whether they should be compelled to abandon the present structure and to choose from the menu prescribed by the Government. None of us is saying that we want a purely prescriptive formula; it is the element of choice that is at the heart of the debate.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have not yet reached that part of the argument. I am highlighting problems in the committee system. The right hon. Gentleman was the Minister when the report, which was published jointly with the Local Government Association, was published. The report emphasised a point that I have consistently made—that the committee system was not the open democratic form of decision taking that it was supposed to be.
<P>
Even in the 1993 Maud report, serious problems with the committee system were highlighted. It showed that the system did not work in the way that everyone said it did—that it did not have the requisite openness, so individuals were able to take decisions and there was no means within the system to hold such individuals to account. When we came into government, we picked up that knowledge and asked whether it was time to do something about the problem and be honest with the electorate. I suggest that it is.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I will give way to the other ex-Minister from the previous Administration.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The right hon. Lady forgets that the Audit Commission—I was on it—tended to revel in the worst, but frequently provided good examples of the best practice. It pointed to many examples of local authorities that used the committee system openly, succinctly and economically. Good decisions were often taken in a clear and open manner. Local authorities are asking only to be given that option in addition to those proposed by the Government.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I hate to tell the hon. Gentleman that I was not quoting from the Audit Commission report, but from a joint report between central and local government. I admit that he was not a member of the Government then, but the report was drawn up with the involvement of local authority associations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Patrick Hall </B>(Bedford): Does my right hon. Friend agree that local government has had decades to make the committee system work in the way that the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir P. Beresford) suggested. When I was a local councillor I did my best, in my small way, to make that system work. However, the overwhelming majority of councillors did not make it work in the best way.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The problem is that the system has become so cumbersome that it cannot deliver what people expect today. Since local government was first introduced, the number of committees has grown as the powers and responsibilities of local authorities have grown. The ability for individuals to know what is going on in every sector, which the committee system was originally intended to provide, has diminished.
<P>
The hon. Member for Mole Valley has told me that good officers are required, so that councillors can leave it to them to carry out the work. What we really need, though, is councillors who can handle a strategic overview, so that a more effective scrutiny of the implementation of decisions can be undertaken. We need a system that allows councillors democratically to move forward to ensure that effective decisions are taken. They must act democratically on the public's behalf by taking decisions that are in the public interest and the public must be enabled to examine the method of implementation of such decisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> rose—
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I think that the Front Bencher feels overtaken by his Back Benchers, so I will give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> There is no competition on this side. I am delighted that the Minister is making a case. Which committee system is the hon. Lady talking of—the old-fashioned cumbersome system with its attendance culture and all that, which may still persist in some local authorities, or the more streamlined modern committee system that many authorities now have? She cannot tar them all with the same brush.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am talking of what is possible under existing legislation. As the hon. Member for Mole Valley noted, research has concluded that it is not possible to move forward and bring about genuine change. We have worked with authorities throughout the country—not only in the past three years but for a substantial time beforehand—to take things forward.
<P>
Evidence over the years is that the practice of decision making outside formal committees has increased. Does the hon. Member for Eastbourne believe that with some of the examples of which he urges me to take account, decision taking behind closed doors has lessened? In cross-over government as a whole, ever more decisions are being pushed into the informal rather than the formal process. The Local Government Management Board call this:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A concentration of decision making powers in small groups outside the formal arenas.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The pretence is maintained that it is the full council that continues to decide. The reality is that it does not; a small group—in fact, an executive—does. Frequently, the chairs of committees and the leader get together to sort matters out and put proposals to the political group, after which they go before the committee and after that the council. That is the system now operating in many councils that has operated for the past five years. That is the reality of what is happening in local government. We say that we should be honest with the public: we should let them know where decisions are being taken and who is responsible for them. We must make those details public so that authorities are more accountable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): The Minister talks as if there were only one type of local authority—a metropolitan, possibly Labour-controlled, authority. She is aware from her constituency that there are also local district councils, many of which have no overall control. Therefore, decisions are not made during private meetings of committee chairman—
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I wish that they were.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> Indeed. A democracy is sometimes a nightmare. Decisions are made in committee on those councils.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It is interesting hearing that from my neighbour. I know some of the councils in his constituency well because he represents a neighbouring constituency. That that may apply with planning matters, but it certainly did not apply when one of his local district councils acted over the transfer of its housing. It was discussed and well prepared in the informal procedure before it went to a formal committee. That has been my experience in small district and in metropolitan or county councils. Indeed, I know the hon. Gentleman's county council quite well. It is looking seriously at what it has been doing and where it has been getting it right and wrong. It would happily admit to having meetings of the chairs of committees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> It is Labour dominated.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I can take the hon. Gentleman to Kent or Essex, although Essex is no longer Tory controlled. Exactly the same has happened in Kent. It is not about one party, but about the way things have started to happen in local government. Councils have come to this view because of the nature of the decisions that they have to take, the considerations that must be taken into account, and the pace at which they must act. They have to get on with it. That form of decision taking has become the norm. We can either pretend that it is not happening and let it continue and say that it is okay to take decisions where no one is sure about who is accountable, or we say let us accept that this is the reality—
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Let me finish my argument. If we accept that the current method is not honest with the public and does not have the right sort of legislative framework to enable that decision taking to be both efficient and accountable, we must look at it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders </B>(Torbay): First, I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
The example that the Minister used was not a good one. Housing transfers are surely not about councils taking decisions but about tenants' choice. She cited the experiments that have been taking place in local government as examples of improvements, but they do not hold up to scrutiny. In authority after authority, local newspapers are running campaigns about the reduced access to information for the press and opposition councillors and the fact that meetings are held behind closed doors. Surely if those new committee structures are to work and to improve on what went before, there must be proper freedom of information and public and press access to those decisions?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Of course there does, and that is precisely what the Government have been doing and what we shall debate under clause 21. The whole idea of scrutiny and accountability needs to be embraced much more. It is new in local government and it is finding it difficult. Many authorities are finding it traumatic because they are not used to having to work in this way and many councillors are saying that their role has been diminished. The role of many councillors is changing and becoming much more important. Their contact with the public will be much more effective.
<P>
The hon. Member for Torbay says that housing transfers was not a good example, but the council's role in the movement towards housing transfer is critical. The council lays down the options for a possible transfer. Of course we have secured, and will secure through future legislation, the importance of tenants making the final decision, but the council sets the parameters. It decides whether to engage with a housing company or to transfer to an existing registered social landlord. However, there will be scrutiny, which will have an impact, so that before the final decision the process will be much clearer and more open than in the past. We want to develop that openness and accountability.
<P>
I urge members of the Committee to see the proposal not as the Government deciding that they are fed up with councils, but as an attempt to ensure that the public believe that councils are working for them, that they know what is going on and who is taking the decisions.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> Will the Minister please clarify the position? Let us suppose that a majority of councillors were against a housing transfer; a small number at the top took the decision to put it to a ballot and the tenants agreed to the transfer, but it was decided that the majority of councillors were right and therefore it was not the tenants' choice. Surely, the point of tenants' choice is that the tenants should decide, not the council.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am not sure where the hon. Gentleman is trying to take us. Tenants choose in the end, but proposals, which are developed by the council, must be put to them. I am saying that the nature of the proposals is right. There is a misunderstanding; a proposal would have to be the policy of the whole council and the executive would be in charge of deciding how it should proceed. The hon. Gentleman must work out what is the whole council's responsibility, where things are different and what is the responsibility of the housing chair if that is how the council decides to do it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for assisting the therapy for my leg; there is so much jumping up and down.
<P>
Does the Scottish Executive intend to implement parallel proposals in Scotland, or do Scottish councils have the holy grail, which has been denied to English and Welsh councils, of making the committee system work?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> As the right hon. Gentleman knows, the Scottish Executive has a group led by Neil McIntosh, I think, although I may be wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> It is a Scottish name, anyway.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It is a Scottish name, but not Macpherson. Mr. McIntosh is working with the Scottish Executive on a commission considering the future of local government in Scotland. It is a fully devolved matter; they have different councils, as the right hon. Gentleman knows. His Government took different decisions on Scotland and Wales and the structure of their councils from those in England. [Interruption]. The hon. Gentleman says that it is not a universal truth; the interesting thing is that we are the only country in the western world that continues to run a committee system—[Hon. Members: ``No''.]—well, the pure committee system that we have now. Parts of the Netherlands have a mixture. I go to meetings of the Commonwealth local government forum, in which Conservative Members did not get involved, because we are looking at developing democracy throughout the Commonwealth and there are difficulties in doing so. There are difficulties in many countries in the development of democracy and we can never be complacent about it. Opposition Members are being almost wilfully complacent because they like to have good fun. Let us take seriously the future of democracy in this country and let the public have a look in at how decisions are taken.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> While the right hon. Lady is talking about democracy—she has had 10 months to think of a response—does she remember what she said in the joint committee when she was asked what would happen if there was referendum and it was lost? It is a crucial matter in considering clause 9. The right hon. Lady said that the public would decide to stay as they were, and that that would cause problems.
<P>
The clause lets her out of those problems and provides what many people in local authorities and those that have thought about it wish for—a fourth choice.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The clause does not do exactly as the hon. Gentleman said, which is why we are having the debate; we want to find a new way forward. Conservative Members may be interested to know that, in the Netherlands, royal commission on local government is considering ways of greater separation from the executive. We are not the only ones looking at the matter; we want to ensure that we have a local government tier that can win the confidence of local people. None of us can be sure that local people have confidence in local government at present.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): This is my sixth attempt to intervene. I am not sure what the Minister is afraid of [Hon. Members: ``Ah!'']—and I have listened carefully to her. She said that different systems in different parts of the country have evolved in different ways. If that is the case, and it has happened naturally and organically, why does she want to impose a one-size-fits-all limited choice of options on every council in the country? What evidence is there that those councils that have made changes are more democratic, that the turn out in elections is higher and that the public has more of a look in than in the councils that have not made the changes? What is the evidence in the past three years for the right hon. Lady's assertions?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I welcome the hon. Gentleman to the Committee. I hope that he had a good time in Canada last week and had a chance to look at its local Government, which has an executive and scrutiny split. The hon. Gentleman may have learned some lessons in Canada, which might make him less fearful and less conservative in his view that the proposal is all about preserving rather than moving forward, as the Opposition argue.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that the current system is not delivering. I do not know how many times I have to say it: the experiments being carried out at present are within existing legislation, without the benefit of the Committee's deliberations and those of the House in respect of guidance. Whatever councils want to do has to be fitted into the existing structures and we want to change that.
<P>
Opposition Members have been going on about the Government wanting to impose a system, but that is arrant nonsense. The current system is based on legislation introduced about 150 years ago, and we cannot, legally, move away from that system at present. The informal system that I have been talking about this morning, which is the way that councils work, is not within the current system but outside it. That is why there is no accountability and why the press cannot get into the caucus meetings. There is no responsibility even to report what goes on in those meetings because they are outwith the current system.
<P>
We are not trying to impose a uniform system. There are three extremely broad frameworks within the Bill and all the research done so far demonstrates that they are being used in different ways by authorities throughout the country. The Bill's framework will provide greater variety than is possible under existing legislation. Much work and further thinking still needs to be done. Democratic matters cannot be turned round within a year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Jenkins </B>(Tamworth): My right hon. Friend knows that I have been interested in local government for some time. In passing from one authority to another throughout the country, I would become familiar with the arrangements for committee structures. I can use the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy to compare the costs of running authorities. However, as a consumer of local government services, what guarantee can my right hon. Friend give me that a particular interest group will not decide, for its own purposes, not to go along with a particular structure, thereby denying me the ability to ascertain whether I am receiving value for money? Each structure carries certain costs and I want to ensure that those costs are comparable across authorities.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> My hon. Friend raises an interesting point. He ran a local authority successfully—
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> No, it was not successful. It was a failure.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am not saying that local government is a failure; merely that it can be better. The current system does not enable authorities to act in ways that ensure both efficient decision taking and accountability. The two must be taken together, but Opposition Members seem unable to appreciate that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Minister was developing an interesting point about problems during the transitional phase. She referred to a recent report, on new forms of political management, produced by the university of Birmingham. It dealt with the experience of six councils in attempting to implement a version of the executive system. Is the Minister arguing that the flaws in their experience derived from current legal constraints? If she does not accept our points about compulsion, why not follow the legislation up with proper piloting of the proposals to see if they work?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The report was published by the Improvement and Development Agency. It was commissioned jointly between ourselves and the Local Government Association and was conducted in the university of Birmingham with the participation of a researcher from De Montfort university. The report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Evidence from the case study authorities suggests that local authorities face difficulties in developing new structures within existing legislation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Since the publication of the White Paper, some authorities have moved forward: we have learned from that experience and it has been reflected in the Bill. There has been more discussion and experimentation than is often the case with respect to legislation, and we must move forward following that discussion and experimentation.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon said during the first sitting of the Committee that if we leave it to local government, nothing will change. The response to the 1993 report was that because local authorities were not being told to do something, nothing happened. I am interested that the hon. Member for Eastbourne now pleads with us to allow experiments. The so-called Hunt Bill—the Local Government (Experimental Arrangements) Bill—a private Member's Bill, was introduced in the other place during the first Session of this Parliament in response to work done in 1993. We said that we would support the Bill, which would have allowed experimentation. It was not as extensive as the Local Government Bill. The Opposition rejected it, so they must not lecture me this morning about experiments. When we wanted them, the Opposition prevented them. We knew that we had to get on with our programme. We were prepared to run with the Hunt Bill, because we all could have learnt from its experiments. We could then have brought about change over time. The Opposition Front Bench rejected the Bill, so the experiments could not begin.
<P>
I believe strongly that we need to move forward because that is what people deserve. They are entitled to more from their local councils. They will wonder why the Opposition are so intent on preventing the introduction of other options for the running of councils. [HON. MEMBERS: ``Increase the options!''] The amendment tabled by the Conservative Opposition in the other place would not have allowed more options. Conservative Members were set on not even giving councils the option of asking local people what they want. The Lord's Bill would have cut out the opportunity to move to an executive. Opposition members are saying this morning that they want another option, but that was not their position during the debate in the other place. Local people should know who takes decisions, why they have been taken, and who can be held accountable. They should be able to influence the decision takers and be informed about how to do that. They want efficient local government delivering efficient services, as my hon. Friends have said.

<P>

<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Many local authorities now do exactly that. The Minister has been asked this question, but has not answered it. What would happen if there was a referendum, her executive scrutiny formula was turned down and the public made it clear that they wanted the status quo?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The referendum refers to the directly elected mayor model. If the referendum were lost, the local authority would have to bring in an alternative and put it out to consultation. One mark of a good local authority is that it knows that it can improve its services—
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman can debate all these issues when we debate referendums.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> It is fairly basic.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We could put the whole Bill through the Committee this morning if the hon. Gentleman wanted; that would satisfy me. However, if I have to debate every amendment, we will be in great difficulty because we will not be considering the Bill consecutively, in the way that the public want us to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> That is what my hon. Friend is trying to do.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> He wants to take us to another part of the Bill.
<P>
One mark of a good local authority is that it knows that it can improve its services year on year. It also knows that it can improve the way in which it operates and wants to do so. It should not have to rest on its laurels. Such councils want to move to executive arrangements and can see the benefits that a more efficient way of working will bring to local people. Unfortunately, as we all know, some councils—not the better ones—will simply take the opportunity not to change if it is on offer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I have listened carefully and have wanted to intervene many times, although I shall have an opportunity to speak later. The Minister said that authorities want to move forward because they can improve their decision making. Will she therefore explain the decision that Brighton and Hove council made on Thursday? The council was one of the first to move in the direction that the Minister is describing, but it has thrown out its new system. After one year's experience of the system, the council has decided that it simply does not work.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I do not know about that decision and have not read about it. However, I do know that Brighton has been struggling. Work has been going on and the council knows that it has not got the model right. It must go back, reconsider and work the model out again. That is how it should be. There should be an opportunity to assess the situation and to ask, ``Is this working?'' If it is not, councils should be able to say, ``Well, let's go back and start again''. Brighton started off with a complex and intricate system, which I always thought would run into difficulties. However, I am sure that it will work to come up with other proposals. That is exactly what needs to happen.
<P>
We need to know that things will change in such a way that the public notice the improvement. Too often, there has been an internal debate about how to keep councillors happy, rather than about engaging effectively with the public. So many of the contributions that have been made to me have been about managing groups and councillors and about keeping them happy, rather than about improving the relationship between councils and the public and ensuring not only that all councillors have a meaningful role, but that councils are not organised simply to keep their members happy. I have far too many memories of cases such as the allowances debacle, when authorities met every morning and afternoon to ensure that they got full allowances. That debate was never about providing the public with an effective service; it was about ensuring that councillors got a basic income. We want to change that status quo.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I will give way to the hon. Member for Mole Valley.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I thank the Minister for being helpful to Opposition Members, as she always is. Many authorities are getting ready for the proposed changes, because they expect them to be rammed through despite the disturbed feelings of Labour Back Benchers on the issue. One London Labour council that is getting ready has 37 scrutiny committees. Will this case not be the same?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have not heard of that, but if it is happening it is lunacy. Name the council; it is simply trying to be clever. Again, how does that inform and involve the public? Under the current system, councils can set up as many committees as they like. One council undertook a review to make things more efficient and streamlined and ended up with more committees. It meant that every member of the group could have a chair or a vice-chair position, which kept them all happy. That is not the way to get the most effective relationship with the public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I agree with much of what the Minister says. The worst abuses that she describes, such as councillors appearing to run the council to maximise their allowances, or too many council's having a plethora of committees, are problems in the system that need to be tackled. The Government can do that by changing the regulations for those activities. There is no need to turn the entire system upside down or impose new structures. Why cannot we retain the existing structures for those councils that want them, but with limits on the number of committees and allowances? Is that not another solution that local councils should be allowed to adopt, if they so choose and their electorate permit?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not come to other parts of the Bill where changes are made to the allowances system. Those changes are being made, but that is not enough to bring councils back in touch with the public. He did not mention scrutiny. How does one ensure that those who take decisions are held to account? One cannot run a council effectively without building in accountability. It is not simply about the executive, but about the holding to account.
<P>
When hon. Members object and say, ``Let us stick with the status quo'', they do not take scrutiny into account. If every member of the council is part of the decision taking, who has an interest in holding the decision takers to account? Opposition Members must answer that question this morning. If one concocts a system in which every councillor is officially part of that daily decision-taking procedure, who will hold them to account?
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> To be a little more helpful, one of the Labour authorities in London is setting the system up and is following it as carefully as it can. It has scrutiny committees, although very few and not 37. It has looked at some 600 issues in the past six months and has scrutinised one. I do not call that scrutiny.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I do not call it scrutiny either. I also take whatever the hon. Gentleman says about a Labour authority with a pinch of salt. If he wants to bring evidence to me, I shall happily look at it and talk to the leader of the authority about it. His comments reinforce our argument rather than his. He is reinforcing the argument that councillors do not have the skills or the experience of scrutiny. That is why we need a system that demands that it takes place. Some chief executives have said that they will not put any money into supporting scrutiny until it is on the statute book. They are happy with how things are going, and will not reorganise their officer forces to support a system that will give them a hard time. That attitude explains why we need the changes. Opposition Members know that decent authorities, of which I am sure most of them have experience, can act through an executive that takes tight and clear political decisions and lets its chief officer get on with his instructions.
<P>
That is the daily reality that Opposition Members try to deny. We know that such authorities exist, and Opposition Members will agree with that if they are honest. What justifies keeping the public out? The argument for keeping the status quo is all about protecting those responsible for taking decisions from real accountability to the public.
<P>
As hon. Members examine the Bill, they will learn that any member of a scrutiny committee will be able to put any item on the agenda for scrutiny. All scrutiny committees will be politically balanced. The situation that Opposition Members described could not happen under the new arrangements, because of the safeguards that we are introducing. People will have to work hard to adapt to the new culture. The position is different from that in the House, but even our Select Committees took some time to work out how to scrutinise effectively because that is a different and important way of working.
<P>
We oppose the inclusion of clause 9.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The right hon. Lady said that scrutiny committees will be balanced. Will all parties have equal representation, or will they be in the same proportions as on each council?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Equal representation would be difficult to achieve in some authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Craven district council has no Labour members.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Exactly. Some councils lack members of some political parties, so we will work within the legislation on political balance in committees, which a Conservative Government introduced. I am generous about giving way, but we need interventions that develop the debate and are not as pathetic as that.
<P>
Amendment No. 117 clarifies the drafting on our policy that every local authority operating executive arrangements should have a single executive. That refers back to a point that I made when the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) was out of the Room, so I will repeat it, because his party has pushed the issue. If every member of the council were in the executive in some way, no one would be able to scrutinise the executive or hold it to account, and the public's confusion would increase. It should be clear to the public whom they can hold accountable.
<P>
In my area, I frequently ask people whether they know who the chair of education is, because in my local authority that chair has a lot of influence and is responsible for a large budget. The chair changes every two years, which is as much about keeping everyone happy and ensuring that they all have a job as anything else. However, that means that people outside do not have a clue about who the chair is. I must confess that I am not even sure myself at the moment, because I suspect that it has changed again in the past week.
<P>
The public should know who in the authority is responsible for key areas of policy and implementation. It is right to say that we organise the council so that it gives the public the best opportunity to know who is doing things, how to hold those people accountable, how to reach them and how they can get their questions asked. These wide models will provide that opportunity. On that basis, I do not want clause 9 to stand part. I have already spoken on the amendments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> We have now reached what Lord Whitty in the House of Lords called the central part of the Bill. You have already been good enough, Mr. O'Brien, to say that this group of amendments, which straddles more than one clause, calls for a wide-ranging debate. A good starting point is the following statement of principle, because it is high time that we returned to basic principles, rather than becoming lost in the morass of complexity that the Government are trying to impose on local government:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>People should have a real choice about how they are governed locally.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are not my words, but those of the Deputy Prime Minister in his foreword to the White Paper ``Local Leadership, Local Choice''.
<P>
The fundamental difficulty that Opposition Members and, I suspect, Government Members have with this part of the Bill is the element of compulsion and the apparent intention of Ministers to impose a narrow set of structures on local government. That is all very strange. In a moment, I will deal with the views of many organisations, councils and individuals with a lot of experience in local government who have expressed concerns about the Government's proposals. Let us remember—because the Minister started with a history lesson—that the Government, to their credit, set up a Joint Committee to consider the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley was a member of that Committee. No doubt he will have something to say about his experiences. Why would the Government ignore the clear advice of that Committee—with which I will deal in more detail in a moment—on the central issue of compulsion?
<P>
The real difficulty is that the issue has become enmeshed with the inevitable post mortem that has followed the recent local election results. A Government who, at the beginning of this stage, might have been prepared to consider alternatives, and who have indeed been negotiating for some time with the Local Government Association about alternatives, have hardened their heart on this part of the Bill. Although they perhaps had a salutary shock in the local elections, the net result is that local government as a whole will have to pay. That is the attitude that we are getting from Ministers. The loss of some 600 seats across the country and the humiliation of the Government's mayoral candidate in London must be paid for. Retribution will be exacted and this is the vehicle for doing just that.
<P>
The Government are deeply scarred by the Livingstone fiasco in London and as a result do not trust local democracy. They are offering local government not modernisation—that ghastly overworked word—but a straitjacket. Their insistence on imposing centrally dictated structures for local councils borders on the Stalinist. Cabinet-style local government runs the risk of creating a gang of fat cat, permanent politicians who are out of touch with the real world. Even worse, the Government will allow them to make key decisions that affect local people, behind closed doors. So much for open government.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman let us know when Stalin built into his system the accountability and openness that we have put in the Bill and the guidance?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that we shall not have a history lesson on Stalin. Perhaps hon. Members will stick to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I would be delighted to be drawn down the avenue of Soviet history: there are some interesting parallels with the Government's present proposals. But you would rightly draw me back to the path of righteousness, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
I was talking about secrecy. As the Minister said, we shall have a major debate on clause 21, on secrecy and openness. However, it is worthy making the point in passing and in analysing some expert comment on this part of the Bill that the secrecy provision is a major problem not only for journalists, editors and—[Interruption.] I am sorry, but it is difficult to pick up the Minister's sedentary interventions.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman is behind the times. Substantial changes in the guidance mean that the lobby groups will move their position. I shall meet them before we debate clause 21. Substantial alterations to the access to information aspect meet the concerns that have been expressed. I do not want the hon. Gentleman to get into trouble because he has not kept up to date with events.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Well, is not that rich, Mr. O'Brien? I began this morning by saying that we had been given the redrafted guidance rather late. I have been through it and I do not accept the Minister's characterisation of the clause, but I will not get into that now. I do not believe that the right hon. Lady has responded to the principal concerns expressed by some of the organisations. It is wholly unacceptable to criticise us for being behind the times. I am delighted that the right hon. Lady will have meetings with some of those people; let us see whether something comes of them.
<P>
As we have said, guidance is one thing, but there is a great deal to be said for putting the really important things in the Bill. Let the right hon. Lady not think that hiding away behind draft guidance and having little behind-closed-doors meetings with lobby groups will solve the problem. We are all quite fond of the Minister and would not want her to be sacked, or reshuffled. However, she and her colleagues have painted themselves into a corner here. There was a window of opportunity following the debates in the Lords when I, as an eternal optimist, felt that the Government had the chance to reconsider these proposals and listen to people who know what they are talking about. No one would have criticised the Government. We might have pointed out that they should have done that earlier, but we would have backed them. On Second Reading, however, both Lord Whitty and the Minister effectively said, ``No. These are the options. Take it or leave it.''
<P>
The Minister's speech was a model of her approach to local government. As on Second Reading, she damned the entire committee system in all its manifestations and infinite variety and, at a stroke, damned the serious substantial record in local government of hon. Members on both sides of the House and elsewhere. There was talk of the past 150 years. There was no reference on this occasion to the squirearchy—hon. Members may recall that moment of high comedy during Second Reading. The basic message was simple: the committee system is old fashioned, does not work and is untreatable. It is in terminal decline and there is no way in which it can be saved or improved.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
As I tried to tell the Minister in an intervention—she was generous in accepting them—we may he talking about different things. Are we talking about the old-fashioned committee system? I remember the attendance culture when I was a councillor in the 1970s, with endless committees and sub-committees. It was, of course, a Labour-run council and I suspect that the motives included maximising opportunities for allowances as well as serving the public. However, the system is different today. North Yorkshire, for example, has four main committees and many other councils—not all, I accept—have streamlined, effective and efficient committee systems.
<P>
Conservative Members are not in the business of attempting to secure a bland, homogenised, uniform structure of local government throughout the country. Nor is it a question of being a conservative with a small ``c''. We are far from being in the minority on this matter; indeed, it is the Minister who is very much in the minority.
<P>
I must raise an issue to which we shall return in greater detail when we debate the draft guidance. One of the Minister's main concerns about the operation of the current committee system is what she called the informality of decision making—the smoke-filled room syndrome, I suppose. Has she not read the concerns of experts and others who work on behalf of council officers about the informality inherent in the executive or cabinet system? The real difficulties, especially for younger, less experienced officers, lie in their close day-to-day dealings with members of the executive.
<P>
Piloting was another important element of the Minister's speech. Thanks to an intervention by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon, we know that we are the pilot. As far as the Scots are concerned, the whole of England and Wales is the pilot. We shall have to see how it works out. It is a mystery to all of us why the Scots are being excluded, at least for the time being, from this privilege. Mr. Macduff or Mr. McIntosh—whoever is running the review body—will, if he does his job properly, take note of mistakes made here in the English pilot.
<P>
The Minister tried hard to distance herself from the recent report. Under the headline ``Cabinet pioneers fail to deliver democratic dream'', an article in the Local Government Chronicle makes worrying reading. The report by the Improvement and Development Agency, prepared by the university of Birmingham, contains some damning conclusions. It pointed out that councils were putting structures in place ahead of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman read the report, or only the LGC's version of it? The report has been available for several weeks and I hope that he will go to the source rather than accept comments about it from others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I hope that the LGC will take due note of that intervention. The Minister cannot commend the reading of the report as worthwhile and at the same time try to distance herself—and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions—from it.
<P>
The report states that it is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>hard to see how executives as currently constructed will contribute in terms of openness and inclusiveness—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
not quite the message that we have heard from the Minister. [Interruption.] I am coming to that. The report also states that the six unnamed councils were ``struggling'' to establish effective overview and scrutiny and that some scrutiny committees had difficulty establishing a meaningful role and received only limited, dedicated officer support—a point that was, in fairness, echoed in some of the Minister's remarks.
<P>
We should recal1 that the report was prepared by the highly respected and reputable unit at the university of Birmingham. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>some of the current opaqueness—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is the word—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of the new systems will have to dissipate before real benefits in terms of accountability can be achieved.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The good bit, which is not in the report—how could it be?—is the comment from an anonymous DETR spokesperson, who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The way most councils are developing the new arrangements isn't what is intended. We are not going to get it right first time.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is that not the whole point? The report is extraordinarily significant, but even more significant are the comments of the anonymous spokesperson from the DETR. As I understand it, the Minister was saying that one cannot blame the councils for getting it hopelessly wrong because the legislation is not in place. That explains why they got into difficulties.
<P>
Let us forget the enormous cost and disruption to local government, which has been going on for a long time, because Ministers and district auditors keep telling them to introduce the structures. To take an example plucked from the air, Durham city council has budgeted £300,000 towards the cost of establishing a cabinet structure, as reported in the Newcastle Journal. Costs have been incurred throughout local government by people who think that they are getting ahead of the game in time for the legislation, with the result that there are a range of different models, some of which will fit into the measure when it is enacted, and some of which will not. That is not what the Government want. If that is true, and it is accepted by both sides of the Committee—it seems to be underpinned by a highly reputable and independent report—why on earth do the Government continue to set their face against a proper pilot study? If it does not work in six councils, is there any guarantee that it will work in 400-plus councils? Why put them all through the expense, hassle and turmoil of putting the structures in place, some for the second time, if it is not actually proven that they work? I put that to the Minister and tried to draw a conclusion from her speech that that was the obvious course to take.
<P>
What is the almighty rush to get the measure on to the statute book and in operation? I shall let you into a secret, Mr. O'Brien: the Bill, or something like it, will be forced through Parliament before our summer holidays. We cannot stop that; we can throw ourselves in front of the juggernaut from time to time and suggest improvements and try to make the Bill more workable, but at the end of the day the Government seem determined to remove the amendments tabled by their lordships and to crack on with plan A. They seem even more determined to do so as a result of their humiliation in the local elections.
<P>
Leaving that aside, what is the rush? This is not a matter of national security but of getting local government structures right. Where is all the pressure coming from? Where are the people demonstrating for something that has been missing all their lives? Why is there not a captive councillor in a pen in Parliament square? Who really cares so deeply about getting the matter sorted out so urgently?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Patrick Hall:</B> Thirty per cent. turnout.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The hon. Gentleman puts his finger on the problem; there was a 30 per cent. turnout in the local elections. Tinkering with structures will not affect that; making councils choose structures that they do not want and which do not suit them will not increase turnout. We will come to directly elected mayors in due course and I am looking forward to hearing the hon. Gentleman's contributions then. For all the ballyhoo, the excitement and the thrills and spills of the selection process for London mayor, there was only a 33 per cent. turnout, which does not suggest to me that it is a great idea. That is the problem that we are all trying to tackle, but we are approaching it from different ends of the spectrum.
<P>
I want to come to the curious question of the dog that did not bark. Unless I missed it, nowhere in the Minister's lengthy speech—it was made lengthier by interventions—did she say who, apart from ``the people'', a wonderful new Labour concept, was pressing for the proposal. Who is in favour of her proposals? I shall list a range of councils, councillors, local government organisations, academics, newspaper editors and many more who are against the measure or who have deep-seated and genuine concerns about it; the Minister has not said who supports it.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Another question to which the Minister did not respond concerned what would happen if the public rejected a proposal in a referendum and rejected the remaining options.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Does the Minister want to respond to that question? Perhaps she is thinking about it.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am trying to work out what the hon. Member for Mole Valley is trying to say, as it is not clear.
<P>
We started with a White Paper, for which there was substantial support. That led to substantial discussion and debate in councils up and down the country. There was a response to the hunt Bill, great support for it and a determination in local government that it should go ahead, but the Opposition blocked it. There was then support for the draft Bill. The recent guidance had a substantial response and, yes, of course, some people were against it. One cannot expect universal support for democratic change, because people have vested interests and there are things that they want to defend. Even so, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the vast majority of councils want us to go ahead. The leaders of Tory councils and some Liberal Democrats have told me, ``For goodness sake, we would not dare say it publicly''—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right Hon. Lady is making an intervention.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I apologise. Tory council leaders have said to me, ``Please do not concede all that the Opposition are asking because then people whom we are nearly getting to, who want to change, will not do so because it is much easier for them if they don't. You would be opening the door to all that.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> When I invited an intervention, I did not realise it would be a speech. What the Minister says is all very well, but if high-flying people in local government are queuing up to support the proposals, why did she mention them? I shall mention a lot of people by name, by organisation and by local council. That may take some time, but it must be said.
<P>
For example, the Local Government Association has worked closely with the Government—we shall discuss the matter further in the context of new clause 12—to reach a compromise, but it is not happy with the measure, as it made clear in its Committee briefing. Who are the folk who think that the proposals are a good idea? That is all I am asking. The Minister did not have much support from Labour Back Benchers on Second Reading. We have been down that road in Committee once before.
<P>
Who is currently in favour of these proposals? Will the Minister take it from me—this was made clear on Second Reading and by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon—that our fundamental objection is to compulsion? As Henry Ford put it, ``You can have any colour you want, as long as it's black.'' We genuinely do not understand. We have listened to all the words and phrases about freedom, about encouraging participation and making people responsible and all that, but the conclusion seems to bear no relation to the words that lead up to it.
<P>
The Minister, in her intervention, talked about councils, including Tory councils, that are in favour of the proposals. I expected her to say that all these councils either are putting in place or have put in place executive arrangements, but there is a world of difference between people who are rushing to do that because they think that it is a good idea and those who are pushed into doing it and will take that action grudgingly. Councillors have complained to me that their district officers are asking them what arrangements they have made for two things: the euro and the new structures. Talk about hidden agendas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I was summoning up a desire to intervene. He has said that many people are quite keen to move in this direction. Has he come across anyone who is keen for it to happen on their council and at the same time desperately keen that it be imposed on any other council?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> That is an acute point. Is it not curious that, in the rather wishy-washy compromise in new clause 12, a council that wants to go for a different system must satisfy the Minister that, among other things, this could apply to other councils? We are talking about Henry Ford and his one-colour car. We are not, by any stretch of the imagination, talking about letting a thousand flowers bloom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is clear from Labour Members' reaction to his comments that they have not read subsection (3) of new clause 12, which states that the new proposals must be 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an appropriate form of executive for all local authorities, or for any particular description of local authority?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
At its most generous, the implication is that it has to be a proposal that would apply to all district councils, for example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Ainsworth </B>(Coventry, North-East): Could apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Labour Whip suggests that it could apply, but the word used is ``must''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The hon. Gentleman and the silent one on the Labour Benches are talking about two slightly different bits of the clause. There is definitely compulsion there and that is what we object to. My point, which I think the hon. Member for Bath was making too, is that one of the criteria for getting it past Ministers is that it is a system, no matter how locally contrived and planned, that could apply right across the country.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the official position of the LGA is that no change is not an option? That has been reiterated by the leader of the Tory group, Lord Hanningfield.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I have never understood the slogan ``no change is not an option''. I have heard it from the Minister and others. [Interruption.] I am trying to deal with her intervention. It does not advance the debate at all.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath made a good point about compulsion. If the proposals are so good, why do Ministers feel obliged to impose them on people?
<P>
I will deal with the second leg of the Minister's intervention. Some Tory-run authorities have indeed introduced systems along the lines of an executive, or cabinet, system. Bedfordshire is one. I visited the council a while ago. As I understand its workings, it has an interesting, different system from the models that the Government want to impose on it and other councils. Bedfordshire's system was born of particular circumstances: it was a hung council from 1983, so it has had years of being unable to make decision.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bedford (Mr. Hall) is watching me like a hawk. I shall be happy if he wants to correct me although I have all my notes here somewhere. The council has an all-party executive and select and scrutiny committees. It goes to considerable lengths, as the leader and his team explained to me, to ensure that each councillor feels valued and has a role—apart from representing a ward. That is a different model, which seems to work for Bedfordshire. There may be other examples. It has never been part of my, or my party's, attitude to the Bill to say that the cabinet or executive system should be dismissed out of hand, but it should not be imposed on people. We say also that certain major features of the so-called cabinet system can be problematic and we do not think that they have been thought through. Hence our argument for piloting them in the real world.
<P>
We do not like the potential for a two-tier system of councillors. We do like the system of what some call collegiality, whereby all councillors feel equally valued and have an equal role. The Minister seems to find that rather tiresome and inefficient. Our first aim is to increase voter participation, but it will be difficult to achieve our second aim, which in all these matters is to ensure a good supply of good people of all parties, and of none, who want to serve in local government. We can take both as givens.
<P>
We do not want new councillors to feel undervalued, or that they do not have a role. I give the example of a new councillor who joins a local authority which is to have the executive scrutiny split. If he goes onto a scrutiny committee—he can, of course, be trained, and there is much about training in the guidance, as we might expect—but has never served on an old-fashioned committee or executive, how will he know whether he is scrutinising the executive properly? How will he leap the Berlin wall—[Interruption.] Hon. Members who were not at the Second Reading debate may scoff—
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Twigg </B>(Enfield, Southgate): I was scoffing because the hon. Gentleman appears to be arguing against the options for change, thus bearing out precisely my hon. Friend the Minister's comments about people who oppose change.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is entitled to scoff as much as he wants. I suspect that that is another coded reference to the dark forces of conservatism of which we have heard so much from our own dear Prime Minister. By definition, anyone who is opposed to the Bill, especially part II, or has serious reservations about it, is cast into the outer darkness. He is a conservative with a small as well as a big C. These are genuinely held concerns that spread across the whole political spectrum in local government and are also deeply felt by many others such as observers of local government, academics and commentators.
<P>
We are concerned about the two-tier system of councillors. I mentioned the other day that I had addressed a meeting of the ethnic councillors group in the House of Commons, and I think that I was the only representative of a major party to accept its invitation. I suspect that there was not another Tory present, but the meeting was very pleasant, and we had a good, friendly discussion. The members of the group were concerned about the Bill's proposals. They made the perfectly reasonable point that the percentage of ethnic minorities in the population is very different from that represented on local councils. They said that that was bad enough, but they wondered how they could improve on or even maintain that position under the present proposals. They were concerned that it would be even more difficult to get into the magic circle of councils—in particular, long-standing labour-run councils, where the executive is a small, self-perpetuating oligarchy.
<P>
I turn now to what I accept is a side issue, although we shall discuss amendments on it later. It is curious that most umbrage in local government is caused not by proposals to introduce large salaries for council leaders—about which more in a minute—but by proposals to introduce pension schemes for members of the executive. I can think of no better way of sending a subliminal message that those people expect to have a claim to office in the executive of their local authority for a substantial period. In any event, the point is that that causes much concern among councillors.
<P>
There are worries about collegiality, member development, attracting new members and candidates, openness and secrecy—to which I shall come in a moment—and the role of officers. The Minister spoke about the guidance, and it will be interesting to see what the briefings that members of the Committee receive from organisations such as the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Unison say about how the guidance tackles their concerns. If those concerns are sufficiently serious, the Government should consider dealing with them in the Bill.
<P>
Many councillors, from all parts of the political spectrum, have lined up to oppose the imposition of the executive-scrutiny split. As the hon. Member for Bath said, they even include those who might want to introduce similar proposals in their locality to suit their own needs. The Government's response, however, has been consistently to deny councils that choice, which is an extraordinarily Stalinist attitude. That brings me back to the point about the dark forces of conservatism, which made in answer to the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Twigg). The problem is that when the Prime Minister uses that phrase to mean the Conservative party, he could all too often be describing the clark forces of conservatism—with a small ``c''—in his own party. I am sure that the worst examples of that in his mind—in particular after the local elections—are in old Labour local government. People there have never signed up to new Labour and do not understand or like it. They think that the Government's metropolitan obsessions have lost them seats and their share of the votes for local councils—[Interruption.] The Minister can laugh as much as she likes, but if she listens hard enough, she will hear the tumbrels rolling among the rank and file of her party. The rumblings of discontent within the Labour party have been clearly audible to anyone who has cared to listen and should not be lightly dismissed. Conservative Members have listened, and I have received representations from local government representatives from other parties who are concerned about the present proposals. I can only assume that they are getting no hearing from Ministers.
<P>
When the Joint Committee took evidence on the new structures, a delegation of Labour councillors told it in no uncertain terms of its concerns about the Bill. We should bear it in mind that the Bill was still in draft form when the Committee considered it, and my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley might have something to say about that. Councillor Brendan Bird, from Hammersmith and Fulham—a local authority on which I once had the honour and privilege to serve—said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>democratic checks and balances are being lost.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He also said that councils
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>bitterly resent the insulting tone in relation to backbenchers in the Bill.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Councillor Gerry Harrison from Camden—of which more later—said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>what are emerging are first and second class councillors.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that I am speaking slowly enough for the Government Whip to write those names down—we know that the Government do not like or tolerate dissent.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> So that the hon. Gentleman does not feel the need to speak on behalf of those councillors, I should say that I have met them several times and had many comradely discussions with them. For him to try to portray them as representing the mainstream of Labour party councillors takes a bit of imagination, to put it mildly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Imagination or not, let me give it a try. I am delighted to hear that the Minister has had discussions—what a shame that she took no notice of them.
<P>
When those Labour councillors were asked how the Bill could be improved, the answer that came back from Councillor Tom Davidson of Haringey—they cannot all be wrong, can they?—was:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>By giving us the option of the status quo plus, of an improved committee system . . . we could easily cut down<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the number of committees
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>if we had to and the Government could put a limit on them if that is what they wanted to do.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall not quote at length the various memorandums that were submitted to the Joint Committee, although my hon. Friends might want to discuss them in more detail. However, Burnley borough council, which is not exactly a hotbed of Conservatism with a big C, said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the choices the draft Bill offers for new structures are unnecessarily limited<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>there is no evidence that<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
an executive-scrutiny split
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>is more effective than the current system.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also noted that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the proposed new structures in themselves will not make decision-making more open. Indeed, it may make it less so.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The London borough of Camden said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We believe it to be good democratic practice to offer the widest possible choice to the electorate where local consultation has identified this need. As interest in our consultation exercise has demonstrated, local people are interested in a range of models of political management and may not favour the models offered.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Earlier in her speech, the Minister spoke about the lack of interest in such matters among the punters, as she called them—
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I did not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I have paraphrased her words, and we can read Hansard in due course. However, there is an assumption that ordinary voters are not interested in such issues. It would be sad if that were true, because that would wholly undermine the aim that I share with the hon. Member for Bedford. However, I do not think that it is true, and the acid test is the London borough of Camden.
<P>
Camden has moved on a bit since the days when the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) was its leader. The Minister will not be able to dismiss it quite so lightly, because it has received one or two awards as a beacon council. In many ways, it seems to have got its act together, and there have been changes, for obvious reasons. Indeed, I received a letter from its leader only yesterday saying that he was standing down. The explanation for that might not be difficult to find. When the council debated the Government's proposals, a motion against them was carried by 43 votes to nil.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> It says 45 here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> It says 43 here, but let us not argue about it. Three members abstained, one of whom was the council leader, Councillor Arthur. One would expect a council such as Camden to be all signed up to the Labour Government's proposed changes, so what could lead it to deliver such a humiliating judgment on their proposals, particularly those in part II? The council was under pressure from the Conservative opposition, ably led by Councillor Pam Chesters.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have met her.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Minister has obviously met a lot of people, but the trouble is that she takes no notice of them. She might as well have met them in a bus queue.
<P>
Councillor Pam Chesters and her opposition group pressed hard for proper consultation. It is fair to say that Camden carried out an exemplary public consultation. [HON. MEMBERS: ``Nonsense.''] Ministers are saying ``nonsense'', so I shall have to go into more detail. Camden delivered a questionnaire to every household in the borough and to every organisation registered there. It held 30 public meetings, which Councillor Chesters tells me were well attended. There was extensive advertising in the local press, which also gave the matter considerable coverage, and a series of special interest meetings, for example with disability groups, was also held. That happened between January and March 1999 and prompted a letter from Councillor Arthur to the Minister. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Although, personally, I think there is considerable merit in the ``Cabinet'' model, it does seem to me to be good democratic practice to offer the widest possible choice to the electorate. I should welcome your thoughts on the suitability of a referendum giving four options, ie, the Government's three plus the existing arrangements (or an amended version of the existing arrangements) with the outcome depending on the popular vote.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister produced a two-page response, which can be summarised in the word ``no''.
<P>
Camden took the issue seriously and carried out an effective consultation. It is outrageous that Ministers should rubbish that, particularly from a sedentary position. Some Labour authorities have carried out only paltry and perfunctory consultations and I shall return to that soon. Camden did an excellent job and nailed the lie that the punters—the voters—cannot be persuaded to take an interest in these matters. If issues are made relevant to people's lives, people will resoundingly say what they want and what they do not want. It is clear that people were deeply unimpressed by the Government's narrow set of proposals for new local government structures.
<P>
That view is spreading further than just Camden and one or two other councils. Earlier, reference was made to the Labour campaign for open local government. I am sure that the Minister categorises its members as a bunch of fringe operators and complete wackos who have nothing to do with the new Labour project. I am sorry for putting words in her mouth, but she thinks that, even if she will not say it. The campaign has more than 1,000 members, of whom about half are councillors—probably less than that, after the local elections—from 80 local authorities. Those people felt so incensed that they produced the St. Pancras declaration, which contains various sensible proposals. They talked about pilot schemes and for the life of me I cannot understand what is so bad about piloting the proposals. If the proposals work, fine, but we do not think that they will in their present form.
<P>
The declaration says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As a first principle, all councillors should have a fundamental role in local democracy. Any proposed executive/scrutiny split is divisive, impractical and expensive.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems pretty clear. The declaration advocates an improved committee system, so let us not hear any nonsense about how everyone is backward looking and wants the status quo. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Decision-making should always be open and in front of public and press, for whom agendas should also remain available.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also says that the whip should be relaxed. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Excessive salaries could mean the loss of the public service ethos for councillors.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Interestingly, the press release stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Those councils who have carried out minimal or no consultation have found it easier to impose anti-democratic structures.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Who could they have been talking about? Possibly Brighton, to which I shall return in a moment.
<P>
More recently, in March this year, the campaign reiterated its opposition to the Government's proposals, which it characterised as ``an anti-„democratic leap backwards''. The Government were, in its view, ``legitimising cronyism''.
<P>
Showing that the campaign is still socialist, it talks about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the controlling mechanisms put in place by Margaret Thatcher,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
forgetting that it was that newly elected Back Bencher, Margaret Thatcher, who introduced a private Member's Bill, which became law, to ensure the openness of local council meetings. The Labour campaign for open local government—not central office, the LGA or anybody else—also points out that section 28, which ran to just two and a half lines,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>had been cleverly used to distract attention from the more dangerously anti-democratic elements—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a point that I had made.
<P>
Let us assume that all 500 or so councils have all got it wrong and thoroughly misunderstand the Minister's good intentions, and deal specifically with Brighton and Hove—close to my constituency of Eastbourne and that of my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton). The front page of the Friday 12 May edition of the Brighton Evening Argus—an excellent newspaper, that has fought an effective campaign against secrecy, called ``Behind Closed Doors''—has the headline: ``Cabinet Plan Gets the Boot''. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Brighton and Hove Council is in chaos after Labour rebels voted to ditch the cabinet system of local government . . . Opposition members had complained they were being excluded from the decision-making process and yesterday Tories, Lib Dems, Greens and rebel Labour councillors banded together to get the scheme thrown out.<P>

<P>

<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that opposition members, particularly the Tories, voted against a cross-party recommendation for improving the existing system? The cabinet system was not completely voted out: councillors voted for another option. The Conservative party voted against opening decision making to opposition parties. It also voted down proposals to give opposition parties the chair of the scrutiny committee and proposals to provide more training for councillors. In other words, the Conservatives voted against proposals that had been framed by a cross-party panel to improve the system, and voted instead for yet another report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful for that intervention, but even the hon. Lady must accept that what happened in Brighton was hardly a ringing endorsement of the cabinet system. The article continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Instead, by 34 votes to 31, they voted to look at a different system of three or four powerful, all-party committees.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I accept what the hon. Lady says, but the council is struggling, despite the weight of the Government machine, to say that it is not wholly signed up to the Government's scheme and wants to consider other options, including another version of the committee system. Is that too much to ask?
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that if an all-party panel investigates a subject and produces a unanimous report, voting it down in favour of yet another report is perverse? It is just the sort of ``committee-itis'' and ``bureaucracy-itis'' from which local government suffers. It has nothing whatever to do with democracy; it has simply to do with delay and obfuscation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Does my hon. Friend think that the Government's action in setting up a commission to consider the economic consequences of banning fox hunting might be described in precisely the terms that the hon. Lady has just used?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are not going down that street.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Certainly not. We have enough to contend with. That is for another time. If the hon. Lady means what she says, I am afraid that she is applying those criticisms equally to some Labour councillors, Conservatives, Greens—
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Who were not members of the committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Ah! Is that not revealing? I will return to that in a moment.
<P>
The hon. Lady is also applying those criticisms to Liberal Democrats, and I would never even begin to attempt to take any responsibility for the actions or statements of Liberal Democrats anywhere. The Minister made an interesting remark sotto voce that those councillors were not members of the committee. Is that not the culture—as she would describe it—that we are opposing? If one is not a member of the in-team or the in-crowd, one is out of it. If one is not on the inside, one is on the outside.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman is deliberately missing the point. Let us get to the bottom of this. The reality that we are discussing is a group working together on a cross-party basis, which we know that the public want, despite his protestations. They are looking for proper co-operation on what should be the way forward. Of course, the rest of the council can then say, ``We don't like that.'' However, the hon. Gentleman is defending people who were party to a decision but who, for political expediency, said, ``We can give a bloody nose to the main group and make life difficult here.'' Is he defending that sort of irresponsible behaviour?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Call me old-fashioned, but I am defending the right of individual back-bench councillors and others to vote in a particular way. Why do the Minister and her parliamentary private secretary, the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) have such a problem with that? Why is that so difficult? I do not know all the circumstances of the decision in Brighton and Hove, which might or might not be good for local people. I have enough trouble representing another seaside town. However, for Ministers and their acolytes to dismiss everything as wholly motivated by petty party political motives is unfair.
<P>
If the proposals for executive scrutiny split as set out by the Government are so great, let them sink or swim on their own merits. If the proposals are good, people will clamour to put them into effect. If they are not—it sounds as though they are not in Brighton and Hove at least—let people get on with whatever suits them best. I do not see the problem.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> If the Conservatives were so opposed to the cabinet-executive split, why did they not vote it down at the meeting where they had the majority? Why did they not throw it out? Why ask for another report? They did not throw out the model, but called for another report. They clearly had the opportunity to vote it down, but did not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am not a journalist and I am the first to accept that the headline ``Cabinet Plan Gets the Boot'' is unlikely to encapsulate all the subtleties of the argument in Brighton and Hove council. Why does the hon. Lady have a problem with the Conservatives asking for a report on another option? Is she saying, like her boss, that they should go gung-ho and hell for leather into putting the model in place in the hope that it will work? That seems to be the Bill's approach to the cabinet system.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> My only problem with the call for another report is that it does not show the courage of convictions—it simply shows that Opposition members are able to call for a report. That demonstrates nothing of their opposition to the system. They voted against proposals that they had been party to drawing up, which, by any measure, would have opened decision making to much greater scrutiny because it would have allowed opposition parties to have chairs of committees and to be part of the executive. My objection is, first, that their call for a report shows no opposition to the structure and, secondly, that it does not demonstrate clear thinking or commitment to greater democracy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> All that I can say is that democracy is sometimes a messy business. Those people, for whatever motives—high motives, as I would hope, or low motives, as the Minister seems to assume—voted a particular way. The real problem for the hon. Member for Northampton, North is that this is far from being an isolated instance; it just happens to be the most dramatic and most recent, which no doubt is why the hon. Member for Bath raised the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman that one has to be careful as none of us knows the full details of what happened. However, will he confirm, first, that his report, which apparently comes from a different source from mine, suggests that one matter that was clearly voted on was stopping the current arrangements with the executive and, secondly, that the motion called for a return to the previous committee system? Whether the opposition called for a further report to consider other options seems to be neither here nor there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> With the caveat that the hon. Gentleman rightly expressed, that is my understanding. But, with the permission of the hon. Member for Northampton, North—unless she wishes to say something more—I will move on from Brighton and try a few other places.
<P>
I will veer back into the mainstream, which, on any view, is the LGA. It, as a broad principle, has always backed enthusiastically the so-called modernisation agenda, whatever that may mean. But even the association, in its evidence to the Joint Select Committee, of which my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley may say more in a moment, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The introduction of a separate executive may not suit the wide variety of different local authority types and circumstances.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is modestly put and difficult to argue with. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A model based on an improved committee system may better secure the objectives of change in some cases. The temptation for national prescription should be avoided.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The latter statement is important. The temptation for national prescription has been swallowed wholesale by Ministers on this occasion. Unsurprisingly, the Joint Select Committee's report finally endorsed that view, stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We consider the Bill can be viewed as an enabling measure and that an authority where decision making is normally taken on the floor of its committees should be allowed to apply to the Secretary of State for confirmation of arrangements not in conformity with the executive arrangements on the face of the Bill.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is fair to say that the LGA's view has not altered materially since it spoke to the Joint Select Committee. The association has worked with Ministers to find a compromise, but it is not happy with the so-called compromise that has been arrived at.
<P>
Let me pluck another organisation—the Local Government Information Unit—out of the air. It stresses the importance of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the maximum flexibility of choice of structures to respond to local view and circumstances.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the right approach. How on earth can Ministers claim to be meeting the needs of local people and their views and circumstances if they impose a uniform system through the country? The LGIU continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However, we believe it—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
by which it means the status quo—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>would reflect the diversity of councils and communities to allow a wider range of structural options.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Diversity is an important word; we support diversity and believe that it should be encouraged when possible. The LGIU also says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>structures should be allowed which are suitable for smaller councils for hung or balanced councils and for councils with many independent members and no tradition of strong political control<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) pointed that out earlier in an intervention.
<P>
I shall take another place at random: Trafford council, of which the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston (Ms Hughes), was leader for a while. I spoke to Councillor Barry Hepburn—

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms BeverIey Hughes):</B> A Tory!
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Yes, he is a Tory, but he gives up his time willingly in the public service, as Labour members do and as the hon. Lady did. Mr. Hepburn said that only the executives take decisions; the opposition have no part to play in running the council and have no idea what is going on. Other, non-executive Labour councillors feel the same. More worryingly, he says that a ward councillor has no role to play any more. I hope that that is an exaggeration; perhaps the Minister for Local Government and the Regions will respond to the point.
<P>
Other organisations are queuing up to criticise the proposals. I shall pick one at random: the London Forum of Amenity and Civic Societies, which represents 120 local organisations in London, says that the Bill would give councils
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>too few choices in how to organise their democratic, decision-making structures.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also regrets the Government's decision to encourage major change in advance of legislation, which has led to some councils acting with undue speed and with only perfunctory public consultation. Several councils will end up with egg on their faces because they put in place structures that they think may fit in with what the Government have in mind, but that will later have to be unpicked at significant cost. The London forum states that the strengths of the existing committee system are undervalued.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman slid over an important point, which I hope he will explore in more detail. I share his concern that the pressure that the Government put on many councils to make changes led a number of them to introduce new models, which will not meet the requirements of the Bill as amended. That is not only expensive but disruptive and confusing to the local population.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> That is a good point, which I tried to make earlier. There will be a lot of disruption, second time around, for many councils that put in place systems that will have to be changed because of the Bill and there will be significant costs. It is estimated that the cost to the taxpayer of modernisation will be about £150 million over three years. I suspect that that figure does not take account of the councils that have already committed money to putting in place a system that, as the hon. Member for Bath said, may not subsequently pass the test. It does not take into account the fat cat councillors who seem to be popping up in places such as Hammersmith and Fulham and Wales. We all know about the leader of Cardiff council, Councillor Goodway, who became Britain's highest paid councillor on a salary of £58,500, and Councillor Slaughter, the so-called executive mayor in Hammersmith and Fulham on a salary of £37,000; they were out of the starting gate quickly. A handful of thoroughly new Labour authorities have been far too quick to put the new structures in place and pay out vast salaries to curry favour with Ministers. When the time comes, I hope that the electorate will lay the blame where it belongs—on the people who spent all that money, possibly to no effect. 
<P>
Hull provides another interesting example. The Hull Daily Mail of 23 March this year, under a headline ``A cloak of secrecy could soon descend on important council decision-making in Hull'', states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Opposition councillors say they fear a revamped cabinet must not only exclude them, but also members of the public.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The ruling Labour group on Kingston-upon-Hull city council says that it is yet to decide how any decision-making system would work under new legislation being brought in by the Government.
<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I have been generous to the hon. Gentleman in supporting much of what he said. However, may I tactfully suggest that he should not always criticise only Labour councils? Had he chosen Rushcliffe borough council, he would have found that the cabinet arrangements are also secret under a Tory council. The hon. Gentleman might like to hear what the Tory leader of the council said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The new system is no different for most of the public because the vast majority of them are not interested. If you wrap facts and figures around fish and chips, they would see them, but they wouldn't read them.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He admitted that that was why the cabinet meetings were held in private; there was no point in conducting them in public. Clearly, the criticism applies to Labour and Conservative councils—perhaps even to Liberal Democrat councils.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am glad that the hon. Member for Bath added his final phrase, almost as an afterthought. In East Sussex, the Lib-Lab pact, through which the county will be run for the next 11 months, moved with some alacrity towards a cabinet system. So let us have no finger pointing on this matter. The hon. Gentleman was right to raise the issue. As I said, some councils run by the Conservatives have put in some interesting and elaborate schemes to ensure that some of the objections to the council system can be addressed. Some of them might in due course be reflected in the guidance offered to other councils. None of this exonerates the Government, who are attempting to put in place a system that would encourage precisely the problem that the hon. Member for Bath is complaining about.
<P>
To show even-handedness, let us consider Councillor Simone Butterworth, the Liberal-Democrat leader of the Guildhall, who said that the proposals were a threat to local democracy. [Hon. Members: ``Which Guildhall?''] Kingston. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The option to hold cabinet meetings behind closed doors is not viable in terms of public accountability. It also excludes councillors not on the cabinet.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Councillor John Fareham, the council's sole Conservative, also said that he was worried by the moves.
<P>
I am not in the habit of raising technical issues relating to the European Union, but we have tried to raise, in a parliamentary question, the relevance of all this to the European charter of local self government. With their usual alacrity on things European, the Government signed up to it.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It is not the European Union.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Council of Europe, fine. The Government propose that local authorities can adopt only one of several internal structures. However, the European charter of local self government states under article 6:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Without prejudice to more general statutory provisions, local authorities shall be able to determine their own internal administrative structures in order to adapt them to local needs and ensure effective management.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister tell us whether the Government have considered that point and whether they agree with it? Do they think that there is a risk of councils launching successful legal challenges on the basis of the European charter of local self-government? I do not mind when or how the Minister answers those questions. I am happy to let her intervene. She may prefer to leave the matter until another time. Then again, she may not want to deal with it at all. That is an important issue.
<P>
I should like to say a word about the relationship with officers. We are told that the guidance may ease the concerns of those who speak for local government officers. I hope that that happens. No doubt, as the Committee proceeds, they will inform us whether their meetings with the Minister have been successful. No matter how those discussions go and no matter how detailed the guidance is, two concerns remain. The first, to which we shall come in detail later, is that if things are that important to officers and others, they probably should be in the Bill. The second problem—this is one of the fundamental issues that would have come to light in a proper piloting scheme—is the position in which officers are potentially put simply by the introduction of the executive scrutiny split. Officers may face conflicts of interests, because on the one hand they are advising members of the cabinet or the executive and on the other they are expected to advise scrutiny committees. In large authorities it may not be so much of a problem to separate officers who service executive members from those who service scrutiny committees, but it could be an insurmountable problem for smaller authorities. It could well involve the recruitment of significant numbers of extra officers and increased costs for running the authority itself.
<P>
We have all had briefings from SOLACE, the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers, which takes a measured approach to the legislation. I shall not quote it in as much detail as I was going to as the Minister has told us that the Government will review some of its more detailed points about the guidance during the redrafting. It will remain to be seen what it has to say to us in the light of that revised guidance. In one of its earlier briefings SOLACE says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If being ``executive'' means delving into operational management then the clock will have been put back several years, and the promises of modernisation will turn to dust.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an important observation. Even enthusiastic supporters of the Government's proposals would agree that the role of officers should be thought through. Officers, particularly chief executives, should not feel that their position is downgraded or undermined by what is being put in place, unwittingly as much as deliberately. I have already explained how the cabinet-scrutiny split could raise problems of itself.
<P>
Some time ago, there was a good piece by Steve Leach and Pam Fox. One is an independent consultant; the other is professor of local government at De Montfort university in Leicester. In their paper ``The new political management agenda and member-officer relations'', they state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The implication is a unified form of officer structure can survive the transition to new forms of political management structure . . . In our view, this is an unwarranted assumption. The impact of the new structures on the role of officers and their relationship with members is one of the more unconvincing and ill-thought out elements of the White Paper.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Admittedly, note has been taken of some of their arguments in the interim.
<P>
The paper continues with an eminently sensible observation:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As the responsibility for executive action moves from the committee to the cabinet, so the main focus of the chief officer's attention will inevitably move from serving the committee (which includes opposition members) to serving the cabinet (which probably doesn't).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Even in the cabinets that have already been set up, 60 per cent. or more are in effect one-party cabinets.
<P>
The paper mentions the relationship between the senior officers and the head of the executive becoming extremely close. Earlier, the Minister made great play of informal decision making under the existing committee system. We all know what she meant and we do not suggest that it does not happen. However, Steve Leach and Pam Fox say that under the new system too much informality could occur between the officers advising the executive and the executive and lead to the blurring of officer and member roles, which could lead to problems.
<P>
Another matter on which Leach and Fox touch, which is not directly part of their brief, is the potential for marginalising back-bench members. That is a key issue in the worries of councillors of all parties in the real world of local government. They say that in recent years there has been an increasing need for members and officers to work in partnership. There has already been some blurring of roles but they think that it is a recipe for problems and sometimes disaster in member-officer relations. They believe that the setting up of scrutiny arrangements is likely to draw more officers into contact with members. That, in itself, is not necessarily an evil, but Leach and Fox say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>politically unaware managers might be unable to prevent themselves from being used for political purposes or from becoming embroiled in political battles or game-playing.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is certainly scope for concern, which is why bodies representing officers at different levels have expressed their anxiety.
<P>
The final point made by Leach and Fox, is one of the most serious. They say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The new structures could present major dilemmas for officers around ethics and whistle blowing.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is why it is so important not only that the guidance is as it should be—fully approved of and agreed by the officers' organisations—but also that anything significant should be in the Bill, not simply in the guidance.
<P>
I end on a nice observation made to SOLACE by Leach and Fox in February.
<P>
They take the view that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Chief executives and senior managers should remain politically neutral but politically astute as well as being professionally competent.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a good definition of the role of chief executives and senior officers in local government.
<P>
The thread that runs through our debate is not merely the worries and concerns of people who know local government about the proposals and their effect, but also—it is the other side of the same coin—the apparent absence of voices chiming in on the Minister's side. She may have forgotten to mention them in her earlier remarks and may do so in her response. However, it is significant how little support the Minister received from her Back Benchers on Second Reading. For example, the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Smith) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Bill centralises power . . . If the Government really are in the business of devolving power, those local authorities should have the opportunity to develop a system that reflects the problems and ambitions of their local community.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a telling remark from someone who is obviously interested in the Bill. Sadly, he did not make it on to the Committee. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Bill in its present form is deficient and will lead to more closed, less well-informed and less informative local government . . . We cannot let the Bill pass from this Chamber in its closed state. [Official Report, 11 April 2000; Vol. 348, c.207, 223.]<P>
