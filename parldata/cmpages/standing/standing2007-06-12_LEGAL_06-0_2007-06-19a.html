							<a name="0706209000682"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> I first come to one or two little domestic
matters. I am delighted to be back from the Falkland Islands, where I
was in the company of other Members of Parliament, not least the
Minister of State responsible for the armed services, as well as Lord
Parkinson and his wife, representing Baroness
Thatcher, my wife and the shadow Defence Secretary. We attended
ceremonies, with hundreds of veterans and the families of those who
lost their lives in that conflict 25 years ago. It was a wonderful
experience, and the ceremonies in various parts of the islands where
memorials were dedicated by the Earl of Wessex, Prince Edward, were
very moving occasions. They were much appreciated by all present:
service personnel, islanders and politicians who were down there as
guests of the Falkland Islands Government and the Ministry of
Defence.</div>
					<a name="0706209000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am back
here, however, to ensure that we make a little more progress than I
understand we have been making, and I am pretty tough. However, it is
warm and humid, and although I am not normally known for taking off my
jacket&#151;I may be forced to do so later on&#151;I am happy that
those who wish to may do so.</div>
					<a name="0706209000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also like to ask
colleagues&#151;at some stage, perhaps towards the end of this
Committee stage&#151;to indicate to myself and to Mr. Cook
their satisfaction with the new process of the explanatory statements.
Are they helping to ensure more informed debate? It would be helpful to
the Chairmen&#146;s Panel&#151;to myself and to my
co-Chairmen&#151;to hear from hon. Members to hear how efficiently
and effectively they believe that the new process is. It puts our
Clerks Department under quite a lot of extra pressure, but if the new
system helps the Committee and the House, I believe that we should
stick with it. I hope that it is
helpful.</div>
					<a name="0706209000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Committee rose, I understand that the hon. Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst was on his feet moving the amendment. I ask him to resume
his
speech.</div>
					
					<a name="0706209000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0706209000683"></a>
							<b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): I welcome you, Sir
Nicholas, back from the Falklands. I am sure that the Argentine
Government will not regard 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div>your return from the Falklands as their having dropped their guard, or
reduced our level of deterrence in any way. I welcome you to the
Committee. We are delighted to be serving under your
chairmanship.</div>
					<a name="0706209000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">You will
be glad to know, Sir Nicholas, that I have effectively concluded the
essence of my speech. I hope that the proposals, which are supported by
the Law Society, will commend themselves to the Government, because we
think that there is a constructive way forward here to improve the
Bill. Without more ado, I move amendment No.
255.</div>

							<b class="B">John
Hemming</b> (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD): It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Sir
Nicholas, and I welcome you back from the Falklands.</div>
					<a name="0706209000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an interesting point
about schedule 4, and particularly this amendment. The amendment would
make things far more efficient. Rather than trapping everything in a
bureaucratic muddle, it would allow the Legal Services Board to
identify those things with which the board must get involved. To that
extent, if we are looking for an efficient and effective way of
regulating the legal profession, this would be a good starting point.
It would be worth making the same point on schedule 4 itself given that
it is interesting how the Lord Chief Justice is important here, but not
important in terms of appointing the Legal Services Board. However, the
amendment would provide a more effective approach; it is very
good.</div>
					
					<a name="0706209000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0706209000685"></a>
							<b class="B">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretar</b>y <b class="B">of State for Justice</b>
							<b class="B">(Bridget P</b>
							<b class="B">r</b>
							<b class="B">entice):</b>
						 May I also express my
delight that you, Sir Nicholas, you have returned well and full of
enthusiasm from the Falklands? We all know how firm and fair you will
be throughout our proceedings and look forward to continuing our
debates under your wise
chairmanship.</div>
					<a name="0706209000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that there is anxiety over the need to ensure that the board
operates in a proportionate fashion. I agree that it should operate
that way and that it would go against that principle if we were to
create a system that encourages micromanagement by the board. Equally,
we do not want to add unnecessary delay or inefficiency to the
day-to-day operation of the regulatory regime, but I do not consider
that the current arrangements under schedule 4 will have either of
those effects.</div>
					<a name="0706209000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come
to what has been slightly lost in the amendment. First, the hon. Member
for Bromley and Chislehurst touched on the fact that, under schedule 4,
the board will have wide discretion to exempt certain classes of rules.
It is appropriate that it should be possible to exempt minor
alterations to regulatory arrangements or those alterations that are
not particularly relevant. Secondly, the proposed change would not
necessarily make the board&#146;s relationship with the approved
regulators more efficient, despite what the hon. Member for Birmingham,
Yardley said. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it might have
the opposite
effect.</div>
					<a name="0706209000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if the
presumption were that the regulatory arrangements are
to be exempt unless otherwise directed, the board would not be doing
its job properly if it did not know what it was exempting. It could not
be expected to relinquish oversight unless it was confident
that
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div>
						in each case the regulatory arrangements in question
required no input from the board in order to achieve the regulatory
objectives. The outcome would be increased regulatory burdens on both
the board and the approved regulators. The board would have to monitor
regularly and assiduously all regulatory arrangements, and approach
constantly each of the eight&#151;so far&#151;approved regulators
to assess the ever-changing scope of the exemption and evaluate whether
it needed to create further
exceptions.</div>
					<a name="0706209000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
frequent and unpredictable demands created by that
system would increase rather than reduce the burden on approved
regulators. A system whereby approved regulators are free to submit
proposals for exemptions seems to be more straightforward rather than
less. Apart from my reservations about the procedure and inefficiency,
I believe that the change would compromise our primary objective of
accountability and consumer protection through the regulatory
framework.</div>
					<a name="0706209000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the board
is to be strong and effective as an oversight regulator, acting in the
interests of the consumer, it is vital that it is aware of the
regulatory environment. That does not mean that it has to take an
interventionist approach. Indeed, I hope that it does not. However, to
avoid doing so, it needs to have full information in order to make its
judgment.</div>
					<a name="0706209000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst referred to the present position and
what the Bill will, in effect, achieve in terms of streamlining the
system. At the moment, under the procedure set out in part II of
schedule 4 to the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, any alteration to
the rules relating to the conduct of persons exercising a right of
audience or a right to conduct litigation, any alteration to the
qualification regulations of the authorised body or the alteration of
any rights granted by those bodies must be approved by the Secretary of
State. Before doing so, the Secretaryof State must follow the
procedures set out under schedule 4 to the Act, which usually involves
obtaining the advice of the legal services consultative panel and the
Office of Fair Trading, each of which gives its advice
separately.</div>
					<a name="0706209000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State then sends the advice to the authorised body for its
observation and consults the designated judges for their views before
making a final decision. There is no limit to how long the process can
take and, as the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst rightly
pointed out, at times it has taken many months, if not years. It can
take even longer if the rule is complicated or if the authorised body
is unwilling to amend the rule to take into account the worries of the
legal services consultative panel. That was the position with the Law
Society&#146;s conflict and confidentiality
rules.</div>
					<a name="0706209000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the Bill,
the board will have sole responsibility for approving the rules. Under
the procedures setout in part 3 of schedule 4, alterations to
regulatory arrangements will be approved either automatically, if the
board considers them to be exempt, or after an initial determination.
They will also be subject to the warning notice procedures in
paragraphs 21 to 35, under which the board might consider advice from
appropriate persons and representations made bythe approved
regulator making the application. The process is subject to a time
limit to ensure that applications do not become drawn out. For example,
the approved regulator must make representations within 28 days, and
alterations will be approved 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>automatically after 12 months unless the board refuses the application
or applies to extend the consideration period.</div>
					<a name="0706209000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The three-stage process will
ensure that the regulatory arrangements for different levels of risk
are given appropriate consideration. It will
certainly streamline the current situation. On that basis, although I
understand the concerns about complication and length of time, I think
that the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst might find that the
situation outlined in schedule 4 makes for a better system. I hope that
he will therefore withdraw his amendment.</div>

							<a name="0706209000686"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s response. I
take on board a number of her points, and I am grateful for movement
and a degree of reassurance on time limits. We are still concerned, as
are a number of professional bodies. In practice, regulatory bodies of
this kind have a tendency towards mission creep. It is important that
we are vigilant to ensure that that does not become the case, because
it is then, however good the intentions, that the administrative burden
and expense can grow. We hope that the Government will continue to keep
an open mind in the light of experience. We shall see how the rest of
these matters develop, but for the time being, I beg to ask leave to

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000692"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 245, in
clause 29, page 14, line 26, leave
out &#145;prejudiced&#146; and insert &#145;improperly
constrained or
influenced&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0706209000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is vital that the representative functions of the approved regulators
operate smoothly. The regulators must be proactive and imaginative, and
we supportthe Clementi recommendations that the professional
bodies separate their regulatory responsibilities from their
representational role; that makes manifest sense. We support also the
requirements in clause 30 that the board make rules on internal
governance.</div>
					<a name="0706209000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would ensure that the Legal Services Board interfered only
with the regulatory functions of the approved regulators, not with the
representative arms of those bodies. I am sure that that is Her
Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s intention, but I am concerned
about the use of &#147;prejudiced&#148; in clause 29. For example,
if a professional body properly provides a service to its members such
as defending them in the event of disciplinary action, along similar
lines to the work of the Medical Defence Union, one would hope that the
regulatory arm would regard it as a perfectly proper exercise of the
representative body&#146;s role and that it would recognise the
importance of properly representing people who face serious
disciplinary charges.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>
					<a name="0706209000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the regulatory arm may
take a different view, particularly if the defence service&#146;s
actions led to a number of people being cleared of disciplinary
charges. In those circumstances, the regulatory board might argue that
its effectiveness was being prejudiced by the representational
side&#146;s activities. For that reason, we are suggesting a better
wording. The use of the word &#147;prejudiced&#148; in this context
is too wide. It is an altogether stronger term than the phrase that we
are recommending should be substituted for it:
&#147;improperly constrained or influenced&#148;. That substitution
would make a great deal of sense. We are putting in wording that more
neatly and succinctly meets HMG&#146;s requirements.</div>

					<a name="0706209000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point in
English law is that it is the perception of external
influence&#151;the perception of bias&#151;which is the key driver.
Although it has been argued that &#147;prejudiced&#148; is a
stronger word and it may have more emotive value than other words, it
is actually much easier to prove improper influence than it is to prove
prejudice, which presumes that a matter has been prejudged. To that
extent, the amendment would tighten up the legislation and, although it
may be a probing amendment, the Minister should look on it
favourably.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000696"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> A lot of consideration has gone into the use of
the word &#147;prejudiced&#148; in the clause. It has been argued
that it would not be unusual for representative bodies to seek to
influence regulatory decisions, if it is in the interests of their
members to do so. As the approved regulator is the body recognised in
the Bill as responsible for both representative and regulatory
functions, I would argue that it should accept certain responsibilities
as part of that role. It might be reasonable for the representative arm
to try to influence regulatory decisions, but it is important that the
board is able to take appropriate action where it considers that the
approved regulator is allowing representational interests to prejudice
the exercise of regulatory
functions.</div>
					<a name="0706209000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to ensure that the board is able to act where, for example,
the actions of the representative side discredit the regulatory arm,
resulting in damage to consumer confidence. Clause 29(2) is necessarily
and deliberately wide in definition to ensure that the board is not
prevented from taking such appropriate action. Therefore the use of the
word &#147;prejudiced&#148; is correct in the
context.</div>
					<a name="0706209000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for North-West Norfolk has raised specific concerns. To suggest
that the board may use its powers only where exercising the
representative functions has &#147;improperly constrained or
influenced&#148; the regulatory functions implies that there may be
circumstances where it is &#147;proper&#148; for representative
interests to constrain or influence regulatory functions. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>
						I do not think that that is appropriate.
Furthermore, the proposed formulation suggests that there must be an
element of wilfulness, but again that might notbe the case.
There might be no intent whatsoever on the part of the regulator, but
that does not mean that the board should be prevented from acting if
necessary.</div>
					<a name="0706209000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that these are often are very fine definitions, but
&#147;prejudiced&#148; is more appropriate than &#147;improperly
constrained or influenced&#148;, because the latter wording would
narrow the definition just a little bit too
much.</div>

Mann:
						</b> By tabling the amendment I wished to highlight one
of the major consequences of the Bill and to offer the Minister an
opportunity to strengthen it mildly in the Government&#146;s own
direction of travel, with the backing of the Opposition parties and
following Clementi&#146;s recommendation that regulatory and
representative functions need to be clearly distinct and separate. I
wish to ask a question or two of the Minister, and to throw a wider
challenge out to the Committee and to readers of
<i class="I">Hansard</i>.</div>
					<a name="0706209000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">When a
complaint is made to the Law Society and is passed to its regulatory
arm to examine, it may well&#151;individually or
generically&#151;also be a complaint to the Bar Standards Board. For
example, there was the case of Hobson and others <i class="I">v.</i> AMS and
others, which was adjudicated by the Law Society. In that case,
counsel&#146;s opinion was fundamental. The complaint was made
against the solicitor, but it could have been made against the
barrister had the complainants had known counsel&#146;s opinion and
who the barrister involved
was.</div>
					<a name="0706209000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, the
myriad complaints concerning hearing loss cases that are beginning to
arrive at the Law Society could also go to the Bar Standards Board, as
happened last week. There is a suggestion that there is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div>unhealthy collusion between firms of solicitors and barristers on how
counsel&#146;s opinion affects consumers. In a lot of cases involving
industrial deafness, a solicitor might tell someone, &#147;You have a
case,&#148; and the case goes all the way, but the employer defends
the case and resists the claim. Before the case goes to court, the firm
might get counsel&#146;s opinion at the request of the solicitor,
which is usually a requirement built into a small clause of the
insurance policy. The solicitor then says, &#147;Oh no,
there&#146;s no case&#151;absolutely no case whatsoever.&#148; On
that basis, insurance funding is withdrawn and the case does not go to
court.</div>
					<a name="0706209000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there were
many such cases and a pattern emerged, the matter might be deemed
worthy of investigation, but by whom? The regulatory arms covering
solicitors and barristers should look at such issues together and work
through both policy and remedy, but my experience suggests that that
does not happen. Although solicitors&#146; regulatory and
representative arms are close, as are those of barristers, there is a
distance in the relationship between the two regulatory arms and they
do not come together as regulators. That coming together is essential
if the consumer is to be protected, particularly in the more complex
and insidious cases in which patterns of potential
consumer disquiet emerge. Mildly strengthening such measures in the
Bill might well be within the ambit of the Government&#146;s intent,
so I politely invite the Minister to consider the
amendment.</div>

Bellingham:
						</b> Amendment No. 246, which stands in my name and
that of my hon. Friends, including the shadow Secretary of State, as
well as the name of the shadow Minister in the Liberal Democrats, is
very similar to the lead amendment. The amendment moved by the hon.
Member for Bassetlaw would insert anew subsection (3) in
clause 29, which is headed, &#147;Prohibition on the Board
interfering with representative functions&#148; Our amendment would
insert a new subsection (3A) in clause 30, which is headed,
&#147;Rules relating to the exercise of regulatory
functions&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0706209000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
aim is very straightforward: to reinforce the point that there must be
a separation between representative and regulatory roles. We are
requesting that proper separation be included in the Bill. Obviously,
some approved regulators will have a separate building and be a
separate team of people&#151;there will be a manifest separation from
the representative function. However, some of the smaller
organisations, such as the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys and
the Institute of Trade Mark Attorneys, will find it quite difficult to
have a separate building or arm to the operation, and they will be
looking at something more like a Chinese wall, which operates very
effectively in many City organisations.</div>
					<a name="0706209000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we are proposing is common
sense. I will not elaborate further because the hon. Member for
Bassetlaw has put a very strong case. I am delighted that we are on the
same side of the argument.</div>

Chinese wall.</div>

						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>If I am in a good mood this afternoon, it
is because we are all on the same side on the issue of separation
between regulatory and representative functions. It is absolutely
fundamental to the B+ model of regulation proposed by Sir David
Clementi. Since the draft Bill was published, we have strengthened the
legislation in this area. I am very persuaded by the arguments put
forward by all sides, but clause 30 ensures that there is separation
between regulatory and representative functions. Among other things,
the rules require that the approved regulators adequately resource
their regulatory arms and that the people exercising the regulatory
functions can make representations to the board, the consumer panel,
the Office for Legal Complaints and other regulators.</div>
					<a name="0706209000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause takes into account
the recommendations of the Joint Committee, and makes it clear that
once the board is established, it will need to set out more detailed
criteria for the separation of regulatory and representative functions
of approved
regulators.</div>
					<a name="0706209000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">My small

consider whether the additions suggested by the h G and my hon. Friend
the Member for Bassetlaw would make life easier for the small

							<a name="0706209000710"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> New clause 12 should be judged in the light of
the previous debate, as it, too, is about the separation of functions
and proportionality. Some might argue that I am backtracking slightly
on what was said in our debate on the previous amendment, which was
moved by the hon. Member for Bassetlaw.</div>
					<a name="0706209000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause was inspired by
the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys and the Institute of Trade
Mark Attorneys. It provides that when exercising its functions under
clauses 29 and 30, the board should pay regard to what is
proportionate. It makes it clear that the small organisations&#151;a
number of approved regulators are small, highly
specialist and technical bodies&#151;simply cannot be expected to
separate completely their representative and regulatory roles. That
point was made by the Minister only a moment ago.</div>
					<a name="0706209000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The professions represented by
the institutes are not closed; one does not have to be a member of
either institute to practice as an attorney. If they started charging
their members excessive sums&#151;if their cost base increased too
much&#151;they would lose members and thus lose critical mass. That
is why they should be treated with proportionality. I urge the Minister
to consider accepting new clause 12. She was sympathetic to the
previous group of amendments, tabled by myself and the hon. Member for
Bassetlaw, and she could combine that with the acceptance of new clause
12. It should protect the small specialist regulators who form an
important part of the legal services
system.</div>

by discussing the extent to which patent agents and the like provide
regulated rather than non-regulated services.</div>
					<a name="0706209000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am nervous about the new
clause. In some circumstances, one would want those who makes
regulatory decisions to be unbiased, which is to say that they should
not also have a representative role. However, that would not
necessarily mean that the two sides should not have any involvement at
any point; they might have the same receptionist or something like
that. Even in smaller organisations, I would be nervous about a
situation in which the body&#146;s elected president 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div>took regulatory decisions. I am therefore not in favour of a statutory
prevention&#151;of rules that insist on some separation of
personnel.</div>
					<a name="0706209000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept
that in a smaller organisation, if people need to be regulated, there
are constraints, because people might have to work out of the same
premises. The approach has to be proportionate, but there will be
circumstances in which one would want to distinguish between the
personnel, so that those who make the regulatory
decisions are not democratically accountable to the people about whom
they make those
decisions.</div>

My immediate reaction to new clause 12 is that it is a duplication of
what we already have. I accept the points made by the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Yardley about the clarity that is needed. I assure the
Committee that the Bill will not prevent people from exercising
regulatory functions and carrying out representative functions if

light-touch self-regulation as the way forward. To demonstrate that, we

an analogy with a surgeon: the legal profession does not require an
18th century surgeon removing arms and legs in traditional ways to get
to the root of the problem; it requires small amounts
of microsurgery, involving the latest laser technology, to ensure
accuracy and precision. That is the point of the

proved most useful. I cite as an example the legal services
ombudsman&#146;s special report on miners&#146; compensation, which
highlighted a number of minor inconsistencies. They were grabbed by the
regulator, which totally outpaced the ombudsman in delivering an
effective, consistent system and moved in a tiny period of time from
agreat variety of responses&#151;some of them absolutely
superbly detailed and legally precise, some rather waffly, vague and
inaccurate&#151;to a consistency of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 228</div>approach that meant that those who were complaining could begin to see
consistency in judgments, and gain confidence in the system.</div>
					<a name="0706209000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The regulator
needs to be able to examine performance as it is happening, not merely
retrospectively. Then, if there is a swathe of problems in a certain
area, the regulator can improve the consistency and quality of
performance in actual time, rather than retrospectively. Such
strengthening of the ability to intervene on a light-touch,
microsurgical basis would be entirely in the spirit of the
Government&#146;s successful attempts to introduce
self-regulation.</div>

						</b> On amendment No. 279, I very much agree with my
hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw: the board must be able to
investigate approved regulators&#146; performance of their regulatory
functions before setting targets. It would not be properly carrying out
its oversight function if it did not do that. We have drafted the Bill
so that it provides for the board to conduct an appropriate level of
investigation of the discharge of the functions of the
regulators&#151;and not just in clause 31. My hon. Friend knows that
I do not approve of the phrase &#147;light touch&#148;, so he
tempts me down the wrong path when he uses it and other such
phrases.</div>
					<a name="0706209000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give
further examples of ways in which the board has powers. Under clause 7,
it may do</div>
					<a name="0706209000610"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;anything
calculated to facilitate, or incidental or conducive to the carrying
out of any of its
functions.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706209000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">and it also
has the power to obtain information and documents from approved
regulators under clause 55. Across the Bill as a whole, we have given
the boardthe appropriate tools with which to examine the
effectiveness of approved regulators in exercising their
regulatory functions. I anticipate that in most
circumstances the board will be able to take appropriate, proportionate
action, and will try to set appropriate targets through dialogue with
the approved regulators. However, if a situation should arise in which
that cannot or does not happen, it will be open to the board to require
relevant information more formally, as under clause 55. That power is
enforceable through the High Court.</div>
					<a name="0706209000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be a wee bit concerned
about inserting another power for the board to investigate in case that
should muddy the waters. Given that it is already able to require
information to aid its regulatory decisions,a more explicit
power to investigate might need tobe supplemented by powers of
search and seizure. Without there being a proper procedure in place to
govern such use, that could be seen as disproportionate.
</div>
					<a name="0706209000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the ability of
the board to carry out an appropriate level of investigation, and the
desire of all of us to avoid disproportionate action, I would ask my
hon. Friend to withdraw his amendment. Across the Bill as a whole, the
board has sufficient powers to carry out the functions that he so much
wants it to have.</div>

Prentice:
						</b> This group of amendments seeks to reverse the
changes made in another place to the thresholds of the board&#146;s
regulatory powers. Those amendments sought to limit the exercise of the
powers to circumstances involving significant adverse impact on the
regulatory objectives as a whole. The Government amendments will
restore the formulation enabling the board to act where there is an
adverse impact on one or more of the regulatory
objectives.</div>
					<a name="0706209000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have not been persuaded that it is necessary or desirable to
strengthen the thresholds as the other place proposed. The board needs
flexibility to act quickly and decisively where there is a failure. To
wait until that failure has a significant adverse impact on the
objectives as a whole is likely to be damaging to consumers and, I
suggest, to the legal
profession.</div>
					<a name="0706209000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
particular, the amendments are needed to remove the requirement that
the adverse impact be significant. We have serious concerns that such
qualification of the thresholds will fetter the board&#146;s ability
to regulate effectively. Retaining the word &#147;significant&#148;
could cast doubt on whether the board can take steps to rectify certain
regulatory failings. In the case of smaller regulators, who may
regulate fewer reserved activities or authorised persons, the impact on
the objectives may not meet the significant threshold even where there
is clear evidence of consumer detriment in the failing
regulator&#146;s field. The Government want to make it clear in the
Bill that the board will be able to act in relation to a regulator
regardless of that regulator&#146;s size. The simple reference to
adverse impact will achieve that without leaving damaging room for
argument.</div>
					<a name="0706209000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also seek
to reverse amendments restricting the board&#146;s ability to take
action where the adverse impact is on the regulatory objectives as a
whole. In making regulatory decisions, the board will of course need to
balance the impact on one objective against the other objectives and to
assess them together. That might even be the intention behind the
amendments made in the other place, but we do not believe that it will
be their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div>effect. We consider that those amendments could limit recourse to the
regulatory powers to circumstances impacting on all the objectives,
which is clearly far too restrictive. Our amendments in this group will
make it plain that the board can act where there has been an adverse
impact on one or more of the regulatory
objectives.</div>
					<a name="0706209000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee need not look further than the Bill to see that there are
clear safeguards preventing the misuse of the board&#146;s powers.
The board is already under a duty to have regard to best regulatory
principles, including transparency, accountability and proportionality,
when carrying out all its functions. Before taking action, it must
publish policy statements. As we will discuss later, the Government
have tabled a refined amendment to clause 49 that will ensure that when
publishing policy statements, the board must have regard to the
principle that its principal role is the oversight of approved
regulators. In addition, when the board considers it appropriate to use
its powers, it must comply with procedural safeguards, such as the
requirement for it to consider representations from the approved
regulators, and the obligation for it to consult the consumer panel,
the senior judiciary, the Lord Chancellor and the Office of Fair
Trading.</div>
					<a name="0706209000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
highlight the point that the board will not operate its regulatory
powers in a vacuum. The way in which it exercises those powers will be
subject to public scrutiny, it will be obliged to publish an annual
report, and when appropriate, its decisions could be judicially
reviewed. The combined effect of those provisions will ensure that the
board can and will act only when it is right and proper that it does
so. For those reasons, I move the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="0706209000721"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for explaining
both the situation and why Her Majesty&#146;s Government want to
remove from the Bill the wording that was inserted in the Lords. She
has made her case, but the Opposition do not agree with it. There was a
lengthy debate in the other place in Committee, and on Report when
there was a vote on the provision. It was won not by a whisker, but by
52 votes, which in the other place is a reasonable-sized majority. I
have just had a look at the voting list, and a significant number of
Labour and Cross-Bench peers voted for the wording that was inserted.
The argument was won and the vote was won, and I am disappointed that
the Minister has come to the Committee with these amendments.</div>
					<a name="0706209000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason that the Bill was
amended in the Lords is simple. The amendment was designed to ensure
that the various powers of intervention by the board in the regulatory
work of the approved regulators would be triggered only by an adverse
impact on the regulatory objectives as a whole. The original Bill
stated clearly that the board&#146;s disciplinary measures could be
enforced on the basis of an adverse impact on only one of the
regulatory objectives. The Opposition accept the board&#146;s need to
have formal powers, but as the Joint Committee, on which my hon. Friend
the Member for Enfield, Southgate sat, made clear, those powers should
be used only when necessary&#151;when, for example, the approved
regulators are clearly failing. We do not want an over-intrusive board
trying to micro-manage the approved
regulators.</div>

Bellingham:
						</b> Well, the Joint Committee made that
recommendation and it went through. Presumably, the hon. Gentleman
could have demanded a vote and a minority report could have been
published. It is still open under the Bill for the board to punish the
approved regulator for breaching only one of the regulatory objectives
as long as it was sufficiently serious to have an adverse impact on the
objectives taken together. To some extent, his concerns have been met
in the Bill, as it stands
now.</div>
					
					<a name="0706209000643"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div>
					<a name="0706209000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
have said several times that the lead responsibility should rest with
the approved regulator. There will be a need for agreement and
partnership, and it is important that the board does not adopt an
excessively heavy-handed approach. It is also worth pointing out that
the regulatory objectives are to some extent bound to be in contention
with each other. For example, let us consider the requirement to
undertake prescribed training prior to admission as a solicitor. It
would clearly have an adverse effect on competition in legal services
if everyone with a law 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div>
						degree could be admitted immediately as a solicitor.
The potential supply of solicitors would be that much
greater.</div>
					<a name="0706209000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
failing to require appropriate pre-admission training would have a
detrimental effect on the interests of consumers and probably on one or
two of the other regulatory objectives. Under the original formulation
of the Bill, the LSB would be entitled to take action against an
approved regulator whatever approach it took to pre-admission training.
That is just one example of why the Lords made such a
change.</div>
					<a name="0706209000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">We ought to
consider the overall position. We want a balanced approach and, as they
stand, the clauses offer that. After all, the Government have said time
and again that they want full co-operation between the board and the
approved regulators, and that they want a spirit of good will and
understanding. We must remember that they have not sought to
differentiate in weight between the regulatory objectives to which the
hon. Member for Wirral, West referred. They are all of equal
weight.</div>

Bellingham:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I shall not give way as I intend to
come to a conclusion quite soon. The Whip is keen for us to make
progress. Let us focus on one objective. It could be tantamount to
acting in a arbitrary fashion, so the proper approach is for the board
to analyse each of the regulatory objectives before deciding to act. It
is a balancing exercise. There is no need for the board to become
another front-line regulator. The third-party endorsement for such an
approach is widespread. There is no question about it. The Chartered
Institute of Patent Attorneys and the Institute of Trade Mark Attorneys
made it clear that all of the different procedures should be in line
with the Hampton risk-based regulation
recommendations.</div>
					<a name="0706209000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its
latest report, the Bar Standards Board made it clear that there should
be the sensible, delicate-touch regulation that was envisaged by Sir
David Clementi. It pointed out that the danger with any other approach
was that unnecessary costs and delay would be built into the regulatory
process. I have not once mentioned &#147;light&#148; touch. The
Minister has prohibited the use of that phrase. I would instead use the
words &#147;delicate&#148;, &#147;de minimis&#148;,
&#147;sensitive&#148; or &#147;pragmatic&#148; to describe the
sort of touch that should be used. Alternatively, perhaps we should
intervene only in extremis or on a common-sense
basis.</div>
					<a name="0706209000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us consider
the organisations that endorsed the Lords amendments, which were won by
a substantial majority. We must bear in mind not only those that I am
sure the hon. Member for Bassetlaw would describe as the usual
suspects, but the many others that supported the amendments and
considered that they would improve the Bill substantially. While I take
on board entirely the points made by the Minister about other elements
of protection under the Bill and the provisions on proportionality and
checks and balances, it would be a retrograde step to support the
Government&#146;s amendments. They are not necessary. If they had
been, the Lords&#151;after substantial debate that involved a lot of
very experienced people&#151;would not have wanted to amend the Bill
in such a way. That is why Conservative Members will work extremely
hard, but in a constructive and pragmatic way, to keep the Bill as it
is.</div>

								John
Hemming:
						</b> I am sure that my party unanimously took the same
view in the House of Lords. Light touch is not necessarily the best way
of describing the measure. It is, rather, a rational approach to the
attitude that if improving one regulatory objective has a worsening
effect on another, intervention is required. I like to take practical
examples. Let us consider the balance between improving access to
justice, which must be a priority in terms of the rule of law, and
increasing public understanding of the citizen&#146;s legal rights
and duties. Both of those are regulatory objectives under clause 1. My
example concerns a firm of solicitors that is particularly good at
ensuring that people have access to justice. It gets information out of
the clients, takes it to the courts and litigates effectively in, say,
a hearing damage case, so that compensation is paid. However, it does
not explain every step of what it is doing. Because of that, it is
deemed to be contravening clause 1(1)(g) on increasing public
understanding.</div>
					<a name="0706209000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
initial regulator might say, &#147;Well, it is all right that it has
acted in a mechanical manner, because it is improving access to
justice, and people who would not otherwise have got justice have done
so.&#148; However, the LSB would say, &#147;Ah, but we are losing
out on clause 1(1)(g), so we need to intervene, even though we are
benefiting on subsection (1)(c).&#148; The point about taking the
objectives as a whole is that we can take into account whether we are
winning on one and losing on another. Clearly, if we are losing out on
one objective, and it is not making any difference to any of the
others, we are losing out as a whole. The issue is not necessarily to
do with lightness of touch, it is moreto do with
proportionality. This is just a rational approach to the fact that LSB
intervention should be based on a net loss, not on a situation in which
there is a loss on one regulatory objective and a gain on
another.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Burrowes</b>
							<b class="B">:</b>
						 It is a pleasure to make a few remarks
under your chairmanship, Sir Nicholas.</div>
					<a name="0706209000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support my hon. Friend the
Member for North-West Norfolk in wanting to assert the importance of
the work undertaken in the other place, and to highlight all the good
work that would be undone by the Minister. I should like to draw
attention to her undue emphasis on the wording&#151;no doubt she will
rebut this&#151;in suggesting that the fact that one cannot easily
define &#147;substantial&#148; will lead to a lack of clarity. We
should draw back from details of definition and consider the important
point of principle. Our concern is not so much the strength of
intervention of the LSB, but the way in which the Government wish to
implement and apply the Bill.</div>
					<a name="0706209000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to the opening debate
on the regulatory objectives. When we debated whether there was a
hierarchy of, or competition between, regulatory objectives and sought
assurance that there was not,the Minister argued that it was
made clear in the explanatory notes that there was no hierarchy.
Throughout her remarks, she has made particular reference to certain
objectives and not to others. We are concerned that when we address the
issue of how the strength of intervention of the LSB will apply, she is
not balancing the objectives. That is of the essence in this Bill.
Right at the start, in clause 1, all the objectives have equal value.
They need to be properly balanced; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div>
						that was the purpose of the Lords amendment, which
is now part of the Bill. Its aim was to considerthe impact of
the objectives, rather than have one competing with
another. To respond to the intervention of the hon. Member for Wirral,
West, one particular objective might be infringed, but that
infringement needs to be considered against the whole balance of the
objectives.</div>
					<a name="0706209000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s concern is that the amendment would undermine the
clause by allowing intervention when one or more of the regulatory
objectives is adversely affected. It undermines the case that was made
atthe beginning and raises concerns not just about
intervention. Indeed, given the passage of the Government amendment
relating to appointmentsto the Legal Services Board, the
Government&#146;s involvement without proper checks and balances and
the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice, there is a concern that
independence is being undermined systematically in terms of the Legal
Services Board&#146;s potential to intervene on any of the
objectives.</div>
					<a name="0706209000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the
Minister at this eleventh hour to take careful note whether Baroness
Ashton indeed said in the other place when the amendment passed that,
in her opinion, all their Lordships were making the same
point&#151;whether in fact we are all united in the point that we are
seeking to make. Can she assure me that a balanced approach will still
be taken to regulatory objectives, and not the pick-and-mix approach
that causes so much concern about over-intervention in the regulatory
bodies?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000732"></a>John
Mann:
						</b> There is a unity in the Lords&#151;a unity of
judges, barristers and lawyers, the vested interests who raise the
spectre of loss of independence but somehow feel it appropriate for the
judiciary to participate and vote in the very Parliament from which
they claim they want independence. The term &#147;cake and eat
it&#148; comes to mind, but unfortunately we have not had the
opportunity to make constitutional changes to put them out of their
misery in that
respect.</div>
					<a name="0706209000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I am
the only one pursuing a light touch following the debate, but
light-touch self-regulation is very dear to my heart. As for the idea
that there should be no effective Legal Services Board&#151;that its
powers should be watered down by the House of Lords and the vested
interests in the House of Commons so that it becomes a meaningless
talking shop unempowered in any specifics&#151;there are two good
retorts to that. The first is that no investigation has yet been made
by the regulatory arm or anyone else in the legal profession into the
situation with barristers and legal expense insurance. I called for
such an investigation. The current system is a scandal. It is a
national scandal, and not just individuals but the whole system should
be investigated, because it brings barristers&#146; profession into
disrepute.</div>
					<a name="0706209000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly&#151;it was more
publicised previously&#151;there has still been no investigation into
why large numbers of solicitors dealing with industrial deafness claims
are allowed to do so, giving specific and crucial advice, over the
telephone. That is a national scandal, and the legal profession should
be embarrassed and humiliated by it. Any suggestion that this House and
this Committee should water down light-touch powers to allow
self-regulation with proper teeth is, frankly, nonsense. While the
Minister resists my attempts to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 235</div>
						beef up parts of the Bill, I trust that she will be
equally robust in resisting the House of Lords and others trying to
water it
down.</div>

Prentice:
						</b> My hon. Friend has made the case for me in many
ways. There are a number of important and effective regulatory powers
in the Bill, and they are absolutely necessary to ensure that failure
by an approved regulator can be properly addressed. It is crucial that
those thresholds should be set at the right level and that the board
should not be restricted from exercising its powers when appropriate.
It is clearly in the interests of the consumer for the board to be able
to take steps quickly without having to wait until there is a
significant adverse effect</div>
					<a name="0706209000614"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on the...objectives taken as
a whole&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0706209000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
already set out, the Bill provides strong safeguards that will prevent
the arbitrary use of the regulatory powers. To that end, I am
absolutely of the belief that the amendments made in another place are
unnecessary and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw said, they
will undermine the board&#146;s role of being a strong, oversight
regulator that is able to react decisively to problems in the legal
sector, a number of which he
raised.</div>
					<a name="0706209000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall finish
by talking about the view of the National Consumer Council. It said
that it was</div>
					<a name="0706209000615"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;concerned
that this will leave the LSB impotent to act, since this
word&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706209000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;the word
&#147;significant&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="0706209000616"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;can
be interpreted differently and is difficult to prove. Further, the
Board should not have to wait until a significant event before taking
action to protect consumer
interests.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706209000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">As much as
anything else, that is the purpose ofthe Bill, and I commend
the NCC&#146;s views andthose of my hon. Friend. For that
reason, I hopethat the Committee will endorse the

another place.</div>

							<a name="0706209000772"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I have papers that could allow me to prolong
the debate for as much as an hour and a half, but the Labour Whip keeps
making rude faces at me, so I shall do my level best to curtail the
debate; I shall try to be succinct and to get the point across cogently
yet effectively.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div>
					<a name="0706209000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 247 makes it clear
that the board should give notice to the approved regulator, saying
that it has reached a decision and setting out how the statement should
be published. Again, that is perhaps stating the obvious, but the
amendment would also allow the approved regulator time to consider its
response. In the interests of fairness, the amendment says that the
Legal Services Board should not</div>
					<a name="0706209000620"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;publish the statement until after
the expiry of 7 days&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0706209000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is what amendment No. 247 says and I
very much hope that the Minister will see the logic and good sense of
the amendment.</div>
					<a name="0706209000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 13 would give the right of appeal against public censure; very
simply, the new clause makes it quite clear that there should be that
right of appeal. It is plain to the Opposition that the Government
intended that there should be measures in the Bill to provide for such
an appeal. On the other hand, we have examined the Bill carefully and
we have not seen that it offers that necessary level of protection to
the public, or to anyone who might be censured, including any approved
regulator. Therefore, having this new clause makes a great deal of
sense.</div>
					<a name="0706209000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall briefly
address amendments Nos. 248 and 249. Very simply, amendment No. 248
inserts onpage 20, line
3:</div>
					<a name="0706209000621"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the imposition of
the penalty&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706209000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
unlawful</div>
					<a name="0706209000622"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on any ground
that would give rise to a claim for judicial
review.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0706209000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
249 is consequential on that amendment. It would take out clause 39(7),
which is basically an ouster clause. Subsection (7)
says:</div>
					<a name="0706209000623"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Except as
provided by this section, the validity of a penalty is not to be
questioned by any legal proceedings
whatever.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706209000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">To my mind,
that is a straightforward ouster clause. There is a strong argument for
judicial review. I will not repeat all the arguments that were made in
the other place, but it seems to me that the amendment makes sense, is
logical and is very much in line with what the Government are trying to
do, which is to ensure that there is fair treatment for all concerned.
I do not see how one could have that fair treatment unless we accept
this amendment, which would allow the claim for judicial
review.</div>
					<a name="0706209000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore I
hope that the Minister will look carefully at what we have proposed. I
have gone through these amendments as succinctly and as quickly as I
can. On that basis, I beg to move the
amendments.</div>

							<b class="B">Simon
Hughes</b> (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD): I would
first like to welcome you, Sir Nicholas, to the Chair; it is very good
to serve under your chairmanship again.</div>
					<a name="0706209000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall be extremely brief, to
say that this amendment, those selected with it and the new clause
appear to have much to commend them. They appear 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div>to clarify matters and to make everything much more transparent, and
therefore they would add to the justice of the procedures. We are
minded to support these measures. I will obviously wait to hear what
the Minister says in reply, but I hope that she will be sympathetic to
them.</div>

							<a name="0706209000775"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> All these amendments seek to create additional
provisions for enabling decisions to be challenged. I would argue that
they are all unnecessary, because the Bill already achieves essentially
the same outcome and these amendments would just create duplication and
add to bureaucracy.</div>
					<a name="0706209000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 13 and amendment No.
247 would insert a new right of appeal from decisions on public censure
and therefore they duplicate the judicial review grounds that already
exist. Amendments Nos. 248 and 249 would allow challenges to be brought
in judicial reviews for decisions to impose financial penalties. Again,
that duplicates the grounds that already exist as part of the appeal
process.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="0706209000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am minded to
consider amendment No. 247, which states that seven days&#146; notice
must be given. I may want to look at that further. I should say though
that I am not convinced that it is entirely necessary. Clause 36
already provides that the board publishes a statement, and it must
allow a period of 28 days or more to allow the regulator to make
representations. I understand the idea of the seven days, but I think
that it is probably covered already. However, I will look at the matter
again.</div>
					<a name="0706209000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will speak
briefly about financial penalties and the circumstances in which they
are involved. There is a qualitative difference in financial penalties.
We need to guarantee the applicant&#146;s right to challenge not only
the imposition of that penalty, but also the amount of it. That is not
to say that it would not be possible to challenge the amount of the
penalty, or the timescale for payment, via judicial review, but it is
not necessarily automatic. It is more likely that the amount would have
to be manifestly unreasonable.</div>
					<a name="0706209000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is for those reasons,
therefore, that I feel thereis a lot of duplication in the
amendments. The amendments are not necessary because we have covered in
an appropriate fashion the way in which approved regulators can
challenge decisions of the board. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw would
say that nobody knows how to go to judicial review better than the
lawyers. I am quite confident that the proposed system will establish a
fairness without further duplication.</div>

amendment on judicial review. I was encouraged by what she said on the

was saying. The seven days gives the organisation that is being
censured time to respond. That is important in the interests of
fairness all round. Perhaps the Minister could come back to me on that
on Report. I am grateful to her for her remarks. On that basis, I beg
leave to withdraw the amendments.</div>

Hughes:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 225, in
clause 37, page 18, line 30, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) The Board
may not determine that it is appropriate to impose a penalty unless it
is satisfied that the matter cannot be adequately addressed by the
Board exercising the powers available to it under sections 31 to
36.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0706209000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is supported by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk and
some of his hon. friends. I will read the proposal that was put to me
and others by the Law Society which explains why the amendment is both
sensible and justified. In the clauses so far, we have looked at
various ways in which there can intervention. We have considered
censure in clauses 35 and 36, directions that can be given by the board
in clauses 32, 33 and 34. We considered the setting of performance
targets in clause 31. Before that, we examined the rules that require
the separation of regulatory and representative functions.</div>
					<a name="0706209000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are now discussing a clause
on financial penalties. The amendment is designed to restrict the
powers of the board by prohibiting it from imposing a financial penalty
unless it is satisfied that it cannot adequately address the matter by
exercising its other powers. It would put penalties on a gradated scale
and would force the board to consider other types of intervention, such
as direction or censure, before imposing a financial penalty. That
position would be consistent with that of other regulatory regimes that
have been established by Parliament in recent years. The amendment
would ensure that the Legal Services Board could not impose fines
unreasonably. It would also ensure that any action that is taken does
not hit the wrong target.</div>
					<a name="0706209000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is commonplace for direct
regulators of services, particularly those provided commercially, to
havethe power to fine those who fail to comply with
requirements. That is unarguable. The recent McCrory report emphasised
the importance of the availability to regulators of a wide range of
sanctions, including the power to fine, to ensure that the sanction for
the breach of regulatory requirements is sufficient to
removeany financial incentive to fail to comply with
responsibilities. It is sensible to have a financial penalty to deal
with wrongful activity for financial gain. That is entirely logical.
The Law Society is seeking powers to fine solicitors for regulatory
breaches in appropriate circumstances so that, as a regulator, it has
an effective range of available sanctions, rather than having to refer
all such cases to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal. That is
entirely sensible, too.</div>
					<a name="0706209000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been told&#151;I have
thought about it and I cannot dispute it&#151;that it is unusual for
there to be a power to fine a body that carries out regulatory,
non-commercial activities. I have been given the examples of the
Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence, which has no power to
fine any professional medical bodies, and the Financial Reporting
Council, which has no power to fine the accountancy bodies.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 241</div>
					<a name="0706209000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that the Legal Services
Board has extensive powers to make directions, which are by definition
enforceable, it is far from clear that a power to fine approved
regulators is necessary. The Joint Committee picked that up in its
report during pre-legislative scrutiny and the Government said that
they would reconsider the issue, but they have not come back with an
answer to the concerns expressed in the Joint Committee or elsewhere.
In the Lords, the issue was debated in part. Baroness Ashton, the
Minister, sought to justify the power to fine with reference to the
position of other regulators, including the Financial Services
Authority and Ofgem. Both of those directly regulate service providers,
however; there is no intervening tier, so they do not supervise other
regulators. The Legal Services Board is, by definition, the umbrella.
Other regulators, of which the Law Society is one, have been approved
to set up in anticipation of the legislation. It is not a parallel
situation. We are talking about a three-tier structure; the other
organisations that have such a power to fine are part of a two-tier
structure.</div>
					<a name="0706209000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been
told that the only example that supports the Minister&#146;s case is
the power of the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner, which was
created under an addition to the Access to Justice Act 1999. It was
intended to cover a specific problem with the Law Society&#146;s
handling of consumer complaints. I remember the debate on the subject,
and there was thought to be a need to give the commissioner more teeth
in that context. It is unusual for a supervisory regulator to have the
power fine another regulator, so that power needs to be confined to
circumstances in which no other sanction is appropriate. The first
argument against the provision is therefore that it is not based on
precedent and it appears wrong in
principle.</div>
					<a name="0706209000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
argument is that, with legal services regulation, day-to-day
responsibility for regulatory action will, by definition, rest with the
regulatory arm of the relevant professional body. The representative
side will not be able to control the way in which the regulatory arm
operates; indeed, it would be a serious breach of the principle of
independence if it sought to do so. One of our great debates was about
ensuring that we separate regulation and representation absolutely and
rightfully.</div>
					<a name="0706209000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any fine
would not impact on the regulatory arm unless it were charged against
the regulation side&#146;s own budget, which would defeat the whole
purpose of having a fine, because that would mean fining the fund that
is there to put things right and to deal with problems. Any such fine
would effectively be borne by the professional body, and thus its
members and the representative arm. Members of the regulatory arm would
not even be subject to any sanction from an electorate for having
incurred the fine, as they are all appointed under Nolan principles
rather than elected, so they could not be ousted. It would not be the
equivalent of a vote of no confidence that would result in them leaving
their office.</div>
					<a name="0706209000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
a risk that lawyers who are regulated by the approved regulator will
bear the whole burden of any such fine without being able to exercise
any effective influence over the people whose failings led to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div>imposition of the fine. That seems wrong to me, as a matter of
principle. I believe that the Joint Committee also thought it wrong,
but the answers given in the Lords did not address the issue. That is
my second reason for asking the Minister to be
sympathetic.</div>
					<a name="0706209000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
debates in the other place, the Government tabled an amendment to
ensure that approved regulators cannot be fined for the failings of
their regulatory arm unless a direction has already been made under
clause 31. That provides some welcome protection for approved
regulators. By placing appropriate requirements on their regulatory
arms, they will be able to ensure that they can intervene where
necessary to ensure that directions are complied with, but there is
still a significant risk of fines being used inappropriately, because
the current drafting does not prevent that. It does not seem to
guarantee that other options have to be considered before that power is
used.</div>
					<a name="0706209000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">My last point is
that there is frequent media pressure on professional bodies across the
board, not just legal bodies, and on regulators to flex their muscles
and exercise their powers to intervene. That is rightful and
understandable in certain cases; you and many others, Sir Nicholas,
have been keen, in our talks on rail services in this place, that the
regulator should be able to intervene when railway companies do not do
their jobs properly and services are not what constituents of yours,
mine and our colleagues would wish. It is absolutely right that there
should be calls for that to happen, but that alone is not a good
justification for it to be the common practice if other remedies are
appropriate and available.</div>
					<a name="0706209000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Good regulatory practice
requires regulators to use the least draconian sanction that will meet
the regulatory need. It would be quite wrong to fine an approved
regulator simply because circumstances have arisen in which there is,
in theory at least, a power to do so. The power to fine should properly
be exercised only when the Legal Services Board is satisfied, under the
provisions in the Bill, that no lesser sanction, such as direction or
censure, will suffice. I believe that the Government have accepted that
principle as far as the board&#146;s power to intervene in the
functions of approved regulators is concerned. I think that that was
said to be generally the case by Ministers elsewhere, and I suggest
that the same principles should apply to fines as it does elsewhere. On
that basis, I hope that the Minister will accept our arguments, or at
least take them away to consider, and will be
sympathetic.</div>

						</b> My name and those of my colleagues have,
indeed, been added to the amendment. It is a simple and
straightforward, but nevertheless important, safeguard to ensure that
the LSB does not impose financial penalties where lesser sanctions
would suffice. The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey made
a very powerful case. It is designed to prevent capricious,
over-the-top fining. It is to ensure that the fining option is the last
option available. I take on point his point: there will be quite a lot
of pressure on the Legal Services Board to make examples and to flex
its muscles. If it is to do that, an extra constraint needs to be built
in. That is why we support the amendment and I hope that the Minister
will accept it.</div>

Mann:
						</b> You missed, I suspect, Sir Nicholas, the floods and
downpours across the north of England over the weekend. Hon. Members
are more than making up for it with their attempts to water down the
Bill. Indeed, one wonders whether one is living in a parallel universe.
I expect the Tardis to appear at any moment. I know which Time Lord
will be backing the people and which will be backing the solicitors,
barristers and
judges.</div>
					<a name="0706209000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
absolutely extraordinary in the context of the Bill and what is
happening in the real world that we are seeing attempt after attempt
after attempt by the vested interests of the legal profession to look
after their own. If this was trade union legislation 15 years ago, if
this was the immediate fining of trade unions for technical flaws in
the holding of industrial action ballots,would the hon. Member
for North-West Norfolk(Mr Bellingham) argue that it was
capricious and over the top? I think
not.</div>
					<a name="0706209000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me balance the
argument and cite the case of four of my constituents who three years
ago madea consumer complaint against Rayleys Solicitors.
Rayleys Solicitors disputed it. They disputed the fact that these four,
elderly, ill miners had a complaint. All four went with me to visit
Rayleys unexpectedly, with a little bit of publicity, and we went
inside and met the senior partners. We explained their case for justice
in no uncertain terms. Still Rayleys refused to pay out. They still do
today. There have been no fines on Rayleys. They are
allowed to prevaricate. Why? Because every time one thing happens, the
legal profession comes up with a legal excuse for challenging
it.</div>
					<a name="0706209000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">My constituents
were required to go through70 pages of technical legal
arguments as the defence to a very straightforward complaint that they
had been diddled and double charged over meagre compensation for
emphysema, money they needed to give them a better quality of life.
They had 70 pages of legal argument thrown at them as the defence that
they are required to make a judgment on. It is only because of the
common sense of the Law Society in allowing representation from people
like me that these claims have ever seen the light of day.</div>
					<a name="0706209000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is it a coincidence that no
miner or textile worker put in complaints before tiny numbers of MPs
started to do so on their behalf? Is it just a coincidence that none of
them did so, that they did not realise that they could challenge the
solicitor who had, in some cases, stolen the money from them? That was
done quite openly and quite deliberately and from large numbers of
them. The solicitors then threw the legal book at them, wriggling every
way, challenging the Law Society, challenging the regulation. They
issued writs, bullied, threatened and intimidated.</div>
					<a name="0706209000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are solicitors who visited
complainants at home. There are solicitors who sent third parties to
visit complainants at home. For example, my constituent, after his
third heart attack, is no longer in the statistics of the Law Society
because he withdrew his complaint, fearing that the pressures being put
on him by the solicitors who had done him over would kill him. Some of
my constituents who, in the process of attempting to get justice,
died&#151;</div>

the Joint Committee&#151;I was unfortunately unable to be chosen to
serve on that Committee&#151;whose voices shouldbe heard in
the case of these amendments and, if necessary, others. Any watering
down of the powers in the Bill will be resisted. If the point was put
to the people outside, the 60 million who are not part of the cosy
legal profession, I know which way they would go. They would say that
the Bill is a modest attempt at self-regulation. It is a generous
attempt at allowing self-regulation&#151;I applaud that light touch
and think that it is what is appropriate for Government, and therefore
I am out of touch with most of my constituents, who would like me to be
far more robust. I call on the Minister strongly to reject these
representations and others to water down the Bill because those with
vested interests, not least in the House of Lords, wish to protect
them.</div>

justification, as far as I know, about solicitors&#146; abuse of
their professional responsibility when acting in the sorts of cases
that he has brought regularly to the attention of the House and dealt
with locally. Nobody, and certainly nobody in my party, defends that
activity. Nobody is suggesting that solicitors who behave
inappropriately should not be dealt with.</div>
					<a name="0706209000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon. Gentleman is good
enough to reconsider by re-reading the amendment, he will see that it
does not say that there should not be fines or punishment for
solicitors. It does not say that solicitors&#146; firms should not be
punished or brought to book for breaking the rules and behaving in the
disgraceful way that he described. It does not say that there should
not be a fine on the Law Society, if appropriate. All that it says is
that if the second tier of punishment, which involves punishment of the
regulator&#151;the Law Society in the case of solicitors&#151;is a
financial penalty, it has to come after consideration of the
appropriateness of other matters. I do not think that that is
contradictory to anything that the hon. Gentleman argues for. I
certainly did not intend it to be, and on reflection, if he is
fair-minded about it, I do not think that he will think that the
amendment has that effect.</div>
					
					<a name="0706209000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000785"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> I am a wee bit surprised to see these
amendments. They were debated for some time in the other place, and we
made a number of concessions at that time. I know that my hon. Friend
the Member for Bassetlaw will not be happy to hear me say that, but we
made some concessions and as a result the exercise of the
board&#146;s powers to fine is possible only where there 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 245</div>has been a failure to meet the requirements imposed by clauses 30, 32
and 51. I am not persuaded that we should go any further than the scope
of the amendments that we have already made. To do so would put the
board&#146;s powers to impose a financial penalty in the same
category as its powers, for example, to cancel the approved
regulator&#146;s designation. That is what the amendment seems to
seek to do, and so it does not recognise the regulatory chasm between
the power to impose a financial penalty and the power to take away
completely a body&#146;s ability to authorise and regulate the
provisions of reserved legal
activities.</div>
				
					<a name="0706209000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment, therefore, would
reduce the board&#146;s ability to exercise what I believe is a key
regulatory function to make appointments if it were no longer able to
respond with the flexibility that it needs to address failing
regulators. That is inconsistent with the current approach to
regulatory sanctioning regimes, which argue for greater flexibility and
the use of the widest range of sanctions
possible.</div>
					<a name="0706209000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey said that he could not find
many examples of one regulator fining another. Almost certainly he is
right. The model of oversight regulation that we are proposing is
unusual, but Sir David Clementi thought it preferable to the
establishment of a single body along the lines of the Securities and
Futures Authority because it will retain the best parts of the existing
arrangements. He argued also that the LSB should have the maximum
regulatory flexibility, which is consistent with the findings of the
Macrory review, which argued that regulators should have the widest
range of sanctions possible.</div>
					<a name="0706209000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have modified the fining
power to meet some of the concerns of the Law Society. I have to say to
Opposition Members that the consumer bodies would not support the
amendment if it meant that we were watering down the powers any
further. There might be times when it is necessary to impose a
financial penalty&#151;for example, where there were repeated
failings that could be addressed by censure each time, but where,
accumulatively, the situation was out of control and firm action was
clearly necessary. If the regulator expects a lesser power to be
exercised each time it fails in the same way, and if that power has no
real impact on the regulator in preventing future failings, clearly
that regulator has far less incentive to correct those failings. The
board would be stuck then with issuing the same censure over and again
and the problem would never be
resolved.</div>

							<a name="0706209000786"></a>Stephen
Hesford:
						</b> Is not the point a little shorter? I know that
the Minister is trying to do justice to what has been said, but is the
point not that the amendment is completely unnecessary because, under
clause 39(2)(c), one of the grounds for an appeal against financial
penalties is that the penalty is unreasonable? If it were unreasonable,
and there should have been a lesser penalty, the appeals procedure
would find that to be the
case.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000787"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I raised
clause 39 for that very reason in an earlier debate. The approved
regulators would have that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div>opportunity if they thought that the fine was unreasonable. I said
specifically that almost certainly they would appeal on the basis of
the amount, rather than anything else. He is right to point that
out.</div>
					<a name="0706209000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consumers, who are
at the heart of the Bill, consider that the power to impose a financial
penalty is essential to the regulator&#146;s remit. I think that they
are right. It sends a clear message to the regulated body that it must
improve its standards, and acts as a reminder to other
bodies that failings will not go unnoticed or
unattended. That is vital for the consumer. Unnecessary restraints
would deal a blow to the very heart of the principles in the Bill. If I
need to convince the Opposition of that, Which? did a survey and found
that nearly four out of five people&#151;78 per cent.&#151;agreed
that the independent regulator should be able to fine the legal
profession if it did not do its job properly. More than 53 per cent.
agreed with that strongly.</div>
					<a name="0706209000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge the Committee to reject
the amendment for the reasons given by me and by my hon. Friends. I
cannot accept any further constraints on the power. Its purpose is
clear, its necessity is verifiable and its scope is balanced. I hope
that Opposition Members will reflect on what has been said and
reconsider whether they are helping the legal profession by giving
consumers the belief that this is another opportunity for it to look
after its own interests rather than
theirs.</div>

						</b> The Minister knows that I am a reflective
individual. I shall make three short points. The first is that Which?,
a good organisation that produces a good magazine&#151;I have often
consulted it, as have other Committee members&#151;does not surprise
the world by finding that a majority of the public at large would like
solicitors who do not do their job properly to be fined. I do not think
that that quite wins the argument of itself. It is a simple question to
which the likely answer is
yes.</div>
					<a name="0706209000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">To answer the
contribution of the hon. Member for Wirral, West, of course there is a
power of appeal on the basis that a fine is unreasonable. That is as it
should be. The argument was not that there should be no power to fine;
it was simply that the power to fine should be the end of the options
available. However, despite what arguments may still exist for the
amendment and for others like it, the Minister has asked me to withdraw
it and to reflect. I am happy to reflect. I shall go back and read what
she said earlier when the debate is printed. On that basis, and on the
basis that I shall return to the matter if necessary, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

not moved.</div>
					<a name="0706209000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to
ask a question, which of course is not directly related to the
amendment but was promptedby it. The clause is about further
provision for intervention directions and, therefore, gives options for
interventions. The hon. Gentleman obviously thought about ways in which
powers of entry and other things could provide opportunities for
intervention.</div>
					<a name="0706209000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
be grateful if the Minister gave some examples of the sort of further
provision that she envisages will result from the Bill. What would be
an extreme example of a regulation under the Bill? Thisis an
enabling clause to allow secondary regulation. Clause 42(6) states that
regulations will be made by the Lord Chancellor, but will all
regulations be made by him? Will the Minister say what kinds of
measures she envisages will be introduced under the
clause?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000806"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> As the hon. Gentleman said, this is an enabling
clause, behind which lies the idea that, if an approved regulator
failed or refused to provide the information that the board required,
it could apply to the court for a warrant to search premises and to
seize materials.</div>
					<a name="0706209000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause gives the Lord Chancellor a power to make regulations about what
the judge or justice of the peace should consider before granting a
warrant, and how such a warrant might be executed. The Lord Chancellor
must consult with or, indeed, receive the recommendation of the board
before he makes regulations. I do not quite know whether that answers
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000807"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I expected the Minister to say what she said, but
I would like to ask some further questions. Elsewhere in the Ministry
of Justice portfolio, there is a Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement
Bill, which I anticipate will be discussed on the Floor of the
House
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div>on Report and Third Reading in the relatively near future. One of the
issues with that Bill is powers of entry, to which the clause also
relates. We should not legislate to give powers of entry without people
knowing clearly who will come to enter and what powers they will have.
Such people should be clearly identifiable as people with
authority.</div>
					<a name="0706209000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
protection will the Bill provide for a citizen or
organisation&#151;by definition, it could be an individual or a
company? What does the Bill provide to ensure that people know that a
person coming to enter comes with authority? I am troubled because a
recent review of current powers of entry under law showed that there
are hundreds and that they relate to different people and
organisations. The ordinary woman or man should know that people who
come to enter do so with authority, and how to check that. How would a
person know that another was authorised and what would they have to do
to find out? I appreciate that that might be a secondary legislation
point, but giving more powers willy-nilly to people to knock on doors
and to enter is dangerous, unless we protect citizens against it,
except for in the most extreme circumstances. People should know
exactly what the score is and have the ability to avoid such
action.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a point that is
important for two reasons. First, as he says, if someone comes knocking
at one&#146;s door, one ought to be able to know why and under what
power they are there. Secondly, we should ensure that the Bill does not
contradict the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Bill. The Lord
Chancellor&#146;s consideration of the judge or the justice of the
peace is one aspect of the issue, but by way of reassurance to the hon.
Gentleman, I shall consider the way in which the provision fits in with
the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Bill, so that there is
consistency. I shall write to the Committee about that at a later

etc).&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0706209000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the amendment will not be controversial. It tries to clarify
the drafting of an amendment, which was made in the other place, about
the board&#146;s policy statements. I hope that the revision sets out
more accurately the relationship between the board and the approved
regulators. As I have said on many occasions, we have
accepted Sir David Clementi&#146;s recommendation of the B+ model for
oversight regulation, which should be the basis of the new regulatory
framework. That principle allows existing regulators to continue to
authorise people in respect of certain legal activities and to regulate
those persons. Overseeing that front-line regulation is the Legal
Services Board, which will take over many of the functions currently
undertaken by a number of the existing oversight regulators, including
the Secretary of State, the Master of the Rolls, the immigration
services commissioner and the Archbishop of Canterbury. The board may
move to regulate authorised persons directly only where there is no
other suitable or willing regulator to carry out that
role.</div>
					
					<a name="0706209000648"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div>
					<a name="0706209000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is my
understanding that the amendment introduced in the other place in many
respects sought to achieve the kind of thing that I have just
described. In trying to get the B+ model in the Bill, it is vital that
we should not inadvertently compromise the existing provisions. For
example, the Lords amendment provided that policy statements
must</div>
					<a name="0706209000624"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;respect the
principle that primary responsibility for regulation rests with the
approved
regulators&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0706209000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Except in
those extreme cases where the board may have to regulate directly, it
will have quite different responsibilities from those of the approved
regulators.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div>
					<a name="0706209000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, different as those
functions may be, I do not want to give the Committee the impression
that they are not as important, or that the board should not have any
primary responsibility for regulation. A strong and independent
oversight regulator is what consumers have long been calling for. We
owe it to them to deliver just that. I do not want to be part of
anything that relegates the board to being a regulatory also ran. I
want to ensure that the role of the approved regulators is concerned
with direct regulation of authorised persons, whereas the role of the
board is principally one of oversight. I hope that
the amendment makes that
clear.</div>
					<a name="0706209000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other aspect
of the Lords amendment was the reasonableness test. I felt that that
had the potential to restrict the board from taking the appropriate
regulatory action in some circumstances. For example,
an approved regulator may make a number of decisions
that in themselves all appear to be reasonable, but the overall effect
of those decisions may have an adverse impact on the regulatory
objectives. That may mean that the board would have to take action. In
such a case, the reasonableness test might not be satisfied, which
would then leave the board unable to take appropriate action.</div>
					<a name="0706209000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, we have always
maintained that issues should be resolved informally before resorting
to more formal statutory powers, in line with best regulatory practice.
The Bill already provides for that by requiring the board to have
regard to the principles in clause 3, including proportionality and
targeting activities only where action is needed. However, I understand
the desire of regulators to ensure that the board should highlight how
those principles are achieved when setting out its policy statements. I
have tabled the amendment to set that out, albeit without affecting the
thresholds already set out in clauses 31 to 45 and in clause
76.</div>

the discussions wentinto the detail of the difference between
the two amendments, but it was accepted that they would be happy to see
an amendment if it gave general force to the principle behind the
original one. We have now worded things in a way that provides the
components necessary for the board to be able to set out the policy
statements on how much it takes into account its oversight role, and
the principle that the issues that should be resolved informally are
resolved informally, using proportionality as the test before
exercising the other powers.</div>
					<a name="0706209000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">As always, the amendment has
gone before our consumer panel, which supported this wording rather

&#147;could reasonably have taken&#148; in subsection (3)(b), but
if one examines the overall impact of the Lords amendment, one sees
that it explains things in more detail than the Government
amendment.</div>
					<a name="0706209000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
mentioned that she believed thatthe Law Society was happy with
the Government amendment. It has made its position clear, stating in
writing to members of the Committee:</div>
					<a name="0706209000625"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Committee should
therefore reject the Government&#146;s amendment, and retain the
provision passed by the House of
Lords.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706209000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree
with the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey that Which? is an excellent organisation. All of us read
<i class="I">Which?</i> magazine from time to time. As the Minister rightly keeps
telling us, the Bill is about giving consumers a better deal. It is
worth pointing out that Which? told me that it does not oppose the
inclusion of the Lords amendment in the Bill as a cosmetic reassurance
to the legal professions. That might be a touch grudging, but it
indicates that Which? does not see any need to remove the current
wording.</div>
					<a name="0706209000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
having a close look at why the House of Lords made the changes. It did
so because it wanted to incorporate in the Bill the statements about
the relationship between the board and the approved regulators, which
the Government had made in other contexts. We should consider what the
Legal Services Board is all about and then examine what the Joint
Committee said. It
said:</div>
					<a name="0706209000626"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe it is important that the LSB has an effective range of powers,
but it is also important that the Draft Bill ensures that they are only
used where necessary, in order to avoid undue micro-managing of the
approved regulators...The Draft Bill should ensure
that&#151;consistent with the Government&#146;s policy that lead
responsibility should rest with the approved regulators&#151;the
Legal Services Board acts in
partnership&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706209000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;I
like that word
&#147;partnership&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="0706209000627"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;with
the approved regulators, seeking to resolve differences by agreement
wherever possible&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0706209000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also worth pointing out
something that the Government said in response to the Joint Committee.
My hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate served on it, as did
the hon. Member for Wirral West. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw was not
put on it, despite applying, and that was a pity, given his knowledge
and experience. The Government&#146;s response was that the
LSB</div>
					<a name="0706209000628"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;should...work in
partnership with authorised regulators, leaving them with the
responsibility for day to day
regulation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706209000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking at
the way in which the Government responded to the Joint Committee, , I
find it strange that they are trying to remove the Lords
amendment.</div>
					<a name="0706209000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us look
at the essence of Sir David Clementi&#146;s recommendation. He could
have gone for an all-singing, all-dancing unitary system of regulation,

<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div>rather like the Financial Services Authority. However, he decided not to
do that for the simple reason that he took the view that regulation had
to be independentof Government. He rightly took the view that
the professional bodies were well established, so it would make no
sense to build such bodies from scratch, and that it was important to
get the professionals in the different parts of the legal services
world to buy in to regulation and to secure the maximum good will and
confidence in the new system from the word go.</div>
					<a name="0706209000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bearing that in mind, their
lordships looked carefully at the measure, and came up with an
amendment that I think is workable. It was discussed at great length
and road-tested before a number of experts; it was not just put forward
on the back of a fag packet. We should be aware that the Minister
hinted that it might be possible for the Government to issue further
guidance if need be. It is not on for the Government to give guidance
to the board; any suggestion of that is a little disturbing. It might
be appropriate in some cases for guidance to be given to bodies that
undertake what are effectively Government functions, but that is
manifestly not the case in relation to the approved regulators. Far
from it.

want to hear what the Minister has to say, and the Government Whip
keeps looking at me.</div>
					<a name="0706209000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">One has also to consider the
costs. We do not want the LSB to be a primary regulator or to treat the
approved regulators as its administrative outposts. We want it to have
a working relationship with them that is based on confidence and trust,
not on micro-managing and trying to second-guess everything that they
try to do, or laying down detailed templates as to whatthey
should do. That is why the Lords came upwith a pragmatic,
imaginative, sensible and workable amendment, and the Government should
not be trying to remove it at this stage. We will listen carefully
tothe Minister, but our inclination is to reject the
Government&#146;s
amendment.</div>

							<a name="0706209000831"></a>John

amendment. It does something that we will not oppose at this point, but
might come back to later on the Floor of the House.</div>
					<a name="0706209000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">We always ask to what extent the
principles, as defined in the Bill, are enforceable through judicial
review. We have issues about the parameters established by subsection
(3)(b), because any policy determined by the board can be used as a
basis for judicial review under the principle of
procedural legitimate expectation. Therefore, the measure has quite a
substantial impact on the Bill.</div>
					<a name="0706209000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">Personally, I am not completely
comfortable with subsection (3)(b) because it is a bit too wide.
Although we are not happy with the Government amendment, we are not
going to oppose it at this stage. We may come back to it on the Floor
of the House. It is important to determine the relationship between the
LSB and the regulators. This is an important engine house of that
process because of the facility to take issues to judicial review under
the principle of procedural legitimate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div>expectation. The board needs to have the ability to exercise powers
other than in circumstances in which the individual regulators could
not reasonably do
so.</div>

							<a name="0706209000832"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> I support the amendment, and I do so for a
practical reason that can be illustrated by the miners&#146;
compensation cases. This legislation is taking away the legal services
ombudsman. She has been the only person in the current system to have
said to the regulatory authorities, &#147;You have got this
wrong,&#148; or &#147;You are dealing with cases too
strongly.&#148; If the Legal Services Board does not have the
ultimate say, or some backstop, to enforce and say to regulators that
they are too slow on cases or that they are dealing with them
inappropriately, who will stand up for the consumer?</div>
					<a name="0706209000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill will take away the
legal services ombudsman, but we need to retain that ombudsman&#146;s
powers in some form. That is why I support the amendment and the
Government&#146;s position. The Legal Services Board has to have that
backstop position so that it can ultimately say, &#147;I&#146;m
sorry, but you are not doing your regulatory job correctly&#151;get
on with it,&#148; sometimes question regulators&#146; effectiveness
and stand up for the consumer. At the end of the day, as the Minister
has said on a number of occasions, the champion of the consumer in this
Bill will be the Legal Services
Board.</div>

							<a name="0706209000833"></a>John

						</b> I should like to add one other little point. If
we maintained the current situation in respect of the Lord Chief
Justice and the appointment of the Legal Services Board, I would not
want the change at all.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000834"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> We have established that we all agree that Sir
David&#146;s B+ model is the appropriate system for regulating the
legal profession, that the approved regulators should be able to get on
withthe role of regulating authorised persons and that the
board should oversee that. It is important that any provisions that set
out those principles do not contradict or lead to confusion about
existing principles already set out in the Bill. It is vital that we
take care to ensure that amendments are compatible with the rest of the
Bill. I think that this amendment is.
</div>
					<a name="0706209000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout the debates
in the House of Lords, peers pressed regularly for provisions that more
clearly set out the relationship between the board and the approved
regulators. Those threshold amendments were inserted following a vote,
and the combination of restricting the board&#146;s powers and the
recognitionof the B+ model in policy statements
developeda confusion. We have tabled the amendment
understanding that it is important to show that the board is an
oversight regulator, as opposed to the approved regulators that do the
day-to-day work; as the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk rightly
said, the board does not micro-manage what is going on.</div>
					<a name="0706209000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Birmingham,
Yardley makes an important point about subsection (3)(b). That
causes problems because it sets a threshold, a
Wednesbury test, that is too difficult for the board to achieve. It
also adds 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column254" />Column number: 254</div>further confusion. The test is difficult to meet and as a result, it
could be difficult for the board to take appropriate action. It is
important that we take that bit
out.</div>
					<a name="0706209000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the
Committee feels able to support the amendment, which has been drafted
in good faith. It tries to achieve what the other place was asking for,
but in a way that is compatible with the rest of the Bill and clearly
sets out the role of the oversight regulator, as opposed to that of the
approved regulators doing their day-to-day work. On that basis, I ask
the Committee to agree to the
amendments.</div>

is a very simple amendment. As lawyers would say, &#147;Res ipsa
loquitur&#148;; it speaks for itself. There are arguments for
different types of income to be kept separate. The Institute of Trade
Mark Attorneys provides an illustration of the problems that could
arise in any recovery of the levy. It is a private body, limited by
guarantee, which performs regulatory and non-regulatory functions. If a
levy can be recovered against all their assets, it would mean that the
assets of the business, including income and capital assets derived
from non-regulatory and represented sources could be vulnerable, even
though as a regulator, the institute and its members are precluded from
realising any financial benefit from any other regulatory
activity.</div>

could be private persons or businesses who are expected to guarantee a

thatthe recovery of a levy should be limited to funds
ring-fenced as provided in the amendment.</div>

Hemming:
						</b> The facts may speak for themselves in a
legalistic sense, but I am not sure that they do in an accounting
sense. I cannot understand why it is trust money and requires to be
accounted for separately. I do not see how that can be, as under
insolvency law, for example, one cannot merely keep that which has been
received unless trust status is created for it, which cannot be done
just by keeping it separately in a bank account. At the end of the day,
the objective is to say that if the levy is &#163;1 million and the
income is only &#163;900,000, the &#163;900,000 does not get paid.
The reality is that that amount would be secured against the
organisation&#146;s other assets, so I cannot see how it is of any
advantage to anyone, or that it achieves the stated
objectives.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000851"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point. It
would be wrong in any legislation to restrict how moneys owed may be
recovered. In that sense, we are being consistent with general
legislative practice.</div>
					<a name="0706209000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand why hon. Gentlemen might want assurances that the funds
raised for representative functions are not used for regulatory ones.
However, I cannot agree that the statute is the place to put an
absolute requirement on approved regulators to ring- fence income
derived from practising fees.</div>
					<a name="0706209000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are also a number of
problems in putting an absolute duty on approved regulators in this
way. There are also a number of problems in putting an absolute duty on
approved regulators in this way. First, some flexibility is necessary
in the way in which they set out their financial arrangements, and what
might be right for one regulator might not be appropriate for another.
For example, the amendment does not take accountof approved
regulators who exercise only a regulatory function
and do not operate in a representative capacity, such as the Council
for Licensed Conveyancers. It would be unnecessarily restrictive to
limit their financial arrangements in this
way.</div>
					<a name="0706209000430"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some aspects of
the practising fee income could be relevant to both regulatory and
representative sides of an approved regulator. Clause 51 states that
fees can be raised for the purpose
of</div>
					<a name="0706209000629"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the promotion of the
protection by law of human rights and fundamental

either with external regulators or with approved regulators. That is
why it is
important.</div>

No. 252 would simply add to and complement that. I shall not go through
it in detail, because the Minister will have had a technical briefing
on it. It was tabled as a probing amendment in the House of Lords. We
did not receive a satisfactory response at the time, and I would like
the Minister to say either that she can accept it because it improves
the Bill and the clause, or that she cannot accept it and give and give
an explanation for that. I look forward to hearing what she has to
say.</div>

							<a name="0706209000858"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> As the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk said,
these amendment are similar to amendments that were tabled in another
place. We agreed there to reflect on the initial suggestions put
forward. I say to the hon. Gentleman that, having reflected, we do not
believe the amendments would do much to alter existing policy on
regulatory conflict, except perhaps risk inviting undesirable
interpretations of how the obligations on approved regulators should
apply.</div>
					<a name="0706209000446"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sorry that
I will disappoint the hon. Gentleman again, but that is not to say that
I do not sympathise with the objectives behind the amendments. I agree
that it is essential for the Bill to do all it can to facilitate
co-operation between regulatory bodies when a range of professionals
work together, and that robust procedures for dealing with regulatory
conflicts are a key part of that. The clause is effective enough to
achieve that, and no evidence has arisen since it was debated before to
persuade me
otherwise.</div>
					<a name="0706209000447"></a><div class="hs_Para">I realise
that the provision is not the same as that being made in relation to
conflicts between two approved regulators. Given the different legal
contexts, it is neither possible nor appropriate for it to be the same.
Clauses 52 and 53 impose detailed and specific mutual obligations upon
approved regulators, in particular requiring them to consider requests
from regulated members to consider any specific regulatory arrangements
that might create conflict and to submit to the direction of the board
in the event that it identifies a need for any particular arrangement
to be altered.</div>
					<a name="0706209000448"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
not possible to translate those principles into the context of clause
54, mainly because it would not be within the scope of the Bill to seek
to impose obligations upon regulators of non-legal services or require
them to submit to the jurisdiction of the board. They can of course do
that voluntarily, and the clause recognises that, but only to the
extent that it is compatible with other legal and regulatory
obligations to which external bodies are subject. The clause therefore
relies entirely upon the efforts of approved regulators for its
efficacy. That is appropriate given the aims and scope of the Bill, and
I do not want to amend it in a way that could risk uncertain and overly
onerous impositions on approved regulators.</div>
					<a name="0706209000449"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause already imposes clear
duties on the approved regulators to have regard to other regulatory
regimes. They are required not only to take measures to prevent
regulatory conflict and avoid unnecessary duplication of regulatory
requirements but to provide for the resolution of conflicts that do
arise. That does not only apply when the initial rules are drafted, it
is a continuing obligation that should inform all current and future
regulatory arrangements. That combination of requirements goes a long
way towards achieving the outcome sought in the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="0706209000450"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some
respects the clause goes a bit further than clause 52. The duty to
avoid unnecessary duplication is unique to clause 54 and intended
specifically to target 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 258</div>issues that might arise in relation to external regulatory conflicts and
give effect to general principles of better regulation.</div>
					<a name="0706209000451"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would not assist
in encouraging better regulation or preventing regulatory conflict. At
worst, they could exacerbate conflicts and increase bureaucracy. They
would apply a further statutory burden to the approved regulators not
only to address conflicts with external regulators but to take action
formally on any applications about specific instances, no matter how
numerous and whatever their merit or relevance. That could increase the
pressure on approved regulators to be overly assiduous, to avoid the
possibility of legal challenge if they fail properly to consider every
approach made by an external regulator. It would have the undesirable
effect of diverting substantial resources from both the approved
regulators and the board into handling those requests when they could
be more productively engaged in ensuring that their own rules take a
robust and consistent approach to pre-empting conflicts, and dealing
effectively with overlapping regulatory regimes.
</div>
					<a name="0706209000452"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that note, clause
54 as drafted has achieved about the right balance between ensuring
that the approved regulators are obliged to take a proactive approach
to dealing with external regulatory conflicts, but not to create an
undesirable and potentially burdensome duty on themselves in so doing.
I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

to enforce the legislation. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was
necessarily talking about the idea that it might become a criminal
offence to disobey the legal services, but the difficulty then becomes
how to enforce the proposed measures. One would have to apply to the
High Court for an order. Failure to comply with that order would be
contempt of court and enforced accordingly, so if the Committee passed
the amendment, we would not be getting anywhere, as it will be possible
in practice to go to the High Court quickly if that is required. The
files to which the hon. Gentleman referred would probably be held by an
individual firm, not a regulator.

have been situations in which self-regulation has failed, and that
there needs to be pressure on regulators such as the General Medical

enforce that on the GMC&#151;a court order is obtained, and the GMC
obeys&#151;but that is not the sort of thing that happens within the
time scales that the hon. Gentleman is thinking of. To that extent, the

						</b> I understand entirely why my hon. Friend has

importantly, not compliant with the European convention on human
rights. I obviously cannot accept an amendment that is not ECHR
compliant. On that basis alone, I will have to ask my hon. Friend to
withdraw his amendment. It is right that the magnitude of power that he
seeks here is the subject of judicial scrutiny. It would be entirely
inappropriate to leave the exercise of a High Court power to the
discretion of the board. The power here pre-empts the courts in a way
that would allow that.</div>

I cannot accept my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment. Also, I would
suggest to him gently that the term &#147;exceptional
circumstances&#148; is not clear enough for statute. It leaves too
much open to interpretation. I do not think that it is clear enough to
guarantee that the rights of the approved regulator would be protected,
either under articles 6 or 8 of the European convention. On that basis,
I would ask my hon. Friend to withdraw his
amendments.</div>

one case&#151;for the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal to meet to
consider their cases. Clearly, the regulator, if instructed to get on
with that, would be unable to comply. There are some wider issues
involved. Perhaps the Minister might write to the Committee about when
the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal will meet and where the power then
lies. That is precisely what my constituents and others who are waiting

					<a name="0706209000486"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment deals with whether the Legal Services Board should regulate
legal services and, if so, in what circumstances. The proposal is that
it should do that only as a last resort and if there is no other
regulator that could do the job. This is all to do with the back-up
provision in the Bill that says, in effect, that there should be
regulators for the different legal activities but that, in exceptional
circumstances, the big regulator&#151;the LSB&#151;can do the
regulating.</div>
					<a name="0706209000487"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Minister and I were serving on the Compensation Bill, we discussed what
sort of regulator there would be. In that context, the decision was
taken that a civil servant would be the regulator on behalf of the
Department, so that the Department became the regulator for the time
being. I stand to be corrected, but I believe that that is what was
agreed.</div>
					<a name="0706209000488"></a><div class="hs_Para">As an interim
arrangement, knowing that coming down the track was the Legal Services
Bill, the Government gave an express undertaking that, after that Bill
became an Act and the regulatory systems were set up, a further
transfer of regulatory responsibilities to the authorities would occur
under this Bill. In essence, that was a provision for the Big Brother
regulator of last resort to do the job for the time being, and the
amendment relates to
it.</div>
					<a name="0706209000489"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is to
subsection (4) on page 35, which is about the designation order and
states:</div>
					<a name="0706209000633"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

					<a name="0706209000491"></a><div class="hs_Para">In effect, the
amendment states that, if somebody is there, give them the job; if not,
the provision would come into force. I shall say just a few words about
the logic of that
position.</div>
					<a name="0706209000492"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout
the discussion of the Bill, the Government have made it clear that they
intend the lead role in regulation to rest with the existing
professional bodies. There will be an interim handover phase, and the
LSB will therefore be the supervisory body&#151;the safety net. The
logic behind the Bill is that the board would intervene only when
necessary. That is the view being subscribed to, and there is a
discussion about the theology of the words. The board will be the
regulator of last resort.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div>
					<a name="0706209000493"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have provided,
however, that they may occasionally move the board from being a
back-row regulator to being a front-line regulator of temporary resort.
That is fine. I can completely understand and subscribe to that idea.
It would be unacceptable for professionals out there in the field to be
unable to do their jobs because no regulator was in place, and the
measure is intended to fill that gap. It is conceivable that a
regulator might regulate badly and must therefore be prevented or
suspended from regulating, and it would then be entirely reasonable for
the Government to step in. So, yes, it is acceptable, reasonable and
inevitable that they should have that power.</div>
					<a name="0706209000494"></a><div class="hs_Para">However&#151;I hope that the
Minister will come with me down my next line of argument&#151;the
logic ofthe amendment is that it is important to keep clear
the distinction between the approved regulators andthe LSB,
which is the regulator of last resort, so that the board should adopt
that intervening regulatory role only when there is no alternative.
When a regulator loses its approval or when a new service becomes
regulated, theoretically&#151;for example, will writing, which we
discussed the other day, might become regulated&#151;it is important
that the board should first consider whether an existing regulator
should dothe job.</div>
					<a name="0706209000495"></a><div class="hs_Para">We discussed this issue in our
debates on the Compensation Bill, and I remember, almost verbatim, the
Minister saying then that it was right to consider whether an existing
regulator should do the job. By and large, we have far too many
regulators in society, and there is far too much regulation, so we do
not want to create more unnecessarily. If we are to have regulation, it
is far better that a body that already exists and has a structure,
support staff, an office and systems in place should take on the job.
That is what the amendmentis
about.</div>
					<a name="0706209000496"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final point
is that the board should intervene only when it has looked around the
field, seen who is there and concluded that nobody else can do it. Only
then should it say, &#147;We are going to look after this for the
time being.&#148; That is right in principle, and I hope that it will
happen either never or extremely rarely. The idea is that another
regulator should always be used. Of course, Ministers will not want a
super-regulator,or obergruppen regulator, to force regulation
on regulators that do not want those responsibilities. It is no good
simply saying, &#147;You will do it.&#148; We also discussed this
issue in our Compensation Bill debates, and I remember that the
Financial Services Authority was thought to be one option, but it was
not keen to do it and said no.</div>
					<a name="0706209000497"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, it would be
inappropriate to make a regulator take on responsibilities if, after
discussion and negotiation, a regulator said, &#147;We&#146;re
really sorry, but we don&#146;t think that this is up our street; we
don&#146;t think that we should do it.&#148; Of course, in theory,
someone would have the power to make it, but that would not be a very
happy arrangement.</div>
					<a name="0706209000498"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
propose that it should be made absolutely clear that the LSB must look
around to see which regulatory bodies in the field could do the job.
Only if there is none should it seek designation from the Lord 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div>Chancellor to do the job. I hope that that is clear,and that
the Minister will be sympathetic to our
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000875"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I rise to support the amendment, which my hon.
Friends and I have signed. The hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey has explained it extremely effectively, and I shall not
addto his comments, except to say that we support
it100 per
cent.</div>
					
					<a name="0706209000500"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000876"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> I assure the hon. Gentlemen that I fully endorse
the objectives behind the amendment, but the Bill already takes account
of those principles; they are already included. We certainly do not
intend that the board should compete with approved
regulators.</div>
					<a name="0706209000501"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
procedures and criteria in clauses 62 and 63 will enable and encourage
the board and the Lord Chancellor to evaluate viable alternatives,
offeredby existing approved regulators, when considering
whether an order under clause 62 is appropriate. The hon. Member for
North Southwark and Bermondsey rightly raised the possibility of a new
reserved activity&#151;will writing is an obvious example of one that
might be considered. Clause 63(2) makes clear the limited circumstances
in which the order can be made: where a body has been de-authorised or
there is a new reserved legal activity. I think that that makes it
clear that the board can regulate directly only to prevent a regulatory
vacuum. He is right to make a comparison with what we did in the
Compensation
Act.</div>
					<a name="0706209000502"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I am
confident that clauses 62 and 63, when taken with all of the other
provisions in the Bill, will ensure that the board&#146;s ability to
act effectively as an approved regulator is constrained sufficiently,
none of which can happen unless an order has been approved by both
Houses. That militates against the board thinking that it can jump in
and regulate new activities willy-nilly; it must look at what is
available already. That makes good economic sense, as well, as the hon.
Gentleman said. We have already a regulator up and running that has all
of the attributes needed to carry out the regulation, so it is
unnecessary to do anything other than that. On that basis, I ask him to
consider withdrawing his
amendment.</div>

think about that and perhaps be persuaded. On that basis, I beg to ask

								Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I might have to revise my tacticsand sign
up to more amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Bassetlaw, who
did not move his amendment No. 282. I shall treat them with more
interest for fear that we get such surprising timidity in proposing yet
more good ideas. The idea in the amendment was a good one, but, if I
remember the rules correctly, the fact that it has gone will not
prevent me from discussing the wider issue to which it referred.
</div>
					<a name="0706209000509"></a><div class="hs_Para">We now move to part 5,
of which clause 71 is the first clause. It is fair to say that part 5
was the most controversial part in the House of Lords. Right up to the
very end, up to the debate on Third Reading, when amendments can be
considered in the Lords, there were amendments concerning the issues
before us. Clause 71 is the first clause of a significant part, which
goes up to clause 111 and deals with the alternative business
structures&#151;a substantially new concept.</div>
					<a name="0706209000510"></a><div class="hs_Para">Every member of the Committee
and many people following our proceedings will know about the
alternative business structures, so I shall not extend the explanation
at length. However, in lay terms, the basic proposition is that, in
addition to the simple and traditional legal organisations, such as
solicitors firms, it will be possible in England and Wales to create
bodies that have the rather mundane title of alternative
business structures. They will either be
multidisciplinary or involve different groups in the legal profession
coming together to offer services.</div>
					<a name="0706209000511"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alternative business structures
were described in a clich(c)d way as the sort of business that
might be promoted by one of our larger high street
supermarkets. It is certainly true that large high street supermarkets
sell not just food and drink, as they originally did. Indeed, they sell
not just food, drink and clothes; not just food, drink, clothes and
children&#146;s toys; not just food, drink, clothes,
children&#146;s toys and electrics&#151;the list could go on. If
one queues for any length of time at a checkout, one will see various
leaflets offering all sorts of other services, such as travel insurance
and holiday insurance.</div>
					<a name="0706209000512"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concerns are that, if part 5
is enacted andit becomes possible to licence ABSs, which is
what clause 71, the introductory clause that permits the</div>
					<a name="0706209000634"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Carrying on of
activities by licensed
bodies&#148;,</div>
					<a name="0706209000513"></a><div class="hs_Para">is about, the new
species of bodies&#151;multidisciplinary bodies&#151;might be
sufficiently well resourced and supplied in capital and financial terms
to go into the traditional legal providers&#146; market and, because
of the macro-economic cost-benefits, offer their services at a lower
price, thus undercutting existing services, not just competing on price
but causing difficulties, and forcing some of them out of business. It
is a bit like the debate about the supermarket and the corner
shop.</div>
					
					<a name="0706209000514"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0706209000879"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Adrian Bailey</b> (West Bromwich, West) (Lab/Co-op): Does the
hon. Gentleman not agree that, in a competitive market environment,
organisations that can compete on price often expand the market for
their product? At the end of the day, if we are putting consumers at
the heart of the Bill, will not the provision be a logical extension of
that principle?</div>
					
					<a name="0706209000515"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000880"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I have not yet expressed a judgment about the
issue. I have so far expressed the argument, which is why the issue is
controversial, why it was controversial in the House of Lords and why
there is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 266</div>great deal of interest in it. The answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question, which is also the next logical issue to deal with, is that
the arguments are pro-competition, an idea to which I am
sympathetic.</div>
					<a name="0706209000516"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question is whether we allow entirely deregulated competition, which
the Bill does not propose, or a form of regulated competition. With the
Competition Commission and the Office of Fair Trading, we have a
balanced position. Competition is permitted, but there is control, so
that people do not acquire too much market share and exercise undue
influence.</div>
					<a name="0706209000517"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issues
that arise are how we go from the present position to that which the
Bill would allow without threatening the destruction of the sort of
services that many hon. Members on both sides of the House regularly
complain about in a different context. Downstairs and in Committee,
hon. Members bemoan the fact that there are not nearly as many sub-post
offices or post offices as there were. In a competitive world, other
people are coming in and providing alternatives, such as firms from the
Netherlandsand elsewhere providing business deliveries, and
organisations such as banks dealing with
pensions.</div>
				
					
					<a name="0706209000654"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.30
pm</div>
					<a name="0706209000518"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
competition, but that has not stopped people saying that there is a
significant reduction in service for local communities, and it has
resulted in many communities losing services. Post offices have gone
and an alternative service that people might have liked has not
replaced it. That is the debate. In this context, the debate is about
how to manage transition, if that is the right way to go, so that good,
high-quality outlets&#151;in this case for legal services&#151;are
not destroyed in a way that allows a predator in the market not just to
be competitive, but to be competitive in a way that destroys
alternative valued local providers. That is the issue. The hon. Member
for Bassetlaw&#146;s amendment No. 22 addressed how we get from here
to there, and that is a proper issue to
address.</div>
					
					<a name="0706209000519"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000881"></a>Mr.
Bailey:
						</b> With the greatest respect, I do not feel that the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s comparison is valid in terms of the perception
that elderly and deprived peopleare queuing outside their
lawyers as a result of competition. To suggest that those facilities
are being removed is far from the truth. The irony is that although
competition is causing difficulties for post offices, for law firms and
solicitors it provides the opportunity to open up new
markets.</div>
					
					<a name="0706209000520"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000882"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is entitled to take an
absolutist view and may be entirely supportive of the
Government&#146;s proposals, but that was not the view of the
pre-legislative scrutiny Committee, which was concerned about the move
from A to B, as he knows. It is not the view of many other people, not
all of them lawyers, as he also
knows.</div>
					<a name="0706209000521"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
the situation for post offices and lawyers may not be parallel, but in
small towns there may be only one legal firm of general competence that
has been there for a long time, or a couple of firms that have a good
reputation and are well regarded by the community. Of course there will
not be queues as there 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 267</div>are outside post offices, but there will be a regular procession of
clients, who are local people and often without much money, going to
see their lawyer if there is a dispute with a neighbour, or a
commercial dispute concerning conveyancing, wills, contracts,
complaints about holidays that went wrong, and so on. The question is:
what is the risk to those
firms?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000883"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I do not want to prolong our proceedings, but does
the hon. Gentleman accept that his concern is reinforced by the
Government&#146;s proposals elsewhere to restructure legal aid
contracts, which will have the effect of creating monopoly contracts in
some areas? If the Government choose to create monopoly suppliers in
geographic or sector-specific areas, it is all the more important to
provide some
protection.</div>
					
					<a name="0706209000523"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000884"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. I allowed the hon. Gentleman to make his
point, but I trust that the debate will not expand into legal
aid.</div>
					
					<a name="0706209000524"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000885"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I shall try not to be led far down that road, Sir
Nicholas.</div>
					<a name="0706209000525"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
competition issue, which is central toclause 71&#151;I was
rebuked for not having an exact parallel when I talked about post
offices&#151;has a better comparison, as the hon. Member for Bromley
and Chislehurst reminded us, in the context of legal aid. I will leave
it at that, but there are parallels and there is an interlinking
between the two.</div>
					<a name="0706209000526"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we
go through the following clauses and look at the licensed bodies that
will be defined in clause 72, and when we consider the
Minister&#146;s amendments&#151;her largest batch so far&#151;I
hope that all members of the Committee, no matter what their starting
point is, will remember the wisdom of the pre-legislative scrutiny
Committee&#146;s advice. We say that we like that part of the process
and that it is important. In that case, we should listen to what it
recommends. It was very cautious about going helter-skelter down this
road. It was not happy with the speed and the pace which the Government
propose.</div>
					<a name="0706209000527"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be
other amendments such as the one originally tabled in this context for
a graduated, gentle, considered, cautious, delayed implementation. I
hope that the Committee will be sympathetic to them. Obviously, in
Committee one cannot and should not seek to take out a whole part of a
Bill. We deal with it clause by clause. I will not seek to remove one
of the clauses in the next group of 40, or 10 of the clauses as we come
to each of them. That would be an unjustified use of the processes open
to me. If the Government are to have their way, it is far better to ask
whether the clauses are the right ones and are well written. However, I
reserve the right, as do my colleagues, to say either that this part of
the Bill is inappropriate, or that it is inappropriate if it is amended
as the Government wish and is put back into the position it was in
before the amendments were passed by the
Lords.</div>
					
					<a name="0706209000529"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0706209000886"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): It would be fair to
say that in the other place the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives
supported each other on most aspects of the Bill. It was perhaps on
part 5 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div>where we to some extent parted company. Having heard the hon. Gentleman
just say what he said, I think that it is likely to be the case here.
As he said, part 5 is about alternative business structures. Our
debates over the following clauses will be slightly complicated by the
fact that many of the concepts at the lower end of the risk
scale&#151;LDPs and Legal Practice Plus&#151;have already been
reviewed at clause 18. Therefore, it will be quite difficult not to
repeat arguments, but I will try my absolute
best.</div>
					<a name="0706209000530"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem is
that it is easy in many ways to lump all ABS structures together. Our
position is that both LDPs and Legal Practice Plus&#151;that is,
partnerships with non-client-facing professions&#151;should not be
treated as ABSs. There is then the question of the timing of expanding
the concept to include non-legal support professionals who act for
clients. That would leave the ABS rules finally to cater for
involvement by non-professionals in the provision of legal services.
That is clearly where the greatest risk lies and where caution and
therefore delay is most required and
justified.</div>
					<a name="0706209000531"></a><div class="hs_Para">We shall
come on to the safeguards, which we shall be defending against the
Government amendments. I suspect that we shall tread together with the
Liberal Democrats on that one. However, by building in delay for the
simplest low-risk structures between well-regulated professionals, we
are missing a unique opportunity to realise early benefits for
consumers and business in certain markets. One example is the market
for advice to small business.</div>
					<a name="0706209000532"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2006, the Institute of
Chartered Accountants found that 58 per cent. of small businesses went
separately to both lawyers and accountants for general business advice.
It is important to appreciate that we are not just talking about very
large law and accountancy firms. We are talking about smaller firms as
well. There will certainly be smaller firms that could benefit, such as
the high street solicitor that is struggling now, but that could become
more efficient, customer-friendly and stable, by joining up with a
small accounting
practice.</div>
					<a name="0706209000533"></a><div class="hs_Para">Allowing such
professionals to come together more easily could cut costs, increase
choice and competition and reduce the time needed to forge
relationships with different advisers. To the extent that it offers new
business opportunities for small or rural legal practices, it will
support rather than undermine access to justice. Another example in the
individual consumer market is allowing chartered surveyor and legal
practices to come together to reduce delays and transaction costs. I
have said all that I want to say at this stage, but I hope that the
tone that I have set reflects where my party is coming from on this
part.</div>
					
					<a name="0706209000534"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000887"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> I promise my hon. Friends that I shall not speak
for very long on this part. The alternative business structure is an
important part of the Bill. It offers innovation, creativity and
greater choice for the consumer. I hope that the Committee will welcome
it. It is the part that the consumer panel in my Department and
consumer organisations are keen to see implemented, although that will
not happen until 2010-11. We had a bit of a debate earlier about
possible opportunities between now and then for other professionals to
work with lawyers, and I am looking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 269</div>into whether there is any scope for that to happen without undermining
part 5 of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="0706209000535"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand what the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey says
about ensuring that people do not cherry-pick activities. That will be
part of the board&#146;s remit when it decides who will be licensed
under this part of the Bill. There will be opportunities throughout the
debate on this section for us to consider some of the issues in more
detail. Suffice it to say that clause 71 provides for the licensing of
bodies as alternative business structures.</div>
					<a name="0706209000536"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the debate will
cover some of the details and reassure hon. Members who are concerned
about whether certain organisations will come in and distort the
market. We certainly do not want the market to be distorted; that will
not allow for the sort of consumer choice that is at the heart of this
part of the Bill.</div>

Prentice:
						</b> I agree with you absolutely,Sir
Nicholas. I shall be happy to stay here all night if necessary. Only a
few of us remember the times when we sat through the night in
Committee. Those were the days, and good fun was had by all.</div>
					<a name="0706209000543"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a fearsome list of
amendments, but they are relatively straightforward. They refine the
ownership provisions in part 5 and schedules 16 and 17 to provide more
clarity on how firms and companies with complex ownership structures
will fit into the ABS or recognised body regimes, as well as on whether
non-lawyer owners and managers will be subject to the fitness-to-own
tests. They also contain a number of related and consequential changes
to other provisions. They do not depart from existing policy on
non-lawyer ownership, but they do provide essential refinements to
ensure clarity in complex corporate
structures.</div>
				
					
					<a name="0706209000655"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.45
pm</div>
					<a name="0706209000544"></a><div class="hs_Para">The group
contains amendments to the non-lawyer ownership and related provisions
in part 5; to the ownership provisions in schedule 13, which contains
the fitness-to-own test, and to the ownership and related regulatory
provisions for recognised bodies in schedules 16 and 17 to ensure that
there is no overlap with part 5.</div>
					<a name="0706209000545"></a><div class="hs_Para">The principal change to which
the other amendments relate is the revised clause 72 proposed by
amendment No. 111. The clause provides that a body will be a licensable
body if it has any managers who are non-authorised persons, but it will
now contain a refined ownership test that clarifies how the test will
apply to complex corporate structures. Proposed subsections (1)(b) and
(2A) provide that a body will be licensable if any non-authorised
person holds shares in it or is entitled to control voting rights in
it. As before, the concept of shares is wide enough to cover
notonly companies but limited liability partnerships,
partnerships and other unincorporated bodies. Proposed subsection (2)
provides that a body shall be licensable if one of its managers,
shareholders or persons with voting rights is itself a body and one or
more non-authorised persons hold 10 per cent. or more of the shares or
voting rights in that second-tier
body.</div>
					<a name="0706209000546"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
formulation provides greater clarity and consumer protection than the
existing clause 72 in relation to the many and varied types of
structure that may be used to deliver legal services. In particular, it
will ensure that loopholes do not arise because of complex structures,
for example in bodies with multiple corporate tiers. A number of
related and consequential amendments, including those to schedules 11
and 12, are necessary to reflect that change. That includes provisions
that refer to or impose obligations on non-lawyer owners, such as the
low-risk body provisions in clauses 106 and 108, and to the provisions
in clause 90 setting out the duties of non-authorised persons. In
addition, the definition of a &#147;non-authorised person&#148; in
clause 111 is amended to ensure that the treatment of foreign lawyers
and international 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 271</div>legal services firms, particularly those with complex
corporate structures, is consistent with the
amendments to clause
72.</div>
					<a name="0706209000547"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a number
of related amendments to schedule 13, which deals specifically with the
regulation of non-lawyer owners. Many of them reflect our changes to
the concept of interest in a body and the distinction between voting
rights and the wider concept of voting power, which is defined in
paragraph 5 of the
schedule.</div>
					<a name="0706209000548"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
main area of change is amendments to the terms of the ownership test
for recognised bodies regulated by the Law Society and the Council for
Licensed Conveyancers, as well as related regulatory provisions. The
amendments to the definitions of terms such as &#147;licensable
body&#148; and &#147;shares&#148; reflect the changes to clause
72. They maintain our policy that the categories of licensable bodies
in part 5 and bodies that may be recognised by the Law Society and the
CLC are mutually
exclusive.</div>
					<a name="0706209000549"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments will create greater certainty and identify the boundaries
between regulatory regimes for ABS firms and other authorised bodies.
They will also provide greater clarity in setting out how and when the
different provisions in the Bill regulating owners will apply to
specific individuals and firms. On that basis, I recommend them to the
Committee.</div>

						</b> Clause 72 tells us what is a licensable body.
The Government&#146;s amendments to it are technical in nature and
are intended to ensure that the controls on the fitness to own are
fully effective, particularly in relation to what constitutes an
interest in a body. That is acceptable to
us.</div>

							<a name="0706209000893"></a>Simon

						</b> There seems to be a move in the right direction,
but I have two general questions and one specific one.</div>
					<a name="0706209000554"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, what prompted the tabling
of the amendments at this stage? Was it debates in the Lords,
particular representations, or an awareness that there was a technical
defect in the drafting in respect of interest? I can see that an
attempt is being made to be more precise.</div>
					<a name="0706209000555"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, what was the
justification or reason for the decision that a 10 per cent. rule
should effectively determine whether there is a relevant interest? Is
that based on what is accepted as common precedent, either in European
Union countries or elsewhere?</div>
					<a name="0706209000556"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, amendment No. 191,
which stands alone even though it is in the group, appears to broaden
the remit of the Bill by expanding the definition of the phrase
&#147;relevant legal services&#148; so that where it
reads</div>
					<a name="0706209000636"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where authorised
persons, other than solicitors or registered European lawyers, are
managers of,&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706209000557"></a><div class="hs_Para">the words
&#147;or employees of&#148; are added. What is the logic and the
reasoning behind that expansion? It is welcome&#151;I am not being
critical, as it seems to me to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div>be a logical move in right direction, but I wondered what triggered the
change at this stage. There is clearly a difference between considering
a firm because the managers do certain jobs and considering all the
employees down to whatever level.</div>
					
					<a name="0706209000558"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000894"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> On the question about beneficial interest, no,
that is not included unless voting rights are attached. Amendment No.
191 was reflected in some of the things that I said earlier in the day,
but it is intended to ensure that employees who are authorised persons
are in the same position as managers who are authorised persons so that
there is a consistency across the piece. Horribly, I have forgotten the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s other question.</div>
					
					<a name="0706209000559"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000895"></a>Simon
Hughes:

						<b class="B"> </b>Why was a limit of 10 per cent. set? Is it
because that is what is done generally across Europe? What was the main
reason for spotting that we needed to insert this raft of redefinitions
relating to interests and checks at this
stage?</div>
					
					<a name="0706209000560"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000896"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> The main reason was that we had further
discussions with the Law Society, the DTI and counsel. As a result of
those discussions, we felt that it was important to make the
amendments.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000897"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> To return to the question of beneficial holding,
is the Minister saying that if an owner does not appear on the share
register as a beneficial owner and has not had voting rights
transferred to themas part of the beneficial ownership, anyone
could effectively own an
ABS?</div>
					
					<a name="0706209000562"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000898"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> I am not saying that anyone could effectively
own an ABS, because a raft of other issues are included in the
fitness-to-own test. However, the hon. Gentleman is ahead of me on the
issue of a beneficial owner who is not on the list, so to speak. I
shall have to consider that in more detail and get back to him, in
order to ensure that I can reassure him on that.</div>
					<a name="0706209000563"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 10 per cent. figure was
decided on because that was what the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 used. We used it to be consistent.</div>
					<a name="0706209000564"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, it is important that
recognised bodies are not restricted to legal services that only the
partners of the firm provide but can cover the services provided by the
employees, who carry out much of the firm&#146;s services to clients.
That is why employees and managers all had to be defined in a similar
fashion.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000900"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> New clause 16 has been tabled on a probing basis
by my hon. Friends and me, with information provided by the Chartered
Institute of Patent Agents and the Institute of Trade Mark Attorneys. I
should make it clear that both institutes agree with proposals in the
Bill to remove restrictions from the type of business structures that
can provide legal services. Their experience has demonstrated that
external ownership in existing mixed-practice firms has neither been
problematic nor posed a threat to consumers in relation to conflicts of
interest or anything else. The new clause mirrors one that was tabled
by Lord Kingsland in the other place when he pointed out
that</div>
					<a name="0706209000637"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It arises
specifically out of the unusual position in which the patent and trade
mark agents find themselves in comparison with other approved
regulators. Patent and trade mark attorneys have never been restricted
as to their ownership. As I understand it, a number of firms&#151;at
least one major firm and several smaller ones&#151;have external
owners, and have done so for a long time. I should emphasise that this
situation is perfectly
legal.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706209000571"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is true. The
two institutes informed me that the ownership of patent and trade mark
agents has never been restricted. A number of firms have external
owners and have done so perfectly legally without any known consumer or
conflict risk.</div>
					<a name="0706209000572"></a><div class="hs_Para">Patent
and trade mark attorneys are directors of one firm that is listed on
the alternative investment market, Murgitroyd &amp; Company. There are
attorneys of both types in either single or multidisciplinary
practices, including partnerships, limited liability partnerships and
limited companies. In other words, in private practice several bodies
already fall within the definition of an alternative business
structure. That fact was not recognised during the debate on 23
January, whenthe other place discussed a gradual approach to
introducing ABSs or the possibility of piloting them. Therefore, as
Lord Kingsland said, we believe that</div>
					<a name="0706209000638"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there has never been any
suggestion of a risk to a consumer, nor indeed any risk of conflict of
interest. To us it seems inequitable to regulate a business practice
that has so far been perfectly legal and where no risks have been
identified.&#148; &#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 6
February 2007; Vol. 689, c.
621.]</div>
					<a name="0706209000573"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, many
providers&#151;patent attorneys, trade mark attorneys, solicitors,
barristers and probably legal executives and licensed
conveyancers&#151;are employed in-house. Their employing
companies&#151;each usually a subsidiary within a group of
companies&#151;might also fall within the definition of an ABS if the
in-house practitioner in question continues to provide services to a
member of the public, which might be the case if a subsidiary company
is hived off but continues to use the patent or trade mark services of
its old parent company. In that scenario, the parent company would need
to be licensed under the proposed scheme. That type of working practice
is well known to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 274</div>Chartered Institute of Patent Agents, as are circumstances in which the
subsidiary is not only owned by the employing company. That
demonstrates another form of regulation to be borne by some UK
industries.</div>
					<a name="0706209000574"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposal in the Bill will require mixed practices with external
ownership to seek authorisation as ABSs and to undertake a
fitness-to-own test within a transitional period. That would cause
considerable cost and disruption, not only to existing firms, who would
be forced to restructure, but to the two institutesthat would
be obliged to be the licensing authorityfor ABSs. For that
reason we have tabled the new clause, which proposes an exemption from
licensing requirements.</div>
					<a name="0706209000575"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite an assertion from the
Lord Chancellor in his speech to the Law Society on 13 October 2006
that ABS proposals are not intended to put pressure on lawyers to
change their working arrangements, the institutes are concerned about
the effect that the requirement to be licensed will have on their
members. They do not feel that the perceived risk that ABSs pose to
consumers relates to the type of business service that intellectual
property mixed practices provide. They have argued for an exemption of
existing practices for any corporate structure, but have also discussed
with the Bill team a compromise under which subsequent voluntary
structural changes might trigger ABS status. That would put the
institutes&#146; member firms in the same position as new entrants to
the ABS market and give them a similar degree of
choice.</div>

							<a name="0706209000902"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> It is my great pleasure to do so, Sir Nicholas,
even at this late
hour.</div>
					<a name="0706209000580"></a><div class="hs_Para">The level of
regulation required under licensing and authorisation proposals for
ABSs is substantially greater than for other bodies. As the licensing
authority for ABSs, the institutes would have to bear
considerable costs to provide that level of regulation. That in turn
would mean sizeable fees for ABSs, over and above current regulatory
fees. The feedback that has been received from the institutes&#146;
members in response to the proposals in the Bill suggests that the idea
of setting up as an ABS may not be as attractive as envisaged to those
in private practice, with the licensing system being seen as such an
unwanted burden that some firms are considering restructuring to avoid
the need for a
licence.</div>
					<a name="0706209000581"></a><div class="hs_Para">In-house
practitioners are worried about the ABS requirements being loaded upon
them. It may be that so few private practices of patent and trade mark
attorneys wish to becomes ABSs under the new system that it will be
unsustainable for the institutes to apply to be licensing bodies. The
proposals for ABSs could then have the opposite effect to that
intended, acting as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 275</div>a disincentive to practices wishing to continue to provide a mixed
practice, rather than effectively removing restrictions, in order to
allow more flexible business models in the legal services
market.</div>
					
					<a name="0706209000582"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000903"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> Since the Clementi review, we have demonstrated,
I hope, our commitment to ensuring that the new opportunities for
external control and investment are balanced by robust safeguards. It
is important that ABS firms are protected by the very same statutory
safeguards. It is clear throughout the Bill that significant non-lawyer
owners must be approved by regulators as fit and proper persons.
Providing exemptions to that would create a risk of inconsistency in
both standards and the protection of the
consumer.</div>
					<a name="0706209000583"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
competition in the legal services market could be distorted by giving
some existing trade mark and patent practices a competitive advantage
over new practices offering services in the same area. If we allowed
those exemptions, as the hon. Gentleman has suggested, we would create
even more complexitiesin the framework, albeit without very
many real additional benefits for either firms or consumers.</div>
					<a name="0706209000584"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is sufficient flexibility
in the Bill to allow for proportionate regulation, without creating
specific exemptions for any category of legal services. I am absolutely
confident that the current provisions in the Bill would allow existing
trade mark and patent attorney practices, such as those that do not
have external ownership, to continue without necessarily requiring an
ABS licence. We have provided that firms with small numbers of
non-lawyer managers may qualify for flexible regulation as low-risk
bodies under clause 108. That means that they may qualify for licensing
rules that are not subject to this part ofthe Bill.</div>
					<a name="0706209000585"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the hon. Gentleman
will withdraw the amendment. I understand why he has tabled it, but the
Bill is sufficiently flexible to allow trade mark and patent practices
to work successfully under the new
arrangements.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000904"></a>The

						</b> Order. The Minister was slightly inaccurate in
asking the hon. Gentleman who leads for the Opposition to withdraw his
amendment, because we are not discussing an amendment. We are debating
clause stand part, with which we are discussing new clause 16, which
will be voted upon formally, as and when we reach

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706209000905"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas, I take your
point.</div>
					<a name="0706209000588"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having heard
the Minister, I wish to make three general points. The first point is
that, as the Minister knows full well, there are different sizes of
regulators. Bodies like the trade mark and patent institutes are much
smaller than some of the other regulators, and they have specific
issues, which have come up now and again during our debates on this
Bill. The Minister has acknowledged those issues, but does not seem to
have done much about
them.</div>
					<a name="0706209000589"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second point
is that those institutes are not closed professions. That means that
people who practise in patents or trade marks do not have to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div>regulated. The implications of getting the provisions of the Bill wrong
will mean that more people who practise in patents and trade marks will
not move towards regulation. The institutes may fold and the Government
may therefore have an opposite effect to what they would want. The
Minister just said that regulation should apply to everyone; I am
afraid that it simply does not apply in the context of professions that
are not closed professions.</div>
					<a name="0706209000590"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, if representatives of
those institutes were here, they would stand up and say,
&#147;Minister, you have been warned&#148;. I just hope that the
approach that the Minister has taken is right. Serious concerns have
been raised that what she has said is, in fact, not right. I suppose it
will be a case of sucking it and seeing. None the less, we have our
concerns.</div>

Hughes:
						</b> This is the first of two clauses about appeals in
the context of alternative business structures. It allows for the Lord
Chancellor to establish by order bodies to hear and determine appeals
from decisions, which is perfectly proper, reasonable procedure. I
would be grateful if the Minister could tell the Committee what sort of
bodies the Government envisage would be set up under the procedure. I
appreciate that we will return to that point in secondary
legislation.</div>
					<a name="0706209000600"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to modifying existing bodies, I recognise that clause 80(2)
flags up two such bodies, namely the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal
and the Discipline and Appeals Committee established by the Council for
Licensed Conveyancers. Will the Minister say what is intended by way of
secondary legislation if we pass the clause? Will we have one appeals
body or several? Will they involve lay people? Some colour and
information would be helpful.</div>

Prentice:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right; the bodies
concerned are the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal and the Discipline
and Appeals Committee of the CLC. The Law Society cannot of its own
accord simply create an appeals body, nor can it modify on its own the
powers of another statutory body such as the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div>
						Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal. That is why the
provision is in the Bill. If I may, I shall write to the Committee with
more detail on the structure of the appeals bodies, because further
discussions on what the structure will be are
ongoing.</div>

						</b> I am grateful; that is very helpful.It
might be particularly helpful if the Minister lets colleagues have her
written comments on the matter in good time before we reach Report, for
reasons that she will
understand.</div>
