<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the next amendment, I wish to point out that a slight adjustment has been made to the selection list. On schedule 2, it is now proposed that amendment No. 225 and the associated group of amendments will come before amendment No. 112. On yesterday's list it was the other way round. This is merely a procedural matter, but perhaps members of the Committee will take note of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. You will almost certainly have seen the announcement by the Secretary of State that problems have arisen with the new computer in relation to calculating the CSA's new formula and computers' ability to communicate with each other. The system is unlikely to be working before April 2001. Given that we have received many assurances about computers in the Committee, can you tell us whether the Minister of State thinks that this is likely to affect implementation of the Committee's decisions?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for the Chair. I am sure that the Minister of State has noted the hon. Gentleman's remarks. I have not had notice of a statement.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle):</B> To help the Committee, I am happy to explain the details for the hon. Gentleman before we begin. We do not have problems. It is simply that, as we negotiate with Affinity, which is the suppliers, we wish to avoid a repeat of what happened when the Child Support Act 1991 came into effect. The previous Government had a start date for child support reforms and wanted a bespoke computer system to be created by its technology agency. The company attempted to achieve that, but half way through the process it discovered that it would not work. The Conservative Government chose not to put back the start date to cope with the unexpected hitch, but instead bought an off-the-shelf computer from Florida, which cannot even identify national insurance numbers. It cannot do many other things either, but we shall deal with that later. They had bought a pig in a poke, which made it difficult for them to pursue their aim of producing CSA reforms in a reasonable manner.
<P>
We were determined not to fall into that trap. When first we said that the end of 2001 would be the date by which the computer would be available, we believed it. We still believe that it will be available by that time, but we have been advised by our suppliers, Affinity, that we need a test period to ensure that the computer holds up and works before we begin loading new numbers into it, and we have agreed. Our announcement was made to make it clear exactly when new cases would be put on to the system—which will be April 2002. However, we still expect a computer to be available for our use for testing and commissioning by the end of 2001.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I thank the Minister of State for that explanation.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Applications by persons claiming</center></H4>
or receiving benefit
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 120, in page 3, line 13, leave out `or any other benefit of a prescribed kind'.
<P>
It is not my intention to delay the Committee for too long on clause 3. Most of our amendments are of a technical nature. We find it a little strange that the clause refers to ``any other benefit''. The Bill mentions an income-based jobseeker's allowance and ``any other benefit'' prescribed. It is that phrase that we find peculiar, especially as we now know that there are problems with the computer. Although we are grateful for the Minister's explanation, it seems that Affinity and the technology company EDS have found the work much more complicated than they anticipated. The phrase ``any other benefit'' is therefore likely to exacerbate the complexity of the programme being put into the computer.
<P>
We did not know about the Government's problems with the computer when we tabled the amendment, but we question the necessity for the phrase ``any other benefit''. If the Government wanted to introduce another income-related benefit, surely the more sensible thing would be to include it in a Bill for that purpose, and amend the current Bill through that new Bill. It may be thought that I am nit-picking, but a seasoned observer of parliamentary procedures would not think so. If Parliament is to remain in control of legislation, it should be able to determine what income-related benefit should be included in an Act and not allow the Secretary of State carte blanche to introduce a new benefit through the statutory instrument procedure.
<P>
I fail to see the advantage of the proposed new section 6(1). The Minister may have good reasons. My amendment will give him an opportunity to explain them. Now that we know about the computer problem, not only do we need a technical response explaining why the phrase should be included, we want further particulars because I am concerned that the information technology software and probably the hardware supplier, EDS, is saying something different from what the Minister said. I am sure that the Minister will wish to qualify that. It is not a question of bedding in or testing the new system; it is a more complicated problem than anticipated. One complication would be putting any other benefit into the computer system. We are looking for a response on two levels. We want to hear why this all-encompassing power is necessary and why suppliers say something quite different from the Minister.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> We have had some good-natured debates. But if the hon. Gentleman for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) continues to repeat the mantra ``problems with the computer'' my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will become extremely irritated because it is not true. We do not know where his quote comes from. Hansard has the answer from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, who announced the start-up date of new cases by April 2002. To the best of my knowledge—I am not an expert—no precise date has been given, but it has been assumed that it will be around the end of 2001. However, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said, we do not want to repeat the mistakes of the past. The fact is that we do not have a computer at present. That is the whole point. We have now done sufficient work with our suppliers to give a date by which we will be confident that we can put the new cases on the system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I would be grief stricken if I had given the hon. Lady a moment's pain. I am quoting from a newspaper. It is from The Daily Telegraph, so it must be true, as that is our nation's periodical of record. I am not quoting from the hon. Lady or from the Secretary of State but from the suppliers, Affinity, which is led by the information technology company EDS. The company said that the work has been ``more complicated than anticipated''. I shall go on because I may be giving the hon. Gentleman some news. The article says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This is because the computer will have to be able to `talk to' other machines at the Benefits Agency and the Inland Revenue to cross-check data.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is serious. I hope that now the Minister of State has cognizance of all the facts, he will not think that I have raised this matter just to annoy the Under-Secretary. I have done so to get to the truth. The hon. Gentleman should address this problem. Has he been fully briefed by his suppliers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The idea that it is an innovation for a new computer system to talk to other systems is worrying. That is one of our problems. In the past, that was never considered. The possibility of data matching and data sharing as a means of cutting down on fraud is very important. However, the computers need to be able to talk to each other. It is nonsense to suggest that suppliers went into the game thinking that we did not want them to talk to each other. The hon. Member kept referring to a problem. There is no problem because we have no computer at present. We have given a date, which has been recorded in Hansard. Heads are on the block from the top down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Not the right hon. Gentleman's.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> We have collective responsibility.
<P>
I want to refer briefly to the amendments and respond to the points that the hon. Member has made. Throughout this Bill, cross-references have been made to other legislation and from time to time we have found duplicate powers that have had to be taken out. The hon. Member may have a point: that provision could be in a future Bill if there were a future benefit. We think, on balance, given that we have this primary legislative vehicle, that it would be better to do so now. Clause 3 improves the process by which parents with care can claim or receive income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance or be treated as applying for child support. It will ensure that parents with care on those benefits receive a seamless maintenance service when they claim benefit.
<P>
Under the new scheme, parents with care who make a claim for income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance will be treated as applying for child support unless they specifically request that child support should not be pursued. As with the current scheme, there is power to prescribe benefits other than income support and income-based jobseeker's allowance. In the past, disability working allowance has been included as a benefit. Amendment No. 120 would mean that we would no longer have the power to prescribe any benefits, other than the two to which I have referred. We do not intend at the moment to include any other benefits. I will repeat that. We do not intend at the moment to include other benefits. We think it important, however, that the power to do so remains in case other benefits replace or supplement income support for which parents with care may be eligible in future. It is only right in those circumstances that all parents with care should be treated in the same way.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): On a point of clarification, can I assume that working families tax credit is also treated in the same way?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> There is a 100 per cent. disregard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> My hon. Friend says that there is 100 per cent. disregard in respect of child support. It is not listed in the Bill and I have just said that we have no plans at the moment to include any other benefits. We are merely providing for that power, so that nothing in the future breaks the seamless service of child support for parents with care.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Minister said something earlier about using this opportunity of primary legislation. He also said that there is no intention to bring in a new income-based benefit. What advantages are there? How can the service be seamless? Surely he is not suggesting that an income benefit could be introduced by secondary legislation.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I do not need to take advice on that. The advantage is one of administrative convenience for the Government of the day. That is the bottom line. In the past, other benefits have been included, such as disability working allowance. We have no plans to include any other benefit, but we cannot forecast the future. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar is right in that it would currently be inconceivable for a new benefit to be brought in under secondary legislation, but I cannot say that that will always be so.
<P>
It is convenient to provide for that power in case certain circumstances arise, so that the benefits to the parent with care can be maintained in a seamless service. That is important in the event of other benefits replacing income support. There may not be a new benefit, but an existing benefit may be refined. We do not plan that, but if it happened, it may be achieved in secondary legislation. If we agreed to amendment No. 120, it would not be possible to give the new benefit any designation other than income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance. It would require future Governments to stick to the exact title of an existing benefit. Even if the title were different, the benefit would remain the same, as primary legislation would be required for any changes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson </B>(Tewkesbury): Does the Minister envisage that any new benefit would be income based? The words of the clause do not suggest that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No. I have given an example. If the terminology of existing benefits were changed, that would cause a problem if the words specified in amendment No. 120 were removed from the Bill. Primary legislation would be required. I do not know, but I suspect that to change the titles of some benefits may not require primary legislation. I have specific instructions to say that we have no plans to designate another benefit, and I have seen no papers to say otherwise. The provision is there for convenience so as to avoid possible difficulties with primary legislation in future.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I hope that the Minister does not feel that we are persecuting him, but we are trying to get to the root of the problem. I suspect that I know the answer to the question that I shall ask. The Bill also introduces the state second pension. I would not expect a pension to be regarded as a benefit. As I am not a lawyer, will he confirm that the second state pension—many pensioners may have to pay child support—would not be regarded as a benefit in those terms?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No. No pension is regarded as a benefit. The basic retirement pension is not. The state second pension will be national insurance-based and contribution-based.
<P>
We do not plan a new benefit. One could be introduced under primary legislation, but its impact could come through secondary legislation. Please do not ask me to explain fully the hypothetical possibilities, as I could not do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That deserves a response. I am impressed that heads are on the block over the new computer system, but it has not yet been delivered. We have all experienced the excitement of unwrapping a box, only to wonder which bits go where, so it is somehow encouraging that people involved in information technology also experience that problem, although on a grander scale.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Can we deal with the amendment? We have dealt with the computer issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am sorry, Mr. O'Brien. I did not want to go out of order; I just wanted to say that the Government have satisfied me on that point. However, we shall come back to it in due course.
<P>
The Minister thought that I had a point, which was quite flattering. For one moment, I thought that he was about to accept my amendment.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Steady on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I know—I was going to sit down so that my leader and the Opposition Chief Whip could witness the event. It would have been an exciting moment.
<P>
However, the Minister's response was not entirely satisfactory. He said several things that disturbed me. First, he said that operators might be straitjacketed by a change of name. That would of course be terrible; we would not want that at all. We have experience of the Government calling a benefit by a new name. The Minister probably knows the new Labour spin doctors well, and can envisage the jobseeker's allowance, for example, emerging supposedly as something different, but actually as the same. It would be quite possible to amend primary legislation. The Minister also said that the Government may introduce a new benefit under secondary legislation, which I regard as extremely worrying. We live in a world in which secondary legislation is in many ways more important than primary legislation. If we are to ensure that provisions affecting our citizens are considered by Parliament and not introduced for administrative convenience, as the Minister suggested, the measure should be resisted.
<P>
At the start of our proceedings—this morning I got distracted by the issue of the computers and the news—I thought that the Minister would be able to satisfy me. In fact, he has made what I thought was a fairly harmless legislation seem rather sinister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It is my fault for thinking aloud and departing from the brief. I have nothing written down about changes in names. I am trying to think of examples, but the best explanation I can give the hon. Gentleman of why the power to prescribe other benefits is in the Bill is that it was included in the existing legislation by the previous Government. I plead guilty and admit that our reasons for wanting that flexibility are the same as those of our predecessors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am beginning to feel that I am part of an honourable tradition. I get the impression that if the Minister were standing in my place, he would be saying what I am saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): It may be helpful to the hon. Gentleman if I give a precise example, from a slightly different context to do with social security legislation. When the previous Government introduced statutory sick pay many years ago, which replaced various elements of sickness benefit, there were many loose ends that were not covered in the primary legislation. In fact, in my previous profession I took a case to the High Court on the interpretation of one aspect of statutory sick pay as it related to the calculation of compensation in accident cases. When primary legislation is introduced it is easy occasionally to miss the odd loose end. The provision would cover such a problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman felt that his contribution was helpful, but I am not certain that it was. I do not think that the provision is a loose end—it is a catch-all. It is more than a belt and braces exercise. It is saying, ``Let us give unto ourselves a power that we may or may not need. We do not know whether we will want or need it, but gee, heck, it would just be nice to have that extra power.''
<P>
It seems incredible that we have been talking about the amendment for nearly half an hour, and I should like to move with a bit more pace. However, because the amendment is important, I should like to press it to a Division.

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 121, in page 3, line 19, leave out `may' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall'.<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, within 14 days of the parent receiving from the Secretary of State the notification required by subsection (4),'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 138, in page 3, line 37, leave out from `(7)' to end of line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The amendments start from the basic premise that we support the Government's proposals, which the Committee might not have realised given the previous debate. The clause sensibly changes existing child support legislation. The amendments are designed to probe a rather murky aspect of the child support system.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 121 and 125 would extend the Government's proposals. They would reduce the parent's ability to deny information to the Secretary of State, and they would reduce the Secretary of State's discretion to take action. At first sight, that might seem strange or perverse. However, the relationship between the parent with care and the parent without care, especially in the case of a vulnerable woman and an overbearing and aggressive man, may involve threats against the mother and, possibly, the child. The family may have a history of violence. Of all the child support cases that hon. Members have experienced—I doubt whether many hon. Members have no experience—those are the most worrying and difficult. That is especially true when the relationship is not as it seems.
<P>
I recall one case in which the two parties made an attempt, without true regard for the interests of the child, to defraud the taxpayer through the CSA. They used the relationship as an excuse for the agency not to contact, assess or bother the non-resident parent, and benefits were not affected. The father and mother had an unsavoury and rather cosy relationship. He paid her considerably less than she would have received through the CSA. He able to do that because he was self-employed. He was unpleasant and physically intimidating, and she was convinced that he would be able to show the CSA that he had a very low income. She felt that she was materially better off with that arrangement, but I did not take that view, and nor, eventually, did the CSA.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I was also struck by the report, which hon. Members will have seen, entitled ``Securing Child Support'', which was published in July 1999 by the benefit fraud inspectorate. On page 16, it states that people say that it is okay to lie to the CSA. That report was considered by the Select Committee. The amendment would ensure that it is more difficult to lie to the CSA.
<P>
Why reduce discretion? Why reduce people's ability to deny information? It is more difficult for a person—even a rational person who is bullying another—to anticipate whether information will be denied if the discretion for denial is so narrow and it is clear that the CSA will demand that the information should be made available.
<P>
We support the Government's notion that having no good cause would reduce benefit by 40 per cent., but we would prefer the Secretary of State's ability to cease acting to be curtailed. That would have the added benefit of ensuring that the aggrieved parent fully recognised that the non-resident parent could do little through physical intimidation or by being unpleasant to prevent the agency from gathering the necessary information.
<P>
We are keen that there should be no hiding place for bullies. We also want there to be no hiding places for cheats. We want to ensure that the culture that says that it is okay to lie to the CSA is well and truly smashed.

<P>

<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): Will the hon. Gentleman clarify a point? I hope that I did not misunderstand him. Does he accept that some absent fathers are bullies and that they will use intimidation to get their way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I was not implying that: I was saying it loud and clear—and unambiguously. That is why we think that the Government's general approach in clause 3 is entirely satisfactory. That is why the amendments are merely probing; their only purpose is to put on record what is expected of the new regime with regard to disclosure. This provision is an important and wholly acceptable toughening of the law. We would be in neglect of our duty if we did not ensure that we had the benefit of the Government's thinking in Committee. I hope that we will not want to put the amendment to a vote, but that depends on what the Government have to say. We start from the basis of being supportive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): I put my name to the amendments because they were probing amendments, and I hope that the Minister's response will be robust. I see the clause as a lost opportunity. It is an admission of the failure of compliance and enforcement. In that respect, it mirrors the failure of the original reforms. Now we have an opportunity to correct that.
<P>
When Baroness Hollis spoke to the Select Committee on Social Security, she said that she wanted the proportions of the agency's resources used for calculation and enforcement to be reversed. At the moment, the vast majority of the resources go into calculation, whereas a small proportion goes on enforcement. We have previously turned a blind eye to that. The legislation sends the message that even if the parent with care has been threatened and her life made a misery, the Secretary of State may leave her alone because it would be too much trouble to do otherwise. That is a retrograde message to send, and we must deal with it.
<P>
I know of cases in which the parent with care has had a profound fear of what may happen because of disclosure. However, that is no reason for the state to stand back and let the taxpayer pay. Surely concerns must be addressed in an effective and proper system. An individual who issues threats should be pursued with a rigour and vigilance that is absent from our legislation.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I am astonished. I detect a clear message that the Opposition want to pursue even those women who suffer domestic violence—not only those who claim to suffer, but those who suffer. If I am correct, I find that quite disturbing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The hon. Lady has turned the world on its head. The pursuit is not of the parent with care who is under threat, but of the individual who has fathered children and now seeks to avoid his responsibility by issuing threats. She would have us accept that it is a way out of one's commitments if the threats are accepted as genuine, and nothing in the legislation states that we even have to establish that.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman met women, as I have many times over 25 years, who have suffered domestic violence not only for the period of a claim, but throughout a relationship? They desperately need to get away. What is his problem with such women?
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Such women have come to see me. I am not saying that those women should be pursued or their lives made miserable. I want to deal with the nature of the problem. The hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) knows that an incentive already exists to treat women in such a way—that is to avoid the commitment of paying maintenance. If one issues such threats and carries them out, one is less likely under the present arrangements to be pursued for maintenance by the Secretary of State. That sends a message to other such individuals to adopt that sort of behaviour.
<P>
The armoury of the agency is an additional resource. As it will no longer spend all its time making calculations, the machinery for pursuing those who issue the threats will be more effective.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Joan Humble </B>(Blackpool, North and Fleetwood): Does the hon. Gentleman expect the CSA to investigate allegations of criminal actions? What role will the police have? Who will co-ordinate investigations into such serious allegations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The issue before us is clause 3, and whatever the outcome, the taxpayer will continue to pay for those children who would otherwise be paid for by those absent parents who have avoided their responsibility by issuing threats. The clause should be more robust in trying to obtain the information that is required. That would have a knock-on effect on the work of other agencies such as the police.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> On a point of detail, if the hon. Gentleman has known of women who have had to flee from violence, he must be aware of how horrific that experience is and why women often remain silent for some time afterwards. Would not the amendment make it more difficult for women to discuss their experiences, which would therefore put them in more danger?
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> It is a probing amendment, to elicit the Government's response to the general problem. I do not dispute that Labour Members have a proper concern for individuals who withhold information because of their perception of the threat—
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> It is not a perception.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Because of the reality of the threat of what would happen if they gave that information. However, the hon. Ladies are saying that we—as Members of Parliament, we represent the taxpayer, who will otherwise foot the bill—should turn a blind eye and not require that information to be divulged, and that we should simply accept the situation and not pursue parents with care who have issued such threats.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> Do not we, as legislators, also have a duty of care to the parents and the children who flee the violence? If the police cannot adequately pursue those men, how can the CSA do so?
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The point, to which I have already drawn attention, is that the CSA will have an additional or spare resource to verify such claims, and perhaps provide information to the police. Otherwise, we shall be running away from the problem. The hon. Ladies have shown the reality of that problem; it is not an imagined problem. People really are under threat for giving information. It is therefore the duty of the state, and our duty as legislators, to ensure rigour in the law so that the problem can be dealt with. There is not such rigour in clause 3.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Since the beginning of our debates about the agency, the question of domestic violence has bedevilled the enforcement of child maintenance. I, like the hon. Members for Colne Valley and for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble), have been involved in this matter since the days of Erin Pizzey, the Chiswick Women's Aid and the Women's Aid Federation. I have spent many hours at the women's aid refuge in my constituency, so I am only too aware of the difficulties that such women face, but I am equally aware of the difficulties that the CSA faces in ensuring that children of violent fathers are maintained.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendments are designed to tease out what enforcement procedures the Government want the CSA to put in place to ensure that proper maintenance is collected. It is extraordinarily difficult for women in violent circumstances to reveal information that they believe will prejudice their situation. As my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) said, we are dealing with two different agencies—the CSA, which is trying to collect maintenance on behalf of the taxpayer and the children; and the police and social services, which are trying to deal with the dysfunctional family. Can the Minister reassure us that the CSA will take a more robust approach in establishing links with the police and social services so that sums legitimately intended for the maintenance of children can be collected without women fearing that they will be exposed to further violence? What procedures will be involved?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Will my hon. Friend confirm that the clause represents a considerably more robust approach than the current law?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Indeed. As my hon. Friend said in moving the amendment, we support the Government. We are trying to tease out—which, I suppose, we could have done in a clause stand part debate—the Government's approach to what instructions the CSA will be given about gaining maintenance from violent fathers and how the CSA, now that it will be able to interact with the Inland Revenue and the Benefits Agency, will also interact with the police and social services to ensure that the problems identified in cases that involve victims of domestic violence can be dealt with effectively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I agree that the clause is an improvement, and I congratulate the Government on it, but the problem ultimately remains that, if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the anxiety about the circumstances of the children or the parent with care is genuine, our response will be to let off a person who has made a threat. That is the nub of the problem.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> If my hon. Friend will forgive me, I suspect that the comments of the hon. Members for Colne Valley and for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood are more along those lines, and that the Minister will take a slightly different approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I have no problem with the Opposition's probing the purpose of the clause, and I shall do my best to respond. I do not want to risk unnecessarily winding anyone up, but we are not in a private meeting. Everything that we say is written down and taken in evidence, and independent, dispassionate observers might read our proceedings and suggest to women in certain constituencies, ``I wouldn't go and see your MP after what he said in Committee, because he might not take a robust line towards your good cause arguments.'' I therefore choose my words with care. They are not directed at anyone in particular.
<P>
The CSA will not pursue the matter unless a claim is made. The point is to ensure that the mother—the parent with care is usually, although not always, the mother—makes the claim. I do not want to cite too many statistics, but in 1997, 70 per cent.—a huge proportion—of lone parents coming onto the books of the CSA were pleading good cause or, more probably, had made no contact with the agency. Changes in regard to newly claiming parents with care, such as home visits where the claim could be taken, mean that 82 per cent. of such parents now complete a child support application and provide details of the non-resident parent straight away. That is a big improvement, in a short time, even before the benefits that the provisions in the clause will create.
<P>
I think that there is a common view across the Committee that there is, or was, a big problem, as we all know from our constituents, of people pleading good cause and losing benefit. One felt bewilderment and helplessness, knowing that the mother would not receive money as she had not made a claim because she was, for all kinds of reasons, frightened to do so. I am not saying that that has been eradicated to any great extent—it has not—but the change, in less than three years, from 70 per cent. pleading good cause, not bothering with claiming or seeking to avoid the agency, to 82 per cent. now completing a claim straight away is dramatic.
<P>
It is important to address the details of the amendment. I take the point that it shifts the balance. The clause streamlines the procedure and the way in which the parent with care, claiming or receiving the two benefits previously referred to, is treated in terms of child support. The clause seeks to achieve a seamless service—to get the cash, as it were. However, we also understand that there will be circumstances—it is what one might call the footprint of human life—in which although the parent with care had not opted out when making her claim for income support, it is clear to the CSA that if maintenance were pursued, she could be at risk, especially if she lives in a women's refuge or hostel.
<P>
In those circumstances, the Secretary of State has the power under the clause not to treat the benefit claim as an application for child support, even when the parent with care has not claimed good cause. Some discretion has to be built into the system: a discretion that relies on the experience and quality of the CSA staff who, under a new regime, will have greater capacity to address such cases.
<P>
The amendment would toughen up the good cause provision by removing the Secretary of State's power not to treat the benefit claim as an application in those circumstances. Anyone who thought about that for a moment would realise that it was a mistake. Opposition Members might argue that the woman could opt out. I do not think that we can try and second-guess that; the fact is that when a woman is in a hostel or a refuge with her children, claiming income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance but not claiming the opt-out, having been through the interviews with CSA staff who realised the difficulties in the case, there must be a discretion for the Secretary of State not to pursue the matter. It cannot be right to force the Secretary of State in such circumstances, when our professional staff on the ground, having taken a claim and met the parent, are of the opinion that the mother and perhaps the children would be at risk, which is one of the reasons why we oppose amendment No. 121—in any case, a probing amendment. The wording ``may'' rather than ``shall'' will allow a degree of discretion.
<P>
Amendment No. 125 would require the Secretary of State to recover child maintenance unless the parent with care asks him not to. It would turn the current wording around and place more onus on the parent with care to opt out. In the new scheme, the Secretary of State will take action to recover child maintenance unless asked not to, but as I explained in relation to amendment No. 121, in some circumstances it will be clear to the Secretary of State that it would be harmful to pursue child maintenance on behalf of the parent with care.
<P>
Amendment No. 125 would force the Secretary of State to recover child maintenance in cases in which good cause had not been claimed and would put pressure on the parent with care to opt out in difficult circumstances. I cannot provide a complete list of circumstances, but we all live in the real world and know of relevant cases in which the parent with care needs protection against being forced into risky situation.
<P>
Amendment No. 137 would require the parent with care to notify the Secretary of State that she wants to opt out within 14 days of being told of her right to do so. That would add an extra 14 days on to the procedure. It is implicit in the clause that the parent with care made the claim when she applied for income support. We are not convinced that an extra 14 days—and according to a later amendment, notification would have to be in writing—would be reasonable. It would run against one of the overriding objectives: to get maintenance flowing as quickly as possible in appropriate circumstances.
<P>
There is merit in making it easy for the parent with care not to have to write a letter or to cogitate for 14 days. There is no subterfuge: she will be clearly informed that when the claim for income support is made, it is known that it is also a claim for child support. That would normally take place at an interview, and the parent with care and the officer dealing with her claim can discuss all the implications. It is not possible to achieve all that in writing. We all know from our surgeries that sometimes five minutes face to face is worth a 10-page letter without any margins explaining the whole case in one continuous paragraph. It can be difficult to pull out the salient fact that is needed to provide help for a constituent.
<P>
If the parent with care wants to opt out, she may give her reasons immediately, and if they are accepted the case will be closed and reviewed at a later date—not closed for ever. There will be times when the parent with care does not know whether to opt out. We can envisage bewilderment at being in this situation for the first time, following a distressing break-up, and not understanding the full consequences of the benefit system. The former partner may have left with a parting shot, perhaps a verbal threat said in the heat of the moment, and the parent with care may not know whether it is going to be a festering sore. A little time is required in such circumstances and the parent with care will be given 14 days to consider her options. However, that should not necessarily be made a requirement, as in the amendment.
<P>
In the new scheme, information will be set out in guidance. We intend to give parents with care extra time to enable them to consider all their options and seek independent advice—perhaps from a citizens advice bureau, a member of the family, a local councillor or a Member of Parliament—in order to take the best possible decision. Two weeks should be sufficient, but a statutory waiting period should not be built into every case.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not know what the percentage will be, but many lone parents will have made their decision. They may have organised the break, thought it all through, discussed it secretly for months with relatives or friends and know exactly what to do. They build up their courage and know what to do. I recall a constituent telling me, ``I've learnt to speak up for myself'', having gone through years of turmoil. She became a toughie stand-alone, looking after her kids well. So we do not want to prescribe a specific period in the Bill. It all depends on the circumstances.
<P>
Amendment No. 138 relates to subsection (7), which sets out that the parent with care has to provide information for a child support assessment to be made and maintenance collected unless she has opted out. The amendment would require all parents making a claim for benefit to provide details on the non-resident parent, regardless of whether they had opted out of child support. The CSA would have to obtain information about the non-resident parent from all parents with care who made a claim for benefit. We propose, rather, that information on non-„resident parents should be requested only from parents with care for whom child support action is being taken.
<P>
Amendment No. 138 offers no advantage to children for a number of reasons. It would require all parents with care on benefit to give information to the CSA, which could not pursue child maintenance if the parent with care had asked them not to. There appears to be no point, and it would be insensitive and cause unnecessary worry, to ask parents with care who had good reasons for not claiming child support, to provide child support-related information, such as about the non-resident parent. Parents with care who do not have good cause, so on whom a reduced benefit decision has been imposed, are highly unlikely to provide any information on the non-resident parent. The amendment would mean a lot of extra work for the CSA, but to no effect.
<P>
If the CSA were successful in obtaining information from the parent with care, the fact that she had opted out of making a claim for child support would mean that the information could not be acted on by the Secretary of State as stipulated under subsection (5). One of the fundamental reasons why we are reforming the child support system is to get money flowing to more children. Amendment No. 138 would waste vital resources by forcing the CSA to chase information when it was not going to collect maintenance because a claim had not been made.
<P>
These amendments would add unnecessary delay and bureaucracy and would not help to protect vulnerable women who may genuinely fear violence from their ex-partners if the CSA pursued them for maintenance. I urge the Committee to reject them though I accept their spirit as probing amendments.
<P>
I cannot give answers—and I doubt whether any Minister can—about what will happen in individual circumstances: when, for example, good cause is given and the case is closed but will be reviewed in future; or when good cause is not given and there is a benefit slice-off. I cannot say either what actions may be taken against the person who made the threats. We all know that there have been vast improvements in the past decade in the way in which the police approach what were called domestic violence disputes. In my first decade as a Member of Parliament, the old-fashioned attitude still prevailed: ``It's domestic violence; we don't get involved.'' That is what I was told in the 1970s and early 1980s. There has been a dramatic change in the attitude of the police, but we cannot prejudge what will happen. As the hon. Member for New Forest, West said, it is right that these people ought to be pursued. They have made threats against another person that have caused that person to change their behaviour—not to make the claim—so the taxpayer has to pay out.
<P>
That problem must be set against the situation when the CSA first started. I do not make this as a partisan point of criticism of the previous Government, but the figures that I gave earlier showed that 70 per cent. of people were not providing the information, whereas today 82 per cent. of new claimants give the information straight away. The way in which the information can be given is now easier: it can be done face to face or in one's home. Also, we have had more experience. I will not go into the details, but I can recall a claim being made and information being given about the father purely because the claimant's friend had done it and there had not been a problem. As the CSA goes along, it is biting into this issue. It is becoming more unacceptable not to comply, as it has become more unacceptable to drink and drive. There has been a change in attitude—it is not done to boast about not paying for one's kids; the feeling is that one ought to pay. I do not think that that boast would now be made in male company as it would in the past.
<P>
It is right that these people should be pursued, but I do not think that we should add to the mechanism in clause 3 by prescribing actions by the police, the CSA or the parent with care, who is the vulnerable person in these circumstances. There is no question of these issues being ignored, but it would not be right to include such provisions in the Bill.
<P>
I hope that I have given the Committee a feel for how the new system will operate and add to the successes of recent years. The system creaked to start with, but it has got better as the years have gone by.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Minister made a very thoughtful and worthwhile contribution to this difficult subject. We could have waited and raised it on clause stand part, but as I said a couple of weeks back in the debate on the sittings motion, given that we are broadly supportive of the Government's aims, we will be tabling more than the usual number of probing amendments. These amendments have been tabled with precisely that aim.
<P>
I want our primary concern to be absolutely clear: there should be no bonus for violence. Anyone who threatens their partner or their family is despicable. The Minister was right, though: things have changed and it is not socially acceptable to use violence. I doubt that it was ever socially acceptable in decent society to use violence, but that notion is increasingly being pushed out. It is pleasing that we should take firm action. It is time that we started to treat people who prey on their former partners with threats of violence in the same way as we treat stalkers. We will be tabling amendments later on to toughen up the Bill's approach in those situations.
<P>
The Minister quoted one of his constituents as saying, ``I've learnt to speak up for myself.'' I can recall a constituent who faced this kind of problem. She said to me, ``I'm very frightened, but I'm determined not to show my fear to my children because I don't want them to live in an atmosphere of fear.'' That is why we tabled the amendments. I am pleased that the Minister thought that at least one of them was vaguely satisfactory, although he did not accept it. These probing amendments were designed to put on record the sort of comments that the Minister made in his speech. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Amendments Nos. 90, 91 and 140 relate to clause 5, but they deal with the same problem as the others. Hon. Members will recall that I have occasionally castigated Labour for being the party of administrative convenience. Too often, we have heard the argument that we should consider the best interests of running the CSA, rather than those of the individuals concerned. It must seem strange that I have moved an amendment that essentially says ``Put it in writing.'' The Bill states that any method, including writing, may be used.
<P>
I am reminded of the problems that the Minister's predecessor faced when dealing with misinformation that the Benefits Agency provided on the state earnings-related pension scheme. That misinformation continued to be given until last July. Of course, the then Minister was forced to concede that much of the misinformation resulted from telephone conversations and verbal assurances.
<P>
Given the fact that we are dealing with public money and that people sometimes forget what they say on the phone or in other conversations, something should be put in writing. That does not mean that the person has to write a long, laborious letter; they might simply have to sign a form or a request, which would provide some certainty.
<P>
Under amendment No. 63, the Secretary of State would be required to act only with good reason. However, the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) dealt with that point in the previous debate. Under amendment No. 64, the Secretary of State would be required to act only with good reason in collecting relevant information to assess whether good cause exists. There should be a permanent record when dealing with such important matters. The most convenient way of having a record would be to ensure that something is signed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend that we usually want to cut bureaucracy and anything that might waste time. Most members of the Committee have probably been annoyed because they have had to put something in writing. If we want to withdraw our own money from the bank, we must provide documentary evidence. We often wish that the telephone could be used much more.
<P>
If a certain case had not been brought to my attention at my surgery, I probably would not have made this brief speech. What should have been a relatively straightforward case became very complicated. The partner without care was pursued and the case became almost unfathomable because a telephone call was made to the Child Support Agency, on which it acted, and it was later discovered that it was not the parent with care who had made the call, but somebody else. There were all sorts of problems as a result.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Will the Government take into account how easily that can happen? I cannot imagine why anyone should want to make a telephone call pretending to be the parent with care, but where family breakdown is involved matters are inevitably complicated and such things do happen. I was spurred to make this contribution because of that particularly painful case.
<P>
Members of Parliament quite often deal with the Benefits Agency or the Inland Revenue on behalf of their constituents, and those bodies will provide little, if any, information unless there is something in writing. That seems to be a reasonable precedent. When the Secretary of State does not act, as is covered by our proposal in amendment No. 63, it should only be because the welfare of the child is concerned, not for convenience.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The amendments cover much the same ground as the previous group, so I do not intend to go over them in as much detail as I might have done. We need to bear in mind the changes to the current system that are implicit in the clause and the implications that they may have for women who want to claim good cause.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Minister said in response to the previous group of amendments, we are changing and toughening up the approach to claiming child maintenance by asking parents with care deliberately to opt out of making a claim for child support, rather than to opt in. As he pointed out, through administrative action we have reduced the 70 per cent. of parents with care who were claiming good cause in 1997 to 18 per cent. During a series of home visits we look at how we can combine the income support and child maintenance claims to get everything sorted out at once, in keeping with our view of how we want the benefit and welfare systems to go.
<P>
We are currently trialling that in the ONE pilots, which are an attempt to get everything sorted out in one place at the same time so that the administration can then be undertaken. The changes in the clause bring child support into line with those pilots. To date, our pilots have had a dramatic effect on the number of women who either opt out completely or claim good cause.
<P>
Both parents have a responsibility to support their children. The new rules are meant to send a clear signal to them that maintenance is not an optional extra but something for which we expect them to apply unless there are significant reasons of good cause to exempt them from that responsibility, such as those that we talked about on the previous group of amendments.
<P>
The new procedure will allow for a more streamlined and client-focused service to enable maintenance to be put into effect and get it flowing more quickly.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I suspect that this is an administrative question rather than one of policy. Is the Minister saying that the combined application for income support plus child support would in effect be the written application that is proposed in the amendment? Would signing the document to claim income support record the application or the opt-out from child support?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> If the hon. Lady thinks about it the answer must be yes. Once we have the two things properly in kilter, an income support application will go alongside a simultaneous application for child maintenance, unless the parent with care has significant reasons of good cause for opting out of applying for child maintenance. Under the present system, she has to opt in.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Following on from that, if the parent with care opts out of child support, is there somewhere on the form to sign to say that she is opting out? Or would that be left blank?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I am not certain that the forms have been designed. We have been trialling prototypes in various places. That has helped us to obtain the results that my hon. Friend put before the Committee. We have reduced good cause by administrative action and by explaining things more carefully to parents with care at the point of claim. However, I have no exact view in my mind about how the form will look. Clearly there has to be an administrative way for a parent with care to claim good cause and opt out and I would have thought that that would be done by signing the form.
<P>
The initial approach will have to be signed for and we do not want to change that. However, some parents with care who may still want to use the CSA may not be on benefit, and we have to go through all of the permutations of who may arrive. We are talking in the opt-in context only of those who have an appropriate benefit to claim. There will be different systems which may well involve the telephone for people pursuing private cases who are using the collection services of the CSA.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am sorry to be such an administration persecutor. Did the Minister say that if someone who is not claiming benefit wishes to opt out of child support, that can be done by telephone, with no confirmation in a signed document? If it is done by telephone, will the notes taken by the child support officer be regarded as sufficient? Also, given what we all know—we hope that it will stop—about the difficulty of tracking some people's files, many of which go missing, what proof will there be of that telephone call? Would the person who made that telephone call have to agree to it as a true record?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Lady tempts me on to the cusp of new technology and how we want to deliver services in a different manner. Such an issue has faced other service industries which are provide services by telephone and will do so in the not too distant future by internet. It is not a unique issue.
<P>
At the moment a signature is needed and we do not anticipate a change in that yet. For example, our pensions directorate now offers electronic claim forms over the telephone to people in certain areas of the country as they approach pensionable age. Instead of sending out a very large and complicated form, someone on the end of a telephone can take people through an electronic claim form and fill in the information. Then a printed copy of the form that was filled in over the telephone is sent to the claimant to sign at the bottom. The person is asked to include any evidence that may be required. It is a combination of telephone access with a form to sign at the end of the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> In the case that I cited—perhaps I did not make this clear—the mother wanted to stop claiming part of the way through the process. I cannot understand why it was the case, but someone had impersonated her and been accepted by the CSA as the mother so the claim was stopped. That caused enormous problems. How would that situation be covered?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I do not want to get into the minutiae of this, but there are ways of proving identity in the new remote services that are accessible over the telephone. It usually takes the form of asking questions of a personal nature that are already registered in order to ensure that identity is established before a discussion is started. This is not unique. The CSA was at fault for not establishing that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chris Ruane </B>(Vale of Clwyd): The hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) describes the downside of using the telephone. The CSA officers to whom I have spoken in my constituency say that using the telephone often reveals whether a person is telling the truth, especially if the same person answers each time. Contemporaneous notes can be compared and if a person is telling the truth they will always be the same. If he is not, they will be different. Liars must have good memories.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We all need to remember that. The way in which we can provide our services can change, especially when we have our brand new computers which will enable telephony, workflow and access. People who are telephoned will be able to get the case up on screen. That capacity is not on the present computer system, although I will not bore the Committee with its bare bones nature.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Yes, I suppose so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Lady should not be so interesting. On Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) raised the possibility that people could use remote terminals in safe public libraries to complete forms. Is that the kind of thing that the Government are thinking of? Is that what the clause is meant to deal with? Are we moving towards electronic signatures?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> No. This is about trying to achieve a reasonable rebalancing of the good cause provisions and what is expected of the parent with care, given that clause 3 toughens up the way in which child maintenance is applied for. As parents with care now have to opt out actively rather than opt in to claim child maintenance, clause 3 offers some protections around the edges to ensure that women who are at risk of domestic violence if their claims are pursued are not put at any greater risk.
<P>
Having said that, the legislation on electronic signatures is going through the House and it would be very short-sighted of us as Ministers to consider procuring new computers in this day and age without taking what I call future-proofing into account. That will give us the best chance of adapting our new system to make connections with the new age and what will be possible as a result of two-way access via a digital line, be it in a local post office or library or on one's television screen in the front room. The answer is sort of yes, but the main issue here is to get the balance right between parents with care who may have to claim for support and the fact that we have tightened up the application for maintenance.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 62, 63 and 64 significantly toughen up the good cause provisions by insisting that parents with care give their reasons for opting out in writing, that the Secretary of State should consider whether the welfare of any children would be affected if maintenance was pursued and that he should consider good cause only where information has been provided in a prescribed way. The amendments would put potentially vulnerable women at risk of violence from their former partners and make the good cause process too cumbersome and bureaucratic.
<P>
By requiring applications in writing from parents, these amendments would mean that good cause could be accepted—even where the risk to the parent with care was obvious and had emerged in a face-to-face interview between a member of CSA staff and the parent with care only after a written application had been received. The parent might be living in a hostel for women who have suffered domestic violence but there would still have to be written application. More fundamentally, the amendments would mean that for the first time child support would be pursued regardless of the wishes of the parent with care.
<P>
Parents would be allowed to opt out only if they could show good cause for doing so. The result would be that in many cases the CSA would begin action to pursue child support only to find that the parent with care refused to provide the information necessary to obtain the maintenance for the children. By then significant resources would have been consumed in time to work out child support liability with little prospect of any advantage to the children and the violent father would have been alerted by the activity.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 90, 91, and 140 would require all applications for a variation to be made in writing rather than allowing straightforward applications to be taken over the telephone. One of the principal aims of the reform scheme is to get maintenance flowing quickly. We intend to remove the long delays that occur in the existing scheme, often leaving the non-resident parent with a substantial debt by the time he is notified of his liability.
<P>
The difference between the variation scheme and the current departure scheme is that, under the new scheme, applicants will not have to wait until the maintenance calculation has been made before being allowed to apply for a variation. We want these procedures streamlined and focused on clients so that it is as easy as possible for parents to contact and deal with the CSA. Another improvement that we have managed to put in place is that whereas in 1996 only 1 per cent. of clients got through first time on the telephone to the CSA, it is now 76 per cent. We are trying to widen access to the CSA.
<P>
To improve customer service further, we will not require an application to be made in writing unless it raises particularly difficult issues. That might apply where the parent with care alleges that the non-resident parent is enjoying a lifestyle that simply could not be supported by his declared income. In that type of case, a written application will assist in establishing its merits and whether it should be referred to an appeal tribunal to consider. It is intended to ensure that unnecessary debts are not built up during the variation process.
<P>
However, we want to ensure that applications for variations are, like other child support matters, handled quickly and efficiently. Often, these matters will be best dealt with by telephone contact and we see no reason to introduce the delay that would be caused by requiring that an application for a variation be always in writing. It is possible nowadays to establish the identity of people over the telephone and it is possible for the agency to keep good records of telephone conversations that can be consulted in future. For that reason, I ask the Committee not to accept the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Minister has been helpful. My hon. Friend the Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent would be particularly interested in her long-term prediction about how things are likely to develop and the possibility of digital signatures. There is just one point that I should like to put on record. The Minister ended by saying that procedures existed to ensure that telephone conversations were accurately recorded. I am not sure that I am aware of those procedures. My hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury raised an important point about impersonation on the telephone. It would be helpful if the Minister could tell us not only what guidelines there will be but what training is planned for staff. If we are to use telephone communications and to use a form that is not written down either electronically or in manuscript form, we need to be clear on this, because here lies the possibility of great injustice. However, in the spirit in which we have been conducting our proceedings, I am prepared to give the Minister the benefit of the doubt, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 123, in page 3, line 38, leave out `so far as she reasonably can'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 124, in page 4, line 1, leave out from `(8)' to end of line 9.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> This is a simple amendment. Its purpose is to allow Ministers to describe the circumstances that are covered by the phrase ``as may be prescribed''. We want an indication of the Government's thinking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Amendment No. 123 would remove the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``so far as she reasonably can''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
from subsection (7), which would mean the parent with care being required to provide information that she did not have. We think that that would be unreasonable and unworkable.
<P>
The information that is required will be set out in regulations. Under the current scheme, the parent with care is required to provide information only where it is reasonable to do so. That allows for times when, as envisaged in most of the previous legislation, she does not know and is unable to obtain some of the information—the absent parent's address, for example, or his workplace. We want to carry forward that provision into the new scheme.
<P>
Of course, we are in the hands of parliamentary draftsmen, who sometimes think that they are in charge of the House. That is not an attack on their professionalism. Bills are drafted in this way. If we prescribed, ``Unless she has made a request not to do so, the parent shall comply with regulations''—in other words, if we accepted the amendment—and everyone knew that there was an automatic legal requirement to comply, the parent with care could say, ``It's not reasonable. I don't know where he lives,'' and that would be the end of the matter. The way in which lawyers twist words in court means that we have to include phrases such as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``so far as she reasonably can''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as a protection, otherwise we would just build up unnecessary court actions. It would be unreasonable for the Bill to require from the parent with care information that any reasonable person knew that they did not have.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I should like to pursue the interests of a parent with care who is fleeing violence. Can my hon. Friend assure me that that parent would have adequate opportunity to make her case that she should not have to pursue a claim against the absent father?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I do not quite see how my hon. Friend's question squares with the amendment.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I may have missed an earlier opportunity to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> When Hansard comes out, perhaps my hon. Friend should read my earlier speech. No one will be required unreasonably to give information in the case that my hon. Friend highlighted. This provision requires a parent with care to give the information that is required
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``so far as she reasonably can''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, if she does not have the information about the parent, it is not a question of saying ``I don't know where he works,'' when she does, but will not say because she feels under threat. That is a different issue and has to be dealt with in the context of the interview to show good cause. If she clearly does have the information about where the absent parent is living or working, as far as she reasonably can, she will be required to give it. Where she does not have the information, she cannot be expected to provide it and most reasonable people would see that that makes sense. That is what we are seeking to deal with here and Opposition Members are probing that.
<P>
Amendment No. 124 relates to subsections (8) and (9). Subsection (8) provides a regulation-making power allowing the Secretary of State to specify the circumstances in which the requirement to supply information could be waived. The provision is not new; it is carried over, unchanged, from current legislation. Although no regulations have been made using this power, and to the best of my knowledge we do not propose any, we need to retain the provision against the possibility that circumstances might be identified in which it would be wrong to require that the information be provided. The amendment would remove what could be an important protection for vulnerable lone parents.
<P>
Amendment No. 124 would also remove subsection (9), relating to the powers to collect child support when a parent with care is no longer entitled to benefit. It would make the child support scheme much more difficult to operate in that child support would be terminated every time a lone parent came off benefit. Under our proposals, which again carry forward the current arrangements, action to recover maintenance when the parent with care leaves benefit will continue unless she specifically tells us to stop. That is important because there is always a flow of people moving on and off the benefit list.
<P>
We work in global sums and the numbers are huge, but they do not relate to the same people at any given time. Given the fact that benefit has been paid and there is a satisfactory arrangement, it makes sense, unless the parent with care specifically asks us not do so, for the Child Support Agency to continue to collect the benefit. We make no apology for getting the maintenance flowing in a seamless system to avoid unnecessary repeat applications, which create a huge amount of extra bureaucracy.
<P>
I hope that hon. Members agree that it will be reasonable to continue that, and we ask that the amendment be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Default and interim maintenance decisions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 139 page 5, line 2, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) The regulations shall make provision for—
<P>
(a) the calculation of the difference between the amount of child support maintenance paid by the non-resident parent pursuant to any default or interim maintenance decision and the amount of child support maintenance which would have been payable by the non-resident parent had the Secretary of State completed a maintenance calculation at the time of that default or interim maintenance decision;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is an important part of the Bill in terms of encouraging the non-resident parent to divulge information. It lays down a penalty and the rather peculiar suggestion that where it turns out that the non-resident parent has been overpaying, that payment should not be returned. The Government say in the explanatory notes that this is necessary because it will encourage people to fill in the form and to divulge quickly and efficiently. We recognise that that is a legitimate view but we believe that it is important for the CSA to be seen to be fair and equitable. It seems that if one overpays one's taxes, a situation which we perhaps all get into occasionally—[Interruption.] My hon. Friends scoff but a couple of years ago I got £16 back and I was very pleased.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I got £1,500 back last year.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend should fill in my tax returns in future. I would be a much happier person. It might make us all better at filling in forms if we knew that if we were dilatory and we found that we were owed money we would not get it back. That might encourage us to fill them in quickly, but this is a step too far and unreasonable. It is draconian in its approach and will have an adverse effect on the esteem of the Child Support Agency. It is already held in low esteem but we want it to be better esteemed by the public. This big brother approach is a step too far. I look forward to hearing some justification for it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I want to reinforce my hon. Friend's point. Will the Minister address the issue of what action could be taken by somebody who had overpaid and was not receiving any compensation? Sadly, we are moving more towards a compensation culture and I foresee challenges on the grounds of natural justice. Forget social justice—the challenge would be in terms of natural justice. The system is bedevilled not only by more and more claims of compensation but by more and more claims for judicial review. I suspect that this could be an area in which people who wished to make life difficult, or even had a genuine grievance, could tie up the CSA for some considerable time, if they could find routes to claim back any sum overpaid. I wonder also whether the matter might wend its way to the Human Rights Act 1998 as well.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> To put the hon. Lady's mind at rest, we have not had any implications for the European Convention on Human Rights drawn to our attention with respect to this provision. The lawyers would have pointed it out to us if there had been any. In dealing with the amendment we need to remember that we are trying to replace an existing system of interim maintenance assessments set out in the current legislation that, to put it gently, has been a dismal failure.
<P>
The idea behind an interim maintenance assessment was to provide an incentive for the non-resident parent to pay quickly by establishing a punitive rate of assessment in the interim if he were not co-operating in allowing the Agency to make calculations of maintenance due. The interim maintenance assessments are set at around £89.60 a week, which is nearly two and a half times the average final maintenance calculation, currently £38.05. It is certainly punitive. Unfortunately, 90 per cent. of those who are issued with an interim maintenance assessment do not pay a penny, so it has completely failed to live up to expectations. Having accepted that interim maintenance assessments have failed as an incentive to non-resident parents to provide information, clause 4 seeks to put in place default and interim payments, at a much more reasonable level, while further calculations are being made.
<P>
The purpose of the clause, which replaces section 12 of the 1990 Act, is to allow liability to be set at a default or interim rate when it is not possible to make a decision on full liability. The amendment would introduce new regulation-making powers that would provide that if, following a default or interim maintenance decision, the assessment final was lower, the non-resident parent would be able to recover the overpayment. If the final assessment was higher, which would mean that there had been an underpayment, the parent with care would be able to recover that underpayment.
<P>
In the case of interim maintenance decisions, if the outcome of the variation application is that the rate of liability is to be changed, the new decision will be put in place from the effective date of the application for the variation. In the case of default decisions, we intend that once full information is available, the new liability will be put in place from the date that the information was obtained. Maintenance liability for the past period will be recalculated if the full assessment is higher than the default rate. That is because we want parents to provide information quickly and to pay the default rate in the interim. However, we do not want people to gain an advantage by delaying the process.
<P>
Many Opposition Members spoke about people making vexatious claims, stringing things along and all the other things that we heard about in earlier debates, but the new system is intended to provide an incentive to stop that happening.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> Is not the Under-Secretary assuming that the fault always lies with the people who are trying to get the matter sorted? It might lie with the CSA.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I hope that the CSA will be much less at fault in future, because the system that we seek to put in place is much simpler. Interim payments will be made when variations have been asked for. Default payments will be made when information cannot be gathered about an individual's circumstances. The information is required in order to make an assessment. Under the new system, the information will be much easier to provide.
<P>
If the full liability is lower, we shall not revisit the default rate for the previous period. That introduces a financial incentive for non-resident parents to give the information to the agency as quickly as possible. The amendment would dilute the provisions. If accepted, it would mean that non-resident parents would never lose out when a default decision was replaced with a maintenance calculation. Moreover, the final maintenance assessment would have to be adjusted in order to recover any overpayment from the parent with care.
<P>
We want to encourage people to give information to the agency as quickly as possible, so that the proper payment can be put in place. I can announce to the Committee that we expect default payments to be set at an average level of £30 for one child, £40 for two and £50 for three. I hope that my assurances and my explanation of our thinking have persuaded the Opposition to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am sorry that the Minister was a little distressed with a cough towards the end of her speech. She raised a couple of points that require clarification before we can decide whether to press the amendment to a Division. I hope that I misheard her response to my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury. He said that the CSA has had the odd problem, occasionally lost a file or made a wrong calculation. We accept that it is much improved, but suppose that the root of a problem was that the CSA had lost a file, misunderstood information or mixed up two facts. When there is an over-payment, does the non-resident parent get the money back? If I understood the Under-Secretary, she said that he does not. It is similar to that wonderful book by Solzhenitsyn in which the KGB says that it never made mistakes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> Does my hon. Friend remember my saying in an earlier sitting of the Committee that the CSA considers six months an acceptable time in which to sort out a case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend makes another good point. Ministers have been reasonable and have pacified us on most points, but I am afraid that they are not doing so on this matter. There is a fine balance between ensuring that people co-operate, fill in forms and make total disclosure as quickly as possible and injustice. If fate does not lie wholly in the hands of the non-resident parent, he or she will be in a terrible situation. We cannot have a situation in which the CSA can penalise the non-resident parent for its mistake. That is not justice.
<P>
The Under-Secretary made matters worse in dealing with a second point. She referred to several statements that my hon. Friends made in previous debates about the European Court of Human Rights and the various treaties and declarations. She said that she had received assurances that there were no relevant implications. To be helpful, she said that nothing had been raised about the matter, so she assumed that there was no problem. However, the report of the Select Committee on Social Security expressed a concern about article 6 of the European convention on human rights.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I shall read the report out, and then the Under-Secretary can shoot me down in flames and tell me that everything is okay. That will give her time to read her note. The report says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``judicial power to determine the civil obligation of a parent to pay child support under the departures scheme''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the variation scheme­
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``can be vested in an official''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How can that be? Article 6 prescribes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This measure an attempt to vest that power in an official, which is clearly outside article 6. The Government are placing the provision in United Kingdom law and it is about to take effect. Given the evidence before the Select Committee, I cannot possibly see how it does not offend against article 6.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree that many of his cases at the moment involve people who are appealing to tribunals. My understanding of his quotations from the report and the interpretation of the Bill is that there would not be even a tribunal to appeal to on such occasions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That is exactly my point. The Government are seeking to place those procedures—which under article 6, should be protected within a judicial or even a quasi-judicial framework—in the hands of an administrator. That is clearly outside the terms of the article.
<P>
The Under-Secretary wanted to intervene on me and I said I would give way but then promptly forgot. I am sorry—[Interruption.] She can keep reading the note because I am sure that it is germane to this point. Part of the problem is that we signed up to the convention—
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Some of us did not.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Some Conservative Members did not, but we are democrats. Britain signed up to it, but I am afraid that although there were the usual assurances that there would be no effects on business and no implications for the Bill, that was incorrect. All that will happen is that the provisions will be overturned by judicial review. I trust that the Under-Secretary is now in good voice, and that she will tell me how wrong I am.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I hope that I can calm people's worries about this. First, if a Bill is signed by the relevant Secretary of State as being in accordance with the provisions of the European convention on human rights, which is now enshrined in UK law, it means that there has been a vigorous examination of every dot and comma by Government lawyers. Such a declaration is not made in a cavalier way, and I assure Opposition Members that that goes for this Bill.
<P>
Secondly, the hon. Member for Tewkesbury said that the CSA had told him that six months was an acceptable period in which to sort out a case. That may be so for the current, very complex system which was landed on us by the 1991 Act and with which we have all been struggling. We have learned a great deal about what might be done to improve it. I hope that after the Bill has made it on to the statute book, we can reduce that period considerably. I would ask the hon. Gentleman to look forwards as well as backwards.
<P>
If I gave the impression that there was no right of appeal against the decision to issue a default rate, that was the wrong impression. A non-resident parent who is issued with a default rate can appeal against it through the usual mechanisms. Presumably, grounds for such an appeal could be the individual's lack of blame or difficulty in coming up with the information.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must draw the Under-Secretary's attention to the fact that this is an intervention, not a speech.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I am sorry, Mr. O'Brien. I thought that the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar had sat down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I would have thought that the words ``I shall give way to the hon. Lady'' might have been a clue. However, that was a while ago. The Under-Secretary is struggling with her voice and I did not want to be beastly by jumping up and down and objecting. No doubt she will continue with the point that she was making when I sit down.
<P>
The highly paid lawyers do not have much experience of the convention because it is new. They are not going to scour the Bill to see whether it is compatible, but people who are rightly concerned with civil liberties will do so. Mr. Mostyn, a learned QC—[HON. MEMBERS: ``Him again!''] It may be Mr. Mostyn who faces the highly paid lawyers and, on past form, I would not care to put money on the Government. Is this one of the occasions when people's jobs are on the line? If there are several challenges, has the Under-Secretary dictated that heads will roll? I hope that Government lawyers are listening.
<P>
Mr. Mostyn says at paragraph 68 on page 62 of the Select Committee report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I am at a loss to understand how the judicial power to determine the civil obligation of a parent to pay child support under the departures scheme can be vested in an official without offending Article 6''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If he, as a distinguished Queen's Counsel, is at a loss to understand that, how can the Minister feel assured about it when her lawyers have not even addressed the problem? She said that they had not considered this issue, that the Government had received no advice and that there was nothing to be concerned about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I accept absolutely what the Under-Secretary said about the Bill having had a general appraisal by Government lawyers, but it would be helpful if she could assure the Committee that this specific point has been dealt with. Perhaps the hon. Lady could share the Government lawyers' advice with the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am not sure that that is reasonable, because the Under-Secretary said that the lawyers had not given any advice.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I will give way in a second.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It will be short.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I do not know what is in the water that the Under-Secretary is drinking, but I would like some. She has disclosed to the Committee the advice that she has received she told us that nothing had been said. I now happily give way to the hon. Lady.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> In my rather long intervention, I said that our lawyers had gone through every dot and comma of the Bill with a fine toothcomb. That does not equate with what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Every dot, comma, clause, subsection, word and phrase has been checked over by lawyers for ECHR compliance.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I note that the hon. Lady did not mention paragraphs.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It was my omission, not theirs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That was a cheap point, for which I apologise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> It is one thing to have an assurance that lawyers have looked at every comma and paragraph of the Bill, but it is another to say that this specific issue has been dealt with and that the Under-Secretary has been persuaded by it.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The Under-Secretary says from a sedentary position that she has been persuaded. In that case, perhaps she could give us the specific advice that she was given in order to refute the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar made when he quoted Mr. Mostyn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That is not unreasonable. In response to our amendments to schedule 1, the Under-Secretary said to the Committee—this is from memory, but I shall check up on it in the lunch break—that Government lawyers had advised that our proposals would make it more likely that the Bill would be challenged on the basis of the European convention. It is not unreasonable, therefore, for us to ask for an assurance in this case.
<P>
There is no point introducing legislation, only to hand over the responsibility from the people's representatives to a bunch of judges. All that the hon. Lady would be doing is handing over an important aspect of the CSA to the judges to decide—not the House of Lords, not Members of Parliament on Report, not even her officials. The judges will decide.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I shall now attempt to make a proper response rather than a long intervention.
<P>
The Opposition may have got the wrong end of the stick; at any rate, they have become far more aerated than the facts warrant. I shall try to calm things down by explaining why I do not think that clause 4 presents the difficulties that Opposition Members claim. Clause 4 always causes controversy.
<P>
A non-resident parent who is presented with a departure by the CSA because information for a child maintenance assessment cannot be gathered has the right to appeal against the default rate which is applied. As long as that right exists, this part of the Bill is compliant with article 6. I do not want to make the life or earnings capacity of that highly paid QC, Mr. Mostyn, any easier. I am sure that our lawyers would do such work for far less than the salary that he earns. However, we have assurances that the measure is compliant with the Human Rights Act 1998. If a default payment has been unreasonably agreed, the appeal process will discover that and the non-resident parent will have a chance to have a hearing on that matter.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Will the Under-Secretary assure me that the right of appeal is not to a CSA officer or adjudication officer but to a tribunal—or is it subject to judicial decision making?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It is to an independent tribunal. Article 6 is therefore properly respected.
<P>
The Bill is drafted in such a way that a default payment cannot be an overpayment, as it is the proper rate while it is being paid. Therefore, the question of overpayment does not arise. If the non-resident parent obstructs reasonable attempts to get a simple list of information necessary for a quick maintenance calculation, the default payment is issued. Under the Bill, that is the proper payment until the required information is received and it is superseded by the child maintenance assessment.
<P>
Therefore, this part of the Bill provides incentives for non-resident parents to co-operate quickly and effectively with the requirements for information which are far less than those that currently exist and much simpler to comply with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> What happens if it is the CSA's fault?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It cannot be the CSA's fault, as the default rate will be suspended on the date on which the information is provided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> What happens if the CSA loses information that is provided? What happens if such information turns up a month later?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I hope that the calculations will be much simpler than those in the existing system. I hope that people can work out 15, 20 and 25 per cent. of net income much more easily than they perform current calculations.
<P>
We cannot legislate for people losing files. There may be cases in which files are lost. However, default rates are suspended once information is provided and the obligations on the non-resident parent under clause 4 are deemed to be fulfilled Any other delays would be the fault of the agency and would not be visited upon the non-resident parent. The assessment would be put in place from the date on which that parent provided the information, not that on which the agency made the calculation. Therefore, the non-resident parent does not take the rap for any inefficiency in the agency.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> You may say that I am out of order, Mr. O'Brien. However, we are discussing cases of a more complex nature and have not talked about variations, which involve complexities.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We shall not discuss that now. We shall stick to the Opposition amendment, which refers to non-resident default payments and the parent with care.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I hope that I have given the assurance that the Opposition wanted. I hope that the extra information that I have given will reassure the Committee that this is not some kind of KGB clause and that it is reasonable, contains proper safeguards and should enable the agency to do its work efficiently.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am afraid that it is a KGB clause and we must not make a mistake. My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham has made an important point. It is no good the Under-Secretary telling us not to worry because the formula is simple. This is precisely the time when the simple formula meets complexity; such cases will not necessarily be easy.
<P>
The Under-Secretary says that we cannot legislate for a lost file. Under the clause, the penalty for losing a file will be placed not on the person who lost it but on the person whose file it is. That makes not a jot of sense, and the amendment is intended to avoid it happening. She says that there will be no overpayment, because the definition of overpayment used in the Bill does not include overpayment. That is not a convincing argument.
<P>
The Under-Secretary has helpfully given us more information, but the problem that the Opposition face is that, the more information she gives, the more we are convinced that our original fears were right. She has not allayed our fears, but made them worse. When we started to consider the process, we thought that it was fairly simple, but as she gives more information on article 6 of the human rights declaration and on the definition of overpayment, we become more worried. I am afraid that unless she has more words of reassurance—

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 6 to 8 and 38 to 43.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I can play this long or can play it short. Some of the amendments in the group are simply intended to clarify the Bill, but they are not all purely technical, so I shall put a few comments on the record.
<P>
I am jumping the gun, but amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are purely technical. Amendments Nos. 3, 6, 7 and 8 relate to applications for variations of normal rules. Amendment No. 3 clarifies the provision that determines who may apply for a variation. It allows the person with care of the child, as well as the non-resident parent, to apply for a variation wherever an application for maintenance calculation has been made or treated as made. Additionally, where an application for a maintenance calculation has been by a child in Scotland under section 7, the amendment allows the person with care of the child to apply for a variation as well as the non-resident parent, or the child himself or herself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): How will the non-resident parent or the parent with care know whether he or she is likely to benefit by a variation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> That person would make the application. We will have more detailed debates on variations. I am not in a position to answer off the top of my head. Applying for variation implies there is some evidence or information held by the parent with care who will make an application. There would have to be an investigation and that is part of the issue of having access to the Inland Revenue. We will not send the person a form on which it is all set out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Perhaps I am not making myself clear. Obviously one would not be able to apply for a variation on any subject. Presumably these will be tightly curtailed. I may be jumping the gun for a subsequent debate, but it is important that the Minister explains how the public, who would not naturally be familiar with these matters, will know that they are likely to benefit and, therefore, that they may be covered by a variation.

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> With respect, there will be explanatory leaflets for the scheme. This is not going to be a secret. There will be definite issues for which variations can be applied for and there will be some issues under the old scheme that will make it clear that there is no point in applying. That will be upfront. There will be explanatory leaflets, although they will not have the force of law. They will be like other DSS leaflets and will enable people to assess whether they can make a claim based on the information in them. Claims can then be assessed. There will not be a need to go to lawyers. We will publish information about this, as we do with all benefits, so that people know their rights. People who have information that they think might lead to a variation have every right to find further information that enables them to claim for that variation.
<P>
On this group of amendments, I regret that I doubt that I will be able to satisfy the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), because we shall certainly go into the matter in greater detail in another group.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister has been generous in giving way, but when will we know about the issues likely to be covered in these leaflets?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> During this afternoon's debates on schedule 2. I cannot say now when we will be publishing the draft leaflet. Certainly, either in Committee or on Report, more information will become available to parents about the applications that they can make and the subjects that can be touched on with variations. I may be able to get some more information on that later for the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 relate to cases where a regular payments condition is imposed on a non-resident parent who has made an application for a variation. The purpose is to ensure that, where there is more than one person with care to whom child maintenance is due, notifications of decisions relating to the regular payment conditions are sent to them all.
<P>
Amendment No. 8 clarifies the wording of section 28F(5) as drafted and has no material effect whatsoever.
<P>
The purpose of the group of amendments Nos. 39 to 43 is to alter the language of the Bill for consistency. They have no other material effect.
<P>
Amendment No. 38 is intended to widen the nature of the appeals to which paragraph 5(3) in part I of schedule 4A to the Child Support Act 1991 as substituted by clause 6 refers. The effect is to allow the tribunal to consider a variation application that has been referred to it for determination at the same time as it hears an appeal involving the same parties—not solely against an interim maintenance decision made under section 12(2) but against any decision relating to a revision or supersession of such a decision. As it stands, the current wording is too narrow, so we are widening the scope to enable the tribunal to achieve that. As I said, the amendments are partly for clarification, partly technical and involve a change of substance.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 4, in page 5, line 34, leave out from beginning to end of line 37.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 5.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> As I said of the previous group, both amendments are technical. Amendment No. 4 will remove subsection (6) of substituted section 28A. Unlike under the existing departures scheme, applicants will be able to apply for a variation at any time before—as well as after—the final maintenance calculation has been made.
<P>
Section 28A(6), as drafted, provides that, where an interim decision has been made, a further variation application may be made even where the interim decision is the subject of a revision or supersession application, for example, where there has subsequently been a relevant change of circumstances.
<P>
However, section 28A(3) already provides that a variation application may be made at any time before a final decision has been reached on a maintenance application. Since the revision of the interim decision will not, in itself, constitute a final decision on the maintenance application, it follows that subsection (6) is superfluous, and amendment No. 4 seeks its removal.
<P>
Amendment No. 5 clarifies how new section 28B(2)(b) is intended to operate by inserting additional wording into it.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 5, in page 6, line 7, after `11' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(apart from any information needed in relation to the application for a variation)'—[Mr. Rooker.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 128, in page 6, leave out line 9 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) that the non-resident parent could not in any event benefit from the effect of any variation which the Secretary of State might make'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a straightforward amendment and I doubt that it will cause much controversy. It takes at face value what appears in the explanatory notes and seeks to implement what the Government say that they intend on page 20. If they intend something more than what appears in the explanatory notes, we should be told about it.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Amendment No. 128 relates to the grounds on which a variation application may be rejected on preliminary study. The intended categories specified in the Bill are where there are no grounds on which a variation could be agreed and where the maintenance assessment is to be made under section 12(1)—on default maintenance decisions—due to insufficient information. The intention was to prescribe other circumstances in regulations.
<P>
The amendment would remove the general regulation-making power and replace it with a dedicated third category where the non-resident parent could not benefit from the effect of any variation. The immediate effect—I am sure that it is unintended—would be that no application by a parent with care would ever get beyond the preliminary sift stage because, self-evidently, the outcome of any such application would never benefit the non-resident parent.
<P>
More generally, however, the result of the amendment would be that the Secretary of State could not reject any application at the earliest stage unless it fell into one or more of the three specified categories. In our view, that is too restrictive and there may be other reasons why an application should fall at this first hurdle. We do not want to box ourselves into a corner at this early stage by building such a provision into primary legislation.
<P>
We cannot, as I explained, accept the terms of the amendment, but I can confirm that we intend to prescribe in the regulations cases in which the application has been made by a non-resident parent who could not in any event benefit from the effect of the variation. Similarly, we would look to reject—
