<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell), I will make a brief comment. I have considered our debates on the amendments and have studied the clause. Parts of the clause have still not been debated, so I will not rule that we will not have a stand part debate. There will be such a debate. However, I must make it clear that I will rule that hon. Members are entering tedious repetition if they start to debate to issues that have already been covered on the amendments. Hon. Members might wish to take that into account when preparing what they wish to say in the stand part debate.

<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 2, in page 1, line 19, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`; and
<P>
(d) whether in all the circumstances of the case a denial of jury trial would impinge upon the rights not only of the accused but also of the community at large to have the matter considered and adjudicated by a jury.'.—[Sir Nicholas Lyell.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): Your guidance, Mr. Maxton, is always valuable. I was concluding my remarks regarding amendment No. 2. We do not recognise when we are in danger of becoming oppressive. The Minister would not see himself as oppressive, nor would the Parliamentary Secretary. I warn them that they are making a huge jump in that direction. The amendment highlights the problem.
<P>
Lord Devlin, who referred to the jury as a safeguard against repugnant laws made his point succinctly. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The second and by far the greater purpose that is served by trial by jury is that it gives protection against laws which the ordinary man may regard as harsh and oppressive. I do not mean by that no more than it is a protection against tyranny. It is that: but it is also an insurance that the criminal law will conform to the ordinary man's idea of what is fair and just. If it does not, the jury will not be a party to its enforcement.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary jumped up when that point was made earlier. He asked me whether that meant that I thought that juries did not obey their oath. I think nothing of the sort. When one studies the list of either-way offences referred to by the Minister, one realises what a huge swathe of offences it covers and how important it is for the community at large to have its say on where the boundaries of justice should be drawn, as the amendment emphasises.
<P>
Studying the list highlights another good point raised by Government Members in their brief interventions. They have been astute in saying that magistrates can be trusted. I agree that, by and large, magistrates provide an excellent service. I have said that almost to the point of tedious repetition. Serious charges such as those concerning honesty are the most sensitive and are those about which people who have never had a criminal record feel most strongly. Such cases are very much for the jury. When one flips through the pages of either-way offences, one passes violence against the person, sexual offences, theft, handling, fraud, forgery, criminal damage and drug offences. One then reaches a series of offences—pages of them—including gaming, immigration, trade descriptions, health and safety at work, public health and environmental protection. I know from personal experience that clients are entirely happy to be tried by magistrates, who do a huge amount of this work extremely effectively. The ability of the defendant to choose the Crown court or the magistrates court gives enormous confidence in the system.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Charles Clarke):</B> I do not want to make a debating point; I rise because I genuinely do not understand one of the right hon. and learned Gentleman's arguments. I understand his comments about honesty, but does he believe that the right to choose trial by jury should be established in relation to offences that involve dishonesty, which are now tried summarily in the magistrates court and with which no such right is currently associated? Does he believe that they should become either-way offences rather than summary offences?
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister pointed out some small encroachments into the broad principle that I have enunciated. He said that criminal damage involves reputation. The example of keeping a brothel is perhaps somewhat far-fetched for most people, but I think that he managed to point out one or two activities that involved notions of honesty. He gave some examples of fraud in relation to motor vehicle licences. Such cases certainly involve questions of honesty, and I remember working on one in the divisional court. However, these are small encroachments, which the public, by and large, have come to accept. The Minister is talking about a massive encroachment. He and the Parliamentary Secretary have argued several times that all the other either-way offences should be accepted because criminal damage is accepted. That means that one goes from the 10 or so small encroachments to which the Minister referred to arguing that the whole swathe of either-way offences should be permitted. That way lies oppression.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman clarify one point, so that I do not misrepresent him? The matter with which he is concerned is the scale of encroachment and associated issues. Is he talking about small encroachments one way versus large encroachments, as he puts it, the other way, rather than about an issue of principle? Have I got that right?
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister is clever enough to know the meaning of the story of Occam's razor. Although he may be more of a philosopher than me, I think that he is, without realising it, employing the same principle: one moves by small steps and suddenly finds that the gate is locked. He argues from the particular and then suddenly we are on the general. If the courts can decide that magistrates will try all either-way offences, the Government will then say through the Lord Chancellor's Department that it is desirable for many more cases to be tried in the magistrates court. We will then find that what was repeatedly described by the Home Secretary on Second Reading as a small encroachment and a measure that involved a small number of undeserving cases will suddenly become the norm. The very argument on which the Minister is rightly trying to tease out my position will be used to say that Parliament accepted that either-way offences should be a matter for the courts' decision, which, it will be suggested, justifies extension to all offences. Massive encroachments into the jury process will therefore be made.
<P>
I return to the main point of the amendment, because, as you rightly said, Mr. Maxton, we can deal with the other winding-up points in the stand part debate. The community should have its say and magistrates should take its view into account. I shall not press the amendment to a Division, because this is not the moment for votes. However, I ask the Government to take note of the seriousness of my points. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 2, line 5, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and the accused shall have the same rights to legal aid and assistance by Solicitor and Counsel, and the same rights to advanced disclosure of evidence and unused material as he would have if the offence had been ordered to be tried on indictment.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>The amendment deals with an accused person who, having sought trial in the Crown court, finds himself tried by the magistrates court, and also with any person who is liable for trial in the magistrates court. I rather hope that the Minister will jump up and say the entitlements exist anyway. I do not see him nodding and perhaps I am out of date. My impression is that the accused is so entitled. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will confirm it.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. David Lock):</B> As I am sure the right hon. and learned Gentleman will know, legal aid is available in the magistrates court subject to an interest of justice test, exactly as in the Crown court. The only difference is the question, arising from the more extensive rights of audience in the magistrates court, whether both counsel and solicitor or solicitor only are to be engaged. Except in unusually grave or difficult cases or cases under the Extradition Act 1989, a solicitor alone would usually be involved in the magistrates court.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> That is an extremely helpful intervention, and it shows that my amendment is necessary if there is to be a change. It would obviously be difficult to persuade the court to grant legal aid for solicitor and counsel. However, if the Government have their way and if matters go no further than they have suggested, there will be contested hearings in the magistrates court of several thousand cases, all involving dishonesty—mostly theft, handling, burglary or housebreaking.
<P>
My objective, if the Bill, of which I disapprove, must be passed, is to prevent any reduction in the quality of justice overall. That is nothing to do with whether magistrates can stand back and operate with as much independence as a jury. I have covered that point already. It is to do with how cases are tried in the magistrates court. Anyone with any experience of the magistrates court, including the Parliamentary Secretary, knows that a two-day case there is a bit of a nightmare. Such trials are extremely rare and are very difficult for magistrates. I see that the experienced chairman of magistrates, the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (Mr. Taylor), is in his place and I expect that he will confirm—or, if not, perhaps he will give us the benefit of his experience—that a second day in a magistrates court is difficult for the court itself.
<P>
A research paper by Miss Colette Chester, based on work done earlier this year in London, shows that whereas there is a five-week delay in bringing a two-day contested case in the Crown court, one must expect a 21-week delay in the magistrates court. Plainly, one hopes that such delays would not happen under the Bill, but that would require reorganisation of the magistrates court. I agree with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) in an intervention this morning about the difficulty of trying those cases in which there may sometimes be a voir dire—an altercation in the absence of the jury to decide whether evidence should be admissible. That is a frequent occurrence, I have experienced a significant number when sitting as a recorder. The problem then arises that magistrates who have had to hear a lot of background material, to decide whether to admit certain evidence, must put it out of their mind.
<P>
The process takes time. Furthermore, a good deal of practical court experience is needed to handle it, but it is not the type of experience that most court solicitors gain. The youngish counsel who attend to such cases in the Crown court do them day in, day out. The Crown court is used to them and the system works well. For example, if a jury is out deciding a case, the Crown court does not wait for it to return before starting the next case. The court moves on straight away and interrupts the next case when the jury is ready to give its verdict. The Crown court system is very efficient.
<P>
I shall deal with costings in the clause stand part debate. At this stage, I want the Government to recognise that the quality of defence available in magistrates courts, though not negligible, is not equal to that in the Crown court.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): I want to make one specific point that relates to the Government's justification for the Bill. The argument, which I hope to demonstrate is flawed and outdated, is that many people who plead not guilty in the lower court and elect to go to the Crown court, change their plea. It is commonly agreed that there are two main reasons for that. First, the prosecution has time to reveal its hand. It nearly always produces more evidence subsequent to the committal. I cannot recall more than the odd time when there was no additional evidence, other than in the simplest cases. Secondly, the process of testing the case and examining the evidence is more substantial.
<P>
When the Crown Prosecution Service was established, it was envisaged that it would do its work, review cases and hand them over to a prosecutor, who would be one of its people or independently engaged. There would be a debate about whether the two tests had been met and a decision would be taken to proceed. However, there is often pressure to get that stage of the proceedings out of the way so that a case is seen to be making progress. Magistrates are rightly concerned that cases should not drift. If there is an adjournment for the prosecution to get the evidence together, they are keen for the case to be put off for only one month, rather than six. The CPS and the prosecution scramble to get the evidence together, which is often just over the 50 per cent. needed to get them past the threshold. There is usually a lot of work still to do.
<P>
My most recent example of that was a murder case at the Old Bailey last year. Someone was killed in my constituency and there was a committal on the basis of certain evidence, although more was served later. One reason why the evidence was served as late as possible was to protect the witnesses. It is not at all uncommon to add the details of evidence later in the day. The police and prosecuting authorities had an interest in revealing enough to get the case up to the Old Bailey, but, for witness protection reasons, not everything.
<P>
There are many reasons why evidence comes late in the day. In spite of the hearings for procedures and timetables, the prosecution often waits to within about a week of the hearing of the trial before revealing the full hand. Often only at that stage do the defendant's advisers form a view on how the defendant should plead and they often know all along that more evidence will probably or definitely be served.
<P>
The amendment makes the point that, if the system is to be changed—and the change is opposed by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire and myself—the same rules should apply to advance disclosure of evidence. If that were the case, I have no doubt that the number of people who plead not guilty in the lower court and then plead guilty when the case comes to trial would be changed significantly. The Government argue that one of the mischiefs that they are trying to remedy is abuse of the system by the defendant. I reject that argument in any case, but it would certainly not hold if there was parity in the rules of disclosure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I wonder if the hon. Gentleman is aware of the effect of the case of R v. Kingston-upon-Hull, ex parte McCann. That is an important case on disclosure in summary trials that has led the Director of Public Prosecutions to adopt the position that disclosure should be made in all circumstances except when there is an entirely proper reason for not doing so. That is in line with the situation in the Crown court.
<P>
On unused material, is the hon. Gentleman aware that the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 applies in the same way to summary trials as to either-way trials, so the combination of case law and statute now provides that there is no material difference in pre-trial disclosure in either venue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I was aware of the second point and of the principle of the first, although I did not have the name of the case in my head. However, as the Parliamentary Secretary will be aware, that does not come to the same thing in practice. A not guilty plea and an election for trial in the magistrates court will lead to a full trial, with all the potential disadvantages to which I have referred. The case is likely to go part heard because it is difficult to get the same court together for two consecutive days, unless there is a stipendiary magistrate, so it is put back for a week or a month. If there is to be a trial, the same disclosure will have taken place by a week before the trial date as would have taken place in the Crown court.
<P>
That is not necessarily the end of the matter, because if someone elects trial in the Crown court, by definition, there is no trial in the lower court, and the time lapse allows for other evidence to be introduced. That could be evidence that might not have been thought necessary or that, on further consideration, is thought to strengthen the prosecution's case, or evidence that simply was not previously available. The Minister referred to the slip rule, which relates to the fact that there are sometimes proper reasons why disclosure is made late. I gave an example of a case in which evidence was held back until the latest possible moment, in the interests of the witnesses and other parties, with the compliance of the judge.
<P>
I support the proposition that if this or any successive Government are to take away a great swathe of rights from defendants, they should guarantee exactly the same rights for all defendants and ensure that there will be no disadvantage, in terms of serving evidence and timetabling, as a consequence of the loss of jury trial. That is the point raised in the amendment, which I support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): I think that it is the Government's case that people receive a trial in the magistrates courts that is just as good, comprehensive and fair as it would be in the Crown court. Does not that argument lead inexorably to the conclusion that one's representation in the magistrates court should be of as high a calibre as it would be in the Crown court? Does not it suggest that, under legal aid procedures, one should be entitled to be represented by solicitor and barrister—in other words, by trained courtroom advocates?
<P>
The Government may answer that such rights are unnecessary because the procedures of the magistrates courts are very different from those of the Crown court. They may also point out that it has traditionally not been deemed necessary to use barristers in the magistrates court, as its procedures are quicker and simpler. However, does not that argument suggest that one might receive trial and representation in the magistrates court that are not as good as in the Crown court?
<P>
If the Government persist in their argument that magistrates courts procedures are not a fast track or an inferior option, but are equal to the level of justice achieved in the Crown court, they must accept the logic of the amendment. People who are tried in magistrates courts are entitled to representation that is at least as good as that which they would have received in the Crown court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire has once again done the Committee considerable service by tabling the amendment. On listening to him, to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) and to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes), I reflected on how sad it was that some of the Labour Members who spoke and intervened on Second Reading were not present in the Committee. It is perhaps a matter that will remain forever shrouded in mystery.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Hall (Weaver Vale):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. They were asked, but they did not volunteer.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order, but I take the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I do not know whether the comment made by the Government Whip applies to every single Labour Member who intervened or spoke in a less than helpful manner on Second Reading. In particular, I recall the speech made by the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) and interventions made by the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Simpson), as well as the speech made by the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Mr. Best). They all spoke about what happens in practice in court and the protection that people need through legal representation.
<P>
Furthermore, many pertinent points on the No. 1 version of the Bill were made in the other place, by those with practical experience at the sharp end of the courts. I speak not only of Lord Thomas of Gresford, but of Lord Taylor of Warwick, with whom I practised at the Bar in the west midlands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> On the intervention made by the Government Whip, is not it a fiction that hon. Members volunteer for Committees such as this one? Are not we all pressed men and ladies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I think, Mr. Maxton, that you would probably rule me out of order if I answered my hon. Friend's rhetorical question. He made his point adequately.
<P>
I want especially to remind the Ministers of what was said on Second Reading by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins), a very experienced solicitor recorder. His remarks touched precisely on the issues raised by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire in the amendment, which deals with the need for defendants to have proper advice and representation and with what may be required in the appeal mechanisms that the Government propose.
<P>
My hon. Friend spoke about how the appeal procedures would work. He said that he had assumed that the normal rules of the magistrates court would apply and pointed out that there had always been 21 days for appeal, probably with a hearing 21 days later. He went on to say that he understood from discussions with my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) that it was envisaged that appeals might go through in 48 hours. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Home Secretary must get real. It would be nonsense for him to go to a magistrates court or a Crown court and to try to get an appeal through in 24 or 48 hours. Ten to one, the prosecutor in the magistrates court would be an agent, who would push off immediately after the hearing and take a fortnight to return the papers to the Crown Prosecution Service.
<P>
Who would draft such an appeal? What about the defence lawyer?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That point related to legal advice and representation from the defence, to which the amendment is directed. My hon. Friend continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If it is intended to conclude the appeal within 48 hours, why is there no provision for that in the Bill? Why is there no mention of it in the explanatory notes? Furthermore, will it not be a sham if the appeal is merely carried out by paperwork? A worthwhile appeal must have an oral hearing . . . Any appeal judge would look at the bits of paper and say: ``I want to hear the advocate on this matter.'' It cannot be done in 48 hours; it is nonsense to believe that that could occur.—[Official Report, 7 March 2000; Vol. 345, c. 932.]<P>

<P>
In practice, there is great concern that the Government are trying to speed up the procedure far too much. That is why Opposition Members have expressed genuine fears. We are gravely troubled that the Government are not many steps away from tyranny. They are producing exactly the legislation that Sir William Blackstone and Sir Patrick Devlin, as he then was, warned about. They warned that a future Government might go further and take additional powers. As the Minister conceded before we adjourned for lunch, the Government were chipping away—to use my words—at the historic right to trial at every step. The amendment probes the Government on the genuine concerns that we feel that the chipping away at an historic constitutional protection is a seriously worrying development, for all the reasons that Lord Devlin and many others have set out.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I want to correct the record. I did not accept the phrase ``chipping away''. I sought to clarify the hon. Gentleman's remark and to put it on the record. I did not accept that we were chipping away at historic rights of criminal trial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> My recollection of the exchange, as Hansard will no doubt show in due course, was that I used that phrase when the Minister was speaking. He conceded that it was proper for us to debate whether the Government were chipping away. Whether or not one accepts the phrase, the fact remains that the purpose of the Bill is to restrict the right to trial by jury. It will take out a large category of offences that had previously carried the right to elect trial by jury and replace it with court decision. We say that that is constitutionally worrying.
<P>
It is especially important to draw the matter to the attention of everyone who might read the proceedings, including those who might study them in another place when deciding whether the Bill is, as we have suggested, even worse than the No. 1 Bill. They should consider in particular whether there are sufficient safeguards for the protection of defendants. We do not think that there are, so my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire has once again done the Committee a service by raising the issue. It is essential that we signal that there is so much wrong with the principle of the Bill, and not least on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> The debate has been short but interesting and illuminating. The effect of the amendments would be that any either-way offence, no matter whether it would previously have been considered in the magistrates court or whether it would have gone on to the Crown court on indictment, would henceforth be treated for the purposes of representation, legal aid and advance disclosure as if it was a trial in the Crown court. For practical purposes, that would attract the benefit of solicitor and counsel.
<P>
As I mentioned in my intervention on the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, the effects of the case of R v. Kingston-upon-Hull, ex parte McCann, with the statement of principle affirmed by the Director of Public Prosecutions as a result of the case, leave the position for advance disclosure more or less identical in summary trials as it is in trials on indictment. The 1996 Act makes no difference with regard to unused material, so the rules are the same.
<P>
Of course there will be differences in practice. If a trial happens reasonably quickly in a magistrates court, evidence that the prosecution might have wanted to adduce had it had six, eight or 10 weeks to try the matter in the Crown court, will not come to light. The thrust of the Opposition's argument is to protect the rights of the defence, but that would restrict the prosecution to the evidence that it had at the beginning of the trial.
<P>
The main issue is defence representation by counsel or solicitors. There are several principles involved. The first is that a proper defence is important. The Government believe that. We have brought the European convention on human rights into domestic law. It covers the right to a fair trial, which includes an element of having a proper defence. That right will be in British law for the first time from October, when it will be exercisable in our courts before our judges. That demonstrates our commitment to human rights and to providing a proper defence.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am sure that the Minister would not wish to overstate the benefits of incorporating the European convention into our law. It in no way protects our right to jury trial, which is not known on the continent. Jury trial is substantially unique to England and Wales. It happens in Scotland in slightly more limited circumstances and in those jurisdictions in the United States that follow our system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am grateful for that intervention. The right hon. and learned Gentleman is correct. The convention does not preserve the right to a jury trial in any particular case. It guarantees the right to a fair trial, which must be determined by each state, according to its local traditions.
<P>
The second principle is that the level of expertise of defence that is appropriate to a case should be proportionate to its gravity. That principle has operated in this country for a long time. We do not have leading counsel for every case in the Crown court or very experienced juniors for every case in the magistrates court. There is a level of expertise for the defence that is appropriate to the seriousness of the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Of course, that is correct, but minor cases, such as shoplifting, can go to the Crown court, where they are taken by barristers. If solicitors are any good, they sit behind the barristers—often, however, they are not there because they are not very good. If a defendant stays in the magistrates court, he gets stuck with a solicitor. A defendant goes upstairs to get a trained barrister; it has nothing to do with the seriousness of the case. That is the basis of our argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am grateful for that intervention because it brings me to my point about the allocation of defence representation. If we stick to the principle that the level of expertise should be proportionate to the gravity of the case, it must also be right that when the offence is examined, its classification is only to a very small degree determinative of the seriousness of the case. A minor shoplifting case for an individual with many previous convictions will attract the benefit of full counsel and solicitor, but a person with no previous convictions who is alleged to have assaulted a police officer—a serious matter—is tried summarily in the magistrates court and will attract only a solicitor. That is illogical and is not in accordance with the principle that the hon. Member for Gainsborough accepted. We must ensure that the public money expended and the defence provided is proportionate to the seriousness of the case.
<P>
The amendment would allow every either-way offence, however trivial, to attract the panoply of solicitor and counsel. It does not consider whether current legislation would provide solicitor and counsel in a magistrates court, whether the case would be tried today in a magistrates court or a Crown court, or whether it is better to try the case in a magistrates court or a Crown court. The public purse would provide solicitor and counsel purely on the basis of the classification of the offence, rather than its seriousness.
<P>
The better approach is to consider the seriousness of the case to be tried in the magistrates court, then decide, as we do now, whether more than just a solicitor is required. Normally such offences attract only a solicitor. Those solicitors appear in the magistrates court day after day and are experts in that jurisdiction. They know the venue and the magistrates, and they provide good representation. Obviously, counsel is allowed if the circumstances are unusually grave or difficult. The same rules for determining a serious assault on a police officer in a magistrates court will apply to a shoplifting case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I shall pursue the Parliamentary Secretary's response to the intervention made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough. From his professional experience, the Parliamentary Secretary knows that if a defendant needs counsel because of the circumstances of the offence or the offender—that links to an earlier debate—leading counsel may appear in the magistrates court. That might happen in a particularly important case. I will give one example, which the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) quoted on 7 March 2000 at column 921. He described the real case of a respected teacher who had taught for 30 years and who faced an allegation of indecent assault on the basis of one pupil's uncorroborated evidence. If such a case were tried summarily, that teacher and his trade union might regard it as necessary to secure leading counsel as well as junior counsel. Does not the Parliamentary Secretary agree that everyone needs the fairness of equal representation in such serious cases?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am grateful for that intervention, which shows why the mode of trial guidelines issued by the Lord Chief Justice are at the core of the debate. As my hon. Friend the Minister said, the guidelines include provision for cases in which the victim is particularly vulnerable and for cases that have professional hallmarks or involve a breach of trust. Those factors may be relevant to the type of case that the hon. Gentleman described. Such offences are serious, so under the mode of trial guidelines, they could go to trial on indictment.
<P>
However, if an offence is not sufficiently serious, it will not fall within the scope of the mode of trial guidelines, which require the magistrate to consider whether a case is appropriate for trial on indictment. If a circuit judge agrees with the magistrate and the Legal Services Commission considers that the case is not unusually grave or difficult in the magistrates court, solicitor representation will be appropriate. By applying the right tests and following the right processes, a decision will be reached about whether the level of representation is appropriate for the seriousness of the offence. The debate has shown that there is little or no link between the seriousness of the offence and its classification. An offence that is classified as an either-way offence might not be serious. We must separate the two elements.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Can the Parliamentary Secretary test his argument on the following shoplifting case? Two people walk out with sweaters from Marks and Spencer: one is a bank worker who will get a criminal record for the first time and the other is a regular shoplifter with nine previous convictions. Where will each be tried under the mode of trial guidelines and what representation will each receive?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am grateful for the chance to answer that as it makes the precise point. If one works from the assumption that both those individuals will get a fair trial in front of the magistrates, the appropriate level of representation is that which is appropriate to the magistrates. I personally would not hesitate to choose trial by magistrates. I trust them. They do a good job. I do not accept, as a number of hon. Members suggested, that one gets second-class justice in a magistrates court, even on an offence of dishonesty.
<P>
On the question of the proper level of representation to ensure that matters are properly ventilated in the courts and the magistrates' minds are directed to the right issues, a solicitor with 20 years' experience, who appears day after day before magistrates, and can argue whether there was any intention permanently to deprive, is likely to provide a better defence than a white wig junior barrister six months out of his pupillage doing one of his first trials, who might argue that the monetary value of the goods lifted was extremely low. I do not think that it is as cut and dried as the right hon. and learned Gentleman suggests. We must recognise that the expenditure of public money on a defence must be measured against the seriousness of the offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> In practice, much of what the Parliamentary Secretary has just said gives the game away about what really drives the Government on this Bill. For the first time, he argues on the basis that it will save taxpayers money. We have argued on Second Reading and in the other place on the first Bill that the whole measure is Treasury driven. This is not about the quality of justice. If the Minister's argument is right, why would the teaching trade unions wish to have their members' previous good character represented by counsel and to advise them to plead not guilt and elect for trial by jury?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am terribly sorry, but that argument simply does not add up. The logical position adopted by the hon. Gentleman is that for every offence, however trivial, in any circumstances, one will always be represented by the best leading counsel. That cannot be the right way of deploying our defence services. I started with the proposition earlier that the level and expertise of defence representation should be proportionate to the gravity of the case. At that point, when the full consequences of the argument had not been thought through, I noticed Opposition Members nodding. That is the issue: whether we are correct to say that the level of representation, be it solicitor, counsel or leading counsel, is appropriate to the seriousness of the offence, not just the accidental classification of whether it is an either-way or a summary-only offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Does that not lead to the conclusion that we should have all these issues looked at by Lord Justice Auld and his committee? The logical system to have is one that assesses which offences are by their nature serious, which offences are serious, although they might not appear so on the face of it, and what representation there should be. A criminal justice system that could adjudicate whether an offence was serious and therefore went through the appropriate process would be entirely reasonable. One could look at legal aid, advice and representation and place of trial all together. The Government are not considering any of that together.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I understand that approach. It has some attractions,but one can never judge the seriousness of an offence by its classification. The offence of theft covers everything from the minor shoplift to Brinks-Mat. The offence of burglary can cover anything from a small, semi-accidental intrusion into a property to the most serious burglaries. It is not the technical offence that determines the seriousness, but the heinousness of the behaviour. The Bill allows magistrates to look at what the offence is before deciding the appropriate venue. It must be logical that, in determining the proper level of representation that the Legal Services Commission should invest in the proper defence of a case, it should also be guided by the seriousness of the offence.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I will give way for the last time.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary, but this is the Committee stage of an extraordinarily important Bill, so I hope he will be generous. Could he answer at least the first part and then perhaps the second part of my earlier questions? Take the bank of official whose whole career is now on the line for his first offence. Under the mode of trial guidelines, will that young man be tried in the magistrates court or in the Crown court, and if in the former, will he get the local solicitor of will he be entitled to counsel?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am cautious about straying into areas that are the proper preserve of the courts.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> May I finish? It will be for the courts to decide on the facts of the case whether it is sufficiently serious. Given the nature of the case and the circumstances of the offence, they will apply the mode of trial guidelines to decide whether the case is appropriate for trial in the Crown court or before magistrates. The second issue, which is separate, concerns the level of defence representation that is appropriate to the seriousness of the case. The same rules will apply to the theft of the sweater from Marks and Spencer as would apply if the same individual were charged with the alleged assault of a police office outside a public house on a Friday night.
<P>
I suspect that both offences would lead to much the same career consequences. Both offences would be seen by the individual as being serious and both would qualify, if the magistrates decided that the theft should be kept in the magistrates court, for counsel, if the issues in the case were unusually grave or difficult. If the issues are not unusually grave or difficult and the matter is in a magistrates court, it must be appropriate for the individual who faces the serious charge of theft to have the same level of representation as the individual who is alleged to have assaulted a police officer. We must consider the seriousness of the offence, not its classification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I want to return to the Parliamentary Secretary's answer to an earlier intervention, because he once again gave away the mindset that leads to this approach by the Government and their advisers. The Parliamentary Secretary said: ``We must consider what our defence services provide.'' I ask him to remember that it is not a case of the Government having a defence service. Of course, taxpayers' money is spent on legal aid, but we are discussing the rights of the individual citizen. Does the Parliamentary Secretary accept that that reflects the difference between the two sides of the Committee? The Government are taking a proprietorial stance: it is their responsibility to control their defence services. However, Opposition Members are standing up for the rights of the citizen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I have rarely heard such nonsense. The Legal Services Commission is responsible for commissioning appropriate defence services in each case. As part of the commissioning process, it determines—as it did under the Government supported by the hon. Gentleman—whether it is appropriate to have leading counsel in the Crown court. The commission determines the level of defence support in each case.
<P>
In this case, we are concerned merely with the commissioning of defence services, so that the right support is available, the issues are heard and the defendant can have a fair trial. The amendment would introduce a wholly artificial system, whereby anyone accused of an either-way offence would automatically have counsel and a solicitor for all offences, whether the case was tried in a magistrates court or a Crown court, or whether the case, under current law, would attract only a solicitor or, being unusually grave or difficult, counsel in the magistrates court.
<P>
That would mean a massive extension of the legal aid bill and is a further example of Opposition Members' willingness to move amendments that involve massive extra public expenditure, while saying that they want to restrict tax rises. We must ensure that we use the substantial sums available for legal aid in the most logical, sensible and appropriate manner, so that they deliver the maximum amount of justice.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I remind the Parliamentary Secretary that this is a probing amendment, and I hope that he will kindly give a straight answer to my question. Must the young man whom I mentioned, who has a clean record and who will lose his job and have his career ruined, be tried in a magistrates court? Must the local solicitor represent him, or will he have counsel and be entitled to go to the Crown court? The Parliamentary Secretary is not interfering with the powers of the courts, but answering questions about the effects of the proposed legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I have explained twice the tests that the court would have to apply, given the circumstances of the case before it. It is for the court to make the decision. Whether those tests are right and appropriate is a matter for the Committee, but human circumstances vary from case to case. It is impossible to mention a tiny portion of a case and ask what the answer would be, because it depends on a wide variety of circumstances. We must compare the case with equally serious matters, such as the assault of a police officer. The right hon. and learned Gentleman appears content with no right to trial by jury and no right to defence counsel in such a case, even though the consequences for his banker would be exactly the same. Asking a hypothetical question with a tiny portion of the facts does not greatly assist the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Will the Parliamentary Secretary forgive me if I say that he was being slightly disingenuous in dealing with the amendment? He implied that if the amendment were agreed—and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire has already said that it is only a probing amendment—all trials currently heard in magistrates courts would be attended by a solicitor and a barrister, which would result in a huge increase in public spending, thus rendering the amendment absurd.
<P>
However, I am not saying that all the small cases currently tried in magistrates courts should have a solicitor and a barrister, but that in cases that currently go up to the Crown court, defendants should feel that their representation in the magistrates court is as good as it would have been in the Crown court. The Government could reject our amendment, but table their own amendment to ensure that that happens.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The second part of the Parliamentary Secretary's argument was that the present system is illogical and that the seriousness of each offence should be judged to establish whether a barrister is required. He argued that it was illogical for a shoplifting case tried in the Crown court to have a barrister, when the same offence in the magistrates court does not. In fairness, there is a degree of illogicality, but many of our procedures—in Parliament, traditions and the law—are illogical, because they are intended to protect the individual. Traditionally, they provide a high standard of defence. The present system may be illogical, but the Parliamentary Secretary must accept that the individual who goes to the Crown court receives a higher standard of representation. If the Bill is passed, that person will, ipso facto, receive a lower standard of representation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lock indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary is shaking his head, but that must be the case. At a critical time in his career, the banker mentioned by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire is entitled to his barrister and his day in the Crown court, however trivial his offence—the alleged theft of a jumper. When the Bill becomes an Act, he will no longer be so entitled.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary must try to answer the crucial question. It is surely absurd that, when faced with two characters—the person with a string of nine convictions for shoplifting who has walked out of a shop with a sweater, and the bank official with no convictions—the magistrates are not entitled to take those facts into consideration. What are they allowed to consider? Are they allowed to consider only that this is a sweater and that it has been taken from a shop? They are allowed no other considerations whatever. That surely is absurd.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> It is even worse than my hon. Friend suggests. The Parliamentary Secretary has bolstered himself with, or hidden behind, all the other pieces of judicial officialdom, which can be beneficial, but may fall short. For example, mode of trial guidelines, the level of representation and the Legal Services Commission are relevant. The outcome, however, of all such guidelines from high-placed bodies still seems to be, ``You will have the local solicitor, like or lump it''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is a very good point. In many market towns, the local solicitor represents the local criminal classes in the local magistrates courts. As I know from experience, the same person often appears before the magistrates again and again, and magistrates sometimes develop a jaundiced view of local solicitors who represent the local criminal classes. A chap with a white wig who is just out of pupillage may sometimes be in the Crown court, but it has 12 good men and ladies with a completely fresh view of the counsel in the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> All solicitors under contract to the Legal Services Commission who will represent a client will be quality marked from this October, which was not the case before. The solicitor will be an expert in criminal law. Quality systems for quality approval are not yet fixed for barristers, who are not therefore quality marked. The notion that representation by a solicitor is automatically worse than that by a barrister might be viewed by members of the Law Society as a cosy barrister conspiracy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I was not saying that. A solicitor with 20 years' experience of appearing in a local magistrates court in a small market town might well do a better job of defence and representation than a young barrister with only two or three years of experience at the bar who is working in a county town. I was not criticising solicitors generally, but arguing that a germ of prejudice sometimes develops among magistrates against particular local solicitors—despite their best efforts—whose job is to stand before the magistrates and represent the local criminal classes time and again. They often put forward pleas in mitigation that, frankly, tell a tall story.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary has not replied to my earlier crucial question, which I shall repeat. If trials in magistrates courts are as good as those in Crown courts, should not people be entitled to as good and comprehensive legal representation in magistrates courts as they would have enjoyed for the same offence under the present system in Crown courts?
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> For good representation in magistrates courts, it is important that an independent judge does not decide the law. The magistrates clerk advises lay magistrates in private on the law. When the Human Rights Act 1998 comes into force later this year, private advice to magistrates from justices' clerks, which in many cases requires better lawyers in the magistrates courts than in the higher courts, may no longer be admissible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I do not want to stray too far, except to say that voir dire—I prefer the phrase ``the trial within the trial''—works well in the Crown court. It is all up front and in public with the defendant present with his counsel and the judge having to listen to legal representations made on both sides. The judge then has to provide his reasons in public. The much more ``in private'' system hitherto enjoyed or suffered from—in magistrates courts is unsatisfactory. The point is not central to the amendment, but I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will reply more fully to our arguments than he has done hitherto.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> We are coming back to the amendment. I shall not press it to a vote, as I have already said that it is a probing amendment. If properly read, the amendment does not suggest that everyone in magistrates courts should have the same representation as in the Crown courts. It applies rather to cases in which a defendant has sought to go to the Crown court, but has been told that he must go to the magistrates court. Proposed new section 20(2) of the Magistrates' Court Act 1980 reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where the court decides that the offence ought to be tried summarily then, subject to the outcome of any appeal under subsection (4) below, the accused shall be tried summarily—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and it is only in those circumstances that the same representation should apply. We are talking about a few thousand cases a year and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will clarify his best estimate today. On the basis of his recent parliamentary answers to me, it could be fewer than 3,000. I am asking not to breach the floodgates but to have fairness in such circumstances.
<P>
The amendment's purpose is to tease out what will happen in practice when a defendant must go to the magistrates court. I will expand on that during the stand part debate. The Parliamentary Secretary was coy in trying not to answer my questions about what would happen to the young bank official and the recidivist shoplifter. However, from what he said, I think that I correctly divine that both would go to the magistrates court and be represented by the local solicitor. If he meant anything other than that, he has managed to be too obscure for me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I did not say that at all. I described the tests that magistrates will apply before reaching a decision on the facts of the case. If the case were kept in the magistrates court, the Legal Services Commission would follow tests to decide whether the use of counsel in the summary trial was appropriate. It all depends on the facts of the case.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> With respect to the Parliamentary Secretary, that answer was equally unenlightening. I can put that more kindly—it was equally enlightening.
<P>
I suspect that any cost savings from equivalent representation will be minimal and that lesser representation will significantly reduce the quality of justice, although my suspicion has nothing to do with my view on the quality of magistrates.
<P>
In case there is any doubt, I was not criticising solicitors when I referred to the local solicitor. Some brilliant experienced trial advocates are solicitors. I endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough said: in some circumstances, it can be wisest for someone seeking representation in the magistrates court to approach experienced local practising solicitors. They understand their bench and handle the magistrates beautifully. Mr. Victor Lissack, who used to appear in Bow street, was probably one of the most skilful magistrates court advocates that I have ever heard. He was concise and effective. His son is now a leading silk at the criminal Bar.
<P>
However, by and large, solicitors cannot have the same experience of trial work as barristers who appear regularly in the Crown court. In the hope of removing any stigma from that, I will draw on my own experience as a Law Officer. I was a regular court practitioner until I became Solicitor-General. During my 10 years as Solicitor-General and then Attorney-General, I was involved in several major cases. However, it would have been absurd for me to describe myself at the end of those 10 years as being as experienced a court advocate as my contemporaries who had continued to do court work day in, day out. Sometimes, I described myself as being similar to the senior partner of the largest firm of solicitors in the country—the one marked exception being the salary.
<P>
It is important for justice that people can be defended by an experienced advocate in the cases under discussion, which may not currently be heard in the magistrates court, and which will last for more than a few hours.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman wish to withdraw the amendment?
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Yes, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee of the strictures that I issued at the beginning of the sitting.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am sorry that the Committee has heard from me a lot, but I cannot be here for the next sitting, so I would be grateful if I could make my concluding remarks on the clause now. I shall question the supposed cost savings that drive the Bill. It is perfectly clear that one of the Government's principal objectives in introducing the Bill is to save £120 million a year. Anyone who doubts that need only read the third paragraph of the Home Secretary's speech on Second Reading, which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Bill is justified in its own right, but it will produce considerable savings of more than £120 million a year, representing resources which could, and will, be better used elsewhere in the criminal justice system.—[Official Report, 7 March 2000; Vol. 345, c. 886.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have already made it abundantly clear that the Bill is gravely mistaken in principle, but the point that I want to make under clause stand part is that it will not produce those savings. In so far as the Bill does make any savings, which will largely consist of saved prison costs, it raises more questions than it answers.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The savings that the Bill will produce have at long last been pinned down in answers by the Minister of State to a number of detailed parliamentary questions, including mine. He made it clear that £84 million of the £120 million savings has nothing to do with court costs. It is related to the fact that sentences for those who have been convicted in the magistrates court are on average substantially lower than those in the Crown court. The answer says that the Government, in working out their costings, have assumed that those sentenced after conviction in the magistrates court will serve 3.6 months, whereas the same people, had they been tried and sentenced in the Crown court, would serve 10.9 months on average, and that that gives rise to a saving of £84 million.
<P>
That highlights other fundamental flaws in the Bill, including the flaw that I pointed out through amendment No. 1: the court cannot take into account a defendant's reputation and any previous convictions. If the average sentences for those who will be tried in the magistrates court, rather than in the Crown court, as a result of the Bill, are of 10.9 months, those offenders obviously have a substantial number of previous convictions. The same parliamentary answer made it clear that that was posited on the basis of a theft-handling case. I think that it is fair to say that, in such a case, no one who is tried in the magistrates court on a first offence is remotely likely to go to prison. All the sentencing guidelines and all the habits of the magistrates court would be against that.
<P>
If offenders have a sufficiently high number of criminal offences to serve 10.9 months, will they not be sent up by the magistrates anyway once they have been convicted, because the magistrates find that they have insufficient powers of sentence? If those offenders are sent up, where will the savings come from? It must be assumed—this is the illogicality that I asked the Minister to explain—that certain defendants who merit only 3.6 months imprisonment are being wrongly imprisoned by the Crown court, which, I should remind Committee members, is subject to supervision by the Court of Appeal, for 11 months—about three times the appropriate time. However, I do not think that that is what is happening. Rather, the Minister's figures appear to be, let us say haywire. For a moment, I struggled to find a suitable word—other suitable ones would not have been parliamentary. The Minister with responsibility for the background work seems not to have thought the matter through.
<P>
The Home Secretary's intentions in respect of certain repeat offenders were made clear in his speech on Second Reading. He stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It cannot be right that we continue to allow repeat offenders with strings of previous convictions to demand full Crown court trials for trivial offences that can and should be heard in magistrates courts.—[Official Report, 7 March 2000; Vol. 345, c. 888.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He repeated that point several times in the course of his speech. A repeat offender who receives an average sentence of nearly 11 months will now be sent back to a magistrates court. How does that constitute justice and protection of the public? One would expect the public to be protected from someone who repeatedly commits offences such as thieving, burgling or affray—or even all three—by the passing of an appropriate sentence and imprisonment for a significant period. However, if such a person appears before the magistrates court, he will be released after only three and a half months. I cannot believe that the magistrate will fail to recognise that illogicality. There is a circular argument in the Minister's thesis that leads to error.
<P>
The Home Secretary has talked about those who deliberately delay their case by pleading not guilty in the magistrates court, and changing their plea to guilty at the door of the court, as the Home Secretary put it. How many such people are there? The answer is: 10 per cent. of the 14,000 who are currently seeking Crown court trial. I have here a copy of an answer from the Minister—I do not think that I have misunderstood it—in which he makes a number of assumptions. The late guilty plea rate is 10 per cent., and the timeless guilty plea rate is 80 per cent. The remaining 10 per cent. plead not guilty, and are presumably tried. Therefore, the total number tried is 10 per cent. of 14,000, which is 1,400 people.
<P>
Our rights are being invaded to prevent 1,400 trials a year. That is what the provision amounts to. I am unsure whether it is the prevention of those 1,400 trials that will lead to savings of £120 million. That would appear to be the case, but the Minister will doubtless explain his answers a little more fully. Such cases are the only ones that involve abuse, although one might say that the 10 per cent. of late guilty pleas involve some abuse, in that such people will be sentenced without a trial in a Crown court.
<P>
A small additional expense will be involved. The Bill will, in effect, affect 20 per cent. of 14,000 people—that is, 2,800 people—which, I submit, shows how flimsy is the case for ending so fundamental a right.
<P>
I shall conclude by briefly placing on record various points that outside bodies have put to us. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath rightly pointed out that Justice, the Commission for Racial Equality, the Legal Action Group, the Law Society and the Bar Council have strongly defended their view that the Bill is deeply misguided. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) rightly said that the Government's approach is not a manifesto commitment. Lord Justice Auld's committee will examine the position in the round.
<P>
The Commission for Racial Equality and Professor Lee Bridges, who is a respected academic—we have all been provided with examples of his work—point out that the Bill's provisions raise real disquiet among the black community about the fairness of trials of members of that community.
<P>
In the view of the former Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham, who was Lord Chief Justice until this morning and who is now the senior Law Lord, the Bill is flawed because, rather than giving magistrates the widest possible discretion, it will deeply and illogically fetter their discretion. That flaw led Professor Michael Zander, who was a member of the Runciman commission and who used to be a strong supporter of the Bill, to withdraw his support. He categorically stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Obviously, the report of the Runciman Royal Commission can no longer be cited in support of the Mark 2 Bill, since the Commission placed great emphasis on the view that access to jury trial was important for cases involving potential loss of reputation. (``Jury trial has long been regarded as appropriate for cases involving that issue'' . . .).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is a profound belief in jury trial as the fairest system for serious criminal cases. A case that could ruin someone's reputation or result in him losing his livelihood is serious, and the court should have the right to take that into account when deciding where he should be tried.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are dealing with a total of 64,000 cases. There are 46,000 either-way cases which are directed to the Crown court by magistrates, and 18,000 cases in which there was an election for the Crown court—the Government base their figures on 14,000 of those cases. As I said, only 10 per cent. of those cases amount to assumed late guilty pleas, and another 10 per cent. involve trials. I forget the exact proportion of trials that lead to acquittal, but the figures are significant. The Government's suggestion that those people should not be entitled to trial—if that is their suggestion—is unfair.
<P>
The suggestion that there will be swifter and more effective trials in magistrates courts is also mistaken. The shifting of those cases means that magistrates will have to try a significant, but not a huge, number of two and three-day cases, which they are singularly ill equipped to do. There is a real danger that people will be under-represented—the Minister's response in our previous debate appeared to confirm that. Most of the savings are based on differential prison sentences, the logic of which completely escapes me, but they are largely illusory. For those reasons, the clause should not stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): The stand part debate involves several questions that the Government have not directly answered. The answers to those questions lie at the heart of why Liberal Democrat Members, and some Labour Members, disagree with the Bill.
<P>
I assume that the Government accept—because that is what the statistics in the digest suggest—that the vast majority of people who end up before the Crown courts of England and Wales do so either because they choose to go there or because the law requires them to. Very few people exercise the right to go to the Crown court for trial. Of those with the right to do so, the ballpark figure is about one in 25. That is not a huge proportion of people from which we can draw conclusions about whether they are using or abusing the system, to use the Government's phrase.
<P>
Most people who choose to go to Crown court do so because they believe that the process gives greater confidence and, if they are innocent, gives them the best chance of acquittal. It separates the adjudication of fact from the evaluation of the law and constitutes—to use my preferred phrase—a trial within a trial, in which the people who decide the facts are not prejudiced by hearing in advance any details of the case that might influence their eventual decision.
<P>
There are particular concerns in some parts of the community, because the evidence shows that overcharging happens more often in cases involving black defendants than white defendants, commensurate with the number of black people as a proportion of the population.
<P>
Significant improvements and changes have taken place in criminal justice procedure over the past few years, especially since the royal commission reported. That means that its recommendations—leaving aside the changes regarding the removal of reputation to which the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire referred—are no longer as valid as they were six or seven years ago. Some of those changes have had clear knock-on effects. According to Home Office figures, 59 per cent. of defendants who elected to go to the Crown court pleaded guilty, and 80 per cent. pleaded guilty after the magistrates decided the jurisdiction. A guilty plea occurs more often in cases in which the individual does not make that choice than in those in which he does.
<P>
I want to put two crucial arguments to the Government. First, they have not yet decided what is the overriding reason for the reform.
<P>
They have not sorted it out and come to a common view. There is a worrying contradiction between what Ministers and advisers are saying about why the Bill is a good one. Secondly, the most recent evidence blows out of the water the argument that there is any significant abuse of the jury trial election process by defendants. The right hon. and learned Gentleman alluded to that fact a moment ago. The most recent statistics invalidate the Home Office research findings, which have been shown to misrepresent the proportion of people who make late changes of plea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Government have worked out why they want the Bill. Their view is that there are all these old lags with strings of convictions, who are wasting everyone's time by going to the Crown court—[Interruption.] I do not know why the hon. Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac) is laughing; that is precisely what the Home Secretary said. If that is the case, there is a simple way to deal with the people who are abusing the system: we should amend section 19 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980. It reads as follows:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The court shall consider whether the offence ought to be tried summarily or on indictment—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>shall consider—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the nature of the case;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) any of the circumstances of the offence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government could add, ``or of the accused, unless they are of previous good character''. The Government could easily amend their own Bill to deal with the old lags who are, apparently, wasting our time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> If the hon. Gentleman is right—and that factor has certainly had an influence, as is evident from what the Home Secretary has said—his proposal would deal with that point. However, I would insert a caveat. A significant number of those who are convicted in the Crown court after pleading not guilty have had previous convictions. However, we should beware of having a criminal justice system in which it is more likely that someone will be convicted, simply because he or she has been convicted in the past. We must make sure that people who have a record—the old lags—do not become easy prey for a criminal justice system that would pick them up, simply because they are more likely to be convicted. My experience was that, sometimes, the obvious suspects were put on trial for no other reason than that they were the obvious suspects. Mercifully, the Crown court rescued them from being convicted again, when the evidence against them was weak.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor </B>(North-West Leicestershire): On a point of information, I believe that more than 90 per cent. of those who opt for Crown court trial and are subsequently convicted have previous convictions. That sets the context for us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Yes, I understand that the correct figure is about 90 per cent.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary has—unintentionally, I hope—misrepresented the argument that I and other hon. Members have put. To my knowledge, no one has said that the magistrates courts in England and Wales give second-class justice. That has never been said, although the Parliamentary Secretary attributed that to us. We did not say that magistrates courts are bad; we said that jury trials are better forums for deciding cases. If that is not so, why do we have jury trials for the most significant cases? The logic is inescapable. Cases concerning murder, rape or terrorism are conducted before juries in England and Wales because that is the best system for the most serious cases. We are arguing about which cases ought to have that system and the circumstances in which the defendant should be allowed to choose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Has Hansard correctly interpreted the hon. Gentleman's earlier comments? He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That leads to the question whether we trust magistrates more than judges. I shall not beat around the bush: I trust a judge and jury more than I trust the Bench. That is my view, which is based on experience; I know that people get a better trial from a jury of 12 people who consider the facts and a judge who must direct them who knows that the case will be open to review if he gets it wrong.—[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 25 May 2000; c. 35-36.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is that right? Is the hon. Gentleman saying that one gets a better trial from a judge and jury? Does not that mean that one gets a less good trial from magistrates?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I stand by what I said. However, the Parliamentary Secretary is eliding what I said last time into a slightly different point. I have always held the view—and I repeat it today—that one gets a better trial before a court in which the judges of fact are separate from the judges of law, in which no secret advice is given, and in which there are 12 jurors rather than one or three. The fact that we use that process for the most difficult and serious cases is evidence of that.
<P>
However, that does not mean that magistrates would give second-class justice in some areas of the criminal justice system. It is right that we should have magistrates for some cases. It is perfectly acceptable to me that they should have the job in some cases. It is not second-class justice; it is justice appropriate to certain tasks. I would limit the number of tasks that they perform to an agreed amount that had the confidence of the public. There is, therefore, a difference between the Parliamentary Secretary's interpretation—and the phrases that he used earlier—and what I said on that previous occasion, by which I stand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I cannot accept that. The hon. Gentleman said, in describing a magistrates court, that such a court could be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>extremely dismissive and offhand and ignore the case presented by a defendant or his representative.—[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 25 May 2000; c. 36.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is he really saying that that does not suggest that one gets second-class justice from a magistrate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I was explicit last time, and the Minister of State was kind enough to confirm that that was his view today; the Parliamentary Secretary has also confirmed that. I also said earlier that jurors can nod off, judges can nod off, and judges who sit with magistrates can nod off. There is no perfect system.
<P>
However, this debate is not about whether magistrates are bad. Magistrates, by and large, do a good job. It is about whether juries are better. I believe that they are, not only because experience has led me to that conclusion, but because cases in the criminal justice system in England and Wales are allocated on the basis of assigning to a jury those serious cases that most put at risk a person's liberty and carry the highest likelihood of a prison sentence.
<P>
Ministers have not come to the House or to the Committee to suggest that the most serious cases should not go to a jury, which suggests that juries must be better at dealing with serious cases. That must still be the Government's view.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, if we are looking for a performance indicator of the quality of justice dispensed, one measure might be the proportion of decisions overturned by a higher court? Can he tell the Committee what proportion of similar types of case heard by magistrates or decided by a judge and jury are overturned? Does he agree that that would be a reasonable measure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is one measure, but not the only one. Digests of statistics exist that give those figures, but I do not have them all in my head. One must discount the fact that 90 per cent. of the work load is in the magistrates court, and that many more pleas of guilty take place in magistrates courts. One must also discount the fact that lawyers will often advise defendants—as I have done—not to appeal against a magistrates court decision that they do not like, because of the risk involved, whereas one might appeal in other circumstances. There are many factors to be considered, but I accept the hon. Gentleman's point that that is one of the indicators.
<P>
There is a debate in this context about what a serious offence is and how it should be dealt with—we discussed that earlier, and I merely flag up this issue because I do not want to repeat our discussion. One of the clause's weaknesses is the fact that it allows us to debate that matter only on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. The proposed change implies that either-way offences are, by definition, not serious enough for the defendant to be allowed to elect for trial by jury. The fact that reputation and livelihood will not be taken into account means that people may be refused jury trial although severe disadvantages to their reputation may be involved.
<P>
The only non-discriminatory way for the state to provide assistance is to allow the choice to remain with the defendant—that case was made by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. It is for the defendant to judge what is serious to him, and our task is to assess whether that choice should remain with him.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In order to discuss the abuse of process I shall refer to research into the right to elect for jury trial—it was referred to earlier, and I assume that all Committee members are familiar with it. The research, by Lee Bridges, was published two or three weeks ago and was carried out at Warwick university. It is significant for two reasons: it updates and overturns presumptions about the number of people who belatedly plead guilty, having strung out a case, and it strongly confirms our beliefs about prejudice against Asian, black and other minority individuals. In the research, such people confirm their strongly held view that the jury trial system is better for them. If anyone has not read that research or the evidence that was given by defendants who were questioned, they should do so. It makes it abundantly clear that such people do not have the same confidence in the magistrates courts system as others.
<P>
That leads to the significant conclusion—the Government may not have realised how significant it is—that if the Bill is enacted we could be guilty of indirect discrimination. The Race Relations (Amendment) Bill—a few weeks ago, I served on the Standing Committee that considered it—would make such practices illegal. A significant number of black and Asian people, and other minority communities, will be disproportionately affected. My understanding of the way in which the European convention works is that that could involve indirect discrimination. It is an extremely worrying thought that the Bill might create a criminal justice system that turns out to be institutionally racist. People might not be persuaded that that is true, but the fact that it might be true should be enough to make everyone realise that we should be careful.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that someone should say, ``Abandon hope all ye who enter here,'' to defendants from ethnic minorities when they enter the dock in a magistrates court? If so, we need to tackle difficulties in magistrates courts. A person from an ethnic minority who believes that he will not get a fair trial should not have to go off to a Crown court because he believes that the prospects are better there. We should tackle the difficulties that exist in the magistrates court system. The hon. Gentleman should assess differently the situation in which a stipendiary sits on his own and that in which two or three people sit on a bench. That is an important distinction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am simply describing the findings of the research, which was conducted at Warwick university and questioned many people in a controlled sample. A typical statement was made by a black defendant in London, who pleaded not guilty to a charge of actual bodily harm in a Crown court was asked about the advantages of being tried in a Crown court. He replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You stand a better chance of being acquitted at Crown court, definitely, definitely. At a magistrates court the evidence would have to be so blatantly not against you, and then you wouldn't be at court, you get what I mean. . . The advantage of a Crown Court is that there is a 12 man, 12 lady jury, so they hear the evidence and decide on an independent basis. Whereas at magistrates court he or she is sided with the law, and I can tell you that from personal experience. Whereas the jury, they are not, are they? I mean the law . . . does come into it, but they are more on the evidence, do you get what I mean?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Many such statements have been made, and I shall cite one other:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I wasn't going to have it tried in the magistrates' court because that's for the police. That's a police court, and I wasn't going to have none of that. . . Why I chose the Crown Court, because I don't trust the magistrates court, they work with the police. And you can see that they're all for the police. So I prefer to come to the Crown Court. Does that answer your question?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
These are the views of people who were questioned just after appearing in court.
<P>
We are giving those people no choice, and they will have less confidence in the criminal justice system. As the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire knows, I share his views on the distinction between stipes and lay magistrates, but the two people whom I quoted made no such distinction. They are part of the social group that is over-represented in exclusions from school, arrests, charges, custody and unemployment, yet we are likely to establish a system that will give them even less confidence in the criminal justice system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> For the record, will the hon. Gentleman confirm that the suggestion that there is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>proven bias on the part of magistrates against ethnic minority defendants, compared with their treatment of white defendants,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is expressly rejected by researchers, on page 17 of the report to which he refers? He is talking about perception, not fact.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is absolutely right. I did not intend to leave out later parts of the report and I shall come to the significant figures in due course. As Ministers in the Home Office have regularly said, there are two important issues: the actuality of crime and the fear of crime. We have often argued that we need a criminal justice system that is not only fair, but seen and felt to be fair. That was the central point of the Hamlyn lectures thesis.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough made a good point: it is helpful when society is the stakeholder and non-professionals are the judges. Judgments should be made by ordinary people with no preconceptions, who are not in and out of the courts every day. Such people perform jury service perhaps once in their lives, for a fortnight or a month, and then they go away and live their lives.
<P>
The report does not conclude that the system was proven to be less fair but it provides abundant evidence that many people from minority ethnic communities believe the jury trial system to be a better system. In the light of nearly 300 offences, many of which are commonly committed by such people, we would be foolish to throw away that preferred system at a stroke. The most frequent 20 offences are exactly those for which young black and Asian people are often charged, especially in London.
<P>
<B>Ms Bridget Prentice </B>(Lewisham, East): If the hon. Gentleman accepts that, according to the research, there is no bias or discrimination in magistrates courts and the issue is one of perception, surely the very people about whom he is concerned will be pleasantly surprised when they are tried in a magistrates court?
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> That is rather a leap of faith in two respects; in any case, it will be too late.
<P>
The Government were elected by 40 per cent. of those who voted, which is about 30 per cent. of the public, and the provision was not even in their manifesto. I might be more easily persuaded to give my support if we had a majority Government—elected by a majority of the people—who had given a manifesto commitment. However, there is no evidence that a majority of people has ever been in favour of the change. Apart from belated converts on the Labour Benches, the only people who are in favour are the senior judiciary, magistrates and the police—which is not surprising. Other groups of people in the legal system would not necessarily share that view. I understand the hon. Lady's point, but it is too big a risk to take.
<P>
I turn to the key quantitative point in the report—that the old Home Office evidence that suggested that there was abuse of the system, is wrong and invalid. The researchers used a sample of 164 cases in which the defendant was charged with an either-way offence. Pages 2 and 3 of the report state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Of the either-way defendants in the sample who elected to be tried at Crown Court, 14 out of 35 (40 per cent.) entered some form of guilty plea. This would at first appear to be a much lower figure than suggested by Government spokespersons in the recent debates over proposals to curb the right to jury trial. However, the Government originally relied for its figures on a study conducted by the Home Office Research and Planning Unit in 1989, which was based on a sample that included only convicted defendants and excluded those who were acquitted and had all the charges against them dropped. This study showed that of those who elected Crown Court and were eventually convicted, 70 per cent. had pleaded guilty to all the charges, and 13 per cent. to some charges.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If one takes out those who were acquitted and includes only those who were convicted, the figures are entirely different from those in the Home Office research study of the late 1980s.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Of course, in a moment. The report goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>More recently, the Home Office spokespersons have cited data drawn from a 1998 sample of one month's cases started in six magistrates courts, showing that 59 per cent. of either-way defendants who elected Crown Court pleaded guilty, 30 per cent. not guilty, with 11 per cent. having had the cases against them discontinued. However, the Home Office has acknowledged that this sample ``had a lower election rate and a higher overall guilty plea rate than national statistics, perhaps reflecting the absence of London in the sample areas''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When the figures are broken down between the three groups, only three of the elective defendants—14 per cent. of the total sample of those who elected Crown court—and only a fifth of those who pleaded guilty entered guilty pleas to all the original charges against them.
<P>
The report continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In all the remaining 11 guilty plea cases by elective defendants in the sample . . . the plea was either to an alternative charge to that originally alleged or to only some of the charges, with not guilty pleas to others being accepted by the prosecution.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the way in which the system works.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the sample size is extremely small, consisting of only 299 cases, from which only 35 defendants elected Crown court trial? I have a great deal of respect for Professor Bridges and have met him to discuss his concerns, but I think that he would agree that it is a small sample. In contrast, Dr. Mhlanga's research, which was commissioned by the Home Office, studied the cases of 5,500 defendants, of whom 595 were black, 656 Asian and 98 other non-white.
<P>
Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the very small sample on which he is basing his whole argument invalidates the statistical authority with which he speaks, as he seeks to undermine the criminal justice system and confidence in it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I do not accept that, and nor do the people who produced the report. The sample is smaller, but they make a good case about that, as the Minister will see from the report.
<P>
The most crucial issue is that the Home Office report left out those who were acquitted. The percentages, therefore, do not stack up and do not make the case for the Government that there is abuse of the system, even if, as the hon. Member for Gainsborough said, the Government want to make sure that the old lags do not spin things out to get a good deal. They also have a second argument to do with cost, to which I shall return in a moment.
<P>
 The Government's argument is that there is abuse of the system, but the evidence to which I am referring is, at least, as valid and shows that there is not. Indeed, as is confirmed by what has happened since the plea before venue changes, there is less abuse than there was. At the very least, there has been an improvement in the system, and the evidence for that is as authoritative as the Home Office study.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman recall that Dr. Mhlanga's research, on which the Minister is relying, was used by Lord Dholakia on Second Reading in another place to attack the Government? The Minister is unwise to rely so heavily on Dr. Mhlanga's research. It seems to me—as it did to Lord Dholakia—that, in fact, it supports our attacks and those made by the hon. and learned Member for Medway.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That point was made expressly in the debates in another place, using exact references to the report.
<P>
The evidence in this report is not just something that was sought out by Opposition parties or Members of Parliament; it is important that we understand the implications for ethnic groups. In the summary of outcomes paragraph on page 13, the report says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Looking at known outcomes in elective cases for each ethnic group, of the 20 black defendants who opted for Crown court, eight pleaded guilty (40 per cent.) but all to alternative/lesser charges or on a less serious version of the facts; ten were acquitted or had the cases against them discontinued (50 per cent.); and only two (l0 per cent.) were convicted by a jury. Additionally, one of the two black defendants who was convicted by a jury had this conviction overturned on appeal . . . The comparable figures for Asian defendants were that only two of the seven who elected to be tried in the Crown court were eventually convicted of all the original charges against them. A further three entered guilty pleas either to alternative charges or to only some of the charges against them, while two were cleared following ordered or directed acquittals. None of the seven white defendants in the sample who elected were convicted by a jury. Apart from the three who pleaded guilty . . . three were cleared on ordered or directed acquittals and one by a jury.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It concludes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In a substantial majority of cases defendants who elect for Crown court are obtaining not a jury trial but a more thorough review of the evidence against them than has previously been undertaken, in many instances at the instigation of the Crown court judge and/or prosecuting counsel.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So, judges have been saying, ``The evidence does not stack up; it does not hold water. We have heard it now, it has been tested and we are throwing it out.'' They are directing juries to enter a not guilty verdict. All members of the Committee, including those on the Government Benches, should look carefully at such evidence. It deals with the abuse of the system as effectively as anything else.
<P>
That leaves us with the two remaining points. I shall not elaborate on the point made by the hon. Member for Gainsborough about the Government's desire to deal with the old lags who keep getting round the system and know how to play the game. If that argument is being made, I hope that I have made it clear that we should ensure that each case is judged on its merits, irrespective of the defendant's previous convictions. That is the basis of the criminal justice system, and we should not, without notice, change that so that there is a presumption of guilt in cases in which the defendant has been convicted before—once, twice or six times.
{**p4
<p4**}The Government are also arguing on the grounds of cost. Various people, including the Prime Minister, keep saying that the savings produced by the measure will allow more money to go to the police. Many hon. Members have tabled parliamentary questions about that: Conservative Back Benchers, my colleagues and I, and other Back Benchers. <P>
First it is clear that most of the savings will be in the prison system rather than in the criminal justice system, by a ratio of about 2:1. That is because the sentences that will be passed will be shorter, and the cost to the taxpayer of keeping people inside will be reduced. Secondly, although various assumptions have been offered in answers to parliamentary questions, no one has yet exactly evaluated the implications for the appeal system—the delays in magistrates courts that could occur because it is rare to get a run of days available, the costs to the legal aid system, or the prospective chances for appeal.
<P>
The Government have made various assumptions, and they have been asked to compile various tabulations, which they have done. However, it is at best dubious that the benefits will accrue as the Government have claimed. Even if one believes that such matters can be worked out on a cost-benefit basis, and that the principle can be bought and sold, the cost-benefit relationship has been only weakly established, if at all.
<P>
One of the Prime Minister's arguments is that the savings, as well as the improvements to the criminal justice process, justify the Bill. We do not have to buy the argument that we need these measures to improve the criminal justice process. Since the end of the Conservative Administration, the two significant changes that they made have speeded up the system. No one has argued that they have not produced an improvement. The plea before venue change and the establishment of rules on the maximum discount for early pleas have both improved the system. It is nonsense to seek to change the system without any prior debate or consideration, and without having taken into account the improvement over the years that those measures have delivered. Furthermore, it is nonsense to change the system without the reputation provision—one keystone of the royal commission proposal—as other hon. Members; have said.
<P>
I have three short postscripts. First, Scotland is a red herring of an argument: an absolutely false argument. ``What about Scotland?'' say Ministers. Scotland's system is different in all sorts of respects, and in no way comparable. One of many differences is that people there know that, once convicted, they cannot be sent to a higher court for sentence. That power is not available to the Scottish courts. Furthermore, the choice of venue is decided by the prosecution, not by the court.
<P>
There is a whole range of reasons why the system is historically different. Even if it were not, the system has been tried, tested and valued—as well as evaluated—in England and Wales for centuries, and reached its full democratisation only 30 or 40 years ago, as the hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Ms Prentice) pointed out. We have made changes only round the edges—never generally—after very careful debate.
<P>
Secondly, Ministers argue that some summary cases are serious for defendants, yet are not subject to jury trial. That is a perfectly valid argument, but one for reviewing summary-only cases. It is an argument for sending the matter to the Auld committee, or to some other independent body. I have always subscribed to that argument. I have never said that the position is cast for all time; each category can be examined. For example, a criminal offence of obscenity might be regarded completely differently in 2000 from how it was in 1962, or whenever ``Lady Chatterley's Lover'' was tried in the courts. Views change—interestingly, what is a serious offence in one decade, or to one generation, may not be subsequently. Speeding, for example, was once regarded as being not that serious, but it is now. We know from our constituency work that speeding is often the most direct cause in accidents involving injury or death. Likewise with drink-driving, people used to drink and drive routinely 20 years ago, but it no longer culturally acceptable to do so. There are good reasons for reviewing offences and the associated penalties every five, 10 or 20 years.
<P>
Thirdly, I turn to a red herring that the Minister conjured up—he said that the right is not ancient and that it stems from only 1885. That is a red herring upside down, as it were. The other day, Opposition Members made it clear that until 1885, the right was absolute, not conditional. We have whittled down the right since then. You will be aware, Mr. Maxton, but not from personal experience, that juries were collected differently in the early days. A person was tried by his peers, but they were people who knew him—that was thought to be the best way to establish whether he was guilty or innocent.
<P>
The Government do not have a mandate. It would be illogical to push ahead with this one reform, which is part of a jigsaw, when the other bits of the jigsaw were not under consideration. It would be foolish as well as bizarre to push ahead with it when someone was looking at the jigsaw—taking evidence and trying to come up with a considered review.
<P>
Finally, the Bill is not a modernisation proposal and it does not have the public's confidence. The evidence suggests that it will not resolve any of the significant objections that the Government have raised about the criminal justice system.
<P>
As this debate continues, I hope that people will realise that we need a fundamental change of course. The best thing that we could do with clause 1 is to remove it. When the time comes, I hope that some Labour Members will vote against it or abstain. If they do not abstain, I hope that they will at least abstain in their hearts and minds. If they did that, they might start moving towards the right side of the argument.
<P>
I honestly believe that the Bill will either not survive this Parliament or fail to be enacted. It troubles me that we have to rely on the unelected Chamber to do what is obviously the job of the elected Chamber, and it saddens me that the Labour party put us in this predicament. The Labour party has left it to the unelected Chamber to rescue us. If the Government use their contrived majority to push through the Bill, despite the objections that have been raised to it inside and outside the House—[HON. MEMBERS: ``Contrived majority?''] Contrived in that it is a distortion of the public's views—if the representatives of a minority of the public are going to drive the Bill through, we shall do all that we can to make things as difficult as possible for them. We shall do so in the belief that right is on our side and that the public would want us to defeat the Bill at the earliest opportunity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Why is the clause in the Bill? What is the Government's justification? Do they want to save money? They cannot admit that that is their motivation, but if it is, how much money will be saved? I do not need to repeat the points that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire made about imprisonment.
<P>
I want to pursue the matter raised in a parliamentary question tabled by my right hon. and learned Friend. Of the 14,000 defendants, there is a timely guilty plea rate of 80 per cent., a late guilty plea rate of 10 per cent. and a not guilty plea rate of 10 per cent. As my right hon. and learned Friend said, the Bill relates to 1,400 trials. How many of those trials involve people who are of previously good character? In politics, one must ask for what one has a chance of receiving. The Government are going to proceed with the Bill. However, the Minister said earlier that he would consider my point. I should be happy with the provision that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the court shall consider—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the nature of the case;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) any of the circumstances of the offence (but not of the accused)<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
if the words ``unless the defendant is of good character'' were added. I ask for nothing more at this stage, because that change would deal with many of my worries and objections.

<P>

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I have said that I would consider that point, and I will. I want to clarify the hon. Gentleman's view. If that change were made, would he vote for the Bill on Report?
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Well, I do not know. I might be in awful trouble with my Whips Office if I were to vote for a Government Bill. If I tabled the amendment that I have outlined—and I now think that I shall do so on Report—and if the Government accepted it, that would be one of the greatest achievements of my parliamentary career. Of course I suppose I should then have to vote for the Bill. It would be great. This is real progress. I am really excited that Minister takes me seriously in this matter. [Hon. Members: ``Calm down.''] I shall not get too excited, because I know that none of it will happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am intrigued. The hon. Gentleman had no compunction about voting against his party when it was in government. Why is it so difficult in opposition?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is a fair point and a good question, but it is unanswerable.
<P>
I have made my point now, but if the Minister has a chance, perhaps he will let me know how many of the 1,400 are affected. I suspect that if all the people with previous convictions were stripped away from the total of those who go for full trial in the Crown court, a very small number of people of good character would remain They would probably represent a very small cost to the public purse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Luff </B>(Mid-Worcestershire): I understand that, through no fault of anyone involved in the Committee, it is not possible to sit on Thursday, so there is some pressure to complete our business this evening—in the next 40 minutes. [Hon. Members: ``Ten.''] I think that that would be pushing it. Among the combined forces of the magistrates on the Labour Benches and the lawyers on the Opposition Benches the voice of the lay person needs to be raised—mine and that of the hon. Member for Taunton. The Ministers are quasi-professionals in this context—glorious amateurs like the magistrates whom they rightly praise.
<P>
Two important issues have not been raised in the amendments. I shall not join my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough in voting for the Bill, whatever happens to it, but if it reaches the statute book, by the use of whatever procedures the Government may choose, including, in due course, the Parliament Act—and that is what it will take, if they insist on it—it will still be nice to know that it is in as good shape as possible and that the Government have given commitments to make it as acceptable as possible.
<P>
I have two questions, which I suspect are more for the Parliamentary Secretary than the Minister of State, although probably the latter will answer, and he may need advice from his colleague. My questions flow from the simple fact that the Bill would be less offensive if the magistrates who would hear the trials that are at present held in Crown courts were, first, the glorious amateurs who now comprise the bench and, secondly, local glorious amateurs. Magistrates are very concerned about the Government's enthusiasm for stipendiary magistrates. I visited my local bench only last week and heard many worries about the Government's hidden agenda to increase the number of professional magistrates. If the trials in question are to be held in magistrates courts, they should be heard by the lay magistracy and not by a growing number of stipendiaries. A categorical Government assurance that there is no hidden agenda to drive up the number of stipes would be encouraging.
<P>
Secondly, there is more democratic appeal to magistrates court hearings in local environments, where local papers can report the misdeeds of local people. However, the Government—like, to be fair, the previous one—have an agenda of centralising magistrates courts and removing them from rural areas. If more trials on issues that concern local people are to take place in magistrates courts, will the Government provide an assurance that they will, wherever possible, abandon their centralising agenda? The Parliamentary Secretary knows, of course, of the case of Droitwich Spa and Evesham magistrates courts and I am grateful to the Lord Chancellor's Department for its past support to Evesham magistrates court. I pay tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor, the present Secretary of State for Defence, who took the relevant decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government believe that justice in magistrates courts should be dispensed as locally as is reasonably possible. However, he will know of the other pressures on magistrates courts, for proper facilities to separate prosecution and defence witnesses and for buildings that are accessible to disabled people. Many other serious issues need to be dealt with in relation to magistrates courts, many of which are in buildings in which it would be difficult to install the necessary facilities. I hope that the hon. Gentleman appreciates the tension between the desire to dispense justice as locally as possible and the wish to make the buildings appropriate to today, rather than to 30 or 40 years ago.
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> I think, Mr. Maxton, that you will rule me out of order if I pursue the matter in too much detail, but I am not persuaded that the Parliamentary Secretary has properly understood the importance of local justice. It is important that he should. Justice is a matter not of the convenience of those who administer it, but of the convenience of those who participate in it, or are on the receiving end of it, or who give evidence to ensure that it works. I fear that the Government's centralising agenda is for the convenience of those who administer justice, rather than those who need the services that it offers.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary said nothing about stipendiary magistrates. I hope that the Minister of State will say something about them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Although we are under time pressure, I want to say that what we are considering is the most important issue in which I have been involved in just over eight years in the House. There is nothing more significant constitutionally than safeguarding the rights of individual liberty. That is fundamental to our job as Members of Parliament.
<P>
The stand part debate, although short, has been very good. As a law student, along with many other lawyers in the House, I was brought up with the view that Lord Denning was one of our great judges and I still believe it. In the 1966 case of Ward v. James he said that trial by jury
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>has been the bulwark of our liberties too long for any of us to seek to alter it. Whenever a man is on trial for serious crime, or when in a civil case a man's honour or integrity is at stake, or when one or other party must be deliberately lying, then trial by jury has no equal.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those words were echoed by the Morris committee on jury service in 1965. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is, we think, a fundamental conviction in the minds of the public that a jury is in a real sense a safeguard of our liberties.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, in a powerful speech on clause stand part, made the point that the Government are undermining their own case. They say that trial by jury is the Rolls-Royce—the best way of dealing with the most serious offences such as rape and murder—but that for administrative convenience the goalposts must be moved dramatically and the right to trial by jury must be cut for many less important offences. The Government ignore centuries of history. When a distinguished 18th-century Solicitor-General, Lord Eldon, found for political reasons that he could not oppose Charles James Fox's libel Bill, he began his speech by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>professing a most religious regard for the institution of juries, which he considered the greatest blessing which the British Constitution had secured to the subject.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is as true today, in the first year of a new century and millennium, as it was when he said it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has also, quite rightly, dealt with many of the Government's red herrings. The Minister of State produced another one on Second Reading when he said of the right to elect jury trial that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the English and Welsh system is eccentric in that it permits defendants to choose.—[Official Report, 7 March 2000; Vol. 345, c. 967 ]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When I consider the words of Lord Denning, Lord Eldon and the Morris committee of 1965, I find nothing eccentric in a British tradition that has lasted 700 years or so and defended the right to choose. I am sure that many of the Minister's colleagues in this House and another place would agree. For those reasons, I am absolutely confident that the Bill—like its predecessor—will be shot down in another place.
<P>
Many of the Minister's hon. Friends have been associated with the Campaign to Save Trial by Jury. In its splendid publication, The Jury, Bruce Houlder QC writes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government says abolishing the right to jury trial will cut delay in the courts.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>But important new research casts doubt on the key argument on delay, and should fuel fears that this pointless change will in fact result in greater delay, and increased costs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This research, published by the Bar Council, found that Crown courts are presently able to hear short trials nearly twice as quickly as Magistrates' Courts.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Magistrates' Courts needed up to 20 weeks, and an average of 9 weeks, to list cases of the kind of length which<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the Home Secretary
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>proposes to clear from the Crown Courts.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Crown Court listing officers confirmed they would need just five weeks.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Campaign to Save Trial By Jury has always said that the Government's statistics were seriously flawed—and that the planned curbs on jury trial would actually add to cost and delay the court system.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This latest Bill, even worse than its forerunner in its approach to individual justice, is bad news for victims and witnesses, bad for defendants, and bad for the taxpayer.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Since the publication of the Stephen Lawrence report, other authoritative research has repeatedly emphasised the lack of faith ethnic minorities have in the magistracy, the lack of effective disclosure procedures in these courts, and the shortage of real safeguards for the rights minorities are entitled to enjoy to the full.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It gets worse. Much trailed Government figures on the percentage of charges withdrawn against defendants from ethnic minorities have been exposed as nothing more than evidence of overcharging—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
charging with too serious an offence—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>against these groups in comparison to white defendants.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government has been hurt by the trenchant arguments made against it, but its response tells only half the story.<P>

<B>Mr. David Taylor:</B> The hon. Gentleman is intoxicated by exaggeration. Stephen Lawrence's probable killers were not freed by any magistrates court in this land.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The hon. Gentleman misunderstands me. I am quoting Bruce Houlder QC from the Campaign to Save Trial by Jury; he should bear that in mind. The Government stand accused of failing to respond to the comment that they made in response to the Macpherson inquiry into Stephen Lawrence. That is Bruce Holder's point, which I am echoing. He went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government has accepted that jury trial is fairer. To reduce its role even further, and do it through a system which will add to delay and probably cost more,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
will cause substantial damage.
<P>
The editorial in The Economist on 11 March gave a damming verdict on the Bill. It made it clear
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Even if there are gains, these have to be balanced against the blow to justice and public faith in the criminal justice system which denial of jury trials would represent.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Mr. Straw's determination to push ahead with his restrictions to jury trial is the latest example of the Labour government's depressing impatience with the civil rights of individual citizens.<P>

<P>
Finally, The Daily Telegraph said—[Interruption.] Hon. Members may want to dismiss one of our great national newspapers, but they will not listen either to The Economist, Justice, Liberty and the Society of Black Lawyers, whose views they often trumpet. The Daily Telegraph said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Trial by jury is a fundamental right and liberty. It is far too important to be curtailed in the nebulous cause of administrative convenience and economy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is for that reason that I will ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to oppose the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> We have had a full debate. I have been prepared—as I am sure the Conservative Whip would confirm—to accept Opposition amendments. I will consider the points raised by the hon. Member for Gainsborough, but I shall not hold him to his commitment to vote against his own party, because that would be unfair and unreasonable. I shall write to him on his question about people of previous good character.
<P>
The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff) asked a question about lay versus stipendiary magistrates. There has been much debate on that issue, but the Bill bears no relation to any of those debates. I do not believe that I will reveal any secrets by saying that there are differences of opinion throughout the Labour party, as these are in other groups. I pay tribute to lay magistrates, who are a key part of our democracy. The lay or stipendiary issue is not a key aspect of the debate.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not regard eccentricity as a pejorative term. With the hon. Member for Gainsborough in Committee this evening, one can only admire eccentrics, who are an important part of national life. On Second Reading, I said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Many international comparisons can be made. All the systems are entirely different in their character, history and orientation, but it is true that the English and Welsh system is eccentric in that it permits defendants to choose. In general, in the rest of the world, either the court decides or, in some cases, which are equally eccentric, the prosecution decides. It is eccentric for the defendant to be given the right to decide. What is universal is the right of everyone to have a fair trial, whether in the magistrates court or Crown court.—[Official Report, 7 March 2000; Vol. 345, c. 967.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I believe that that is a true and accurate statement, and I stand by it.
<P>
A key issue is that of cost. I shall repeat what I said on Second Reading because my remarks have been distorted, although I explained the matter as clearly as I possibly could have done. I said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I emphasise that none of our case rests on the cost savings that may arise from the Bill—it derives entirely from the need to create a more transparent, clear and fair criminal justice system. That is why the Bill is before us, and that is its intention. The law requires us—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would have thought that the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire would have been aware of this point, given his ministerial experience—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The law requires us to make an estimate of the cost savings involved, and we have set out those savings in the Bill to the best of our ability.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I add in parenthesis that I sought to provide more evidence of the basis for those cost comparisons in parliamentary answers, as the hon. Gentleman generously acknowledged. I continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I acknowledge that many of the points made about cost savings are fair, and that the proof of the pudding will be in the eating; but those points are not germane to the central issue, which is whether we want to enact a measure to modernise the criminal justice system and to make it more transparent. That, in fact, is the entire motivation behind the Bill.—[Official Report, 7 March 2000; Vol. 345, c. 965.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I say that because of the criticisms made by the right hon. and learned Gentleman and others, that cost formed the whole basis of our argument; that is not the case. It is our obligation to set out for Parliament our best estimates of what the cost will be, which is what we have done. If savings can be made and the money devoted to other causes in the criminal justice system, that will be beneficial. To respond to the point made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, the overriding reason for the Bill is to modernise and to make more transparent the whole operation of the criminal justice system. That is why the Bill is before the Committee and why I urge hon. Members to support the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I shall accept it if the Minister tells us that modernisation is now the Government's key justification. In which case, will the Minister also say how the proposal modernises the criminal justice system? That has never been explained. It is a phrase out of the Labour lexicon, but how the Bill makes the system more modern has not been stated. In addition, why does the Prime Minister lay such emphasis on cost savings every time he is asked about the measure if they are not the Government's key motivation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I have tried—perhaps I have failed—both on Second Reading and in Committee to describe the ways in which we believe that we are modernising the system. The hon. Gentleman may not find my comments satisfactory, but I have used my best efforts to explain our approach. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is often asked questions on these issues at Prime Minister's Question Time—indeed, I think that that is where he most recently commented on them—but we should bear in mind that he answers questions in the context of the exchanges that are made in those debates. From personal conversations with him, I can inform the Committee that he believes that the fundamental reason for introducing the Bill is to achieve a criminal justice system that is better possessed by the population of the country and not left to the complexities of inter-lawyer arguments of the sort that currently occur. That is the motivation that underlies the Bill. The hon. Gentleman might not accept that, but it is a fact.
<P>
The clause amends the relevant provisions of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980 and omits the requirement for the defendant's consent to summary trial in either-way cases. It provides that the decision on where those cases are to be heard should rest with the magistrates and be based on the clear criteria that are set out in the Bill. We intend the decision on mode of trial to be made objectively and with fairness to all participants in the process—defendants, victims, other witnesses and the wider public—who expect a fair, efficient and effective criminal justice system. That is modernisation.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I shall give way in a moment.
<P>
The clause also provides for the defendant a right of appeal to the Crown court against the magistrates' decision to try the case themselves. The appeal procedure will be subject to the rules of court in the usual way. We have sought also to improve the safeguards that apply to appeals by requiring magistrates to give reasons for their decisions. The Lord Chief Justice has suggested that appeals on mode of trial should be heard by the resident judge or by a court dominated by the presiding judges of the circuit. Although that proposal is not included in the Bill, the Government agree that it will help to ensure public confidence in higher standards of decision making. The appropriate arrangements will be made by way of a practice direction.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister has been generous in giving way throughout our sittings. How can it be fair that somebody with a clean record and no previous convictions, whose whole livelihood and standing in the community is at stake, cannot ensure that the magistrates take that into account when they are deciding whether he should be entitled to trial by jury?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The right hon. and learned Gentleman is not right. He argued that defendants with previous convictions should be committed to Crown court for sentence, thus undermining the savings that he mentioned and which the Bill is reckoned to produce. It is not right to say that such defendants should automatically be committed to the Crown court for sentence. The circumstances are clear and we have discussed them at some length. I do not think that I have anything further to add.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I rise again only because the Minister has unwittingly misrepresented me: I did not suggest that such cases should be automatically be referred. It is unlikely that magistrates' sentencing powers will be sufficient to deal with a defendant who has a string of previous convictions and who they then have to convict again. I take it that the Minister simply does not want to answer my first question.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am well aware that the right hon. and learned Gentleman has not found my answers satisfactory. I am sorry not to have passed my viva in these legal matter, but I have answered to my best ability and I have not tried to misrepresent the right hon. and learned Gentleman; I am sorry if I have done so in any way. I have sought to answer his questions as fully and comprehensively as I can.
<P>
A number of hon. Members have asked about race research. I shall not go into the matter in detail because of time constraints, but, as I said in my intervention on the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, we are well aware of the research conducted at Warwick. I believe that the small sample size of 299 means that the results do not provide evidence that black defendants would be disproportionately affected by changes to mode of trial. The hon. Gentleman said that Home Office research took no account of acquittals: that was not the case with Dr. Mhlanga's recent research, but with the much earlier work to which he referred, which was done by Hedderman and Moxon. It is not the case that the most recent research—the 5,500 cases considered by Dr. Mhlanga—takes no account of acquittals. It has been generally acknowledged that statistically reliable evidence shows that there is no significant racial disadvantage to a defendant if his or her case is dealt with in the magistrates courts rather than the Crown court. In both courts, he or she is about seven percentage points less likely to be convicted than a white defendant.
<P>
There are serious objections to the approach of overall reclassification. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary raised several objections when talking about the seriousness of offences. There is a more profound point. If we were considering change in that direction, it would surely be better for magistrates to study the approach that could best be taken in the many cases that are subject to the appeal process that we have described, rather than for us to have a blunderbuss approach that simply redefined across the range.
<P>
My final point, given the shortage of time, is that many Opposition Members have been at serious risk of undermining confidence in the criminal justice system through the dismissive and sometimes offensive way in which they have referred to solicitors and magistrates. What many hon. Members have said has been seriously misleading and not characteristic of previous debates in another place and on Second Reading. I commend them for the honesty of what they have said, but many will not recognise the description given of the work done by solicitors and by magistrates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Before I give way, I note that it was the hon. Gentleman who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That leads to the question whether we trust magistrates more than judges. I shall not beat around the bush: I trust a judge and jury more than I trust the Bench—[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 25 May 2000; c. 35.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a strong and powerful statement. He must answer the question whether he is responsible for deliberately undermining confidence in the criminal justice system for the 97 per cent. of cases dealt with in magistrates courts. He should reflect on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The Minister is entitled to his view; I stand by what I said. The argument was deployed strongly because the present system is better. I was going to ask the Minister to deal with a problem that he has not yet covered. Will he explain why the Government should not allow the changes of the past four years—the plea before venue change and the maximum discount for any plea rule—to proceed through the system before they seek to make further changes? There has been the Auld review committee. Why have an off-the-peg one-off development instead of considering the situation in the round?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> There is a variety of versions of the best being the enemy of the good. I commend the changes to which the hon. Gentleman referred and I agree that they are having the effect that he described. The best might mean an old review based on the evidence or a total reclassification of the system, but the hon. Gentleman is seeking to make it an enemy of the good, which is our proposed change. He should not do that. The change is good. It does not disqualify the arguments of a more fundamental description that have been advanced and that must be addressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> The Minister says that he is short of time and I understand the reasons for that. You are shaking your head, Mr. Maxton—we are not short of time. The rather garbled approach taken by the Minister is uncharacteristic of his normal approach to Committees. I will press him on one point. He dismissed an important point regarding race relations made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. The chair of the Commission for Racial Equality has said that he has asked the Home Secretary to consider carefully the report and its implications. What will the Home Office do with the report? Will it dismiss it because the sample size is small or will it respond to it in more detail? If it does the latter, will it share its thinking with the members of the Committee and the House generally, later if not now?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> There have been many speeches in the debate. Government Members, including Ministers, have taken a small part of the time allocated. I and my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary have done our best to answer the points made. For what it is worth, I am prepared to stay here until midnight to discuss the issue all the way through if that is convenient for members of the Committee.
<P>
I will answer the specific point. We are aware of the research and take it seriously. In terms of a serious comparison in debate, its sample size disqualifies it as a basis for overruling the research by Dr. Mhlanga and others across the range. I do not dismiss the research; I take it seriously and am prepared to discuss it with the Committee. I have great respect for Professor Lee Bridges, with whom I have spoken on platforms and had meetings. We do not agree on the matter, but I regard him as an entirely authentic and reasonable contributor to the debate and, unlike the views of some other academics, I take his opinion extremely seriously, as I also take seriously the views of the Commission for Racial Equality.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Before the Minister concludes, will he explain how it can be right—this argument underlies his costings—that defendants with multiple previous convictions, who currently receive sentences averaging 11 months in the Crown court, should receive sentences averaging 3.6 months in the magistrates court?
<P>
<H5>7.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Had the right hon. and learned Gentleman had the courtesy to be present when I dealt with that point at the start of my response, he would have heard what I had to say but, for his benefit, I shall read again what I said on Second Reading:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I emphasise that none of our case rests on the cost savings that may arise from the Bill—it derives entirely from the need to create a more transparent, clear and fair criminal justice system. That is why the Bill is before us, and that is its intention The law requires us—<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to make an estimate of the cost savings involved, and we have set out those savings in the Bill to the best of our ability. I acknowledge that many of the points made about cost savings are fair, and that the proof of the pudding will be in the eating; but those points are not germane to the central issue, which is whether we want to enact a measure to modernise the criminal justice system—[Official Report, 7 March 2000; Vol. 345, c. 965.]<P>

<P>
The point I sought to make is that we have to make cost estimates. Of course, those estimates can be challenged and the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. The right hon. and learned Gentleman is wrong that the central case for our claim relates to costs. That is what I said on Second Reading and I have repeated it twice in Committee
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I apologise that I had to slip out when the Committee sat slightly beyond the expected time and I am sorry that I missed what the Minister said, but he did not answer my question, which focuses on the fact that he is assuming that we will save £84 million by sending criminals who have many previous convictions to prison for 3.6 months rather than 11 months. How can he justify a system that produces that result?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am sorry if my answers are not adequate. We have tried to assess the costs involved, which is a requirement of all legislation before the House, and we have made the assumptions that I have set out in my answers in Committee, which is all part of the correct process of debate. Those assumptions are based on our experience and on what we believe will be the impact of the differential levels of sentencing in the different courts. As I have tried to say, now for the third time, those are our best estimates of the consequences of the situation, and they might prove to be wrong, but as our case for the Bill does not rest on the savings that may or may not result from it, that is not germane to the debate.
<P>
My final point is about the various phrases that have been used. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath used a phrase about chipping. The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire used a phrase about small versus large encroachments. Those are legitimate points of debate about the changes that we are introducing as the criminal justice system evolves, but they do not add up to a fundamental attack on the right to trial by jury in this country. I entirely reject those attacks on the Bill, which are not justified. These measures introduce the modernisation that will make the system more accessible to the whole population. I commend the Bill, and in particular this clause, to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister is good and courteous, but I wish that Ministers would not do what they do so often in Committees, which is to say that there is a shortage of time and start speaking more quickly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Hall:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. We had agreed to finish at 7.30 pm and we do not want to come back at 8.30 pm for the benefit of the Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Maxton. That is not entirely accurate. We had hoped to sit on Thursday morning, but that is not possible, for reasons outside the control of any of us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> I am minded to adjourn the Committee, if that is what the hon. Gentleman wants, to return at 8.30 pm.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Mr. Leigh is on his feet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am just saying that there is no need to race through. We have already been sitting for two and three quarter hours. No court sits for that long. We are all growing tired and irritated. We have had the right of trial in question for seven centuries. Why are we now rushing? It is ridiculous. We should slow down and consider the matter. If we must return later this evening or on Thursday or Tuesday let us do so and do our job properly.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I should make it clear that any arrangements about time are for the Committee, not the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> There is no need for us to finish by a particular time.
<P>
Why is the removal of the right to jury trial for between 200 and 300 offences not a fundamental attack on the continuation of jury trial at the election of the defendant? Under the Bill, for the first time in English and Welsh legal history, the defendant will not have a say in whether he or she is given a jury trial. The indictable offences go to juries and the summary offences to magistrates because that is the law. The remaining offences will go where the court, not the defendant, determines. Why is not that more than a chipping away at the right to choose jury trial? Why is it not a fundamental assault on the right that now exists?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I must apologise to you, Mr. Maxton, and to the Committee, if I have become irritable. That is not my general style and I apologise. The reason is that many of the points that have been made are debating points rather than points of substance and I probably over-reacted.
<P>
The expression ``chipping away'' was used by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath and I took it up. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has raised a fair point. There is, for good reasons that have evolved over the years, no right to jury trial today for a long list of summary offences that affect vital matters such as people's reputation for honesty. We are not withdrawing a fundamental right, but trying to adopt a qualified, effective and rational approach to ensuring that the precious right of jury trial will be used when it is really important. Everything in the Bill is aimed at enhancing that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Even if a large number of offences already do not go to the jury, why does doubling the number of offences in which the defendant has no choice not constitute a major inroad, or major reduction?
<P>
Why do so many people argue that the proposal is a fundamental erosion of the right to jury trial? If it were not, could not Ministers obtain a consensus for change that did not bring them into opposition with most of the legal establishment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> To answer the first point, some cases that are now either-way cases will go to magistrates court and some will go to Crown court, but the decision will be made by the magistrates, subject to appeal, rather than by the defendant. It is being argued that a fundamental right is being removed. My response is that in many key instances the right does not now exist. There is no issue of principle, but there is, as I have acknowledged, one of encroachment and chipping away, which is an issue of judgment. They are not fundamental issues about rights and jury trial.
<P>
On the question why there is opposition to the change, I point out that not only the senior legal establishment is involved. In general, police, magistrates, communities and local government are in favour of the change. However, I accept that the Government have not been as successful as we could have been in putting our argument across. As I said on Second Reading, the debate in the other place was—understandably dominated by barristers, and the wider argument did not get put. However, it is for the elected Chamber to decide such matters. Many of my hon. Friends on the Committee have experience of magistrates, local councils and so on, and they know about the needs of the community.
<P>
I have tried to deal with the issues as fully as possible, even if a tenor of irritability has crept in. I hope that the Committee will agree to the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I want to express the thanks of the whole Committee to you, Mr. Maxton, and to Mr. Sayeed, for the tolerant way in which you have overseen our proceedings. I thank the Clerks for their work, and also the attendants and Hansard staff. I thank Committee members for the friendly and amicable way in which the Bill has been discussed. I am especially grateful to the Bill team, which has worked extremely hard and which has tried to give the fullest possible information to the Committee. I express my thanks—and I hope that of all Labour Members—for all the work that has been done by that team and by everyone else.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I echo the Minister's comments. On behalf of the official Opposition, I thank you, Mr. Maxton, and Mr. Sayeed, for your chairmanship of our proceedings. I thank also all the others who were involved in the work of the Committee and to whom the Minister referred. This has been a high-quality Committee; we have had some very interesting debates that will be studied with great care not only in another place but outside the Palace of Westminster.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I join in thanking you, Mr. Maxton, and Mr. Sayeed. I thank our Clerk who has had a much easier time than Clerks have on many Committees, as so few amendments were tabled. I thank the Hansard staff, who have also had a much easier time than they do on some Committees, as our deliberations have been much shorter than such proceedings often are. I do not blame the civil servants for what they have done. I shall not thank them and I hope that they, like the Government, will come to realise before too long that it was all a big mistake.
<P>
I am sad that we did not hear more constructively critical comments from Labour Members, in spite of the offer that I understand was made with regard to Committee membership. I think that the Government will regret the Bill, but this has been a good Committee and the Minister has been his usual courteous, responsive and entirely responsible self, for which we are grateful. It adds to the merit of Committees that are considering legislation that we do not especially like when we realise that the Minister and his team are at least willing to engage constructively in the debate. We look forward to resuming our proceedings elsewhere before too long.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank hon. Members for their thanks to myself and to Mr. Sayeed, which I shall pass on. I thank also those to whom our gratefulness has already been expressed: the Hansard staff, attendants and police, who will pass on that gratitude to staff who have worked in the Committee in other sittings. I give special thanks to the Clerk, Mr. Priestley. Last time he and I worked together, a unique precedent was set in the House of Commons, as he used a laptop computer to do the cut and paste job that Clerks have to do. I regret personally that he did not do so again this time, as these precedents have to be set.
