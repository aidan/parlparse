							<b class="B">Grant
Shapps</b> (Welwyn Hatfield) (Con): I was outlining the
purpose of the amendment, which more or less says that formal
consultation should take place. Rather than being the informal process
that the Minister referred to, whereby this benign agency and
benevolent Minister in the future always look to do what is best for
the local areas, it should be enshrined in law. A presumption of
consultation should be built into the Bill; indeed, more than just a
presumption&#151;a requirement. That is what the amendment would
do.</div>
					<a name="08011634000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is true to say
that from everything we know of the Bill so far, much of its structure
replicates that of, in some cases, the authority that it might
replace&#151;in this case, the local authority. As such, it can
circumvent a large number of requirements that are incumbent on a local
authority before it pushes through its plans. I am thinking of district
or local plans, which are years in the making. The plans go out to
consultation and the authorities talk to local people, consider a
variety of different aspects, publish the plan in draft and then
publish the final copy. I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of
the House have been involved, at one time or another, with their
area&#146;s district or borough local plan. We know that that
document takes a huge amount of time, energy and effort to prepare. As
its requirement to exist is already laid down in law, it is reasonable
that that should mean something. The problem with the clause without
amendment No. 2 is that the Homes and Communities Agency can ride right
across whatever has been decided locally. That endangers the fabric of
local democracy&#151;the purpose of electing people who carry out a
district plan or, depending on the area, a local plan&#151;and the
good work that is done in the plan, and there would be no point in
having it in the first place.</div>

							<a name="08011634000399"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Mr. Iain Wright):
						</b> I
welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton. It is good
to see you.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div>
					<a name="08011634000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman has got to the crux of the argument on the clause and
the amendment. Does he agree that if the agency has local development
plans conferred on it, it will be required under the statutory planning
framework to go out to consultation if it wishes to amend them? It will
have the same responsibilities as the local planning authority, and
that is where consultation would come in. Is that not the
case?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000400"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> I, too, welcome you to the Chair,
Mr.
Benton.</div>
					<a name="08011634000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">With all due
respect to the Minister, that is not really the issue that we are
debating. We are saying that there is a form of retrospective
consultation, which comes in only after the HCA has, in effect, ridden
into town and taken over some of the responsibilities. Before that
happens&#151;before it gets that power&#151;it should first have a
duty to consult local authorities. The argument that the Minister
presses is that once it has decided to take over those powers it will
then, under other clauses in the Bill, have a duty placed on it to
consult. Our argument is that it is right to consult up front, and with
good reason. For example, in an area where the local authority has
already looked at its district or local plan and decided that building
houses in a particular location is a good or bad idea&#151;it has
already gone through not only the consultation to create that local
plan, but also a great deal of local consultation to discuss the issue
with local residents and has come to a determination, which let us say
in this case is no&#151;it is perfectly possible, with the
legislation as it stands, that the HCA will be able to ride into town
and override all that local decision-making
process.</div>
					<a name="08011634000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08011634000401"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Love</b> (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op): I urge the hon.
Gentleman to be careful about using emotive words. My concern relates
not just to this amendment, but to others that we have debated. There
seems to be a competition between the Conservatives and Liberal
Democrats to see who can be most slavishly loyal to the local
community. Can he see any circumstances in which the local opinion of
which he is so supportive might not be appropriate? If we look back a
long time to when his party was last in government, it rode over any
local opinion in relation to setting up out-of-town shopping
centres.</div>
					<a name="08011634000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000402"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention gives me
an opportunity to say that I am absolutely, slavishly loyal to the
desires of local people, but that simultaneously I want more houses to
be built. An easy way of squaring the circle is to say that local
communities must have the power in their own hands&#151;they must
have the ability&#151;so that they are incentivised and know that the
services are going to follow where the houses are to be built. In
particular, as is the case in my constituency, they must be reassured
that their local facilities, such as hospitals, are not going to be
closed down when the Government are insisting that thousands of homes
are built in the local area. It is pretty much common sense to say that
if the Government were to frame legislation that incentivised local
communities, rather than bash them over the head when they suspect them
of being nimbies, they would find that much more housing was built. The
problem with the entire direction of the Bill&#151;the clause in
particular is a good way of highlighting it&#151;is that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div>temptation is to think that everything has to be run from Whitehall. It
does not; it can be run from local
communities.</div>
					<a name="08011634000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08011634000403"></a>
							<b class="B">Alistair
Burt</b> (North-East Bedfordshire) (Con):
Will my hon. Friend take into account&#151;is he
aware, indeed&#151;that the operation of housing finance and local
authority taxation has now reached the stage where in some areas
building more houses costs the council money? They do not get anything
back from it in local tax and more money goes out of their area. What
incentive is there for them to build houses, which we all want to see,
and to reach the Government target? Surely the approach that bottom-up
is best is the right way to
go.</div>
					<a name="08011634000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000404"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes an outstanding point because
it shows precisely where the Bill has missed the game in town. It
should enable communities to expand where they want to&#151;where
they are incentivised to. One of the ways to do that would be to allow
them to take the gain from having a wider and larger council tax base,
but the Bill does not address the issue. It fudges it; it insists that
those matters have to be run centrally. They do not. If 10,000 more
homes are built in one&#146;s patch, those people will pay council
tax. If they pay council tax, politicians can stand for election in
that area with a reasonable expectation of offering lower council tax
or improved services, but only if the Bill allows for it. However, it
fudges it and it misses the point.</div>
					<a name="08011634000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000405"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman mentioned the
word &#147;incentivise&#148; a number of times. Will he therefore
welcome the concept of the housing and planning delivery grant of
around &#163;510 million, which my right hon. friend the Minister for
Housing announced several months ago? It is precisely for that
purpose&#151;to ensure that where local authorities have the
responsibility to identify where housing needs are necessary, they will
be incentivised. Why did his Front-Bench spokesmen go out and say that
that was blackmail? Surely those statements are at odds. The grant is
either incentivising or it is blackmail. I do not understand the
Conservatives&#146; position on
this.</div>
					<a name="08011634000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000406"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> I thank the Minister for that as it gives us a
chance to clear something else up. I welcome the grant. It is a small
way&#151;relatively small, in housing terms&#151;of incentivising.
It takes over from the earlier grant, which was, I think, the housing
plan and I welcome that. However, I was also the one who said that it
looked like blackmail because&#151;I shall explain this clearly to
the Minister&#151;it comes from the same Government who still fail to
recognise that local people should be put in the driving seat. The
figures involved when compared with the cost of building 3 million
homes over a period of time, or even the limited time when the grant is
available over the next few years, are relatively trivial. It is
symbolic of how the Government think that all they need to do is to
hand down money from above. That is not how we should go about
incentivising communities. I am pleased the Minister has a real
interest in incentivising and that the clause has sparked his interest
in the subject.</div>
					<a name="08011634000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
way to incentivise communities is to use the money from within the
community with reformed section 106, the wider council tax base and by
not having one part of the Government working against 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div>the interests of another part of the Government&#151;for example, when
a hospital is closed but more homes are built. If we get the whole
system working in tandem, true localism will mean that we work to
incentivise from the bottom up. The Minister seems to believe that the
only way in which we can incentivise is to push money down from the top
and direct it centrally. In a sense, that is the problem with the
Government&#146;s
approach.</div>

Raynsford:
						</b> I refer the hon. Gentleman
back to the evidence session, our third sitting on the morning of
December 13. I think he was in Committee then. He will recall me asking
representatives from the Campaign to Protect Rural England about the
individual circumstance of a development on a brownfield site&#151;an
infill development in an urban area with more than adequate
infrastructure, hospitals, transport, all the rest&#151;that was
turned down by the local authority because of the feelings of local
people who did not want housing on that site. Without the ability of
the developer to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate and its decision
that the development was in accordance with the London plan, those
houses would not have been built. Does he recognise that it is not just
a question of incentivising communities? There are tensions and
conflicts, and we have to have a framework where the Government can
ensure that the overriding need for housing is met where it is
essential, and that where communities are wrong to oppose new housing,
that can be
overridden.</div>

						</b> I am grateful for the intervention none the less
because it gives me the opportunity to say that the problems in the
market are a result of the marketplace as it is&#151;of our planning
laws as they are. When those circumstances happen, and I recall the
right hon. Gentleman&#146;s exchange with the CPRE, they are because
of the status quo. However, the Bill is not about the status quo; it is
about changing the future. There is barely a politician in this country
who is not elected on the basis of being anti-development, because
politically that makes sense in their
areas.</div>

Shapps:
						</b> Surely the right hon. Gentleman
recognises that he is one of the very few exceptions up and down the
land. The reality is that local people have legitimate concerns. The
problem with the framework of the legislation in terms of planning and
housing is that it fails to recognise those legitimate concerns. I am
trying to describe a situation, with the help of the clause, that would
shift us to a position in which people in this country could, finally,
be elected on the basis of being pro-development politicians. When that
happens over 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 265</div>two or three electoral cycles&#151;when we have people in this country
who have stood for election saying, &#147;Yes, I&#146;ll back those
10,000 houses over there, but in return we&#146;re going to keep this
local hospital open. I&#146;ll back those 10,000 houses, but
we&#146;re going to use section 106 to rebuild our town centre.
I&#146;ll back those 10,000 houses, but we&#146;re going to keep
the council tax receipts to ensure, over a tapered period of time, that
we can provide better services to the local
community&#148;&#151;and when there is something in it for local
people, they will vote for
it.</div>

to reflect on is the Minister&#146;s earlier intervention, which
suggested that, because consultation would take place after the HCA had

that we were debating and discussing for the 10 minutes before the

George Young</b> (North-West Hampshire) (Con): I congratulate
my hon. Friend on what he has just said, and he need make no apologies
for the passion injected into some of the earlier sections of his
speech. I want to support amendment No. 2, which seeks to soften any
injustice that might be done between the existing local plan and the
proposals that the HCA have for that area.</div>
					<a name="08011634000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think I am right in saying
that every part of the country is now covered by a local plan. The plan
has gone through an exhaustive procedure, the Minister has had the
power to intervene and amend it if he so wishes, and it is then
adopted. The thrust of planning policy for the past 20 years has been
to inject more certainty into the planning process, so that people know
that what is in the local plan is going to happen, and it is less
likely that an appeal will succeed. That is the context in which clause
14 and amendment No. 2 should be placed, as clause 14 allows the HCA to
become the local planning authority.</div>

responsibilities as the local planning authority. Will he confirm that
when he replies? The local planning authority has to go round quite a
protracted course in the preparation of the local plan. The Minister
said that the HCA has the same responsibility: will he confirm that it
will have to do exactly what the local authority does when it comes up
with its alternative proposals for the designated area?</div>
					<a name="08011634000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would also be helpful to
know whether the Minister can call in something that the HCA proposes
to do as the local planning authority. Is it susceptible to the same
power of intervention&#151;in respect of what it is seeking to
do&#151;as a local authority? Is it the case that, under this clause,
the HCA, if it were designated for the whole of a local authority area,
could simply produce a new local plan? As I understand it, that is
exactly what is proposed.</div>
					<a name="08011634000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">In an earlier debate, the
Minister said that the objective of the HCA in this part of the Bill
was to give additional help and support to a local authority. I take
that to mean help and support in enabling the local authority to
deliver what is in the plan, which is a wholly admirable objective. But
this is something slightly different: the proposal is not help and
support for the local authority in doing something that it is
struggling to do, but a change to the land use of the area of the local
authority. Will the Minister sketch in the circumstances in which those
powers will be used, and the process that the HCA will go through as
the local planning authority? Will he confirm that it will indeed have
to do exactly what the local authority did when it came up with its
original local
plan?</div>

confident that it will be incumbent on the HCA to respect the
responsibilities outlined by the two previous speakers, will he cite
where in legislation that commitment is enshrined? Such a commitment
would ensure that the HCA fulfils the obligations that have been
highlighted and that the amendment seeks to put back

fundamental, if not ideological, differences between the two main
parties. I was fascinated by the hon. Member for Welwyn
Hatfield&#146;s somewhat contradictory position: being in favour of
incentivising local authorities, but when it happens saying that they
are being blackmailed and that it is a top-down approach. The
&#163;8.5 billion that we have pledged to affordable housing, which
is a 50 per cent. increase on the previous comprehensive spending
review period, is a massive incentive that will be spent locally. Local
authorities are key to this

contradiction. One element is the reality of the situation as it stands
at the moment. We welcome the money that will come down in order to
encourage development, but I ask him to keep it in mind that that is
not the reality that we would like. We are able to dream that in the
future we will have legislation under which that would not be the best
way to handle housing development. Therefore, we can both praise the
amount of money and call it a cynical bribe if future legislation is
not very different from this

go. The Minister was keen to indicate that Conservative Members are
fierce in defence of their local areas if they feel that they are
inappropriate for development. He used that to indicate that we are
against development. He must address the point that Cabinet Ministers,
including the Secretary of State for Transport, the right hon. Member
for Bolton, West (Ruth Kelly), have been featured in the press as being
fierce opponents of planning developments in their constituencies. He
cannot avoid the point that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div>Members will act in defence of their own interests. That applies to
Members on both sides of the House, including Ministers. I cannot see
that he can get away from

entirely consistent for hon. Members to reject planning developments in
their areas when they are inappropriate in terms of poor
design&#151;that is a particularly important point&#151;or if they
do not think that they are in the right areas; I would encourage hon.
Members to reject such planning developments. That is not inconsistent
with saying that we need more homes. On my own patch, there is a real
need for affordable social housing and I can think of a particular area
where it would be appropriate. I do not think that the local authority
will put something there, but I will be campaigning for more homes in
that area. It is right and proper for Members of this House to be
representatives for our own constituencies. Hon. Members should have a
view as to where appropriate developments could take place. That is not
contrary to my
point.</div>

what the Minister says is the case, he should move away from rhetoric
that says, &#147;Oh, it&#146;s only Members on the other side who
do that&#148;, because that was what he said. It is like using a year
zero argument&#151;he suggests that nothing happened before 1997, and
only Conservative Members object to housing developments. That is not
the case. If he is now making the point that Members act correctly when
they defend the interests of local communities over a development that
they think is inappropriate, or when they support planning developments
that they think are right, he should acknowledge that that affects
Members on both sides of the House. It is not a party matter as he
indicated.</div>

						</b> I appreciate that comment. I
respect the hon. Gentleman enormously and I think that his views are
sincerely held. However, I spend a lot of my time answering
correspondence from Members on both sides of the House. A high
proportion of correspondence from Opposition Members relates to
development and housing, and says, &#147;We don&#146;t want
development in our area&#148;. Contrary to that, I receive letters
from Labour Members that say, &#147;Can we have more houses
please?&#148; There is a dividing line between the parties on this
matter. We welcome the need for more homes and embrace it. To address
the significant challenges that we have had for a generation, we need
more homes, but I think the Opposition believe that we do
not.</div>

ill with the action taken by the former Secretary of State for his
Department, the right hon. Member for Bolton, West, because she would
cause the Minister concern on those grounds. The Opposition do not
accept what the Minister said. Those on the Conservative Front Bench
have made it clear that we want more development. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Welwyn Hatfield&#151;he is leading the fight&#151;said,
we want to encourage more development and to help the Government. We
are doing that by indicating that a bottom-up approach is better than a
top-down approach. That is the issue between the parties and I do not
believe that we will agree on it. For the record, that is the
appropriate description of the position of the Conservative Front
Bench.</div>

tells me that there is a party political divide on the
matter.</div>
					<a name="08011634000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is right
and proper that consultation is recognised as a key stage of engagement
with public and stakeholder organisations. It ensures that decisions
are informed, because we will listen to those who might be affected by
new proposals. I would suggest that the Government have done more. We
are going back to the year zero approach that was described in an
earlier sitting. Since 1997, the Government have done a lot to ensure
that local people have much more say on decisions that will affect
them, which is right and proper.</div>
					<a name="08011634000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe
that that was the sentiment behind the amendment. Although I fully
respect the intentions of the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield, there is
a danger that the measure would lead to a situation in which
consultation is an end in itself. The purposes that would be served by
such a consultation are served via other routes, and the amendment
would add another layer to an already robust process, and a level of
unnecessary bureaucracy.</div>
					<a name="08011634000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">To provide an
example, I shall address a point made by the right hon. Member for
North-West Hampshire. If development plans are conferred on the Homes
and Communities Agency&#151;that is a big &#147;if&#148;, because
such a situation would be rare&#151;it would have to engage in
consultation before preparing the development plan documents. The
agency would need to undertake a formal procedure for accepting
representations on plans, hold a public examination of the plan, and
comply with the inspector&#146;s binding recommendations on it. In
short, it would involve exactly the sort of thing that a local planning
authority, possibly a local authority, is required to do. That level of
consultation would be required if the agency took over planning
powers.</div>

in keeping with it. The clause goes into some detail on the
matter.</div>
					<a name="08011634000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Placing on
the agency a requirement to undertake formal consultation with the
local authority, and to organise public information and consultation
meetings with local community organisations and local people in respect
of any development in a designated area, as set out in the amendment,
is unnecessary. Any development would have to be in accordance with the
development plan. I have already set out the level of consultation that
would be required for the agency to make changes to the development
plan documents. In addition, it would have to publicise any
applications for development that were made, including any that it was
involved with&#151;that will help to address the potential conflict
of interest&#151;so that interested parties could comment, as they
can with any other proposed development in any part of the local
planning authority&#146;s area.</div>

desperately needed in such areas. Fewer homes would be built more
slowly. As we have seen from the cross-party consensus in the past few

not what the Committee wants. It certainly is not the purpose of the

Wright:
						</b> I sought clarification and enlightenment over the
lunch break and I should like to update the Committee regarding
Government amendments Nos. 23 and 27. I think it may help if I put
things into context. When an area is designated under clause 13,
functions may be conferred on the Homes and Communities Agency. Clause
14 sets out the functions that may be conferred, including local
planning authority functions, for all or in specified permitted
purposes, and functions that are non-local planning authority functions
but are planning-related.</div>
					<a name="08011634000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 27 sets out which non-local planning authorities have
those planning-related functions. In this morning&#146;s sitting, I
gave the example of a district planning authority function in relation
to enforcement notice registers. Another example would be the hazardous
substances authority. If functions are conferred concurrently, the HCA
would continue to have a role in the designated area for which it has
planning powers, but it will also have some responsibility regarding
hazardous substances. Those would work together.</div>
					<a name="08011634000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
this morning, Government amendments Nos. 23 and 27 are intended to
clarify which functions that are not local planning authority functions
may be conferred on the agency under the designation order. The hon.
Member for Welwyn Hatfield mentioned the Mayor of London. We had an
interesting debate on the Floor of the House during oral
questions about the Mayor. The hon. Gentleman seemed concerned that the
planning functions of the Mayor could be conferred under the Government
amendments. I assure him and the Committee that that is not the case.
The powers of the Mayor are not touched by the
amendments.</div>

relationship be between the agency and the local authority? I do not
necessarily expect an answer today, but will the Minister reflect on
that and drop a line to the Committee about how it would work? I
presume that there would still be an arrangement with the local
authority, because it would have education and others things to do. It
is quite important, even if this never happens, that some thought is
given, if the HCA becomes a planning authority, as to how the
section 106 agreement for planning gain would
operate.</div>

have tabled the amendment with my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives,
who is on his way. He is also preparing for Government, as we speak.
The clause is about the adoption of private streets. It is quite
comprehensive in the outline of the requirements for the HCA in that
regard, but one thing seems to be missing. There does not seem to be an
explicit provision to enable any resident of a private street to submit
a request to the HCA for the adoption of that
street.</div>
					<a name="08011634000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is born out of a recent experience I had in my own constituency, where
the residents of a street in the town of Caersws were desperate for it
to be adopted. There was a very strong case for it, but I do not need
to go into the details. I had the greatest difficulty convincing the
local authority that it was a good
idea.</div>
					<a name="08011634000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause, with
the amendment, provides the opportunity of a formal avenue for
residents to pursue in order to have their street adopted.
Unfortunately for the people of Caersws, the legislation applies only
to England, so it is an act of altruism on my part. Should the Minister
accept the amendment, I shall seek to lobby the Welsh Assembly to
introduce something similar. I hope that the Minister will give a
considered response to the logic behind
it.</div>

Department for Transport, need to look into that matter, because a
common pattern seems to be emerging on former coal sites&#151;whether
they need to be adopted and what the agency could do in that regard. I
shall be happy to report back to my hon. Friend, who I thank for
raising the point, because it has clicked into place for me other
pieces of the jigsaw, for which I am
grateful.</div>
					<a name="08011634000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is unnecessary, because there is nothing now to prevent
residents of a street asking the highways authority to adopt their
street, whether they ask directly, or ask the Homes and Communities
Agency to intercede on their behalf. However, I suggest that stating in
the Bill that they may submit such requests to the agency would
probably&#151;the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire might counter
this&#151;raise an unrealistic expectation that the agency will act
on their request and serve an adoption notice on the street works
authority. Furthermore, it could increase the risk that the agency
could be seen as an unofficial appeals process when a street works
authority refuses the residents&#146; request. That is not the
purpose of the clause, and nor do I think that it is the purpose
of the amendment. The clause is intended to ensure that the
investment by the Homes and Communities Agency to improve highways can
be properly maintained by the appropriate highways authority. I
therefore invite him to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

						</b> I was the victim of the Minister&#146;s
harsh tongue earlier on, and if I may be forgiven for saying so, I
regarded his response as intransigent rubbish&#151;I feel a lot
better for having said that. He said that having a formal avenue of
application for residents might create an unrealistic expectation, yet
every year the Budget statement creates an unrealistic expectation, and
now, with the pre-Budget statement, we have two unrealistic
expectations about the economy. But they are aspirational, and so is my
amendment. It would mean that a member of the public&#151;let us
remember that we are doing this for the public&#151;can see
explicitly that he or she has the right to make an application to the
HCA.</div>

as a member of the public, to make a formal application for
adoption.&#148; I understand that Ministers are always loth to modify
any Bill on the basis of Opposition amendments, but given that we have
already passed a number of Government amendments, the Minister should
acknowledge that the Bill is not perfect. I am willing to withdraw the
amendment on one condition: that he will, at some point in the next
week, have an informal meeting with me, so that I can put my case and
allow him to see the logic of my proposal, which is not party
political, but common sense. If he can assure me that we will at least
have that conversation, I shall withdraw the amendment&#151;but I
cannot sit down until he either intervenes, or I push the amendment to

						</b> These short amendments deal with the power to enter
and survey land. Amendment No. 64 would provide a period of notice for
people who may be expected to accept somebody from the Homes and
Communities Agency coming on to their land to survey it or to represent
the HCA. The other amendment is designed to protect those who may be
subject to the powers being applied to them by officers from the HCA.
These probing amendments are intended to elicit from the Minister some
guidance on how these powers should be
used.</div>
					<a name="08011634000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will probably be aware that for a lengthy period, national periodicals
such as <i class="I">The Mail on Sunday</i> and other newspapers have run a
series of stories concerned with inspectors&#146; powers to enter
people&#146;s property for various purposes, whether to follow up
council tax demands, assess the size of houses, photograph bedrooms,
toilets and so on, or to support claims being made by the customs and
valuation authorities, all of which come from guidance issued by the
Government that is available for people to read, and all of which have
been rejected by the Government as scare stories, saying, &#147;There
is no truth in those things; they will never happen.&#148; However,
they have not been able to give a satisfactory explanation of why such
wide-ranging powers have been given to officers. We are following up on
the same lines
today.</div>
					<a name="08011634000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
mentioned on a number of occasions that the agency is not simply a
result of the happy merger of English Partnerships and the Housing
Corporation: the combination of the two gives considerable powers to
the new agency. The potential for conflict of interest for those who
acquire, develop and sell on can be considerable. In each area of the
agency&#146;s work, there should be a belt-and-braces approach to
ensure that the public are not being traduced in any way and that the
powers will be used with the greatest sensitivity, whether they relate
to inquiry proposals, to the matters we discussed this morning
regarding easements for right of way, or whether they apply to the
considerable powers given by the Government to those in authority to go
on to other people&#146;s property and do various things. There is a
need to ensure that we have some idea, through guidance from the
Minister, about how these powers are to be used. That is most
important.</div>
					<a name="08011634000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 66, the Minister will note, would remove the power of the criminal
law to be used in relation to an individual who may not know why
someone came on to their land if notice had not been given, and who
objects to that individual. To invoke the criminal law in those
circumstances might be to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut. I ask the
Minister to think again about
that.</div>
					<a name="08011634000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
background to the amendments and our concerns. I am sure that the
Minister will agree that he does not want to see any more stories in
the national papers saying, &#147;Why are this draconian Government
taking so many heavy powers to crack down on the everyday
citizen?&#148; Here is a chance for him to respond and explain and,
by amending the Bill, to give an opportunity for such stories relating
to these powers not to appear.</div>

							<a name="08011634000451"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman was extremely
helpful. He expressed the amendments in a characteristically thoughtful
and sensitive manner, which helped me to sense where his main concerns
lie. However, he may have overlooked the proper statutory context of
the power.</div>
					<a name="08011634000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 19
sets out a power that relates to the process of acquiring land under
clause 9, whether those purchases are made by agreement or in exercise
of the agency&#146;s compulsory purchase powers. The hon. Gentleman I
think recognises that the clause has a strictly practical purpose. Yes,
it allows an authorised person to enter a person&#146;s land, but the
wording makes it clear that the power arises only in connection with a
proposal by the agency to acquire land.</div>
					<a name="08011634000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
only two reasons for which the agency is empowered to enter a
person&#146;s land&#151;first, to carry out a survey; and secondly,
to value land to assess the amount of compensation to be paid. The
clause also authorises entry on to someone&#146;s land in connection
with a proposal by the agency to acquire some other person&#146;s
land, but that is simply a practical point. It may be necessary for a
surveyor to assess a party wall or to access land. Soil surveys will be
essential if accurate valuations of contaminated land are to be made,
and the hon. Gentleman will be aware that clean-up costs can vary
depending on what substances are found.</div>
					<a name="08011634000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments seek to limit a
necessary power, and I shall respond to each in turn. In general,
however, I assure the hon. Gentleman that the power simply enables
those same procedural elements that take place in every normal private
sale to take place in the statutory
context.</div>
					<a name="08011634000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000452"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> I am slightly afraid to ask, but are the powers
modelled on any other powers, so that we can compare and contrast
them&#151;or does the Minister need some inspiration on the
question?</div>
					<a name="08011634000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000453"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> No, I am already inspired. The provision is
similar to section 163 of the 1993 Act and is modelled on provisions
similar to those found in Acts governing the regional development
agencies and urban development corporations.</div>
					<a name="08011634000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to amendment No. 64.
Subsections (1) and (2) of clause 19 operate together and mean that at
least 28 days&#146; notice is required before an authorised person
can demand entry on to land for the purpose of surveying it or
estimating its value. Taking the clause as a whole, it is clear that
subsection (1) is to be read in the light of subsection (2). I
therefore suggest that it is unnecessary to repeat in subsection (1)
the notice requirement provided in subsection (2). In that respect, I
invite the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08011634000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
take this opportunity to tell the Committee that we are considering
whether the drafting of clause 19 makes it sufficiently clear that the
notice requirements apply in all cases of intended entry. As I said a
moment ago, we are clear that subsections (1) and (2) are to be read
together, so that notice must be given before an authorised person can
enter the land. That is our firm intention, even when land is not
occupied in the conventional sense of the word, as referred to at line
26, clause 19(2)(b). We will therefore be considering whether the
drafting requires clarification.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div>
					<a name="08011634000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 65 would restrict the land that could be entered and surveyed or
valued to that which the HCA is proposing to acquire compulsorily.
However, it is also necessary for the agency to be able to enter land
for surveying or valuation purposes even when the sale is by agreement.
In many cases, if land is acquired by agreement the landowner is a
willing seller, and I presume that he would be content to allow an
authorised person entry on to the land in connection with the sale. The
situation is similar to a survey of one&#146;s house, whether it is
to survey the property or to value the land. In such cases, I suggest
that the agency would not need to enforce its right to enter.</div>
					<a name="08011634000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
vendor may decide at a late stage in the compulsory purchase process to
proceed by agreement, which is some time after the agency needs to
enter the land in order to survey and value it. The amendment would
hinder the process. With the greatest respect, it is probably contrary
to its intended effect and could be quite unhelpful. It could even
result in forcing the agency to complete an acquisition via the
compulsory purchase route in circumstances in which the landowner would
otherwise be willing to sell by agreement. That, in turn, is likely to
lead to unnecessary delay in site acquisition. In addition, the
amendment may prevent the clause from applying to other
situations&#151;for example, if the owner agreed to sell the agency
the property, but a tenant of the property did not want to allow the
agency access to the land. The amendment is neither necessary nor
useful, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw
it.</div>

the early &#146;80s. My goodness, the definition of

far off days are a long way from where they are today, but we will
refer to that on another occasion. We have had a long and enjoyable
relationship over the years, and I am glad that he still enjoys my
remarks&#151;as, indeed I enjoy his. Long may it continue.</div>
					<a name="08011634000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 19
will create an offence where an individual obstructs someone acting
under the powers of the HCA when entering land. As I have said before,
the concern is whether the measure is a little heavy&#151;whether
this should be an offence or a civil matter&#151;and whether it will
raise the stakes in circumstances where feelings might be running high.
There may be a contentious purchase in circumstances that we cannot
currently envisage but that we know can occur&#151;over a contested 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div>piece of land and a contested issue. Temperatures might be high
regarding an HCA purchase and a development that may cause concern
locally. Will the Minister consider whether creating an offence is
really
necessary?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000459"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I suggest that amendment No. 66
has the potential to render clause 19 entirely redundant because it
would effectively make the power unenforceable. Why should it not be an
offence intentionally to stop someone entering land to survey it or to
estimate its value within the framework of the proper exercise of the
statutory power? Clause 19 requires the authorised person to be able to
produce evidence of their authorisation to enter the land before they
do so. Any proposed entry must be at a reasonable time and the Homes
and Communities Agency must have given at least 28 days&#146; notice
of the intended entry.</div>
					<a name="08011634000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having gone
through those entirely reasonable and standard steps, why should the
agency then be unable to enforce its right of entry if someone
deliberately prevents its representative from carrying out their
duties? I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman about
amendments Nos. 64 and 65, but I am surprised that he has pushed
amendment No. 66, because he will be delighted to hear that the clause
is modelled on an equivalent provision in the Leasehold Reform, Housing
and Urban Development Act 1993, as well as on other Acts, such as the
Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980. I imagine that he had
something to do with the former measure.</div>
					<a name="08011634000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I stress that the powers are
necessary to ensure that the purchase of land progresses smoothly, that
land is accurately surveyed, and that the seller is appropriately
recompensed for the land. That enforcement is important to move swiftly
on, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

on the matter, but I will simply say that, as the Minister will be
aware from Question Time in the House today, concerns are being raised
in the news about the London Development Agency and the problems
associated with the giving of large amounts in the circumstances that
are being investigated. That, understandably, raises in the
public&#146;s mind concern about the power of the Government or their
agencies to handle large sums of public money and to distribute it. To
try to ensure that before we get to the stage of worrying about where
the money has gone, who might be responsible and whether it is being
misused, there should be sufficient checks in place to ensure that that
is not an issue, or at least no more of an issue than it is in the
normal run of affairs involving public bodies that must be accountable
with proper
audit.</div>
					<a name="08011634000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
reason behind my amendment, which, in some cases, would provide
guidance. It would assure the public that there would be provisions to
ensure that the Secretary of State had regard to the repayment of money
and to the setting out of circumstances. That would protect the HCA in
cases when there might be a problem recovering the
money.</div>
					<a name="08011634000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we can move
slightly beyond the amendment to the clause as a whole, I should be
grateful if the Minister would assist us. The clause states that
financial assistance may be given to any person. Precisely who is
intended? The main recipients might be obvious, but who are the
unlikely recipients? Where should this money be going? Surely it is
very broad to indicate that financial assistance of &#147;any
form&#148; may be given to &#147;any person&#148;. As I said
earlier, where do we all apply? There must be some rules that the
Minister is already considering, so let us have some sense of what they
might be. I fully appreciate that they must be in line with the objects
of the agency, as set out at the beginning of the Bill, but I think
that we are entitled to find out a little more.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 279</div>
					<a name="08011634000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
I stress that the width of the powers given to the agency to distribute
finance, as well as the width of the powers given to the agency
right the way through the Bill, must be set against the exceptional
powers of an agency that can acquire land, develop it and sell it on.
Again, I suggest that if one looks at the issues surrounding the
housing market renewal initiative in Liverpool&#151;concerns have
been raised by Committees of this House about how that initiative has
been used and question marks have been placed against the Housing
Corporation and the way in which it has handled its responsibility up
there&#151;the public are entitled to know just how these powers will
be handled and what might happen if things go wrong. That is the
sentiment behind the amendment and I would be grateful for some
guidance from the Minister.</div>

						</b> We have had a short debate, but
this is an important clause and an important amendment. I understand
what the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire was striving for by
tabling the amendment, but I suggest, with the greatest of respect,
that it is not needed.</div>
					<a name="08011634000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I like the way in which these
themes are emerging in our discussions, but the amendment, which is
based on the corresponding section in the Leasehold Reform, Housing and
Urban Development Act 1993, would require the agency to attach specific
terms and conditions when providing financial assistance, rather than
allowing the flexibility, as is currently the case, to attach such
terms and conditions as it feels are appropriate in the
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="08011634000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (4) allows for that
flexibility. It should be remembered that the agency might be dealing
with small local bodies as well as large national bodies when it
provides assistance. I think that the hon. Gentleman would probably
agree that the terms and conditions attached would no doubt be
different in each case. Also, let us not forget that subsection (1)
requires the agency to obtain</div>
					<a name="08011634000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the consent of the Secretary of
State&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011634000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">prior to giving
that
assistance.</div>
					<a name="08011634000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked for further clarification about who would be able
to access funding. I would like to put on record that I suggest that
assistance would go to agencies that were focused on improving the
supply and quality of housing and also on the regeneration of
communities. They will be able to access funding from the HCA, and I
suggest that that would include registered social landlords, housing
associations and local authorities. We have talked a lot this afternoon
about the importance of local authorities. We have talked throughout
our discussions about the importance of local authorities stepping up
to the plate so that they are able to deliver the housing needed in
their area. I imagine that they will be able to secure financial
assistance from the HCA to do so.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000467"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> The Minister has mentioned agencies and local
authorities. Under the provision, would it be possible for money to go
to private building companies and development
companies?</div>
					<a name="08011634000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000468"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> It is certainly not inconceivable. Yes, it could
be possible. I would suggest that &#147;any person&#148; could
receive financial assistance in that respect, but it must be given in
full accordance with the agency&#146;s objectives. I would suggest
that that wide power is needed to enable the agency to meet its
objectives. Therefore, I do not really see any merit in placing the
agency under a duty to include the conditions in the amendment on each
instance that it provides financial assistance. The agency will be
accountable for the way in which it handles its finances, and it will
therefore be able to account properly for its financial transactions.
On that basis, and given the discussion that we have had, I hope that
the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08011634000469"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s response. We
have now introduced a slightly different word in that he said that the
clause was &#147;based&#148; on legislation, as opposed to being
modelled on it. I am very interested to know what the distinction
between the two might be. The amendment is based on legislation to
reflect the existing provisions relating to the powers of English
Partnerships, as set out in section 164 of the Leasehold Reform,
Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. The Minister has extended those
powers, and I was seeking clarification, which he has given partially,
on allowing greater flexibility to the Homes and Communities
Agency.</div>
					<a name="08011634000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I humbly
suggest that further work is needed on the production of
information&#151; either from the agency or the
Department&#151;about the intention behind these powers, how they
will be used and what safeguards there should ultimately be. If the
safeguards are not in the Act, clear guidance ought to be laid down. If
the Minister can say that there is a commitment to consider providing
further guidance on how these powers should be used and explain why he
has moved away from the model to a different base, I will probably be
prepared to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000470"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I am grateful for that. The way in which the
clause has been drafted represents a modern approach. As I suggested
earlier, the clause allows the agency, when giving assistance, to have
the flexibility to set such terms and conditions as it considers
appropriate. I reiterate the point that I made a moment or two ago
about the sort of organisations that will receive financial assistance.
That could be RSLs or housing associations. As I said to the hon.
Member for Poole, it could be private companies. It is important to put
it on record that the way in which that occurs will not compromise
state aid rules. Given that this is a modern drafting approach, and
given my hope that I have clarified some of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
concerns, I hope that he will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08011634000472"></a>Sir
George Young:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I have a very short question to put
to the Minister in connection with clause 22(1), under which the
HCA</div>
					<a name="08011634000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may, with the
consent of the Secretary of State, give financial assistance to any
person.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011634000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, that
consent will not be needed, and should not be needed, for every single
piece of grant that is given. I am after the HCA&#146;s level of
delegation below which it will not have to apply to the Secretary of
State for consent, and above which, because of the size of the
transaction and the nature of the commitment, reference to the
Department will be needed. It will be helpful if the Minister can shed
some light on the degree of financial autonomy that the HCA will have
under subsection
(1).</div>
					<a name="08011634000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking
slightly further ahead, I assume that when we get to clauses 49 and 50,
under which the Secretary of State can give directions and consents,
one of the consents that he might give would be a derogation in
connection with clause 22(1). It would be helpful to have a feel of the
confidence that the Minister has in the HCA by knowing the level below
which it will be free to dispense public money without reference to the
Department.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000473"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:
						</b> My point relates to the clause as a whole. It
is obvious that the HCA can carry out its work only if it has
substantial access to funds and wide latitude to allocate the funds
pretty much as laid out in this clause. My great concern is that the
Government are notoriously bad at negotiating with the private sector.
Time after time, in my life as a local councillor in Newcastle upon
Tyne and now as a parliamentarian, I have observed the private sector
taking advantage of the naivety of the public sector in negotiations.
That is not because the private sector is evil, but because it is
motivated to secure the best deal that it can. It sometimes gets a
better deal than it could ever have imagined or hoped for when it works
with the Government. I therefore ask the Minister what kind of
safeguards will be in place to ensure that clause 22&#151;and,
indeed, chapter 3 as a whole&#151;does not signal a green light to
opportunity and untold profits at the cost of the taxpayer through the
HCA. I cannot see a way of avoiding the important financial freedoms
the HCA has, but I sincerely hope that this will not be yet another
illustration of the Government acting naively in the face of very
shrewd operators and costing us
billions.</div>

Syms:
						</b> I have similar concerns. This is
an extremely widely drawn clause, and probably rightly so. In order to
deliver the Government&#146;s objectives, one clearly needs all the
levers here: grants, loans, indemnities, and so on. I do not see how to
get hundreds of thousands of homes without involving the private sector
and the public sector in some kind of partnership. Who would audit this
particular body? Would it be the Audit Commission? Who keeps an eye on
all the deals being done under the auspices of the HCA? I really would
like to know that, because this could involve joint companies, PFI
schemes and a whole range of things in a number of developments in
order to meet the Government&#146;s targets, and I am concerned as to
what the audit trail will be and how we will keep an eye on what is
going on in various developments.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000475"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> This is an important debate, and
an important clause that sets out the idea that we need to spend money
in order to achieve our objectives of 3 million new homes by
2020; but we cannot throw public money away. Clause 22 enables the HCA
to provide financial assistance to any person. This power is
deliberately wide. Financial assistance is defined to include grants,
loans, guarantees or indemnities, investments or incurring expenditure
for the benefit of the person assisted. It is mainly through the
provision of funding&#151;through, for example, the Housing
Corporation&#146;s affordable housing programme, English
Partnerships&#146; regeneration funding streams, and funding for
specific programmes such as growth areas and decent homes&#151;that
the agency will be able to drive forward regeneration and housing
delivery. As we discussed in relation to clause 5, the agency will have
the power to build homes directly should it prove necessary, and I was
taken by the discussion that I had with the right hon. Gentleman on
that basis, in which he probed and questioned me on that. As I made
clear, the new agency will not be as well equipped as the house
building industry or registered social landlords to play an active role
in construction, which is why it will have to be involved with RSLs and
private companies. Its role will be focused primarily on providing
funding, facilitating work between partners and undertaking projects
that make the building of homes in some areas attractive to, and
possible for, developers. The agency will build on the successes of the
investment programmes of English Partnerships, the Housing Corporation
and the Department for Communities and Local Government through an end
to funding silos and increased funding flexibility, as I mentioned
during the clause 1 stand part debate.</div>
					<a name="08011634000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The financial
assistance may be given on such terms and conditions as the HCA
considers appropriate. This power is absolutely vital to the power of
the agency to deliver its objects. A number of members mentioned
specific concerns relating to funding delegated limits and the audit
trail of the agency. As to whether the HCA would always need to go to
the Secretary of State for consent to spend money, there is likely to
be a general consent. In relation to the point on clause 10, we will
probably have a fairly substantial debate on clause 50 in a later
sitting. I note the crucial part in all this played by the
agency&#146;s tasking framework and financial memorandum in terms of
governance architecture. I have had dealings with some regional
development agencies in respect of that financial memorandum and I had
responsibility for delegated limits at One NorthEast. I imagine that
there will be a similar system for funding delegated limits in
conjunction with Government accounting rules and ensuring that good
value for money is provided.</div>

							<a name="08011634000477"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Yes, we will move on to
borrowing powers later. The hon. Gentleman also asked about the audit
arrangements. As a former auditor, I find this incredibly interesting,
so I give notice to the Committee that I will be talking at some length
about the agency&#146;s auditing arrangements. Let me make it clear:
the Comptroller and Auditor General will be responsible for auditing
the external audits of the agency. That 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 283</div>might be outsourced to a big four firm or whatever, and I imagine that
the agency will have an internal audit function to ensure that there is
value for money and effectiveness in terms of how it spends and
accounts for its cash. That is an important point&#151;I imagine that
the audit functions will work in entirely the same way as in the
regional development
agencies.</div>

							<a name="08011634000478"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:
						</b> I admire the Minister&#146;s optimism and
faith in the audit process. Just about everything that the Government
do is audited, apart from, apparently, the European Union, but that is
another story. My concern is that the audit trail can highlight money
that has been wasted, but is unlikely to warn us of money that is about
to be wasted. Therefore I ask the Minister again what assurance we can
have that the HCA will not end up becoming a massive opportunity for
the private sector to make money out of the state by sharp negotiation
and the naivety of the Government, as has sometimes been seen in such
negotiations?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000479"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> In earlier sessions, we spoke
about the importance of a good chief executive to provide strategic
direction for the agency. I also suggest that an important and strong
director of finance or public resources will be key to the
implementation and introduction of rigorous financial controls and
procedures to ensure that agency money is not wasted. With regard to
governance arrangements, I expect that the Audit Commission will have a
clear role in ensuring that it is reassured with regard to how the
money is spent. That governance framework is key. Again, the importance
of the internal audit function, working together with the Audit
Commission and providing strong leadership through a chief executive or
director of finance, will be key to ensuring that money is not wasted
by the agency.</div>

						</b> As a former member of the Public Accounts Committee,
may I commend to my hon. Friend the good work carried out by the
National Audit Office? May I also bring to his attention the fact that
the National Audit Office has had difficulty with the Housing
Corporation in relation to following the trail of public money that
went from there to other housing bodies that were independently audited
by other organisations. It is important to reassure the Committee that
whatever arrangements are followed with regard to the HCA, it will be
able to help whoever audits the HCA to follow that money trail wherever
it may lead, and whatever auditing functions it
has.</div>

high-profile organisation, and in terms of the Prime Minister&#146;s
pledge to provide 3 million new homes by 2020, and the key role that
the agency has to play in that, it will be entirely appropriate for the
board to consider this a major risk in terms of its outputs and
outcomes. I will suggest that the director of corporate resources or
the director of finance&#151;&#151;whatever they may be
called&#151;&#151;in conjunction with the internal audit function,
should ensure that there are absolute, robust procedures in place. They
should be able to carry out an audit trail and see where the money has
gone and what outputs and outcomes will be provided, so that, for
example, the money provided will have<b class="B"> </b>created 150,000 homes in a

of a financial framework that guarantees that even locally based

assumptions in this Committee about the particular role of the NAO as
against other bodies? Clearly, there will be partnerships with local
authorities that are subject to the Audit Commission, rather than the
NAO. Some of the difficulties that my hon. Friend the Member for
Edmonton referred to were in territory where there was doubt as to
whether it was appropriate for the NAO to be auditing organisations
that were of local significance and subject to another audit framework.
It is absolutely right that there must be robust audit arrangements and
I hope that when we come to consider the directions and the consents
under clauses 49 and 50 we may pursue this, but may I counsel against
being too precise at this stage about the exact arrangements that will

						</b> I have one or two small points. Looking at
subsection (1) about the short-term borrowings of the HCA, will those
fall within the financial limits referred to in clause 26 or will they
be outside the &#163;2,300 million that is set as the financial
limit? Perhaps the Minister could clarify whether they are within the
overall limit.</div>

(1) refers to the short-term management of the HCA&#146;s finances.
In the days when we used to have bank managers and I used to talk to
them, I often found that their interpretation of a short-term
arrangement was somewhat different from my own. I wonder whether there
is a definition of a short-term arrangement that would make it
absolutely clear whether borrowing fell within subsection (1), or
whether it was on a longer term
arrangement.</div>
					<a name="08011634000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to subsection (2), which is more serious for long-term borrowing, I am
intrigued about the HCA&#146;s rather restrictive line of credit. It
has to borrow either from the Secretary of State or the European
Investment Bank. I am not one of those in my party who gets frantically
excited about matters European, but it would be helpful to have an
explanation of why the European Investment Bank, alone among many other

agency&#146;s borrowings via the Secretary of State or the European
Investment Bank, may I point out to him that that is deliberate and in
common with former arrangements with organisations such as English

George Young:
						</b> I want to reflect on what the Minister said
just before he sat down, because it may come up again under clause 25.
It would be helpful if he could explain something about clause 24. I
ask the question out of ignorance. I assume that the HCA will get some
cash from the Government as well as having access to loans. Am I right
in thinking that the money that it spends will not just be raised by
borrowing, but that there will also be a cash budget for the HCA? If
so, in what circumstances will the money spent by the HCA be spent out
of the cash that is voted to it by the Government and in what
circumstances will the money that it spends have to be recovered by a
loan, either from the European Investment Bank or the
HCA?</div>
					<a name="08011634000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
respect of clause 2, when the HCA has to pay interest to the Secretary
of State, presumably on the long-term borrowing, it would be helpful if
the Minister could confirm that that is the arrangement under which the
Housing Corporation and English Partnerships are funded. I should be
interested to know the rate of interest that the predecessor
organisations have to pay to the Secretary of State on the money that
is outstanding by way of loan.</div>

							<a name="08011634000489"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I am grateful, I think, to the right hon.
Gentleman for his questions. I shall give the Committee examples of
instances in which the agency needs access to its finances but that is
not possible. In such circumstances a loan from the Secretary of State
may be the best way forward. I can confirm to the right hon. Gentleman
that the agency will receive a grant; it will not raise money solely
through borrowing. We expect that the vast majority of spending by the
agency will be funded by the grant and that borrowing will probably not
be the
norm.</div>
					<a name="08011634000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
agency needs flexibility in order to achieve its objectives and a grant
will be available from central Government. That flexibility is
important to ensure that it can have a loan if necessary, which is very
much in keeping with former regimes. For example, until 1998 the
Housing Corporation provided loans to registered social landlords to
help to develop new social housing. Those loans were funded by
short-term borrowing from the national loans fund; the
corporation&#146;s remaining loans portfolio, which covers core
ownership loans and guarantees, is part-funded by short-term borrowings
from the national loans fund, which is at present about &#163;1.4
million. The reason for the borrowing is purely historical, as all
loans were funded by
borrowings.</div>
					<a name="08011634000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Gentleman wanted to get a flavour of how often that sort of
borrowing takes place. English Partnerships has never borrowed or
received a loan from the Secretary of State. As I said a moment ago,
the Housing Corporation&#146;s borrowing is largely historical but
remains current in that respect. The Department did not provide any
grant in aid as financial assistance to fund redemption of the loans in
the Housing Corporation&#146;s loan portfolio. Any borrowing from the
new town development corporations was funded from the national loans
fund.</div>
					<a name="08011634000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposal
provides flexibility and another source of reasonable and prudent
funding, but it will probably not be the norm in how the agency funds
its
activities.</div>

						</b> I have another short intervention on loans
that are guaranteed by the Secretary of State. The Minister said that
in an earlier life he was an auditor. That means he has removed the
excuse of ignorance for the question that I am about to put to him.
Will the guarantees given by the Secretary of State under this clause
score so far as the public sector borrowing requirement is concerned?
Will they form part of the calculation towards the golden rule? The
clause makes it quite clear that if the Secretary of State gives a
guarantee, Parliament has to be told about it, so the information will
be in the public domain. It would be helpful to know whether the
guarantees given under this clause will go towards the total liability
of the Government and therefore score against the PSBR and the
Chancellor&#146;s golden rule?</div>

under the financial limit of &#163;2,300 million or above it? In

					<a name="08011634000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Minister
said himself, what is to stop anybody through an order changing the
legislation to any amount at all? There is no prospect of subsection
(3) doing anything useful. The amendments offer different sums. I think
that the amount the HCA spends will end up being far in excess of
&#163;2.3 billion or indeed &#163;3 billion. If it gets its
momentum and if the house building programme that we need in this
country is to benefit significantly from the investment through the
HCA, the sums will have to be far higher than what has been put forward
here.</div>
					<a name="08011634000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister,
being so keen to maintain a frugalness of content in the Bill, needs to
explain why subsection (3) is there. There may be an administrative
reason. Perhaps there is a standard precedent in legislation of which I
am not aware. But in the absence of those, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div>while subsection (1) is meaningful, because it indicates some initial

for the Minister. He referred to the borrowings of the organisations
that will form the HCA&#151;the Housing Corporation, English
Partnerships and the Commission for the New Towns&#151;and I think he
said that there were some outstanding borrowings in some of those
organisations. Will those borrowings be rolled into the borrowings of
the HCA, or will the HCA start with a blank sheet of paper so that the
&#163;2,300 million will refer only to liabilities that it itself
incurs? Will it have responsibility for the debts of its predecessor
organisations?</div>

							<a name="08011634000498"></a>Mr.

organisations to which my right hon. Friend referred already have an
external borrowing limit. Is the &#163;2,300 million new money or is
there a sort of net difference? Are these additional resources or are
they the resources of the organisations that are forming the HCA? What
are the external limits of English Partnerships, of the Housing
Corporation and of the Commission for the New Towns? What I am trying
to get at is this: is it new money or is it
reannounced?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000499"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> That was an interesting point about borrowing
limits, certainly from my point of view as a former auditor and
accountant. I reiterate what I have said in earlier discussions. The
power of the homes and communities agency to borrow is an important
part of its financial powers, because it gives it additional
flexibility. I refer to borrowing either on a short-term basis from
anyone or on a longer-term basis from the Secretary of State or the
European Investment
Bank.</div>
					<a name="08011634000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me clarify the point made by the hon. Member for Poole. The amounts
that we are proposing for the borrowing limits of the HCA are those
currently available to the Housing Corporation. Those amounts were
increased from those originally allowed in the Housing Associations Act
1985 by the Housing Act 1988. The agency will be a bigger agency than
the Housing Corporation. It does not seem reasonable to expect the new
agency to do more than the combined roles of its constituent parts
while at the same time restricting its ability to borrow to less than
that of its constituent parts. We have taken the view that retaining
access to this amount of borrowing is reasonable, given the breadth and
wide variety of work being undertaken by the new agency. It seems
reasonable; it does not seem excessive. It will not be the main source
of its funding. I therefore hope that the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08011634000505"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> Clause 27 covers the power of the HCA to charge
for certain activities. It is obviously appropriate that, where the
agency provides services and research, there should be the capacity to
make a reasonable charge for that. Indeed, I understand that the
existing bodies, the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships,
currently do that. My concern is that the power as defined in the
clause, certainly in subsection (1), appears to be limited to anything
done by virtue of clauses 41, 42 and 47. Clause 42 covers training and
advisory services and it looks sensible and straightforward.</div>
					<a name="08011634000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 47 needs closer
examination because it states
that:</div>
					<a name="08011634000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The HCA
may provide services in support of a
project.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011634000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
defines those services as seconding staff; providing consultants or
other manpower resources to a project, or; lending or providing
technical, property or other resources. That is all fine in theory, but
what is the definition of &#147;a project&#148;? Could that be
unduly restrictive? Does a project refer simply to a single housing
scheme supported by the new agency, following on from the ability of
the Housing Corporation to provide funding for a particular housing
scheme, or does it go wider? Could it cover new regeneration
initiatives that perhaps will apply in a number of different areas or
projects&#151;I am using the plural&#151;that will have different
outcomes in different parts of the country? Might that fall foul of a
definition that appears to be limited to anything that is done in
support of &#147;a project&#148;? I do not know the
answer.</div>
					<a name="08011634000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am puzzled by that matter and slightly worried that when we see the
agency operating, the definition of &#147;a project&#148; might
unduly restrict its ability to offer technical support, consultancy,
advice and other assistance to enable worthwhile regeneration or other
initiatives to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div>take place. We might all support and regard them as sensible and
admirable activities, but they might be prevented if the definition
of</div>
					<a name="08011634000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
support of a
project&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011634000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">proves unduly
restrictive. I am simply seeking guidance on whether that definition
provides for the full range of circumstances in which it would be
appropriate for the HCA to provide support and to charge for it in
order to defray the
costs.</div>
					<a name="08011634000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000506"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Personally, I think that the clause is important
because it empowers the HCA to charge. In doing so, we get a bit of a
sneak peek into what it will do and how it will help local authorities
and others to step up to the plate. I would like to refer you to the
objects of the HCA, Mr. Benton. It is tasked with
supporting</div>
					<a name="08011634000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in other ways
the creation, regeneration or development of communities in England or
their continued
well-being&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011634000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will do
that by working with local authorities and other stakeholders by being
an expert delivery partner. The expertise and experience that already
exist within English Partnerships and the Housing Corporation will
transfer to the agency. That means that the new agency has the
potential to be incredibly innovative in the way in which it takes
regeneration forward. That could be in providing advice, training and
consultancy services to drive forward projects that otherwise would
never get off the
ground.</div>
					<a name="08011634000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Additionally,
something that I am interested in and that we do not talk about often
enough is the Academy for Sustainable Communities, which will go into
the agency and effectively act as an operating arm of the HCA.
That will carry forward its work to improve the skills, knowledge and
behaviours that are needed to deliver and to maintain sustainable
communities. The power in the clause will enable the academy, and then
the agency, to charge for the information, advice, education and
training support services that they
provide.</div>
					<a name="08011634000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
intended to enable the HCA not to make a profit from providing those
services, but to make reasonable charges to recover the costs that it
incurs as a result of providing advice or operating a particular
service. It would be unreasonable to require the agency to provide such
services without allowing it to recover costs, where it considers it to
be appropriate. If the agency were to provide these types of services
free of charge, it could lead to it being exploited. We do not want
that to happen. It was suggested earlier that we do not want private
sector developers and others to see this as a green light and a cash
cow. We believe that the agency should be able to make a reasonable
charge for those services. That is only right and
fair.</div>
					<a name="08011634000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to come
on to an intriguing point that my right hon. Friend the Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich made with regard to the power to charge under
clause 47, and the reference to &#147;project&#148;. We may return
to that matter when we consider clause 47, but my understanding is that
the word &#147;project&#148; is used to suggest a time-limited
involvement. To remove that word may suggest that the HCA would be
involved indefinitely, and that is not the best use of resources. The
intention&#151;this will be true for a range of things that the
agency does&#151;is that the agency will provide support to schemes
to enable them to get to a position where they are either complete or
self-sufficient. The duration of that will vary quite widely depending
on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div>the scheme, but &#147;project&#148; is deliberately not defined, so
as to ensure that it has its natural meaning, which suggests a
time-limited span with particular
outcomes.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000507"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> I accept the point about the time-limited
nature of &#147;project&#148;, but I was also asking about
geographical spread, because a &#147;project&#148; could be
interpreted as referring only to a particular area. If there were an
initiative that involved projects in several different areas which
depended on an input of consultancy from the agency, and that were
interpreted as going beyond the remit because it was not a single
project, but a series of projects in different areas, might that be a
problem? I ask only because I want to be quite certain that this will
not prove unduly restrictive as an interpretation. I entirely accept
all the points my hon. Friend has made, but I would ask him to give a
little further thought to the question of geographic spread, and to
whether a number of different projects might fall foul of the
definition.</div>

again, because my right hon. Friend makes an important point. We had an
interesting debate on Thursday on community land trusts. I imagine that
he agrees that community land trusts&#146; expertise would be
disseminated to relevant local authorities. I certainly see that as
being within the clause. Let me look at the matter afresh. We may come
back to it shortly when we deal with clause
47.</div>

Corporation and I assume that it will be subsumed by the new agency. It
deals with some innovative work. It has done work around procurement
and around best practice in equalities, for example, which is not
project-specific, but more wide-ranging. It is leading edge in terms of
best practice, which I know my hon. Friend will want to see from the
new agency. I am a little concerned that the wording here may be a
little restrictive and may inhibit that kind of best practice project
from going
forward.</div>

						</b> I appreciate the comments of my
hon. Friend. I think that she agrees that one of the things that we
want to see is the dissemination of good practice. The agency will be a
repository of that, and I do not want to see anything within the Bill
to prevent that from happening. I ask her and my right hon. Friend the
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich to let me look at the matter again. I
am fairly confident that, with the definition of
&#147;project&#148; as it is, that would be allowed to happen. One
of the arguments that has been teased out of the Conservative party is,
and I paraphrase, that they do not want homes, and one of the reasons
they do not want homes is that we do not have the relevant
infrastructure. I suggest that dissemination of good practice would be
the bread and butter of what the agency will be doing, working in
conjunction with local authorities. I reiterate that I do not want
anything that would compromise that within the Bill. I hope
that we can come back to that during consideration of clause
47.</div>

							<a name="08011634000511"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> I have a couple of questions in relation to the next
two clauses. First, will the Minister say in what circumstances the
Secretary of State will appoint the HCA to act as agent in the manner
described in clause 29?</div>
					<a name="08011634000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
when talking of the HCA&#146;s power as agent of the Secretary of
State on matters of regeneration, I wish to raise a particular issue. I
understand that the Housing Corporation does not provide finance to
schemes in which there is no net increase in affordable housing. In
areas that have the potential to increase housing supply and that
already have an over-concentration of council housing, making a more
mixed community would involve a net loss of council housing. Although
it would result in a much more balanced community, which is the desire
set out in the Green Paper, such a scheme would not attract financial
support.</div>
					<a name="08011634000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister say whether the HCA might take a more flexible approach? I am
talking of a situation in which there was not necessarily a net
increase in affordable housing. Would it still be possible for
financial assistance to be given to a scheme whose objects were within
the terms of the HCA&#146;s remit&#151;within its wider powers over
regeneration, rather than simply its powers to act as an agency to
deliver more housing
units?</div>
					<a name="08011634000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">How will the
HCA use its powers, and will it be more flexible than the current
provisions as they affect the Housing Corporation? I should be grateful
if the Minister gave us some indication on
that.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000512"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> I, too, would like a little
clarification on clause 29. I may be wrong, but it seems that the
Secretary of State can give the agency a role&#151;for instance, to
dispense grants. Does that mean that grants that would now be given
directly to local authorities will go to the agency to be dispensed? As
someone who spent 14 years in local government, my concern is that it
should not be used to get around directly funding local authorities or
boroughs.</div>
					<a name="08011634000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000513"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Let me provide some clarity.
Sections 126 to 128 of the Housing Grants, Construction and
Regeneration Act 1996 give the Secretary of State the power to give
financial assistance in respect of expenditure on activities that
contribute to the regeneration or development of an area. In simple
terms, that means that the agency can step into the shoes of the
Secretary of State and give financial assistance in support of
regeneration or development activities in particular areas; it is
appointed as an agent by the Secretary of State.</div>
					<a name="08011634000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">However&#151;I
return to this point time and again&#151;the agency must act in
accordance with the terms and conditions of its appointment, as set out
by the Secretary of State, and crucially it will still need to act
within the confines of its objects as stated in clause 2. In practice,
the agency will be enabled to administer regeneration funding
programmes, which are currently delivered by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 293</div>the Department for Communities and Local Government. The power will
enable the Secretary of State to appoint the Homes and Communities
Agency to perform a number of functions that are currently performed by
the Department.</div>
					<a name="08011634000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Thursday, we had a debate about the vision of the Department and it
providing a strategic role on what is needed in respect of housing and
regeneration, with the HCA being one of the delivery agents. Many of
the delivery functions currently performed by the Department are being
transferred to the agency. We are doing something similar in clause 19
in order to build on that. The Government believe that it is vital that
investors have clarity on the arrangements for delivering those
commitments, and I hope that we have provided that clarity.</div>
					<a name="08011634000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have provided
some certainty for the hon. Member for North-East

affordable housing. Will the new agency take a different view on
that?</div>

						</b> May I understand that the Minister
is answering &#147;Yes,&#148; and that he does not expect the
current restriction operating through the Housing Corporation to
continue under the new agency in the specific circumstances that I

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000520"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> My understanding, from an expert
who works in the regeneration field, is that the Housing Corporation
will not supply finance to a scheme in which the overall end result
will be fewer affordable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div>houses. In some development areas, there is opportunity to expand the
housing supply in the round, including more mixed
developments&#151;more private housing and home ownership&#151;by
taking out some council housing in places where there is an
over-concentration, such as on the monolithic-type estates that we are
trying to get rid of.</div>
					<a name="08011634000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s Green Paper supports the development of more mixed
communities, but money is not available through the Housing Corporation
if a point of principle on affordable homes is breached. The thinking
is, &#147;There will be fewer affordable homes, so how can we give
money to this?&#148; If the Government&#146;s aims and objectives
were slightly broader than simply building more homes and units, which
is the charge that has been levelled against the agency, and if there
were an allowance to supply finance to that sort of scheme if a more
balanced community were being created, even though there would be a net
loss of affordable homes, would that restriction be
lifted?</div>
					<a name="08011634000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000521"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> That helps an awful lot and
clarifies the question. The agency&#146;s objects are wider than the
Housing Corporation&#146;s, and I do not want to pass judgment
regarding the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman mentions. I
mentioned the housing market renewal area because I have ministerial
responsibility for it, and I have been to your constituency to have a
look around, Mr. Benton, and really enjoyed my
time there. A relevant consideration might be an over-preponderance of
two-up, two-downs and that we need to lower the density. In such
circumstances, that would be entirely reasonable. However, the whole
objective is to improve the supply and quality of housing in England. I
hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman.</div>
					<a name="08011634000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The housing market renewal area
and possible phased and planned demolitions are a good example of how
we need to improve the housing stock. That might mean fewer houses in
that particular area; in that respect, I agree with the hon. Gentleman.
I hope that I have clarified matters.</div>

Burt:
						</b> I want to raise an issue that was brought to our
attention by the CPRE, which wants to ensure that the work of English
Partnerships on having an up-to-date register of brownfield land will
be continued, especially given the amount of time and money that has
been invested. It originally proposed that a new clause be tabled,
which would have been headed, &#147;The duty to monitor and promote
the re-use of brownfield land&#148;. The new clause would envisage
the new agency identifying, collating and publishing up-to-date
information on</div>
					<a name="08011634000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
availability, including type and location of previously developed (i.e.
brownfield) land in England at district, regional and national
level.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div>
					<a name="08011634000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">That data would be kept under review and

					<a name="08011634000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;promote the re-use
and reclamation of brownfield land by acting as the Government&#146;s
statutory adviser&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011634000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">on it.
The CPRE made the following
point:</div>
					<a name="08011634000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To make
the best use of our brownfield resource, and reap the benefits in terms
of urban renewal, it is vital that English Partnerships&#146; work on
the National Land Use Database and National Brownfield Strategy
continues. Given that housing is the HCA&#146;s priority, CPRE fears
this work could be sidelined should the HCA face pressure to deliver
housing numbers or cut costs. This would be short-sighted, given the
huge resource brownfield land represents and the need for action to
tackle brownfield blight and dereliction in ways which can improve the
quality of life of existing
communities.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011634000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to
take the opportunity to reiterate how important that work on brownfield
land is, and that it should be continued by the agency, whether or not
under the specific powers in clause 30 on its duty to act as an agent
in respect of derelict land or elsewhere. I know that the CPRE will
appreciate
that.</div>

that, although I want to provide reassurance that the regeneration

George:
						</b> I enjoyed the point made by the right hon. Member
for North-West Hampshire about the clause being a veritable list.
Indeed it is, but it does not include provision of housing. The objects
of the HCA in clause 2(1)(c) make reference to the</div>
					<a name="08011634000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;development of communities in
England or their continued
well-being&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08011634000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">which clause
33 is clearly intended to address. My questions for the Minister return
to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire made a
moment ago about constraining mission creep. Who will decide how to
apportion the agency&#146;s resources so that it can concentrate on
its primary purpose? How will it make those decisions? How will it fund
the provision of cemeteries and recreational services? How will those
interplay with the role of local authorities? Will it undermine
statutory provision elsewhere, or bail out local authorities from those
provisions?</div>
					<a name="08011634000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">A moment
ago, in relation to the stand part debate on clause 30, the Minister
referred back to questions that I raised about the continuing work of
English Partnerships in relation to the provision of work spaces, which
is not mentioned specifically in the list in clause 33. One would
assume, therefore, that it has been overlooked in the list. This is
purely a probing stand part debate, but it would be very helpful if he
could address the need for clarity in the interrelationships between
the HCA and the communities that it will
serve.</div>

						</b> I rather agree with the last
points made. If there is going to be a major development, support
services will be needed. One can easily see a need for security guards
and so on. However, under the terms of clause 33, existing businesses
might well face competition from organisations supported by the HCA. My
concern is whether there is a code of conduct, because, for example, if
the HCA sets up a transport service in competition with a private
business, it might be unfair. I shall not labour that point, but I am
concerned that the moment that we allow an organisation to enter into
any business, we might come up against small
businesses.</div>

						</b> I have been goaded by the
comments on the lists made by the right hon. Member for North-West
Hampshire, so I shall add my two penny&#146;s worth. I have no
objection to the list set out in clause 33(1), which seems to provide a
broad definition of the kind of community services that are likely to
be supported by the HCA. It could be said to be a cradle-to-grave
definition, although there seems to be a rather strong emphasis on the
latter end of that process, given that &#147;cremation or burial
services&#148; are specifically identified. I referred back to clause
31 and was surprised that the only listed business is undertaking. I
wonder whether that meant the particular service being considered in
clause 33(1)(g)(iv). However, on the assumption that it will genuinely
be cradle to grave and that there will be no bias against the provision
of maternity services, when appropriate, I give my strong support to
the
clause.</div>

Greenwich and Woolwich responded. It is the end of the day, so it is
perhaps appropriate that we consider burial and undertaking services.
Moreover, perhaps that highlights the dying embers of a Government who
are peacefully drawing to their close, and why the services that are
listed have drifted quite subconsciously in that direction. I can well
understand how such a subliminal sense has affected Labour
Members.</div>
					<a name="08011634000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
have two things to add to the general merriment about such a lovely
catch-all clause. I wish first to ask the Minister quite a wide
question, but it is based on the measure to which the hon. Member for
City of Durham referred when talking about providing safe and
attractive environments. Will anything in the new agency act as a
driver to ensure the provision of more family housing? We covered that
matter in the evidence sessions and it has come up before in general
debate. Developers know that at the moment, one-bedroomed and
two-bedroomed apartments fly out the window in certain areas. They
cannot build and get rid of them fast
enough.</div>
					<a name="08011634000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">Family
housing is much needed to ensure that there are mixed and balanced
communities, but few provisions drive developers in that direction.
Will the Homes and Communities Agency be any more successful in
delivering the main object of the agency stated at the beginning of the
Bill, and comply with the clause to provide safe and attractive
environments?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 298</div>
					<a name="08011634000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second point is similar and
relates to design. I hope that the Committee does not mind if I use as
a brief not a piece of paper but an electronic device, because it
contains information that, had it been written down, I would have used
in the same way. I shall be quick. Critics of the Bill are disappointed
that it does not contain specific mention of design, and I wonder
whether the
phrase</div>
					<a name="08011634000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provide safe and
attractive
environments&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011634000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">will
allow the agency to take more notice of my proposal. The Minister said
earlier that the Academy of Sustainable Communities was coming inside
the agency, but no reference is made to the Commission for Architecture
and the Built Environment. A recent CABE report drew attention to a
problem that highlighted the concept of safe and attractive
environments.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000532"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> My hon. Friend is raising a good
point. As I understand it, Bedfordshire police have an architectural
consultant who consults on schemes mainly from a point of view of
safety, but also on the quality of particular estates that are built in
my hon. Friend&#146;s county. To meet some of those objectives,
design and indeed input from other bodies are
important.</div>

							<a name="08011634000533"></a>Alistair

						</b> Such matters have come up in the
margins of our discussions. They were referred to in our evidence
session, but now is the appropriate opportunity for the Minister, in
responding to this short debate on clause 33, to illustrate how
important design is to him and to the general welfare of communities,
particularly in respect of safe and attractive
environments.</div>
					<a name="08011634000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">I draw
attention to a recent CABE report, which was published in December. It
reveals that although new home owners like their homes, almost half
miss a sense of community spirit. The report is titled, &#147;A sense
of place&#148; and based on an Ipsos MORI survey of more than 600
residents of 33 new housing developments. It points to a quality blind
spot that suggests that house builders and planners need to work much
harder to create a sense of place. Paradoxically, although 91 per cent.
of respondents were satisfied with their new home, there was widespread
dissatisfaction with the wider development. The report
states:</div>
					<a name="08011634000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;45 per cent say
that&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011634000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">their

					<a name="08011634000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;go their own

					<a name="08011634000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;40 per cent thought that there
was not enough public open

					<a name="08011634000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">which was the
point made by the hon. Member for City of Durham, and
that</div>
					<a name="08011634000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;48 per cent thought
there was not enough play
space&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08011634000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">or perfect places
to get to know each other. More than a third of residents thought that
their neighbourhood</div>
					<a name="08011634000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;was
unsafe for children to walk, cycle or play

							<a name="08011634000534"></a>Mr.
Love:
						</b> I saw the results of the CABE study. Does the hon.
Gentleman agree that if we looked up and down the country, we might
find estates, towns and cities that have been redeveloped since 1945
that won awards at the time, but are now considered blighted? If we are
to address the issue that he described, we need to do more than find a
new design or architect; we need to build new estates in consultation
with the people who will live on
them.</div>
					<a name="08011634000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000535"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> Very much so. The hon. Gentleman made an extremely
good point. It is difficult for professionals or laymen and women to
look at designs and say what will work in 20 or 30 years. However, it
is clear that if we do not pay attention to design or look at the
mistakes of the past, and if we are driven by targets of numbers, there
is a danger that the things we are discussing will be squeezed out.
Will the Minister reassure us that concerns about the quality of design
and new estates will be at the forefront of the housing and communities
agency, and that concerns that it will be a purely target, numbers and
unit-driven agency that at the behest of Government has to get its
numbers up, will not come true? We hope that there will be a place for
design and some reassurance that that will be brought into the body of
the agency in some manner. That would be
helpful.</div>
					<a name="08011634000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011634000536"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I have enjoyed the debate, which has been good
natured and well meaning given that it has come at the end of the
day.</div>
					<a name="08011634000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">I detect two
main themes: first, the list principle and, secondly, the importance of
design. The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire rightly
criticised me in a gentle manner on the list principle. We can go back
to our similar debates on infrastructure&#151;I draw his attention to
clause 2(3), which sets out what infrastructure means. Essentially, the
measure is based on the same principle and will avoid doubt. That is
entirely what clause 33(1) will do. I mentioned the thriller in Manila
last time, and I enjoyed the two Privy Councillors joshing again.
However, the measure will avoid doubt as much as possible.</div>
					<a name="08011634000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
mentioned the importance of infrastructure and the relationship that
other providers, such as Government Departments, will have with the
agency. It might be that a site is not attractive to a developer
because, for example, there is a lack of transport access, but if the
agency delivers the necessary infrastructure, a private developer might
take on the wider development. Therefore, if the HCA builds the
infrastructure, the wider development may be more viable for the
private developer.</div>
					<a name="08011634000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
reasonable for hon. Members to ask whether the measure provides a
facility that Government Departments or local authorities should
provide&#151;that point was made by the hon. Member for Poole. The
agency will work in conjunction with the Departments and authorities
that lead in such areas. The Government see the agency as complementing
the activities of those bodies and as helping to drive forward
regeneration and housing where necessary, as opposed to leading on
those
matters.</div>
					<a name="08011634000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
pay tribute to the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire because he
made an important contribution on design and planning. He is absolutely
right. He 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 300</div>reiterated a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham.
As I mentioned in the evidence sessions, we cannot have a similar
debate in 20 or 30 years&#146; time. We need sustainable communities,
and their design and planning is essential. I am tempted to say
&#147;sustainable and inclusive communities&#148;, but I had best
not this time. It is essential, however, that we factor those things
in. It is right that in a modern economy where people are busy and
travel to work we need to have that sense of community, and
recreational facilities and open spaces allow the community to come
together.</div>
					<a name="08011634000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest
that we have provided guidance with regard to planning policy statement
number 3, which is about housing. Frankly, local authorities need to be
more robust in rejecting planning applications that do not come up to
the standard for design and quality. Local authorities should be
forthright and it is right that they should play the lead on that, but
I agree with what the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire said and
reiterate the point about the Academy for Sustainable Communities. I
think that the agency will be working with the Commission for
Architecture and the Built Environment to ensure that we drive up
quality, but his point is well made and I agree with every word he
said.</div>

on climate change, the Climate Change Bill, the endorsement of Stern

within the environmental limits and providing a just society by means
of a sustainable economy, good governance and sound science. Those are
guiding 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 301</div>principles that should underpin the delivery of housing and apply to all

on annually in the report the HCA is required to undertake under

the need to make a more robust statement on
