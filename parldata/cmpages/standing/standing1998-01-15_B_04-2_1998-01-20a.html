</P>
<P>
On resuming 
<P>
<B>Mr. Norman A. Godman </B>(Greenock and Inverclyde): On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. As an ex-shipyard worker, I am slightly deaf. I can hear your voice, Mr. Butterfill, but I should like to make a plea through your good offices for members of the Committee to speak up so that shipyard workers such as myself can hear what they are saying.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have already requested that from hon. Members. The acoustics in the Room are particularly poor at the moment so speaking up would help some members of the Committee to hear the debate as well as assist Hansard staff to make an accurate record of our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 2, line 6, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and publish such terms and conditions, including the nature of such assistance and any sums paid or granted".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 12, in page 2, line 7, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and publish the names, political and religious affiliation and the nationality of the researcher or researchers".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> We return to the same general issue that was addressed in earlier amendments whether the affiliations of individuals who will be paid under the Bill should be made known to the general public. Clause 2(3)(a) states that
"the Commission may ... commission research",<P>

<P>
and the amendments would add to that provision. At a time when we seem to be moving towards European unity, that could be considered unnecessary or wrong. I have heard it said that some of the best defences of the Unionist position in Northern Ireland have been published not by Unionists but by people outwith these islands.
<P>
The general public of Northern Ireland may hear, however, that the commission has decided to carry out some research and intends to grant considerable sums to researchers, but only one side or the other or perhaps nobody will agree with it. Then people will say, "Who did this work? Who carried out the research? Where are the questionnaries? What inquiries were made aboutwhom? What was the purpose of seeking the information and of drawing conclusions on its basis?".
<P>
The Government must understand our concerns. We want to ascertain whether the Government agree with us on open government and transparency in research. Do they accept our views on appropriate qualifications? Will they publish the names, addresses and the political and religious affiliations of the individuals involved? As far as we can see from the Bill's wording, they are not prepared to publish that information.
<P>
What assistance will the Government provide to those who they employ on the commission? Will they offer them advice and will they be prepared to set out the general framework in which research will be conducted? What is the purpose of the research? What is the commission trying to ascertain? In other words, what information will the commission give to the Government an what information is it seeking?
<P>
Researchers may come to Government sources, the police and the commission and say that they would like to take a careful look at the advice that was given in the past. Not only may they want to see the general advice and evidence that was published, but they may want to see the detail. That would involve written evidence and transcripts of oral evidence. They may also want the names and addresses of those involved. Would the commission provide such helpful information?
<P>
If the commission provides such information, we must consider the security input. We discussed that last Thursday when the issue of security information was raised. Some of the information on individuals is very sensitive and may include details on the whereabouts of persons who might decide to cause trouble, such as fomenting riot, arson, petrol bombing, stone throwing and murder. All those acts have occurred in Northern Ireland in recent years and days.
<P>
The police, especially those who work under cover, operate in the most difficult and dangerous circumstances. That was demonstrated by an incident last week when an undercover operation in Belfast went clearly and wildly wrong. A woman soldier was so surprised by other security forces that she shot and severely wounded a policeman. No one regrets such incidents more than me, but I refer to it because it demonstrates that the work of gathering intelligence can be dangerous and fraught with perils from every source.
<P>
The information that is gathered at great cost might be required by a researcher. Are the Government, the police or the commission prepared to give it to him? If so, under what conditions will it be provided? Will the research be published? If not, why not? Will semi-secret work be carried out and a report be published setting out the conclusions that have been reached? If so, people would ask, "What led you to these conclusions? Where is the evidence for them?".
<P>
I am sure that many hon. Members have read the Widgery report recently. They will wonder about the evidence presented in it. When hon. Members consider the findings of opinion polls I am sure that they consider whether the questions were weighted to obtain a particular answer. This is a sensitive and dangerous matter and the evidence given by the security forces should also be published. The public should be aware that there is a grave security risk if a certain procession[Mr. Ross]
goes ahead or is stopped, for that matter. They should know that no good ever comes from concealing from the public and the nation the nature of the threats that people face in Northern Ireland. If the Government think that there are good reasons, we should be told, because knowledge is essential to enable people to come to sensible decisions, not least in Northern Ireland.
<P>
I am convinced that one reason why sensible decisions have not been taken in the past is because so many of our fellow citizens are not clearly aware of circumstances in Northern Ireland. Few people in the United Kingdom really knew what the Maze was like until they saw it on their television screens a few weeks ago, and were horrified by those pictures.
<P>
It is not only the matter of the security input; there is also the question whether the investigators will be granted access to the civil servants who advise the Minister and the Secretary of State. Civil servants have their own views of the situation. As the Minister said, they come to him with valuable and detailed advice which enables him to make up his mind. They provide another series of comments, views and information that the investigators should have and which should be made available to the public when the research methods and results are published, because it is a valuable source. When all the facts have been gathered together and presented to the Secretary of State, she can come to a firm conclusion.
<P>
It is not only access to civil servants that matters. An individual or a body will be selected to carry out research into whether any changes are necessary and to make detailed inquiries into what is going on. Will there be access to Ministers? Will the researchers be able to ring Stormont castle and ask the Secretary of State, "Can we come and talk to you?". Will they be able to tell her that it is essential that she grants them an audience because they want to ask her questions to enable them to formulate a policy that will bring peace and tranquillity to Northern Ireland. Will their request be granted? If not, we need to be told why.
<P>
The matter of access to the commission will arise. It will have taken decisions some, as Ministers have told us, may be inaccurate and wrong and lead to unforeseen and possibly unfortunate consequences. On the other hand, some of the decisions taken by the commission may lead to sweetness and light and agreement across the board, which will ensure that the spectre of violence disappears from our streets forever. In such circumstances, people would be very interested to know exactly how the commission came to those correct decisions, because they could perhaps be applied more widely.
<P>
We must consider the matter of access to the various individuals affected by the legislation the parading organisations and protesting organisations, for example. The attitude of prisoners who feel that the length of their stay as guests of Her Majesty was affected by decisions taken outside must be considered. Will access be granted to all those people? How will the researchers be given funding to make inquiries?
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The second issue arising from amendment No. 11 concerns the nature of any assistance. I have already mentioned the assistance that any researcher worth his salt would seek in an effort to reach a sensible conclusion. However, beyond that is the question of the real cost.
<P>
What sums would be available for the work, to be granted to the body or person involved? We need to know the length of time to be allocated, and all the detail, to set the minds of the people of Northern Ireland at rest on the matter.
<P>
We need also to consider the questions raised by amendment No. 12, which would establish a means for inquiring about the identity of the researchers. The people who would examine the research material would want to know the names and addresses of the researchers and the position that they held; whether they were individuals or tied to a university; whether they were part of a think tank or simply had a particular interest in the subject, as post-graduate students of social or political matters.
<P>
Finally, the question of religious affiliation would rear its ugly head. The question would be asked: "If these people or this group are to carry out the research, what is their political background? Where were they educated? What primary and secondary schools and university did they attend? What church do they attend?". The researchers' nationality would also become a matter of interest. Most people in Northern Ireleand would look askance if they discovered that citizens of the Irish Republic were carrying out research on the issue of parades. No matter how eminent the researcher, his or her claim to be fair, reasonable and unbiased would fall into question. Even if those qualities were present, the process would come up against the second great roadblock people's perceptions of the person concerned.
<P>
I have raised questions in the present context that have been raised before. If the Government are intent on ensuring the acceptance of the information collected as valid, fair and reasoned, they should accept the amendments. Those simple provisions would commend themselves to anyone intent on maintaining people's support for the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Godman:</B> I shall be brief. I oppose amendment No. 12. If that pernicious amendment were, by a remarkable streak of misfortune, to be accepted, clause 2(3) would state that
"the Commission may, with the approval of the Secretary of State ... publish the names, political and religious affiliation and the nationality of the researcher or researchers."<P>

<P>
I think that the Peach principles, which are widely supported in Northern Ireland, compel a person seeking certain types of public appointments to say whether he or she has stood for political office in the previous five years. But although employees have to give confidential information about their personalities, affiliations and so on, it is confidential information based, I consider, on principles of personnel management that can be found in any large company in the United Kingdom.
<P>
In opposing this disgraceful amendment, I cite appendix 6 on page 253 of the North report, where principles vis-\ga-vis procedures for handling public appointments in Northern Ireland are outlined. These are ministerial responsibility, merit, independent scrutiny, equal opportunities, probity, openness and transparency, and proportionality. Paragraph 6 states:
"The essential principle is that the selection of the successful candidate should be solely on merit for the job".<P>

<P>
Where research groups are concerned, it could be argued that I am paraphrasing paragraph 6 the essential principle for the selection of a successful candidate seeking a research post with the commission should be based on merit for that post.
<P>
I have worked in research and studied up to doctoral level at a fine Scottish university whether my doctorate was a brilliant peace of work is not for me to say; I am too modest for that. I consider it utterly disgraceful, even in the present circumstances of Northern Ireland, to call upon research applicants or members of research consultancy firms to offer up their religious and political affiliations.
<P>
I will give the Committee an example. It is evident to most people, whether Conservative, Labour or other, that Professor Patrick Cornford is a Conservative supporter. This does not detract from the quality of the research that he produces and writes. We assess his papers and books on the methodology of research, the analysis undertaken by him and the interpretation of it in other words, the quality of his research work. That should hold for all researchers. We are not talking about intelligence gatherers. The commission may seek to hire certain academics in Northern Ireland who are known to Opposition Front-Bench spokesman, to me and to others. I know not what their religious affiliations are but I know that they carry out first-class research work.
<P>
I always think of the hon. Member for East Londonderry as a decent fellow. But the amendment, which would ask researchers to demonstrate publicly their political and religious affiliations, has elements of political fundamentalism fo the type found in Teheran or in McCarthyism. Where does nationality come into it? The hon. Gentleman said that he would not want people from south of the border to conduct research on such a controversial issue. There may be experts in conflict studies it is an established discipline within disciplines such as sociology and political science who come from any point of the compass. Will the commission deny a first-class researcher a research commission because he is from a country outwith the multinational state of the United Kingdom? Is the hon. Gentleman going to say that we do not want Scots to carry out research, particularly if they went to Heriot-Watt university where I studied? Is he going to argue that the English should be kept out of Northern Ireland? There would be trouble if he said that to sympathetic Members of Parliament on this side of the water. The amendment must be rejected, and I shall have no qualms if Ministers kick it into touch.
<P>
Intelligence gathering is a different matter, but we are talking about research of the highest order. Therefore, the commission must judge researchers on their proven track record in research and on their ability to do the job. That is the view set out in the first-class report produced by Dr. North, who presumably holds a PhD.
<P>
It is nonsense to talk in terms of nationality and religious and political affiliations. It would not help us if such thinking crept into our universities in the way that it crept into American politics in the 1940s and 1950s, and in the way that it forms an integral part of fundamentalist Islamic politics. We want nothing of that anywhere in the multinational state of the United Kingdom. People should be chosen for a job on merit alone. We are debating research, not intelligence or police work. People must be chosen on the basis of their track record in that.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> I shall be brief because the amendments are straightforward. I shall come to the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (Mr. Godman) shortly.
<P>
Under paragraph 13 of schedule 1 to the Bill, the Parades Commission is required to produce and publish an annual report on how it discharges its functions. The Secretary of State is then required to lay it before each House of Parliament. The information specified in amendment No. 11 on the terms and conditions under which assistance is given or grants are made by the commission will be published in the annual report. Therefore, I do not see the need for the amendment. The commission will do what it wants. I hope that the hon. Member for East Londonderry will withdraw it.
<P>
On amendment No. 12, it is clear that the Parades Commission will have to use the services of reputable researchers with established track records. It is most unlikely that it will pick their names out of a hat. It will be aware of well-known people with track records in the subjects to be examined, so those people will probably be already known for the quality of their work on the issues surrounding parades. Details of the commission's research function, including the names of persons and bodies carrying out research, will be published in the annual report. One aspect of the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde made an impassioned and profound contribution on other aspects of amendment No. 12.
<P>
<B>Mr. Godman:</B> May I correct a mistake I made earlier? I have been reading poetry, so I said Cornford when referring to Professor Minford, the professor of economics who votes Conservative.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I was going to pick my hon. Friend up on that point because I wanted to question the professor's advice.
<P>
The main point that my hon. Friend made was about the political and religious affiliations of researchers and their nationality, and I have no need to repeat it. To ask people about their religious or political affiliation or, indeed, their nationality as if that were relevant, is intrusive and offensive to the way that reputable researchers go about their business. There is no justification for amendment No. 12. If it was carried it would be so offensive that no one would carry out the research, but that might be the reasoning behind it. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> The Minister's response was interesting. He has explained to us that by and large most of the information that is being sought will be published anyway. Certainly the name, political and religious affiliation and nationality of the researchers will be rapidly unearthed and published in Northern Ireland. Therefore my questions will be answered, albeit it at arm's length. Let us be under no illusions about that.
<P>
I should like to ask the Minister one further question about amendment No. 11. Do the sums that are being paid encompass payments to the authorised officers who will be employed by the commission? If not, perhaps he will tell us where the sums for them are covered in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> My understanding is that there would have to be full disclosure of money paid in the annual report. If the hon. Gentleman will allow, I shall come back to him later, perhaps in a letter, about the details of that. Clearly, where public money is being paid out, there must be full and open accounting. The annual report would seem to be the mechanism by which such information could be imparted to the Houses of Parliament and to the public generally. I will come back if there is another means by which that information would be provided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> From what has been said, these amendments are clearly unnecessary as all the information that I am seeking to be put in one form will appear in another. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ross:</B> There are many other amendments associated with clause 3. If I recall correctly, Mr. Butterfill, you said earlier that it was at this point that we could consider the code of conduct, the procedural rules and the general guidelines which are set down. I am curious to know whether that is still the case or whether we shall deal with those documents at another stage.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If we did that, it would form part of the clause stand part debate. We are now considering amendment No. 13 and the other amendments grouped with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> As always, Mr Butterfill, I am grateful to you for your guidance on these matters.
<P>
This is an important group of amendments which covers the question of whether the commission should seek the views and advice of persons and organisations affected by the code. The Minister is almost certain to tell me that he is sorry but he is not too sure who will be affected yet. As he is by now well aware that we take it as read that this is an anti-procession Bill, he will understand that most of the loyalist orders will be concerned. As will be all the bodies mentioned in the documentation that was sent to me on 17 December that were referred to as having held processions. They include the Orange Order, the Royal Black Preceptory, the Apprentice Boys and band organisations. Surprisingly, processions have comprised non-political party groupings. It was interesting to note from the first half of the statistics that I received that those processions do not take place in the east of the Province.
<P>
According to the statistics, party political groupings apparently do not hold processions in the rest of the Province. Only two such processions took place in the first half of the year in Banbridge and there was one in Dungannon, as there was in Ballymena. Various uniformed youth organisations, such as the Boys' Brigade, the Girls' Brigade, the differing versions of the scouts and girl guides movement, the Church Lads' Brigade and all sorts of other groupings apparently do not hold processions in the early part of the year. It could be, however, that no one takes any notice of them.
<P>
When we consider the nationalist element, we discover that the Ancient Order of Hibernians hold processions as do the Irish National Foresters. There are band processions and others consisting of political party groupings. In fact, there are 23 other processions in total. One way and another, several folk hold processions.
<P>
I am curious to know precisely why the Government will not accept my amendment and I intend to seek the advice of those who will be affected by the code. Those who will mainly be affected are set out in the documentation, although a few groups are not mentioned such as the Boys' Brigade, the Girls' Brigade and ex-servicemens' associations. They can easily be contacted and if the commission is to issue a code of guidance, keep under review the code of conduct and revise the whole of it or part of it, surely it should be incumbent on the commission to contact those groups and quietly ask them why they think that changes should be made. There is cross-community and cross-party support for this approach in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Down is not in his place at present, but he has tabled amendment No. 70, which states
"and such other person or persons and organisations or institutions as he deems appropriate."<P>

<P>
That provision falls neatly into what I am arguing for and, if the Minister is really seeking openness and cross-community support in Northern Ireland, surely he should accept the amendment. I am sure that the hon. Member for South Down had no desire to be absent from the Committee; something unfortunate must have happened to keep him away from the sitting. Despite the fact that he is not here, the silence and the lack of objection to my point is clearly to be taken as acceptance of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I fear that my intervention may simply be to seek an explanation from the Chairman. I can see the need to discuss amendment No. 70 with the others but, if it comes to a vote, should it not be considered under clause 8? The two issues are completely separate. One concerns the commission's powers and responsibilities, and the other concerns the Secretary of State's duties in overruling the commission.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct; the vote would come under clause 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> May I seek your advice, Mr. Butterfill? A couple of the amendments that I tabled related to clause 8. May I take it for granted that we can leave this matter for the moment and discuss it again when we come to clause 8, or will there only be a vote then?
<P>
As the Minister's sister party in Northern Ireland, as it is described, supports the broad thrust of what I am saying, will he consider the matter and table an acceptable amendment on Report? He tells us that he wants co-operation in Northern Ireland and agreement to be reached on parades and processions, but when we reach agreement on parades and processions, he is mute. Not a single, solitary word or sound do we hear neither yea nor nay, not even a nod or a shake.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Member for South Down is not in his place; he has had to return to Northern Ireland to give evidence first thing tomorrow morning to the Select Committee, which is investigating electoral arrangements. It would be wrong for any Minister to try to guess what the hon. Gentleman would say about an amendment. We will not have the benefit of his input.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Let me tell the Committee that although it would be correct to say that, if pressed, we would have a separate vote on amendment No. 70 under clause 8, we would not have separate votes on the other amendments that we are considering, as they essentially deal with the same subject, albeit at different points in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I understand that, Mr. Butterfill, but the Minister has said that he does not want to pre-empt what the hon. Member for South Down would say if he were here. The SDLP is the sister party of the governing party, so I would have thought that the Minister would have been courteous enough to his absent friend to consider seriously how they might reach agreement on the basis of the arguments that the Unionists are advancing.
<P>
The two amendments are so close that there is not a hair between them. As the hon. Member for South Down and I are agreed, the Minister has the chance to unite us all in Northern Ireland on this teeny-weeny amendment. The Government will probably agree to it anyway, so why do they not include it in the Bill?
<P>
At this juncture, I apologise for the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone, who also had to return to Northern Ireland unexpectedly this evening for a political reason the council by-election in his area tomorrow. He knew that he would be expected to show his face and cast his ballot for the Ulster Unionist candidate. He is still new to this place; if he had consulted me, I would have warned him to get a postal or a proxy vote, although there are all sorts of arguments about that issue too. He had to depart, but he will be back tomorrow and he will have cast his vote in the hard-fought contest, which arose as a result of the death of one of our sitting members of the council. I apologise for his absence. He would have liked to be here as this is one of the first Standing Committees on which he has sat, and he has taken a great interest in it. He is learning as he goes along there is nothing like learning on the hoof in this place. It is a matter of concern to him that he has missed out.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have tabled some other amendments referring to persons and organisations they are difficult to define. I assume that persons would be those who organise processions. Of course, persons could mean people who live on the route who would also be affected by the measure. The organisations are the groups intent on holding processions. In addition, the commission would no doubt want to consult the individuals who, rather than taking part in a procession, are intent on stopping one. I hope that the commission, if it ever does anything sensible, will want to consult carefully with those people and explain the error of their ways.
<P>
Schedule 2 provides for the commission to issue the draft to the Secretary of State and amendment No. 51 proposes that he or she must
"seek the views of such persons and organisations as appear to be affected".<P>

<P>
In the next amendment No. 52 I ask again that, after consultation with the commission, the Secretary of State should look to other bodies and organisations for[Mr. Ross]
advice. That would be not only sensible, but essential. If we are to have something that is acceptable and on which my ideas and those of the hon. Member for South Down coincide, nothing but good can come from further consideration with the individuals most affected by the proposed legislation.
<P>
Amendment No. 54 is somewhat different. A relevant instrument will be laid before Parliament in draft form, but it will not come into operation, except in accordance with the Secretary of State. There is not much point in laying an instrument before Parliament if it just lies on the Table, goes through the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments procedure and then goes through on the nod some night. That Select Committee is not in the slightest bit interested in the content of an order; it is interested only in how it is drawn and whether the language is correct. As a member of that Committee, I must confess that far too often it is not. That is no safeguard to the people of Northern Ireland.
<P>
The element set out in amendment No. 54 would be a safeguard. It would insert the words "after debate and amendment", but perhaps I should have been more accurate and asked for the opportunity for Parliament to make amendments. The Minister told us earlier today that the House was capable of making mistakes it almost certainly will make mistakes and there will be another opportunity for that to happen during changes to the relevant statutory instrument. As that is true, I should have thought that it would be sensible to have another little debate such as this in Committee, although I should prefer it to be on the Floor of the House. Hon. Members would have the opportunity to put their views to the Minister in Committee or on the Floor of the House.
<P>
The Minister and his colleagues are reasonable people and would listen with great care to the arguments and might decide to extend or curtail the instrument in some way. It would not then be a matter for the commission, but would lie where it properly should with Members of Parliament of the United Kingdom. In the light of that, the Minister will surely accept the need for proper legislation for Northern Ireland, for openness of government, for full rights of the Northern Ireland Members of Parliament, and a willingness to listen to what they have to say and to learn from their experience. They will often be in the street when some of the contentious parades take place and will have firsthand or at least, secondhand knowledge of what happens. They will be in a far better position than any other group of people to form a valid judgment about what is necessary to improve the legislation.
<P>
No. 55 states that
"After complying with paragraph 5, the Commision shall submit the draft of the revised relevant instrument to the Secretary of State and make such modifications to it as the Secretary of State, after consultation with the Commission, may require".<P>

<P>
The amendment would insert after "Commission" the words
"and the Members of Parliament representing Northern Ireland and other persons and organisations as appear to be affected by the proposed revision".<P>

<P>
That goes further than the previous amendment. That amendment could be dealt with only by Members of Parliament in both Houses. In this case, if the instrument is revised, it should not simply be rubber-stamped by Government and passed into law. Some of the measures that the Government are proposing in the Committee this evening are contentious. Any future measures could be equally contentious, and because of that they should all be given full parliamentary treatment. The Government would then have the benefit of the understanding of Northern Ireland's representatives about the situation in the Province and about what should be done to keep peace and tranquillity on the streets.
<P>
Amendment No. 56 repeats the demand for debate and amendment after the Secretary of State has laid the draft of the revised relevant instrument before each House of Parliament. The instrument should be subject not only to debate, but to full discussion and amendment. If that were so, although we might not be content with the outcome, we would at least be satisfied that the Government were well aware of the consequences of their acitons.
<P>
Amendment No. 57 again proposes the insertion of the words
"after debate and amendment by Parliament."<P>

<P>
We are all parliamentarians and we all claim to know what goes on in our constituencies, and even in our regions. The amendments are necessary and the Minister should be not just willing but eager to accept them. The Unionist party is not the only party requesting the change: the SDLP is also happy with the principle behind it. The words spoken by the hon. Member for South Down are such as to convince me and, I am sure, the Minister that we agree about what needs to be done.
<P>
Why, then, the hesitation? The Minister could have saved 20 minutes if had bounced up at the start and said that, because certain principles are self-evidently right and necessary, he would accept them. Unfortunately, the Minister of State seems to have disappeared but no doubt the Under-Secretary is itching to get on his feet to tell me that what I have suggested is acceptable to both Ministers. Surely they would not go against what the SDLP wants: it would be unusual and strange if that were the case. I recommend the amendments to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The Government have consulted more on this issue than have any other Government whom I can recall; and our urge is to conduct even more of it. Occasionally my mind gets a twinge to the effect that the hon. Member for East Londonderry may be rather mischievous in Committee.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 13, 14, 15, 52 and 55 deal with consultation arrangements for the code of conduct, procedural rules and guidelines. Amendments Nos. 70, 192 and 194 would impose an additional consultation requirement on the Secretary of State before confirming, revoking or amending a commission determination on appeal by the Chief Constable.
<P>
It is important to recognise that the Government have grasped the importance of the issues in the Bill and the need for consultation. We could have legislated by Order in Council but we did not; we chose to give Parliament the opportunity, which it is now using, to scrutinise the Bill. We have shown in Committee and in the other place that we are ready and willing to listen to valid arguments put by the Opposition. We should also recognise that a great deal of our consultation was listed at length by the North committee, to which we must pay tribute for its meetings, consultations and public opinion surveys. The Government are building on the history of consultations by the North committee and the previous Government.
<P>
We oppose the amendments, partly because they are redundant, partly because they have already been taken care of, and partly because they are impractical in view of the limited time available before this year's marching season. We must bear in mind the fact that the previous Government's behaviour was partly the result of the timing of last year's marching season. That is why we want the Bill to be in place soon and why we want to ensure that the Parades Commission's documents and consultation documents will be published in time for the coming marching season.
<P>
The consultation exercise is due to run until the end of January. That will enable the commission to present documents to the Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of schedule 2, on which we have already extensively consulted. We look forward to the great effort that will be made by the hon. Members for East Londonderry and for West Tyrone in making submissions in response to the consultation documents the documents are there for people to improve.
<P>
As for requiring the Secretary of State to consult before confirming, revoking or amending a determination of the commission on appeal by the Chief Constable, a moment's thought will reveal that that is completely impracticable. We ask the Parades Commission to make a determination a good time before the parade five days has been suggested. If the Chief Constable, in exceptional circumstances which we hope will not occur felt that he had to appeal to the Secretary of State, I imagine that that would be because of changed circumstances.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>10 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming 
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> This group of amendments would impose on the Government a duty to carry out even more extensive consultation than we have undertaken so far. The reason why we reject the amendments is, first, that those consultations have been extensive and, secondly, that it is our overwhelming wish in fact, we are determined that the Bill must be enacted and the consultation documents and all the equipment that the Parades Commission needs must be available in time for the marching season.
<P>
Before we suspended, I was saying that it would be completely impractical to implement the proposal to have further consultation on what should happen in the unwelcome event that the commission and the Chief Constable disagree. There would not be time for formalised consultation between the Secretary of State and anyone else if the Chief Constable consulted her because of the heavy pressure of a parade that threatened the peace. However, that does not mean that the Secretary of State could not consult the major parties that might be part of that confrontation. There would be nothing to prevent her from doing so, but to impose a duty to consult would be too much.
<P>
The commission has published the documents referred to in schedule 2. It is consulting widely on them and will consider the comments of the various bodies and individuals who respond. The responses will then be submitted to the Secretary of State, who, after consulting the commission, may make such modifications as she sees fit. The documents will then be laid before both Houses.
<P>
The amendments would allow those documents parliamentary scrutiny similar to that given to the Bill. We do not consider that necessary or appropriate, and I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> That is disappointing. It is clear that the Minister believes that this evening is the only time when the House will have a chance to scrutinise the consultation papers and that, thereafter, although such matters might go through various procedures, Members of Parliament will have no chance to debate or amend them. Furthermore, he believes that even if it were necessary to change or improve the documents, that would be done outwith the ambit of the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The claim was made that the Government have consulted more widely than any other Government. Frankly, that is nonsense; it is not true. If, after the Committee has reported, it was felt that in redesigning or rewriting the guidelines, procedures and codes of conduct the hon. Member for East Londonderry could have an input, and if he were to write to this listening Government, would not the Government accommodate him and give him as much time as necessary to ensure that his input went into the documents?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> Given that all our wise advice over the past two or three years has been ignored, I am convinced that the age of miracles is past. The Government are unlikely to listen to common sense. They are hell bent on enacting the measure. The Chief Constable, who has managed to shrug off some responsibility, will be equally determined to ensure that no further debate takes place on the matter. Therefore, our proceedings provide the only opportunity for discussing the documents in the House and for questioning the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> If the hon. Gentleman changed his political complexion and became a paramilitary, the Secretary of State would run to him to discuss his anxieties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I never wanted to dress up, so there is no chance of me becoming a paramilitary at my age. However, there is a danger that other people might do that if they become dissatisfied and realise that terrorism has worked.
[Mr. Ross]
<P>
The Minister claimed that I should welcome the consultation that had taken place. Of course I welcome it. In another month, I shall have been a Member of Parliament for 24 years. Throughout that time, we have made a constant demand, which has almost become a party dirge, for Northern Ireland to be treated in the same way as the rest of the United Kingdom. We argued that changes in legislation and all new legislation for Northern Ireland should be made by Bill. The rest of the United Kingdom has enjoyed that benefit for those 24 years. If the Minister expects grateful thanks for his actions, he will wait a long time. He is doing his duty by the people of Northern Ireland, over whom he and his colleagues preside. He has provided nothing more or less than that to which we are entitled as citizens of this country. Members of Parliament, as representatives of those citizens, are entitled to an opportunity to debate and expose the weaknesses of measures.
<P>
Measures that we opposed in the past often did not work. However, although we have often been proved right, the Government are intent on getting it wrong.
<P>
I welcome the Committee stage of the Bill, which has been useful. We shall read the Minister's words with great care. He claimed that some amendments were reduntant because of the code of conduct that has been published. We shall discuss that. No doubt the Minister will ensure that the commission, the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State will examine my words. That does not mean that they will react. I hope that they will.
<P>
The Minister said that if the Government were confronted with a parade that threatened the peace, there would not be time to engage in consultation. His words exposed the fault line that runs through the Bill. He expressed, inadvertently, the concept that the parade causes trouble. It is not the parade that causes trouble, but the armed terrorist gang, which wages terrorist war. Confrontations through processions are part and parcel of the war that they have been waging. The failure to recognise the real nature of what we have been up against this past 25 years is the dreadful consequence that we have to live with in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The Government have yet to make a mental leap across a very wide gorge. Until they make it, they will continue making the same fundamental errors that have cursed policy in Northern Ireland for the past 25 years. Yes, I welcome the Bill. I would welcome any Bill that applied to Northern Ireland purely and simply because it was a Bill rather than an Order in Council, because it was amendable, because we can argue our case and because we can talk to other hon. Members in Committee.
<P>
As you know, Mr. Butterfill, the Committee stage is by far the most valuable and educative process. It is in sittings such as this that those who know nothing of a subject are brought face to face with folk who do. I well remember the Committee stage of a previous firearms Bill. I remember our arguments with the previous Administration and the slow shift in the views of Labour members of that Committee, which sat for weeks and weeks until they came to see the point. The pity is that many of our amendments were not accepted, but I shall not draw on history now.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Member will get to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> The amendments are part of the educative process, which has to go on until people start to question their preconceived ideas. The Minister still has to make his mental leap. A previous Administration made that mental leap: perhaps current Ministers will make it.
<P>
The consultation papers can be discussed in the stand part debate. It is a valuable exercise and I wish that my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone was here, because he has paid more attention to them than I have.
<P>
I am sorry that the Government are sticking to the view that they are not prepared to accept a word of advice on the matter from the elected representatives of Northern Ireland. I hope that they will reconsider that before Report. Perhaps the Minister would like to add a word to what he has already said. I am happy to sit down and give him that opportunity.
<P>
If the Minister does not want to say anything, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
On proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I do not want to rehearse my arguments on the first tranche of amendments to clause 1, but some of them apply to clause 3. The amendments proposed a code of conduct along the lines recommended by the North report, for those who were bent on protesting or making counter demonstrations against what in future will be a legal procession one that has gone through the hoops and been reviewed by the commission and is ordained as a legal procession. As yet, nothing in the Bill suggests that those who wish to protest should also adhere to an accepted code of conduct, either one introduced by the commission across the board, covering all protestors or counter-demonstrations, or one that residents' groups who intend to protest devise for acceptance by the commission.
<P>
<H5>10.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
When I spoke in support of my amendments last week, the Minister said that he would give due and sensible consideration to what I said. We heard the comments of his ministerial colleague, Lord Dubs, who said during the Bill's passage through the other place that there were still unresolved matters relating to the North report's recommendations, one of which was the code of conduct for those organising protests or counter-demonstrations.
<P>
The Minister has had several days since last Thursday to hold discussions with his officials. Although I do not necessarily expect him to say that he is converted to our way of thinking, it is important that we express our views as strongly as possible. I say, without rehearsing all the arguments, that this is an integral part of the North report that was strongly recommended after more consultation than this Government have undertaken. Given that at least 90 per cent. of the North report's advice has already been accepted, to cherry pick and omit recommendations that do not quite fit would be inappropriate and not in the spirit of the North report.
<P>
Clause 3 is important. It was strongly recommended and supported during the North committee's surveys of public opinion. More than 90 per cent. of those who responded were in favour of a code of practice or a code of conduct and it is interesting that people wanted both sides to be treated the same. But clause 3 states only that those organising public processions must adhere to a code of conduct that should be statutory and enforceable and carry penalties and sanctions if it is not complied with. If it is broken, there are severe penalties for those involved. In the interests of fairness and even-handedness I beseech the Minister to give a positive response not only to what I am saying tonight but to the North report's recommendations, to ensure that those who organise protests, of whatever nature some are mild and some horrific understand that a code of conduct is enforceable in law, which was the strongand overriding thrust of the North report's recommendations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall be brief, as I do not know whether other hon. Members want to contribute to the debate. However, before I respond to the points made by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire I shall pose a question. The hon. Gentleman was a Northern Ireland Minister in the previous Administration. Why did his Government not proceed with the North report? These issues could have been dealt with at that time but the hon. Gentleman raises them now as a matter of great concern. The previous Administration's approach would have been given a fair wind by my party, which was then Her Majesty's loyal Opposition. That was known at the time but for some reason it was left over and we went through the whole process at Drumcree in 1997, which perhaps could have been avoided if a much more determined position had been taken by the previous Administration, so we are having to deal with it now.
<P>
We have heard the arguments from the other place and in Committee. The hon. Member for East Londonderry was right to say that consideration of Bills in Committee is important: we pick up important messages assess the weight of arguments, and consider all the issues. I do not know whether the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire expected a Government amendment to be tabled in Committee in response to the debate on clause 1, which impacted upon clause 3, but that would be impractical. Hence the importance of consideration on Report if amendments are to be debated.
<P>
I gave hon. Gentlemen a commitment that amendments would be examined carefully: we want to reflect on comments on all the amendments and clauses and consider all these matters in the round. That is the usual way of dealing with such issues. We must consider the balance of the amendments and the way in which they sit against one another. There is still a fair amount of business to be undertaken on the Bill, and amendments to be dealt with. The earlier assurances stand: I have given hon. Gentlemen my commitment I cannot emphasise that too strongly. I shall adhere to it, and give due consideration to it, and the appropriate time for a response will be on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> That is very encouraging. Let us help the Minister along the road to righteousness because he has a long way to go. This is our only opportunity to examine the little booklets given to us. We were told that we would be able to do so on the clause stand part debate. That is now: the first of them is entitled "Guidelines for Commission Members". These are important documents that will be referred to by members of the commission as they decide whether or not a parade or procession should take place.
<P>
Mr. Alastair Graham, the Parades Commission's chairman, points out in a foreword on page 1 that his responsibilities will extend to all types of public procession, but that guidelines will in particular take full account of events surrounding contentious parades in previous years. My problem with that statement is that apparently the commission will take account only of some of the events, because it seems not to have considered carefully the predetermining reasons for the violence and the contentiousness of the parades. I have made clear in Committee many times my view that the problem is not the parades but those who oppose them.
<P>
The commission chairman states that there was close involvement with parades in some areas and extensive consultation exercises in Portadown and Londonderry. The hon. Member for Foyle (Mr. Hume), the Leader of the SDLP, was involved in the Londonderry consultations, and we all know the nature of the response that he received in December. Even after his best efforts, violence occurred. We heard all that Mr. McGuinness and his cohorts said, and we know from the evidence of those events that that violence was carefully planned and put into operation that was, of course, after publication of the guidelines. If the commission chairman has learnt anything, perhaps we can look forward to wiser comments from him during the necessary revamping of the document.
<P>
Mr. Graham also stated that in drawing up the guidelines members of the commission worked on the fundamental premise that the
"rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression as outlined in the European Convention on Human Rights are important rights to be enjoyed equally by all."<P>

<P>
I do not think that the House of Commons has ever transgressed greatly with regard to the right of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, but others are doing their damnedest to ensure that the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression are curtailed by violence and the threat of it, up to the level of murder.
<P>
The guidelines state that the commission will not
"raise obstacles to the exercise of these rights unless there are compelling arguments to do so"<P>

<P>
and that the
"Guidelines are therefore designed to provide the Commission with a means of testing the validity of those counter arguments" 
<P>
that is, the arguments of those who intend to stop the exercise of the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression.
<P>
A certain amount of verbiage has been employed because the writers of the document have carefully avoided the core issue the behaviour of the IRA. Over the page we are told:
[Mr. William Ross]
"The Commission will make reference to these Guidelines and to the Procedural Rules primarily where it has not proved possible for parade organisers and protesters to achieve a consensus on proposals for parades."
<P>
Here is this pious prayer that I have heard so often, concerning a method of achieving consensus with the IRA. It is not in the business of consensus and its record proves that. Instead, it is in the business of winning a war, and it has as much intention of reaching a consensus with the Orange institution as Mr. Hitler had of reaching a consensus with Britain in 1940. The sooner people wake up to that reality, the more likely we are to devise a proper means of dealing with the IRA.
<P>
A statement in the document that struck me as really rich was that
"the legislation and its application must comply with the Government's obligations under international law, and provide no encouragement for those who seek to promote disorder".<P>

<P>
Those people are promoting disorder to advance their cause. Every time they get a procession stopped in one place they can say, "We have decided who can walk down that street." The Government may huff and puff and talk about the rule of law, but if a legal procession has been stopped by violence it is the guy who has used violence who runs that part of the country. Whenever we are asked to talk to such people it is a question of surrendering to them the right to determine who shall walk down a road. That is the basic truth that those in government seem to be intent on avoiding.
<P>
The document states that
"procedures for handling disputes over parades and the enforcement of subsequent decisions should be proportional to the issues at stake."<P>

<P>
What on earth is that supposed to mean? It is not clear to me but I suppose it is possible to read into it that if someone is prepared to burn down half the town and as many vehicles as possible and kill a few policemen, that will weigh heavily against the freedoms of the individual. The Minister laughs, but that is what happened. What did the riots in Londonderry in December cost? Has the bill come in yet? The Minister knows that those riots were fomented. If he does not know, all that he has to do is ask the RUC Chief Constable and his officers in Londonderry to tell him who was behind the trouble and let him see the information on which they based their security arrangements on the relevant day.
<P>
I am a member of the Apprentice Boys but I have never attended that gathering, which has been going a very long time. There have been various attempts over a couple of centuries to ban that procession we have the burning of Lundy but they have never been successful. Lundy has always turned up and been burned. [Interruption.] Yes, an effigy. As the hon. Gentleman knows, he got away and managed to change sides later on and serve his other king when the opportunity occurred. But that is by the by.
<P>
The guidelines seem to be saying, "If you raise Cain well enough, we will give in to you." Paragraph 2.1 on page 4 states:
"Past experience has shown how decisions to allow or not allow contentious parades can provoke disorder."<P>

<P>
Parades become contentious when opposition is brought into being to provoke disorder. The paragraph adds:
"It would be naive of the Commission, therefore, to disregard this potential for disorder and damage to property in reaching conclusions. The Commission will therefore seek the advice of the RUC on the public order ramifications of a decision and consider this factor alongside the other factors described below."<P>

<P>
We need to think through more clearly what the guidelines say on that point.
<P>
<H5>10.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On disruption to the life of the community, paragraph 3.1 of the guidelines states:
"The factors taken into account will include: duration of the procession; and the degree of the restriction of freedom of movement by local residents".<P>

<P>
It takes a procession from five minutes to a couple of hours to pass a particular point. Major parades, such as the biggest of them all on 12 August, take a couple of hours. Most of them, however, take much less than that. It would be a very big procession that takes more than half an hour to pass. They do not usually take that long.
<P>
The degree of restriction on the freedom of movement relates to local residents getting their cars in and out

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. I know that you are an attentive and tough Chairman, which is to the benefit of the Committee, but the hon. Gentleman is speaking to the guidelines that relate to clause 5. This is a stand part debate on clause 3; we do not come to the guidelines until later. May I have your guidance?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are dealing with the code of conduct, and I said that I was prepared to allow discussion on that. But the Minister is right; perhaps we are straying from discussion of the code of conduct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> The Minister has drawn my attention to the fact that I am again transgressing the rules of order. Am I able to consider the procedural rules in this debate, or must I wait until clause 4, even though amendments to clause 3 have touched upon them?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Debate on the procedural rules will be appropriate on clause 4.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> Thank you, Mr. Butterfill. I shall discuss the code of conduct now.
<P>
The code of conduct tells me that the commission's decision will be legally binding. I fervently hope that it will have to exercise that function on only a very few occasions. However, that might be a case of hope triumphing over experience. The IRA will ensure that it has as many confrontational episodes as it can create. The Minister well knows that. The parades commissioner will have to juice up his act a little if he is to get all square with the facts.
<P>
From my experience of parades, it seems to me that the code of conduct is a bit like teaching one's granny to such eggs. The plain truth is that the issue is a matter of common sense. However, some of the code is nonsense; it merely helps the folk who are out to cause trouble. The code states:
"While many of the routes may be traditional, in other words routes that have been followed by parades for many years, in finalising the route it will be necessary for organisers to gauge the following factors:
i) Does the route pass through a city, town or village centre location or any other location on a day of the week and at a time when there would normally be a high level of commercial activity?".
<P>
Very few parades take such routes at such times. For example, 12 July is a bank holiday, and 12 August is a major occasion. I should have thought that it brings so much trade to the centre of Londonderry in the normal day that the traders would be very happy to see it. Only pedestrians are about in that area anyway, and they are not greatly inconvenienced if they want to shop. There are so many shopping centres that most of them go elsewhere. In addition, Londonderry has not only a double deck bridge at Craigavon, but the bank bridge a mile or so downstream. There is therefore no problem getting backwards and forwards to the hospital. It might take a couple of minutes longer but the only inconvenience is suffered by people who have to get to hospital.
<P>
We are told that it would be prudent to give those who carry out business the maximum notice. Such notice is given. The code suggests distributing flysheets with details of the parade and that organisers should ask shopkeepers to post them prominently in their shop windows. If there is to be opposition, putting a notice in a shop window is not conducive to keeping the glass. That is about as daft an idea as ever I have read.
<P>
Another recommendation is to place a notice in the local newspaper. That is always done anyway for any major parade. It is then asked whether the parade passes churches or other places of worship. My hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone touched upon that earlier. Not many people will hold a wedding on 12 July in a town where they know the Twelfth is going to take place. That is known for at least a year in advance. Anyone in the town could tell them that.
<P>
There is also the possibility of a meeting taking place at the time of the parade. That happens occasionally but they are not large meetings; they are parish meetings with rarely more than a few people attending. It is possible to get in and out because most of the churches are in areas with more than one access point. There could be a service, but that service is just as likely to be associated with the procession as with anything else. If it is a Protestant procession and if it is the Ancient Order of Hibernians of course there will be a service. All the participants going to it. There is no great worry about that.
<P>
It is then suggested that a final check should be made 36 hours before the event for any emergency such as a funeral service. That is the only valid point. Someone may die. In Northern Ireland we do not have a week's delay between the death and the funeral; it is usually 36 hours and it would be possible for arrangements to be made. We all appreciate that these can be hurtful things, but in practically every town in Northern Ireland where it is known that there has been a death in a house the bands are always silent when passing. It would be very remiss of anyone to have the crude ill manners to play while passing a house where there had been a recent death. I have known bands to be silent whenever they were passing houses where the death had been within recent days.
<P>
We are asked, if the march passes through a residential area, to place notices in the local newspaper, distribute flysheets and so on. That is done as a matter of course. This is sheer nonsense. The code states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if the parade will pass through an area where people of another cultural identity live, it will again be necessary to serve early notice and include in that notice details of the person whom representatives of the local community might approach about aspects of the parade".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They usually know that. The real problem is that by giving all this extra notice one simply gives the ungodly the chance to organise and prepare for violence if that is their intent.
<P>
The code then talks about taking whatever steps are reasonable to meet the residents' concerns if any representations are made, and says that in many cases that is likely to amount to little more than the furling of banners and adjustment of the music to be played. It is suggested that organisers should also consider alternative routes if it is not possible to reach agreement.
<P>
What is the problem with banners? They are a large part of the procession? There is no mention of flags but they would no doubt be included as the real objection to the loyalist parades is the Union flag. This is nonsense pure and simple. The music played has not made a blind bit of difference, whether the band was playing "God Save the Queen" or "God Save the Prince of Wales", which differ in only one note, or a hymn tune such as "Abide with me". The truth is that these people are out to cause trouble, and trouble they will cause. This section is neither more nor less than nonsense.
<P>
On page 4 we discover:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Where communication is problematic, disputants should avail themselves of assistance from facilitators."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
But when communication is problematic, we are often up against confrontationists people who are intent on making trouble not disputants. That has been proved time and again: no matter what is done to please such people, they still turn up. When the Orangemen are only half way up the street in the village of Bellaghy, the mob is there screeching at them. Retreating and trying to avoid trouble with those folk is a waste of time. People with genuine concerns have always been dealt with properly. Local people may ring up the organisers and say, "This is Uncle Tom; Uncle Liam is dead", and arrangements will be made to deal with the situation.
<P>
The document also states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It will also be important to ensure that all participants, including bands, have clear information on arrangements to ensure rapid and peaceful dispersal."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Most people travel on buses: they pay their fare and are told that the bus will leave at such and such a time. But troublesome folk have other times to meet and there is a clear timescale at every point it is only common sense; they have got to get there.
<P>
Appendix A states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"No paramilitary-style clothing or regalia, including emblems or insignia of a paramilitary or proscribed organisation, is to be worn or displayed at any time during a parade."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should hope not in general, at least but one group is not caught by those criteria. The issue of insignia of paramilitary organisations is fine, but the Orange Order and some other loyalist organisations not least the[Mr. Ross]
Apprentice Boys have got into trouble over the years. They are slowly getting on top of the problem and believe that they will soon be on top of it. I shall explain further when we reach the appropriate amendments how the problem can be dealt with.
<P>
The problem relates to "paramilitary-style clothing or regalia". I am not too sure about "regalia". Some UVF bands have nothing to do with the terrorist organisation; they are a memorial to the progenitors of the 36th Ulster Division. The problem is that other bands much more recent creations have grabbed their name. I hope that the Minister will accept that some bands whose members dress in first world war uniforms are working in an honourable tradition. One such band is in Belfast and there are one or two others elsewhere in the same tradition. However, other bands bear no relationship whatever to that honourable tradition, and the Minister should recognise that problem.
<P>
The rest of the document is largely acceptable. A section on flags states that they should not depict
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any scene, or display any inscription which could reasonably be perceived as provocative, threatening, abusive or insulting. No flags relating to a paramilitary or proscribed organisation should be displayed during a parade."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, I should hope not. I make no bones about it: loyalist organisations have had problems with this in the past. They still exist to some extent but are being slowly but surely overcome. I cannot recall any loyalist elements carrying flags depicting insulting or abusive scenes.
<P>
I note, however, that the provision applies only to flags; it says nothing about banners. We have seen in the streets displays of banners of paramilitary organisations that might be considered insulting. That is difficult to deal with. If an organisation is coming down the street with such banners, it is looking for trouble. Members of that organisation will not care whether the police are there; they are there to throw petrol bombs and stones. When banners have been manufactured for the occasion for example, the one inscribed "SS RUC" that was hung in the Richmond centre in Londonderry in December it is clear that the folk who made them did not do so with peaceful intent. In practice, it is not until an organisation begins to move down the street, and sometimes long after that, that a banner will be displayed, and it is displayed as a declaration of war.
<P>
<H5>10.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is much more to be said on the matter and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone will return to it in greater detail and with greater insight than me. However, I hope that my remarks have given the Committee some idea about the minefield into which we are entering with the Bill and its associated codes of conduct.
<P>
The major organisations have their own codes, which they exercise as well as they can under difficult circumstances. However, those who are not prepared to keep to the codes of conduct and are out to create trouble will not give one damn about what is written on a piece of paper. They will throw petrol bombs, stones and iron bars; they will use catapults, ball-bearings and so on. We know that well.
<P>
As I have said frequently, there is a group of people that is intent on trouble as part of a war against the constitutional position of Northern Ireland. I have described one tactic in a battle in that general war. Until that is recognised, we cannot reach a sensible solution to the general problems that I raised earlier.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I shall be brief. After listening to the hon. Member for East Londonderry and to the Minister, I want to make one point. I do not expect the Minister to reply to it tonight, but hope that he will consider it. My point is that there might be a missing dimension in the guidelines and thus in the code that will be produced. I am worried that the guidelines are superficial, in that in military jargon they are tactical rather than strategic. They deal with the immediate situation and their general tenor is that full account must be taken of all surrounding circumstances when a decision is made.
<P>
I want to draw the Committee's attention to the testimony of Mr. Sean O'Callaghan, who in the 1980s was officer commanding, Provisional IRA southern command. He said that, in the aftermath of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Provisionals realised that a wedge could be driven between Unionists and the British state and that the parades could be a way of doing that. They embarked on a strategic rather han a tactical approach, which went back much further than the two years that Mr. Adams acknowledged publicly.
<P>
I am worried about the extent to which the commission's code of conduct could take into account strategic objectives planned long before the events immediately surrounding a given parade. It is alleged that the Republicans deliberately selected some parades, and that ensured that the residents' committees included Republicans with a track record, or with a prison sentence behind them, to make dialogue with Loyalists or Unionists impossible. How far can the code of conduct take account of strategic planning that long precedes the events immediately surrounding a given march?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I should like to remind members of the Committee that under clause 3 a code of conduct will be issued to provide guidance to those who are organising a parade and to regulate the conduct of those organising, or taking part in, a parade. At present, there is a draft code, drawn up by the commission. I was surprised, at our earlier sittings, to find that hon. Members were not aware of the three codes that were available particularly the code of guidance as they had been in the public domain for two and a half months. However, it is only now that hon. Members are raising the issues covered by the codes as matters of grave concern. Having said that, I regret giving the hon. Member for East Londonderry the code before tonight's sitting. Perhaps if I had held off for a day or two, we would not be having this debate.
<P>
The hon. Members for East Londonderry and for Basingstoke have made some serious points. I am sure that the Parades Commission will read the Committee's proceedings and will carefully analyse those aspects of our deliberations that are of immediate concern. If that should not be the case, I assure hon. Members that their comments will be passed to the commission, which will take them into account in any judgments it makes about amendments to the codes and other documents. Initially that will be a matter for the commission, but the House of Commons will then deal with the final version of the documents through statutory instruments, which will be subject to a two-and-a-half hour debate.
<P>
I suggest, Mr. Butterfill, that you might want to avoid chairing the statutory instrument committee that discusses those matters. You have been through them once and might not want to repeat the experience. Unfortunately, some of us will have to go through them again. However, the issues that we have discussed are important and must be addressed seriously. The Government have taken on board the points made by hon. Members in Committee and they will be passed on to the Parades Commission, if the commission has not already read them in Hansard.
<P>
As I have said, the proper procedures of the House will be followed before the final version of the documents is produced, and there will be many opportunities for hon. Members to continue debating the points that they have raised during our sittings. We have had a helpful clause stand part debate.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 4 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Procedural rules </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 29, in page 2, line 23, leave out "or bodies".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 32, in page 2, line 32, leave out "or bodies".
<P>
No. 144, in clause 7, page 4, line 36, leave out "or body".
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> The amendments follow the same general lines as the amendments that we discussed earlier. The two amendments to clause 4, on page 2, line 23 and line 32, are exactly the same. The clause refers to "bodies". Can the Minister tell me who the bodies or persons are? Are they bodies such as the Loyalist Institution, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, and organisations such as the boy scouts and the Boys' Brigade. Is that what the Bill means? I want to know, because it is relevant to the amendments whether the "bodies" referred to in the clause mean those which run processions or others.
<P>
Individuals and organisations will have to meet the commission's timetable. In such circumstances, does the Minister not agree that it would be wiser if the clause specified the person who actually carried out the procedures, rather than the bodies as a whole? It would be very difficult to hold the body responsible if one of its members had been delegated to carry out procedures to a timetable. That person may forget that there was a time limit and be a day or two late in doing what was required. The entire organisation should not be clobbered because someone made a simple mistake.
<P>
Amendment No. 144 is interesting. It would amend clause 7(3)(b), which states that conditions imposed under subsection (1) may be incorporated or framed by reference to the code of conduct or to
"any other document ... prepared by the person or body organising the procession in question".<P>

<P>
Does that mean that in certain circumnstances, when an organisation has its own set of rules for the conduct of its members on processions, it does not have to abide by what is in the commission's code of conduct? Some organisations have rules at least as strict as that set out in the codes before us. I would like the Minister to answer these valid questions.
<P>
A problem that some people might see in the Bill is that the "bodies" referred to might be, for example, political parties in Northern Ireland, rather than organisations running a procession. If that is so, may we be told?
<P>
I have tabled these probing amendments to discover what the Minister has to say on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Further to the hon. Gentleman's point, clause 4(1)(b) states that the commission shall issue a set of rules for the purpose of regulating and prescribing the practice and procedure to be followed
"by other persons or bodies".<P>

<P>
Surely the process of democratic accountability demands that the identity of those bodies is made public so that the process can win the confidence of those who watch the commission's activities. However, earlier in our proceedings the Government were most reluctant for the identity and the allegiance of bodies to be revealed. I do not say that there is a contradiction, but at first sight there seems to be a tension between clause 4(1)(b), which demands the public revelation and identity of bodies, and the Government's reply in a previous debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I am delighted to be able to give the answers sought by the hon. Member for East Londonderry. I hope that I can help the hon. Member for Basingstoke too.
<P>
If the words "or bodies" were removed from clause 4 as amendments Nos. 29 and 31 suggest, the measure would exempt all bodies that organise parades from having to follow the procedural rules set down by the Parades Commission. Recommendation 24 of the North report states explicitly, as the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge, that the Parades Commission should prepare public guidance on the procedures that it will follow and that are to be followed by the police and the organisers of processions.
<P>
It was clearly the review body's intention that parade organisers would have to follow the procedural rules. I see no value in exempting the organisers of processions by parading bodies from following those rules. Indeed, it would be nonsense to apply entirely different arrangements to individuals organising parades than would be applied to bodies. The rules play an important and useful role and I urge the Committee to reject amendments Nos. 29 and 32.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Although amendment No. 144 would also remove the word "bodies" from the Bill, it would have a slightly different effect. It would mean that the conditions imposed by the commission could not be framed with[Mr. Worthington]
reference to any document prepared by a body organising a parade. For example, it would mean that the Parades Commission could not approve the Orange order's own code of conduct. Obviously, it is to be welcomed when organisations have a strict code of conduct in which they take great pride. The amendment would not benefit parading organisations; I see no value in it and I urge the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I am grateful for what the Minister said, but if the proposal will not have any effect, what is the point of clause 7(3)(b)(i), to which amendment No. 144 refers? If there is a good reason for that paragraph being in the Bill, may we be told what it is? The body organising a procession will apply its own rules regardless of whether there is a document or code of conduct framed by the commission. As that is the only legal requirement placed upon it, what is the point of any other document prepared by the person or body organising the procession and approved by the commission? Why is that needed if conditions are to be framed by reference to the code of conduct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> It is obviously to be welcomed when organisations have a strict code of conduct, which will be applied in their own circumstances; each organisation may need a code of conduct to be applied in its particular circumstances. There will be an overlap between that code of conduct and the code of conduct that the Parades Commission will seek to establish. However, as the North committee recognised, it is an important part of the Bill that everyone plays to the same rules; that is transparent and fair. Dr. North was clear that the codes of conduct to be laid down should apply to all organisations. That does not stop any organisation having additional rules, or aspects of its rules, which apply to its own organisation in its own circumstances.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ross:</B> With great respect, the Minister has convinced me more than ever that the three or four lines in the clause are not needed. The only legal requirement that should be placed on a processing organisation is that which is in the Bill. But it appears that what is being said is that if an organisation has stricter rules of its own, they too become a legal requirement. That is not reasonable because it actively removes the common treatment that the Minister lauded a few moments ago. The Minister should reconsider the matter, because the Orange order, the Apprentice Boys, the Royal Black institution, the Boys' Brigade and so on will apply their own rules regardless of the code. Their rules are an extra; they do not minimise the proposed code but go far beyond it. If they decided to change their rules would they have to approach the commission and demand its approval? The code could be a stick with which to beat the processing organisations.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman intend to press amendment No. 29?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I hoped that the Minister would reply to my points. Sadly, he has not done so. I hope that he will consider them carefully and that we can return to the matter on Report. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I discussed the implications of clause 4 when we considered an earlier amendment, which was tabled by the hon. Member for East Londonderry, and referred to clause 2(2)(b). The amendment would have extended the paragraph by adding the phrase,
"and publish the evidence that led to its conclusion"<P>
.
<P>
The Minister did not clarify clause 4(2)(c) and the meaning of "those functions". I assumed that the functions were the same as those that are set out in clause 2(2), and that they were included in the procedural rules. We discussed them in detail in the context of publishing the commission's decisions and the form of publication. I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm that my interpretation of clause 4(2)(c) was accurate.
<P>
On reflection, if the Minister is prepared to consider the substance of the amendments that I tabled to clause 1, especially those that dealt with protests or counter-demonstrations as outlined in the North report, consequential amendments to clause 4 should be tabled. It is an oversight not to have spotted that. Doubtless the Minister and his advisers are already deep in negotiations on that point.
<P>
If the Minister accepts the parts of the North report that deal with codes of conduct for protest groups, procedural rules should be attached to such codes. Those rules should state the method by which the groups submit both their codes of conduct and applications to instigate a counter-demonstration.
<P>
I have made two points. First, the Minister has not clarified his earlier remarks. Secondly, precedural rules as well as a code of conduct should be extended to protesters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire has achieved an awe-inspiring degree of opacity. My hon. Friend the Minister of State and I look at each other during the hon. Gentleman's contribution and asked, "Do we know what he is talking about?". The answer was no. That is not an insult; we may be in the presence of a superior being.
<P>
Consequential amendments may be necessary because of earlier changes to the Bill. We shall consider them. On clause 4(2)(b) and clause 4(2)(c) 
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I did not mention paragraph (b).
<P>
<B>Mr.Worthington:</B> The hon. Gentleman confirms his opacity and that is meant as a compliment. I shall consider the point that the hon. Gentleman thinks he has just made, and come back to it later. I promise that I shall do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That was a sensible point, Mr. Butterfill. Did you understand it?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I tried.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That is extremely helpful, Mr. Butterfill. It is late at night, and I shall not labour the point. I shall read Hansard to see whether I was given a back-handed compliment. I may write to the Minister.
<P>
There will be implications if the code of conduct is accepted for protest groups, because procedural rules on how they should comply with the code of conduct and the rules of engagement will necessarily follow. If the Minister goes further and picks up my new clauses, there will implications and possible consequential amendments to clause 4.
<P>
I am trying to help the Minister. While he is in discussion with officials, he may, without knocking me, convey to them that he understands the point. Progress will be made much more quickly as a result.
<P>
Question put and agree to.

Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 123, in schedule 2, page 14, leave out line 36.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> This is more of a clause stand part debate. By leaving out line 36, I would be leaving out the guidelines, and you told me, Mr. Butterfill, that it would be possible to debate them at this point.
<P>
I shall speak to the amendment, although amendment No. 50, which is also in my name, is consequential on another. The amendment deals with the guidelines, the code of conduct and the rest of it. I have been through most of these issues already, but the code of conduct 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not clear what the hon. Gentleman is seeking to do. We are debating clause 5 stand part, with which we are taking amendment No. 123. Is the hon. Gentleman referring to amendment 123?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> Amendment No. 123 would simply leave out reference to the guidelines, and it was tabled as a means of initiating a debate on them. I shall speak to amendment No. 123, but at what point will we move on to the clause stand part debate?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are taking the two debates together.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I was hoping that would happen.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sorry if I was not clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> You, Mr. Butterfill, are never wrong; the Chairman can never be wrong. We are indebted to the guidance that we receive from you, and, no doubt, you are indebted to the guidance that you receive from those around you. They never get it wrong. [Interruption.] I am just being nice; it always pays to be nice to the Chairman.
<P>
We have to consider the code of conduct and the guidelines, which are pretty much the same. A slight difference, perhaps, is that the code includes a statement about inscriptions that could be perceived as provocative, threatening, abusing or insulting. Those words were used in the old booklet so I shall not dwell further on them, other than to say that all of them apply to the code of conduct.
<P>
<H5>11.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I had reached page 4 of the general guidelines which, until guided by you, Mr. Butterfill, I inadvertently proceeded to discuss out of order. As post-Jopling standards apply late at night, I shall begin where I left off. I was speaking about the duration of processions and the speed of movement by local residents. I dealt with restriction of access to shops and other businesses which are usually delighted to see a large procession in town. On the restriction of access to public amenities such as hospitals, I remarked that Londonderry has a huge procession: the town has three different routes, only one of which is ever blocked, so the problem does not arise there.
<P>
The reference to restriction of access to places of worship as a factor is rubbish. I recall the nonsense that arose over Drumcree and the holding of a service in the open air. There is nothing to stop people going into their church, which is on the main road off the roundabout, a mile or so from where the confrontation took place. The people wanting to go to that Catholic church did not live near Drumcree church; they all lived on the other side of the confrontation, and it was quite possible for them to walk up to the church that day as they would on any other. The behaviour of the clerics on that occasion was pretty remiss because it suggested a problem that did not exist. To my knowledge, there has never been restriction of access to places of worship.
<P>
The other issue of possible contention is the reports of what happened at Harryville. I doubt whether anyone other than those who took part would approve of it; practically everyone in Northern Ireland opposes it. I mention in passing that the individuals involved are clear about what happened there; we know that there was and thuggery. By and large, people have taken good legal advice about exactly what they can get away with and have stayed carefully within the limits of the law, while exercising the right to free assembly. But the fact that advice is legal does not mean that it is wise, or acceptable, and the incident certainly falls into that category. That said, I know of no other places where there has been restriction of access to places of worship unless a chip van got in the way somewhere, and that should be moved on anyway.
<P>
Page 5 mentions the impact of processions on community relationships. We are told that the past has revealed
"a huge potential for unresolved disputes over processions to create major and lasting rifts in relationships between communities in Northern Ireland."<P>

<P>
I do not agree. The only people who have major and lasting rifts are the members of the IRA, and they are not created by processions, although they are to some extent intensified by them. Whenever people are identified as having participated, the rift between that group and the processors may deepen, but it will not have been created because it is already there.
[Mr. Ross]
<P>
The next statement is correct, in that
"these disputes are often symptoms of more deeply rooted conflict but they can provoke a violent response which only serves to tear communities further apart."<P>

<P>
That is why IRA members are on the streets, and the reason that they, rather than any other group involved, should be dealt with. The guidelines state on page 5:
"In attempting to gauge impact, the Commission will refer to a number of factors",
<P>
which include the location and route.
<P>
There is some sensible stuff here. The guidelines state that
"the Commission will regard the commercial centres of towns and cities as neutral zones and will be inclined to support the case for processions, or those parts of processions that are held in such areas."<P>

<P>
Many of the major processions go through the commercial parts of towns. Often they form up in the housing estates round them. I have never known people to complain much about that other than when they have had to sit around a little. In such instances the processors were complaining because someone else was late. No one would really have a problem with what I have just quoted.
<P>
But the IRA had a problem with it in Londonderry. As I have suggested, no one with an honest concern would be opposed. But the IRA was, and that is why we had the trouble in Londonderry. According to the guidelines
"the Commission will take into account ... the extend to which contested parts of the route comprise mainly residential or commercial property."<P>

<P>
That seems to cut across what is said in the introduction to section 4.2, where the commercial centres of towns are to be considered as neutral zones. Does the reference to "mainly residential or commercial" mean that residential areas will be considered in an entirely different way?
<P>
If the Twelfth parades or the Black Saturday want to go to the field, there are very few fields in the centre of towns. They must go to the outskirts. That will inevitably mean that they will pass through residential areas. Some of the Orange districts own their own fields, and land has acquired a remarkable value in some areas over the years. They do not want to see it built on. They could sell it for a considerable sum but they want to hold on to it because it is their own open space that they can use for their demonstrations. It is good that they have it. I hope that the Minister understands that. If people have property, they surely should have the right to get to it. I do not see a real problem there.
<P>
The guidelines then refer to
"the demographic balance among the residents in the immediate area surrounding any contested parts of the route."<P>

<P>
That changes things. Given the way that the Housing Executive points system works, it often changes in favour of those with larger families in other words, the Roman Catholic population. There is another element here. There is general upward mobility in our society. Many tradesmen and so forth who formerly lived in public housing have now moved out and sadly many of the houses are now occupied by single mothers and drop-outs of one sort or another. That is a social problem which does not impinge too much in this instance. By and large, the folk in those dwellings do not really worry.
<P>
The next item is
"the presence of sites such as monuments or churches of other traditions".<P>

<P>
If there was bad behaviour in a church of one's own tradition one would be just as offended. I do not see why it should be "other traditions". It is a common concern. By and large, people behave properly when passing churches. There is the occasional problem but they are relatively small in scale and containable.
<P>
The guidelines then refer to
"other sites associated with past events which give rise to sensitivity within the community".<P>

<P>
War memorials are certainly such sites. There are also problems at places where atrocious murders have been committed. At Enniskillen not only is there the war memorial, there is the tragedy that took place there which makes it a site of particular sensitivity. The Committee will have heard my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone point out that by and large soldiers would not be concerned about a march tune going past. He and I would take a different view to some, a more Calvinistic view and one that is widely shared among the population of Northern Ireland.
<P>
The guidelines then refer to
"the purpose of the parade and whether the route is necessary or proportional to that".<P>

<P>
Here we come to the point that I made earlier about the coat-trailing exercise; the new parades issue, which the Government refuse to accept here it is. What it means in the long run is the new provocative procession, the deliberate effort to cause problems. As the Minister has already acknowledged, what applies to a procession will apply also to a counter-demonstration. That is the problem, and the question is how it will be dealt with. It amounts to a huge can of worms which, if I had more time, I should like to explore further.
<P>
The guidelines refer to
"the availability of alternative routes which are non-controversial".<P>

<P>
but, at the end of the day, there not many alternative routes. For example, I know of changes made to a route down Garvaghy road which turned out in the end to be even more controversial than the original. Let us not get carried away and pretend that we can adopt the technique of directing the Orangemen away from Garvaghy road. Far too many people already believe that it is an anti-Garvaghy road procession. We need to consider the issue very carefully.
<P>
Another section states:
"The Commission recognises as a general principle that residents along the route of a parade have the reasonable expectation not to feel fear or a sense of intimidation because a parade is planned".<P>

<P>
I wonder what people actually do. I do not believe that the average individual in Northern Ireland feels any sense of intimidation because a parade is planned. Some people say that they do, which is a very different kettle of fish. How often in the past 30 years have members of a parade broken away and attacked a house because a Roman Catholic or Protestant lived in it? How often have they broken away and attacked a church building or indeed any other building? There may have been a few occasions but only when the element of provocation beforehand was considerable.
<P>
I recall the procession down Ormeau road after the horrendous murders in the betting shop there. The republican element was up on the roof, waving the tricolours and shouting insults at the Orangemen passing down the road. That was shown just once on television. It never appeared again: all we ever saw was the crowd's reaction a foolish reaction as it happened to the provocation. Many of the problems subsequently encountered on the Ormeau road rolled on from that particular incident. We need to keep that context well in mind.
<P>
We shall deal with the purpose of the parade and the numbers taking part in it when we debate other amendments. The purpose of the parade is well known and there is no problem identifying it. There is a problem only when one of the purposes is to cause trouble; and when identified it can be dealt with.
<P>
It is more difficult than many people think to judge the numbers taking part. One never really knows how many will turn up. It depends on the weather. It depends on what other processions are taking place that evening or what other activities are available. The order of magnitude is almost impossible to determine beforehand.
<P>
The guidelines refer to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the past experience of the manner in which the parade has been conducted."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome that because it refers to how the parade is conducted, but reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the regalia associated with the parade".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
returns us to the element of paramilitary organisations which may try to take part. If so, well and good. It will not worry the law-abiding citizen, loyalist institutions, the Ancient Order of Hibernians or other uniformed youth organisations.
<P>
As to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the nature and number of bands that will participate and the type of music they will play",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
we can deal with the issue more fully when we debate later amendments. In the end, all an organiser can do is provide the number of people in the bands invited. Bands usually have to notify the local police station because they leave one area and enter another; they assemble and then travel. I should like to discuss the problem with the Minister and with the police. I hope that I shall have the opportunity to do that before we consider the matter again.
<P>
<H5>11.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The document mentions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the frequency of such parades along the route."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Frequency is not especially relevant. An endless variety of loyalist band parades takes place in Limavady and Coleraine during the summer. Some people may be annoyed by that. I rarely participate in such parades, but I have seen them. They usually occur in the evening when there is not much traffic, for which there are alternative routes, or people, except those who are actively interested in the parade. They could number many thousands.
<P>
Under the heading, "The Broader Context", the guidelines state:
"In some areas there has been a long history of intercommunity strife, much of which precedes any contention about parades and has its roots in facets of the longer term conflict that has taken place across Northern Ireland."
<P>
We all accept that that is coded language for the IRA assault on Northern Ireland. The document continues:
"Where there has been a year on year history of conflict surrounding the parade, the Commission will take into account the demonstrable impact of dicisions taken regarding that parade in previous years not only on the immediate community but on the wider Northern Ireland community."<P>

<P>
Does that mean that the commission would ban, for example, the Drumcree parade because of the IRA's success in causing trouble? If so, may God help us all. It would be a recipe for disaster.
<P>
Under "Compliance with the Code of Conduct", the guidelines state that the Parades Commission would expect those who were involved to
"comply with the Code of Conduct or any other document prepared by the organiser and approved by the Commission."<P>

<P>
The previous set of amendments dealt with that point. I did not receive a satisfactory answer from the Minister.
<P>
The document mentions the importance that
"the Commission attaches to the need for organisers to take steps to address the concerns which residents may have".<P>

<P>
Real concerns can be tackled easily. I do not believe that many real concerns force people on to the streets to throw stones at their neighbours. The guidelines also mention "conflicts over parades" being
"resolved through communication between those in dispute."<P>

<P>
As I have said time and again, that is nonsense in the context of Northern Ireland. The loyalist institutions will not enter into discussions with the IRA. The British Legion should not be asked to do that because its members fought to defeat such terror in the second world war, in Korea and other places. Surely there is enough maturity, even among the wildest elements in Northern Ireland although we cannot be sure after the Enniskillen atrocity to leave youth organisations, such as the Boys' Brigade, alone.
<P>
The guidelines state that
"the Commission will expect to see evidence from organisers of the steps they have taken to meet its requirements, as well as evidence from residents and others to support any allegation of infringement."<P>

<P>
The organisers will take the usual steps, which are normally sufficient. However, the battery of grievances that the Bill creates will produce allegations from residentswho are out to cause trouble and from the IRA, which may direct them.
<P>
The final heading is,
"The Desirability of allowing a Parade which has been customarily held on that Route to continue to be allowed to do so".<P>

<P>
The paragraph constitutes the one hope that reason will prevail. The paragraph begins:
"The Commission recognises the premium attached by many" <P>

<P>
though not by the commission 
"to the concept of tradition in relation to parades. In considering other aspects of parades the Commission will in particular take into account the extent to which the proposed route is long-standing and weigh this important factor along with the others in reaching conclusions."<P>

<P>
What is meant by "longstanding"?
<P>
I am sure that we shall discuss the whole issue again. It has not been properly dealt with. I hope that the Government will consider my remarks and take or[Mr. Ross]
ensure that the Commission takes sensible decisions in that regard.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It seems that we are dealing with two issues. One relates to the details of the guidelines and the other concerns amendment No. 123, which would remove their statutory status.
<P>
Perhaps it is worth repeating my remarks in the stand part debate on clause 4. The remarks of the hon. Member for East Londonderry will be considered by the Parades Commission and I will ensure that relevant details will be communicated to him. The procedure relating to the guidelines will be the same as that for the code of conduct and the procedural rules. The present consultative version will be replaced by a draft that will be considered by the Secretary of State and presented, via a statutory instrument, to the House of Commons. We will then be able to debate the final decision in detail, in the light of the input by all those bodies and individuals who will have made their views known.
<P>
As for amendment No. 123, recommendation 23 in the North report was that
"guidelines should be prepared setting out the factors which the Parades Commission will take into account in determining whether a parade be made subject to conditions".<P>

<P>
That approach appears right to me, and the Government have adopted it.
<P>
The guidelines will make the basis of the Commission's decision making clear and transparent. There may be differences about the content, but none the less a clear statement of intent for the purposes of the Commission will, subject to the decision of the House, be available. The guidelines are of key importance to an understanding of how the Bill will work. The Commission will take into account the various factors set out in clause 7. Removal of the statutory basis for the guidelines in their essential role in interpreting the legislation would be a removal of parliamentary scrutiny. That would be undesirable and I urge the Comittee to reject the amendment if the hon. Member for East Londonderry is not minded to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> Did I understand the Minister to say, a few moments ago, that the instrument that would bring the guidelines into force would be subject to detailed debate in the House? If so, would it be subject to amendment there?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The statutory instrument process has been laid down; it is subject to affirmative resolution of the House and to debate under the statutory instruments Committee procedure. As the hon. Gentleman knows,that means that it is not subject to amendment. That is the reason for the advance consultative process, and for that reason also the Parades Commission and the Government will carefully consider all the representations and strive for a view balancing the commission's initial opinions with the responses to the consultative document. The resulting document will be presented for the consideration of the House through the statutory instruments procedure. Arguments that carry weight will be given due consideration and amendment will be made to the guidelines, code of conduct and procedural rules.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Motivated by an overwhelming desire to circumvent any situation in which I could be accused of being opaque, I address my remarks to you, Mr. Butterfill, on a point of clarification. I tabled amendment No. 84, which relates to clause 5, and it was taken in the group on clause 1. Should it have been taken on this clause rather than earlier?
<P>
The amendment also relates to new clause 2, which is entitled "The Commission's powers to impose conditions on counter demonstrations". [Interruption.] Am I being opaque again?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Not at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I seek clarification not from Ministers, but from the Chair.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Amendment No. 84 has already been discussed, and the general points on counter-demonstrations were amply aired in earlier debates. It cannot be discussed in relation to clause 5, even though it was designed to amend it. The hon. Gentleman may have the opportunity to raise this issue when we debate new clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Butterfill, for your guidance on the guidelines.
<P>
The Minister and his officials should consider the new clauses. It is important that the guidelines and code of conduct also apply to those mounting counter-demonstrations or protests. If the Minister were to accept that, he would have to add the provisions in new clause 2 it might form a new section 8 to what will become section 7. That would have to be done at a later date.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned. [Mr. Dowd.]
<P>
